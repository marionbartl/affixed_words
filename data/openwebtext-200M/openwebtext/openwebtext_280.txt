Rollback the Lead - Free Initiative
If it has been awhile since my last correspondence , my only excuse is that I 've been busy working on a new course , titled : " High - Speed Noise and Grounding " .
At this point the marketing gurus here are not sure whether the course will be released in book format or DVD format , but whatever happens we will announce it through this newsletter when available .
Today 's letter has to do with one of the important system reliability topics I include in that course .
Rollback the Lead - Free Initiative
I 'm no expert in manufacturing technology , but I can smell trouble coming a mile away .
I believe that our industry , having jumped onto the lead - free bandwagon , is headed towards a train wreck of immense proportions .
Please tell your management .
I 'm sure you 've all heard about the recent EU legislation called RoHS ( Restriction of Hazardous Substances ) .
As of July of 2006 , RoHS legislation precludes the use of lead in electronic products destined for sale in Europe with few exceptions .
The primary motivations for this legislation were environmental concerns .
The RoHS legislation affects component lead plating as well as solder and solder paste .
The legislation was developed , I believe , under the misconception that the switch from a tin - lead solder chemistry to pure tin would be painful , but technologically possible .
The legislators incorrectly assumed that the only difference between tin- lead solder and pure tin solder was the melting point .
Prior to 2006 , most electronic components were coated with lead - based solder , 63 % Sn , 37 % Pb , popularly called 63/37 solder .
Manufacturers use that particular proportion because it has the lowest melting temperature of any Sn - Pb mixture ( i.e. , it is the Eutectic mixture ) .
It makes a good , strong solder joint .
As a result of RoHS legislation , many component manufacturers have begun supplying parts with a lead - free plating made from ordinary tin .
In many cases the old 63/37 solder coated products may no longer be available .
Replacing tin-lead with pure tin is turning out to have been a huge mistake .
There are two significant differences between lead - free assembly and lead - based assembly .
Lead - free assembly is not better for the environment , it is worse .
The additional tin mining required to produce high - purity tin alloys , plus the mining of other precious metals required to alloy with tin in substitution for lead is a poor trade for the use of existing lead , much of which comes from recycled products .
This information comes from a study conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
The study undercuts the primary basis for RoHS .
Lead - free assembly is less reliable than lead - based assembly .
The E.U. environmental commission admits this point .
That 's why they grant exceptions for military and high - reliability applications that still use SnPb solder .
I 'm all for environmental legislation when it actually helps .
When it does n't help , and it harms something else , I question the result .
What harm is being done ?
Let 's start with tin whiskers .
The electronics industry has discovered ( re - discovered , actually , as this knowledge is quite old ) that typical " bright " tin plating grows prodigious numbers of tin whiskers in a short amount of time .
A tin-lead Eutectic mixture does not grow whiskers .
Something about the lead prevents their formation .
Tin whiskers are small , unbelievably thin metallic hair - like growths that naturally emerge from the surface of solid tin ( Sn ) .
On lead - free tin surfaces , tin whiskers may grow to a length sufficient to short one electronic circuit to another , creating product failure .
Material scientists attribute whisker growth in ordinary bright tin to various impurities within the tin .
Purifying the tin-plating solution changes the character of the finished item .
Instead of a bright tin finish you get a " matte " finish .
This step helps reduce but does not eliminate the number of whiskers .
Some people believe that matte plating fixes the problem .
I do n't think so .
Figure 1 shows a young tin whisker growing straight out of a matte tin finish .
This picture comes from Wan Zhangz and Felix Schwager , " Effects of Lead on Tin Whisker Elimination " , J. Electrochem .
Soc. , 153 ( 5 ) C337 - C343 ( 2006 ) .
This particular whisker was grown at ambient temperature under normal storage conditions .
No electric currents are required to form whiskers .
The growth is spontaneous .
A matte tin finish certainly works better than a bright tin finish , but does not , in my opinion , fix the problem .
Lead does .
Fig 1 — Tin whiskers growing on electrodeposited matte tin at ambient temperature [ Zhangz and Schwager ] .
You may be looking at Figure 1 thinking , " Hey , that whisker is only about 16 microns long ( less than one thousandth of an inch ) , not long enough to do any damage . "
If whiskers grew no longer than one thousandth , I would agree .
Unfortunately , they get longer .
Figure 2 shows the dramatic growth that can happen under some circumstances .
This picture is not for the faint of heart .
Whiskers can easily exceed 1 mm -- yes , that 's 1,000 microns , and in some cases even as much as 10 mm .
Fig 2 — You do n't just get one tin whisker , but a whole forest of tin whiskers .
I bring all this up because I recently toured a number of military electronics facilities .
In discussions with engineers at those locations they all agreed that a matte tin finish is not sufficient to render their products suitably reliable .
They have uniformly shunned the use of tin-plated hardware of any kind .
Fortunately , military products get a special exemption from RoHS .
They can use as much lead as they want .
The exemption was granted on the basis that the E.U. commission understands quite clearly that no suitably reliable substitute for lead - based solders has yet been found .
Great , so the E.U. admits there is no reliable substitute .
Yet , they require use of a substitute .
Is this some kind of plan to increase sales of electronic gadgets ?
Is this a way to make sure that products fail quickly , so consumers have to buy more ?
We wo n't know for several years how severe the problem will ultimately become , but what we do know is that many tin- whisker failures have already happened , and more will happen in the future .
Already happened ?
Yes .
17 April , 2005 — Millstone Nuclear Generating Station —
A single tin whisker created a bridge ( short circuit ) between a diode and the output trace on a circuit card , causing a partial reactor shutdown .
P. Daddona , " Reactor Shutdown : Dominion Learns Big Lesson from a Tiny Tin Whisker " , The Day ( New London , CT ) , July 4 , 2005 .
Environmentalists who favor restriction of lead in electronic circuits point out that the reactor did n't actually explode , and that we should n't have nuclear reactors , anyway .
I do n't find that response very satisfying .
Just in case you get into a debate about lead - free solder , here are some myths I 've encountered during my research .
Myth # 1 . Tin Whiskers only grow in space .
Not true .
A lot of research in the period 2002 - 2006 was conducted by aerospace companies using a vacuum environment for their experiments .
This created a perception that it is only a " space " problem .
Actually , whiskers can and do happen everywhere .
The whiskers in Figure 1 grew at ambient temperature and humidity .
Myth # 2 . Tin Whiskers only grow in temperature - cycling environments .
Not true .
They grow under ambient conditions .
Accelerated life - cycle testing is carried out per JESD201 using temperature cycling , as that seems to exacerbate the growth , but at the time JESD201 was written no one knows the correlation between the accelerated tests and what will really happen over time .
Myth # 3 .
Conformal coating stops whisker growth .
Good idea , but it does n't work .
The tip of a whisker is sharp down to atomic dimensions .
It pokes right through a conformal coating .
No coating has yet been found that is immune , although there is some recent hope for a new low - modulus polyurethane material .
Evaluation of Conformal Coatings as a Tin Whisker Mitigation Strategy , Part 2 , T. Woodrow , SMTAI , Sept. 2006 .
Myth # 4 .
Whiskers do n't happen very often .
Check out this list of hair - raising examples of tin- whisker failure in satellites , airplanes , medical , industrial and computer equipment .
Engineers are now just beginning to recognize a lot of past failures as having been caused by tin whiskers .
Myth # 5 .
A whisker is too small to short out anything important .
That is true for some classes of high - voltage , high - power equipment .
An individual whisker conveys only about 30 mA .
In an AC power environment , the whisker would quickly burn out .
In digital electronics , however , 30 mA is more than enough to cause serious havoc .
Myth # 6 .
A better solder is just around the corner .
I do n't believe it .
The industry has tried all sorts of additives from Antimony to Zinc and nothing works like Lead .
The 63/37 mixture is very soft — that seems to be part of the magic .
It does n't accumulate stress , it merely deforms .
Even if we had a better solder , unless it completely coats all exposed portions of every component lead , any exposed tin-plated leads remain subject to whiskering .
Myth # 7 .
The solution is SAC solder .
The " SAC " solder mixture is made from Tin , Silver , and Copper .
The silver and copper additives suppress tin whisker growth , but it remains unclear whether they completely inhibit whisker growth over a long period of time .
Military and other high - reliability products do n't use SAC .
They use only SnPb .
In addition , SAC solder creates other problems .
For example , SAC solder requires a different soldering temperature profile than that used for Tin - Lead solder .
If you mix SAC - based solder with non SAC - based coatings , the results can be very poor , so you must ensure that all your components use the SAC mixture .
Yet , looking at two parts only a metallurgist can tell the difference between a lead - based lead coating and a SAC - based lead - free coating .
Substantial possibility of error exists .
http://thor.inemi.org/webdownload/projects/ese/High-Reliability_RoHS/High_Rel_position_061206.pdf
Harvey Miller at FabFileOnline has this to say about the use of SAC - based solder : " Without the softening effect of lead , the SAC alloys are more brittle and more likely to crack under pressure .
They do n't wet well , requiring more active fluxes .
They do n't have a sharp eutectic , staying plastic over a larger range , allowing intermetallics to form and leading to voids .
Their higher melting temperatures stress laminates and components , limiting choices and narrowing process windows .
There are unpredictable long - term degradation mechanisms such as : 1 ) the Kirkendall Effect , in which copper migrates into tin , leaving voids , 2 ) tin whisker formation , and 3 ) tin pest , in which the tin turns into powder . "
Finally , regarding SAC , here 's a testimonial letter submitted by John Anderson to the Ron Lasky forum : " I have to repair industrial control equipment , and so far there has been a really poor track record with lead - free solder .
Mind you , the products I repair and design are almost always wet , cold , hot and vibrating and tin - lead solder is far superior to the lead - free assembly processes in every respect for extreme applications .
Not only are tin whiskers a headache , but embrittlement problems cause thousands of hours of troubleshooting time searching for intermittent , hairline - cracked joints that we just do n't see , or very rarely see with tin - lead solder .
At this point , several industrial clients of mine are insisting on non-RoHS assembly ( RoHS parts are OK , just not the assembly process ) of all components used on assembly equipment and control systems … "
Myth # 8 .
Eliminating lead from solder saves the environment .
According to John Burke at the UCSC Extension in Silicon Valley ( see Managing Environmental Change in Electronics ) the US Environmental protection agency " Report on Solders in Electronics : A Life - Cycle Assessment " ( 472 pages ) published August 2005 shows that the replacement for “ leaded ” solder generally referred to as “ SAC alloy ” has a greater impact on the environment than tin lead solder in a number of areas such as non-renewable resource use , energy use , global warming , ozone depletion , and water quality .
Admittedly , leaded solder performs worse on issues of toxicity , mainly to workers who handle the material .
Manufacturers can ( and have already for the past 60 years ) addressed the toxicity issue for workers by using exhaust hoods , wearing gloves , and washing hands .
My conclusion ?
SAC solder is markedly worse for the environment than lead - based solder .
We are not saving the environment by moving to SAC solder , we are damaging it .
Myth # 9 .
Lead leaches out of landfills into the groundwater .
True for paint and gasoline , but not necessarily for pcb assemblies .
Lead in a pcb assembly exists in a solid form that does not migrate like paint or gasoline .
Myth # 10 .
Long - term reliability does n't matter for consumer electronics .
Try telling this to Swatch , the Swiss watch - maker .
They were early adopters of the lead - free movement .
After discovering hideous difficulties with tin whiskers , they ended up shutting down production for some months while they changed back to 63/37 solder .
In the process , they helped push through a RoHS exemption for fine - pitch pcb circuitry .
Myth # 11 .
Whiskers can't short between balls on a 1 - mm component .
This came from studies referenced by Swatch in their application for exemption .
Swatch was seeking some kind of rule they could use to exempt themselves without raising the issue for everyone .
They found some research support for the idea that whiskers do n't grow beyond 800 microns .
Based on that , they postulated that a 650 micron pitch was unsafe , and should be exempted , but 800 microns was fine and did n't need exemption .
Now you go look at the picture in Fig. 2 and tell me that there is a hard upper limit on whisker length .
I do n't think so .
Myth # 12 .
You are exempt from regulation .
Not true .
Some components will arrive at your factory door with 63/37 solder surfaces , some with SAC , and some with pure tin .
You have to deal with the issue whether or not you sell products in Europe .
The RoHS committee has now granted exemptions for military equipment , some classes of high - reliability telecommunications equipment , and fine - pitch ( less than 0.65 mm pitch ) circuitry .
These exemptions create a historic opportunity to roll back the RoHS legislation as it applies to all electronic printed wiring board assemblies .
If you want to push back against the lead - free legislation , please go here , sign up for information , and write to Mr. Burke expressing your support :

If there is any progress on the issue I hope to htmll report on it at my upcoming seminars in Boston , MA , May 7 - 10 , 2007 .
Although the main subjects of those seminars will be " High - Speed Digital Design " and " High - Speed Signal Propagation " , I am always happy to respond to questions on any topic , especially during lunch and breaks .
Best Regards ,

The whole Open Classes thing seems to be turning into another debate along the lines of static vs. dynamic typing or perhaps GOTO vs. Structured Programming .
I ’m all for a lusty debate about programming languages , it ’s a definite interest of mine .
But I ’m going put out an appeal right now : this time around can we try something different ?
In the past , we ( as in “ we the blog echo chamber ” or perhaps “ we the programming . reddit.com flame wardens ” or even “ we the news.ycombinator.com mutual admiration society ” ) have fallen into the nasty habit of “ negotiating for someone else . ”
Do you know what that is ?
It ’s when you say , “ Well , that ’s fine with me , I can program Emacs to follow the Python indentation rules but Ralph over there hates being told how to format his source code . ”
Or perhaps you say , “ Test - driven development is fantastic , but most programmers are too busy to write tests . ”
Not to mention when you say , “ Parser combinators are fabulous , you can write a really good parser and eliminate all the accidental complexity , but when we outsource maintenance to India they wo n’t be able to understand my code .
” Those are all valid concerns for somebody , but how about we let those people speak up for themselves , hunh ?
And it swings the other way , we can argue the Optimistic View about other people .
But whether we ’re optimists or pessimists , instead of debating things based on our perspective of their experience , let ’s debate things based on our own experiences and our own honest likes and dislikes .
As in — and this is my actual personal experience — “ I can appreciate how dynamic typing — as exemplified by modifying open classes at run time — makes a program confusing .
I feel the same way when I look at a Java program using extensive Dependency Injection driven by external XML configuration files , I have to pick my way through everything to figure out what is really going on at run time . ”
Note well the use of the word “ I ” and tyingobservation toactual experience .
That is a very , very different thing than arguing about what might happen to someone else under different circumstances than the ones we live within .
Not that there are n’t important things happening elsewhere :
You and I are just two people on a planet of billions .
But quite honestly , we can go crazy hypothesizing what other people will think and do .
I have my hands full just figuring out what ’s going on with my code on my projects .
So let ’s keep this personal , please .
Let ’s talk about our actual experience , please .
Thank you .
Violets are Blue , Now Roses are Too
Recently we reported on rainbow colored roses from the Netherlands , that were causing quite a craze in Tokyo , Japan .
The craze has apparently not worn off , as one Japanese company has developed something quite new and original .
Suntory Ltd. , who also produces alcohol , created the world ’s first genetically modified Blue roses , which they will begin to sell next year .
“ As its price may be a bit high , we are targeting demand for luxurious cut flowers , such as for gifts , ” he said .
The exact price and commercial name for the blue rose have not been decided .
They created the flowers by implanting the gene that leads to the synthesis of the blue pigment Delphinidin in pansies .
The pigment does not exist naturally in roses .

The intelligence veterans noted that during their careers they frequently had to walk a thin line between morality and expediency , all the while doing their best to abide by the values the majority of Americans have held in common over the years .
They appealed to Senators Pat Leahy and Arlen Specter to rise to the occasion and discharge their responsibility to defend those same values .
THE MEMORANDUM FOLLOWS .
OF NOTE : YOU MAY REPRINT THIS MEMORANDUM AT ANY BLOG OR SITE , IN FULL , AND WITH PROPER ATTRIBUTION AND A LINK BACK TO No Quarter .
===============================
MEMORANDUM FOR : Chairman and Ranking Member Senate Committee on the Judiciary
FROM : Former U.S. Intelligence Officers
SUBJECT : Nomination of Michael Mukasey for Attorney General
Dear Senators Leahy and Specter ,
Values that are extremely important to us as former intelligence officers are at stake in your committee ’s confirmation deliberations on Judge Michael Mukasey .
With hundreds of years of service in sensitive national security activities behind us , we are deeply concerned that your committee may move his nomination to the full Senate without insisting that Mukasey declare himself on whether he believes the practice of waterboarding is legal .
We feel this more acutely than most others , for in our careers we have frequently had to navigate the delicate balance between morality and expediency , all the while doing our best to abide by the values the vast majority of Americans hold in common .
We therefore believe we have a particular moral obligation to speak out .
We can say it no better than four retired judge advocates general ( two admirals and two generals ) who wrote you over the weekend , saying : “ Waterboarding is inhumane , it is torture , and it is illegal . ”
Judge Mukasey ’s refusal to comment on waterboarding , on grounds that it would be “ irresponsible ” to provide “ an uninformed legal opinion based on hypothetical facts and circumstances , ” raises serious questions .
There is nothing hypothetical or secret about the fact that waterboarding was used by U.S. intelligence officers as an interrogation technique before the Justice Department publicly declared torture “ abhorrent ” in a legal opinion in December 2004 .
But after Alberto Gonzales became attorney general in February 2005 , Justice reportedly issued a secret memo authorizing harsh physical and psychological tactics , including waterboarding , which were approved for use in combination .
A presidential executive order of July 20 , 2007 authorized “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” that had been banned for use by the U.S. Army .
Although the White House announced that the order provides “ clear rules ” to govern treatment of detainees , the rules are classified , so defense attorneys , judges , juries — and even nominee Mukasey — can be prevented from viewing them .
Those are some of the “ facts and circumstances . ”
They are not hypothetical ; and there are simple ways for Judge Mukasey to become informed , which we propose below .
Last Thursday , President George W. Bush told reporters it was unfair to ask Mukasey about interrogation techniques about which he had not been briefed .
“ He does n’t know whether we use that technique [ waterboarding ] or not , ” the president said .
Judge Mukasey wrote much the same in his October 30 letter , explaining that he was unable to give an opinion on the legality of waterboarding because he does n't know whether it is being used : “ I have not been made aware of the details of any interrogation program to the extent that any such program may be classified and thus do not know what techniques may be involved in any such program . ”
Whether or not the practice is currently in use by U.S. intelligence , it should in fact be easy for him to respond .
All he need do is find out what waterboarding is and then decide whether he considers it legal .
The conundrum created to justify the nominee ’s silence on this key issue is a synthetic one .
It is within your power to resolve it readily .
If Mukasey continues to drag his feet , you need only to facilitate a classified briefing for him on waterboarding and the C.I.A. interrogation program .
He will then be able to render an informed legal opinion .
We strongly suggest that you sit in on any such briefing and that you invite the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to take part as well .
Receiving the same briefing at the same time ( and , ideally , having it taped ) should enhance the likelihood of candor and make it possible for all to be — and to stay — on the same page on this delicate issue .
If the White House refuses to allow such a briefing , your committee must , in our opinion , put a hold on Mukasey ’s nomination .
We are aware that the president warned last week that it will be either Mukasey as our attorney general or no one .
So be it .
It is time to stand up for what is right and require from the Executive the information necessary for the Senate to function responsibly and effectively .
It would seem essential not to approve a nominee who has already made clear he is reluctant to ask questions of the White House .
How can a person with that attitude even be proposed to be our chief law enforcement officer ?
We strongly urge that you not send Mukasey ’s nomination to the full Senate before he makes clear his view on waterboarding .
Otherwise , there is considerable risk of continued use of the officially sanctioned torture techniques that have corrupted our intelligence services , knocked our military off the high moral ground , severely damaged our country ’s standing in the world , and exposed U.S. military and intelligence people to similar treatment when captured or kidnapped .
One would think that Judge Mukasey would want to be briefed on these secret interrogation techniques and to clarify where he stands .
The most likely explanation for Mukasey ’s reticence is his concern that , should his conscience require him to condemn waterboarding , this could cause extreme embarrassment and even legal jeopardy for senior officials this time not just for the so - called “ bad apples ” at the bottom of the barrel .
We believe it very important that the Senate not acquiesce in his silence — and certainly not if , as seems the case , he is more concerned about protecting senior officials than he is in enforcing the law and the Constitution .
It is important to get beyond shadowboxing on this key issue .
In our view , condoning Mukasey ’s evasiveness would mean ignoring fundamental American values and the Senate ’s constitutional prerogative of advice and consent .
At stake in your committee and this nomination are questions of legality , morality , and our country ’s values .
And these are our primary concerns as well .
As professional intelligence officers , however , we must point to a supreme irony — namely , that waterboarding and other harsh interrogation practices are ineffective tools for eliciting reliable information .
Our own experience dovetails well with that of U.S. Army intelligence chief , Maj. Gen. John Kimmons , who told a Pentagon press conference on September 6 , 2006 : “ No good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices .
I think history tells us that .
I think the empirical evidence of the last five years , hard years , tells us that . ”
Speaking out so precisely and unequivocally took uncommon courage , because Kimmons knew that just across the Potomac President Bush would be taking quite a different line at a press conference scheduled to begin as soon as Kimmons finished his .
At the White House press conference focusing on interrogation techniques , the president touted the success that the C.I.A. was having in extracting information from detainees by using an “ alternative set of procedures . ”
He said these procedures had to be “ tough , ” in order to deal with particularly recalcitrant detainees who “ had received training on how to resist interrogation ” and had “ stopped talking . ”

From the reviews ...
" ... If the complete automation of a major industry within discrete mathematics with relevance to computer science counts as the first miracle , this entertaining accessible exposition by the discoverers themselves counts as the second .
...
Seldom do we find such a dramatic mathematical breakthrough placed within the reach of such a large audience so soon .
Highly recommended .
Undergraduates through faculty . " - D. V. Feldman , University of New Hampshire [ CHOICE , 34 , Nov. 1996 ]

" This book is an essential resource for anyone who ever encounters binomial coefficient identities , for anyone who is interested in how computers are being used to discover and prove mathematical identities and for anyone who simply enjoys a well - written book that presents interesting cutting edge mathematics in an accessible style .
[ The authors ] have been at the forefront of a group of researchers who have found and implemented algorithmic approaches to the study of identities for hypergeometric and basic hypergeometric series ... " - D. M. Bressoud , Macalester College [ Zentralblatt für Mathematik 848 ( 1996 ) . ]

" This marvellous expository text describes the authors ' answer to Exercise 1.2.6.63 in a book by Knuth ...
All [ the ] building blocks are brilliantly discussed in the text which is written in a spirit that puts strong emphasis on tutorial rather than on research exposition aspects -- a wise choice in view of the novelty and broad applicability of the material ... the authors not only skillfully explained their methods to a computer , they also did a truly outstanding job in explaining these recent developments to a broad audience ranging from students to researchers .
In particular , this book is a must for all those who at least once have struggled with a binomial sum . "

" This remarkable book tells of a revolution akin to the one in symbolic integration nearly three decades ago .
Until recently , combinatorial identities had to be proved by some clever argument , say by finding an appropriate bijection .
Now computers have taken over .
Three of the experts who enabled this automation have combined to produce a very readable account of their work ...

" This remarkable book is extremely well - written and gives a complete self contained exposition of a fascinating breakthrough in the field of computer algebra and automatic theorem proving .
It 's about computer programs for simplifying sums that involve binomial coefficients and for discovery and proof of hypergeometric identities .
The authors of the book played key roles in these exciting new developments ...
The book is written in an exceptionally clear way and can be read by anyone who has had at least one year of university mathematics .
The many examples , all verifiable in real time on your PC , make the book very lively .
The material is absolutely fascinating , both for undergraduates and for professional mathematicians ... " -- Jan Denef , in J. Approximation Theory , October , 1999 .

" The good news is that after 30 years of extraordinary efforts ( largely the efforts of this book 's authors ) , this problem [ developing computer programs to simplify hyergeometric sums ] is largely solved ...
This book is about the problem , the history of its solution , the resulting algorithms , and finally -- about the programs ...
Although the book is very technical , it is written in a very popular and understandable way .
It starts with the basics , it gently guides the reader through the programs , through the formulas and through the numerous examples ...
I just love this book , and I hope y'all will too . " -- Vladik Kreinovich , in SIGACT News , 31 , No. 4 , 2000 .

" This is why Barack Obama is hedging from his pledge to accept public financing for the general election . "
" So , he 's changing his mind as the circumstances warrant ? "
" Yep . "
" Is n't that cynical ? "
" Depends .
He could argue that the collective action of 1,000,000 people voluntarily deciding to contribute money to his campaign is much more democratic than a government - imposed levy on the taxpayer . "
" But would n't McCain be able to say that Obama is putting political expediency before principle here ? "
" He could say that .
But what 's the principle ?
When Obama agreed -- and I do think he agreed -- to accept public financing if the Republican did , he had no idea that he would be able to fund his campaign from a donor base that was so broad as to essentially remove from the table the appearance of corruption or unfairness . "
" But it 's not fair to McCain . "
" Exactly .
Obama is orgnanically more exciting than McCain . " "
" Hold on .
There 's a structural imbalance , too .
Democats are raising much more money from the internet and have done so , ever since Howard Dean pioneered the phenominon in 2003 . "
" Well , actually , John McCain kind of pioneered this in 2000 , when he raised $ 1,000,000 the week after winning the New Hampshire primary .
But I concede the point .
One of the biggest structural disadvantages the Republican Party faces over the next generation is that they have n't found an alternative source of revenue .
The older generation of ideological and corporate donors are fading away .
There is no replacement cohort . "
" I still think Obama is fudging on a pledge . "
" And McCain will certainly argue as much .
But if Obama gets 1,000,000 people to contribute $ 100 dollars for the general election , McCain will be forced to someone construe that as a bad thing for democracy . "

IN A world where sight and sound seem to reign supreme , all it takes is a cursory glance at the size of the perfume industry to realise that smell matters quite a lot , too .
Odours are known to regulate moods , thoughts and even dating decisions , which is why any serious romantic will throw on the eau de toilette before going out for a night on the town .
Yet in all these cases , those affected are aware of what they are smelling .
Unlike the media of sight and sound , in which subliminal messages have been studied carefully , the potential power of subliminal smells has been neglected .
Wen Li and her colleagues at Northwestern University in Chicago are now changing that .
In particular , they are investigating smells so faint that people say they cannot detect them .
The idea is to see whether such smells can nevertheless change the way that people behave towards others .
Dr Li's experiment , the results of which have just been published in Psychological Science , employed 31 volunteers .
These people were exposed to three different odours at low concentration .
One was the fresh lemon scent of citral .
The second was the neutral ethereal perfume of anisole .
The third was the foul sweaty smell of valeric acid .
And the concentrations really were low .
In the case of valeric acid , for example , that concentration was seven parts per trillion — a level only just detectable by bloodhounds .
As a control , Dr Li used a mineral oil that has no detectable smell at any concentration .
The participants were asked to sniff a jar containing either one of the three odours or the scentless oil , and then press a button to indicate whether they thought the jar smelled of anything .
Immediately after that , a picture of a face would appear on a screen in front of them for just over a second .
Each participant was asked to rate the face 's “ likeability ” .
Dr Li found that the odours helped shape people 's judgments about the faces when their responses indicated that they had not smelled anything .
When someone had been exposed to valeric acid , for example , he tended to react negatively to a face .
Exposure to citral , by contrast , made that face seem , on average , more friendly .
( Obviously , the same face was not shown to any given participant more than once . )
Even more intriguing , however , was that when participants did consciously perceive a smell , its effect on face - perception disappeared .
What is going on is unclear .
If smells can carry useful information about personality ( which is possible ) , then the effect would be expected to be the same whether or not the chemical in question is detected subliminally .
If they do not carry such information , then it is hard to see what use the subliminal reaction is .
Nevertheless , it is there .
The findings do , however , demonstrate what might be a powerful method of manipulation .
Indeed , Dr Li considers the potential uses to be vast .
Business meetings might be made more pleasant by releasing appropriate fragrances into the air in unsmellable amounts .
Conversely , fights might be started by putting people in the presence of a faint foul odour .
Advertising hoardings might benefit from a little olfactory tweaking and cinema audiences could be reduced to floods of tears at the appropriate moment .
The sweet smell of success might , in other words , actually be undetectable .
Have you used Facebook to give a shout - out to businesses you like ?
Best make sure your profile picture catches your best side , because you might be an unwitting star in those businesses ' next Facebook ad campaigns .
In November 2007 , the Palo Alto , California - based social network announced a highly targeted advertising platform , called Facebook Ads , at a splashy media event in New York .
Since the platform 's release , most of the focus has been on a feature called Beacon , which informs people in your Facebook network about what you 're doing on affiliated third - party sites .
For example , if you buy tickets to a new flick on Fandango , your buddies will find out which movie you saw through a line in their Facebook news feed .
Privacy advocates , lead by political organization MoveOn.org , cried foul , leading Facebook to curtail its Beacon program and add the ability to opt out of the service .
Almost overlooked in the Beacon hubbub were the new display advertisements dubbed " Social Ads . "
These ads , bought by participating businesses , insert your name and profile picture directly into their pitches .
Based on anecdotal evidence , the ads started to roll out right before the holidays .
According to Facebook , a user has to take a " social action " in order to trigger the appearance of their name and picture in an advertisement .
According to Facebook spokesperson Brandee Barker , that could be almost any activity that the user does on Facebook , " such as the download of an application and the acceptance of a friend request . "
It could also include becoming a " fan " of a business by clicking a link on that company 's Facebook page .
But are Facebook users aware of the results of their so - called social actions ?
" When you become a fan of Blockbuster , nothing tells the [ Facebook member ] what that means , " says Jeremiah Owyang , senior analyst at Forrester Research .
Indeed , when you add Blockbuster 's Movie
Clique application , there is no notification that you are allowing
Blockbuster to use your name and profile picture in a display ad .
Owyang suggests that Facebook ought to inform users up front and make it very clear what " becoming a fan " entails , or change the system to an opt - in model .
Currently , there is not even any way to opt- out of participation in Social Ads , other than by avoiding associating yourself with any corporate brands on Facebook .
According to University of Minnesota law professor William McGeveran , who wrote extensively about Social Ads ' possible legal ramifications when the platform was announced , the problem is that users may be unwittingly lending their likenesses to advertising campaigns .
" I would expect it to make many users uncomfortable to see their images appropriated this way for commercial purposes if they did n't have warning and did n't give true consent in advance , " McGeveran told Wired .
It 's also possible that Social Ads may run afoul of legal statutes , like Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Company , a 1902 case in which a flour company used a picture of a teenaged girl , without her permission , to promote their product .
However , McGeveran says it 's too early to tell whether this precedent would apply to
Facebook .
" Social Ads [ are ] a little different from [ Roberson v .
Rochester ] , because , rather than being plucked out of thin air , [ a
Facebook user ] did do something to initiate the ads .
The question is if that something constituted consent .
Facebook thinks it does and I think that it is , at the very least , debatable . "

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Missing millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett was declared legally dead on Friday by a Chicago court five months after the airplane he was flying disappeared over Nevada , media reported .
His wife , Peggy Fossett , had asked Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago to make the declaration in November .
Her petition for a judicial finding of his death said investigators had concluded that Fossett ’s airplane was destroyed in a fatal accident .
“ I believe the evidence is more than sufficient , ” Judge Jeffrey Malak of the circuit court said in ruling declaring Fossett was dead , the Chicago Tribune reported on its Web site .
Citing court records it said his estate was “ vast ” and worth more than eight figures -- or multiple millions of dollars .
Fossett , a 63 - year - old holder of several aviation and sailing records , vanished with his airplane after taking off from a private airstrip in western Nevada , one of the most remote and uninhabited regions of the continental United States , on September 3 .
An exhaustive search failed to find any wreckage .
British entrepreneur Richard Branson , who teamed with Fossett on some ventures and underwrote his successful global plane flight , said in September Fossett was scouting dry lake beds as locations for a future attempt to set a world land speed record .
Fossett , who earned his fortune as a financial trader , in 2002 became the first person to fly a balloon solo around the world and in 2005 achieved the first solo nonstop flight around the world in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer aircraft .
Last year Fossett flew solo in the GlobalFlyer to set the absolute nonstop distance record for any aircraft and set a new glider world altitude record with co-pilot Einar Enevoldson .
Fossett also competed in endurance competitions , swam the English Channel and set numerous world records in sailing .
In a major policy announcement , he had said : ' I am announcing tough new protection for village schools .
When a school closes , the village loses a vital focus .
Children spend longer travelling to other schools .
Young families will come under pressure to move elsewhere .
School closures can have a knock - on effect on other services , like village shops , setting up a spiral of decline .
This is what we want to stop . '
Byers said that any proposal to close a rural school would be called before the Secretary of State , a promise on which the government has since reneged .
Steve Sinnott , general - secretary of the National Union of Teachers , said : ' If local authorities are thinking of closing a mass of rural schools then they are going against previous commitments . '
He said that in Scotland ' imaginative ' policies were being used to prevent closures .
Protests from teachers and parents have been successful north of the border , and more recently the Scottish National Party has been supportive of village schools .
Last week there were major protests in Shropshire after the county council announced radical plans to close 22 primary schools and merge 16 more .
Mervyn Benford , of the National Association for Small Schools , said yesterday : ' In 1998 , the Labour government said it wanted to end school closures .
Now , Shropshire , Herefordshire , the Isle of Wight and more want to close between 20 and 35 small village schools each .
' Kent has proposed a minimum desirable school size of 110 , Cheshire and Staffordshire have already begun closures , Suffolk and Oxfordshire are about to launch consultations and they have been busy in Lincolnshire .
Our nightmare scenario is the closure of more than 1,000 schools .
The government said villagers needed their schools and now , suddenly , villagers do not need their schools any more . '
In Wales , rural communities are facing similar problems .
MPs blamed the government 's funding formula , which , they said , demonstrated a massive and aggressive switch of money from the shire counties to the inner cities .
The plans would mean more children facing far longer journeys to school , many along winding country lanes .
' It will have a devastating effect on communities , ' said Philip Dunne , Tory MP for Ludlow , who warned that the countryside would become ' a care home for the elderly ' .
On Wednesday , he and other countryside MPs will meet schools minister Jim Knight .
Dunne added that the battle comes on top of the fight to save local post offices .
Shropshire , one of the most sparsely populated areas of the UK , this year received £ 3,551 per pupil from the government , £ 337 less than the England average , and half of what the City of London received , according to Owen Paterson , Tory MP for North Shropshire .
The local education authority has blamed falling pupil numbers and hopes to achieve £ 1.8 m savings a year if the proposals are ratified .
' If we do not act now , the standard of education would ultimately fall as funding would be used to supplement empty places , ' said Anne Hartley , cabinet member for Children 's Services .
In neighbouring Herefordshire , the council put plans to close or merge 37 schools on hold last week after huge opposition from parents , but will push ahead later this year .
There are fears in the council that failure to act will result in financial penalties .
Barry Sheerman , chairman of the Select Committee for Children , Schools and Families , said he would question Knight about the issue , but added : ' Everyone thinks there should be a village school , and it is an emotive subject .
I understand , but we have to remember we are here to provide the best learning experience and education for children . '
A spokeswoman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families said : ' Decisions on changes to local school provision and organisation are made locally and ministers have no role in the process . '
She said there had to be a strong case for the closure of rural schools , but pointed out that primary pupil numbers had fallen by 10 per cent .
But Les Lawrence , of the Local Government Association , accused the government of turning its back on local authorities .
' It is no good ministers making high - flown statements and expecting others to pick up the tab , ' he said .
' The government has said that council tax can not be increased by more than 5 per cent .
Local authorities have to make savings somewhere . '

Muslim elders at an Oxford mosque have said they intend to push ahead with plans to broadcast a call to prayer from a loudspeaker despite fierce opposition .
Local residents have attacked the idea saying it would disrupt the peace and turn the area into a ' Muslim ghetto ' .
But the elders said they still intend to seek planning permission to install the loudspeaker .
If granted , they would broadcast a two - minute long call three times a day from the Central Mosque , where up to 700 people gather to worship every Friday .
The idea has gained support from the Bishop of Oxford , the Rt Rev John Pritchard , who last week said those in opposition to the idea should " relax " and " enjoy community diversity " .
But residents , who packed out a council meeting last month to signal their outrage , remain set against the plan which they say is an " un-neighbourly intrusion " .
They said they would rally to block the proposal when it is submitted to the council in nine months time , when construction on the mosque is complete .
Dr Allan Chapman , 61 , who lives near the building , said : " The response against this has been incredible , we have been indundated with calls ranging from stiff upper lip outrage to sheer screaming fury .
" The universal message is what an utter cheek to inflict this on a non-Muslim area of Oxford .
If this application goes forward then a large number of angry people are poised to form an opposition to it . "
Dr Chapman added the broadcast is not to comparable to the ringing of church bells because : " They are just a signal .
The Muslim call is a theological statement . "
Residents have said the main objection is the loud amplification of the broadcast .
Elizabeth Mills , 56 , said : " We do n't have a problem with the Imam climbing to the top of the minaret and shouting .
" But we object to electronic amplification .
The Bishop of Oxford might say it's ok but he does n't have to listen to it . "
Martin Stott , 53 , a member of the Oxford Oratory , added : " This is not an anti-Muslim thing , it is more about community cohesion . "
A spokesman for the Central Mosque said that sounding the call to prayer is a traditional part of the religion .
Sadar Rana , 68 , said : " Building work will take another nine months to a year , it is then that we plan to make an application to the council .
" We want to fix a loudspeak to our minaret to broadcast our call to prayer .
We would like to have it three times a day but if that is not accepted , then we would like to have it at least on Fridays .
" We do not need the volume to be loud but we want to have the call in some form because it 's our tradition . "

In this post we present 50 new CSS - techniques , ideas and ready - to - use solutions for effective coding .
You definitely know some of them , but definitely not all of them .
Some technique is missing ?

Thanks to all developers who contributed to the CSS - based design over the last year .
The community appreciates it .
CSS - Techniques
File inputs ( < input type = “ file ” /> ) are the bane of beautiful form design .
No rendering engine provides the granular control over their presentation designers desire .
This simple , three - part progressive enhancement provides the markup , CSS , and JavaScript to address the long - standing irritation .
Derek Powazek suggests adding a copyright message to a photo and use CSS to crop its view .
This is supposed to accomplish the goal of adding robust copyright information without defacing your own work .
What we want to do here , is instead of simply altering the state of the navigation item the user is currently rolling over , we want to alter the non navigation items as well .
A method of designing the so - called step - menus , which have some steps users have to go through in order to achieve some aim .
This menu offers a varying amount of steps , dependent upon the type of user accessing the application .
Ordered lists are boring !
Sure you can apply background images and do quite a bit of sprucing up to a regular ordered list , but you just do n’t get enough control over the number itself .
This is a demonstration of the effect where the bottom of the page seems to fade out .
The technique makes use of an fixed position div ( bottom : 0 % ) with a transparent PNG image and a high z - index value .
Using a simple unordered list this experiment aligns the boxes across the page with the end result being to showcase items like services , products , or specials .
One of cool thing about this — if you turn off styles — is the extractable semantics with the headings and paragraphs used .
In as little as 8 lines of HTML , and 5 lines of CSS , the Table Of Contents Navigation block can be integrated in your site ready for even more styling .
Learn how to generate code for displaying the e-mail automatically once mailto is used .
CSS Attribute Selectors in action which is not supported by Internet Explorer 6 and 7 .
This is a CSS technique that could be useful if you want to give users accessible added content such as tool - tips , notifications , or alerts , without adding unnecessary clutter to your page .
And since it does n’t rely of JavaScript , it should be useful to everyone , even disabled users .
Further Techniques
This amazing little script allows the user to resize any container .
Create a transparent PNG overlay which can be used as a mask / frame around regular JPEG or GIF so users can upload photos without having to worry about using any graphics program to apply filters , plus it saves time .

Intel began shipping its quad core line of desktop processors late last year , starting with the Core 2 Extreme QX6700 .
Later , the company shipped the mainstream Core 2 Quad Q6600 .
Today , Intel has three current products with four cores in its product line , the Core 2 Extreme QX6850 , the Core 2 Quad Q6700 ( essentially a QX6700 with a locked core multiplier ) and the aforementioned Q6600 , which can now be found for well under $ 300 .
Now that we have a dual - core CPU , the Core 2 E6850 running at the same clock frequency and front side bus speed as the QX6850 , it ’s worth revisiting the issue of whether or not users need four cores .
Part of this was prompted by an interesting comment made by AMD Chief Technical Officer Phil Hester in our podcast interview with Phil in our last podcast .
Phil suggested that a dual core CPU with a carefully tuned cache structure might be better for end users of office applications than a quad core CPU .
Do you really need four cores in your PC ?
Certainly , we ’ve seen a lot of new PCs ship with quad core CPUs , aimed at a variety of users .
These range from flagship gaming rigs from the likes of Falcon Northwest and Voodoo PC ship , to HP ’s mainstream Pavilion m8120n home PC , which can be found as low as $ 1,150 .
Let ’s see if we can find a few answers .

N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell will travel to Washington on Wednesday to meet with Senator Arlen Specter for a discussion about the league ’s investigation into the Patriots ’ spying on other teams .
“ I have a lot of questions , ” Specter said .
“ I ’m hoping to get some answers . ”
Specter , of Pennsylvania , is the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee .
He first requested a meeting with Goodell in a letter in November .
Specter wanted to know why the league had destroyed all evidence in the spying case and whether there was any indication that the Patriots had cheated when they played the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX .
Specter called the 3 p.m. meeting with Goodell a “ private conversation . ”
He stopped short of saying the Judiciary Committee would call anyone to testify .
The Patriots were caught filming the Jets ’ defensive signals in the teams ’ season opener Sept. 9 at Giants Stadium .
The league asked the Patriots to turn over any material related to spying .
The league received notes and six tapes , mostly from the 2006 season , then destroyed them .
Updated UK researchers have uncovered a serious flaw in the Chip and PIN machines that authenticate debit and credit card transactions .
Two of the most popular PIN entry devices ( PED ) in the UK — the Ingenico i3300 and Dione Xtreme — are vulnerable to a " tapping attack " , using nothing more sophisticated than a paper clip , a needle and a small recording device .
This basic kit enabled University of Cambridge Computer Labs researchers to record data exchanged between a card and the device 's processor without triggering tamper - proofing mechanisms .
The devices analysed by the team were borrowed from merchants , but they can also be purchased online for as little as $ 20 .
In a technical paper ( PDF ) the researchers explain that in both PIN entry devices they examined the secure storage for cryptographic keys is well protected .
However , in each case it is possible to tap the data line between the card and the PIN Entry device 's processor .
The data exchanged on this line is not encrypted so the problem becomes one of getting physical access to the link and of hiding this covert snooping .
The Ingenico PED includes 1 mm holes that provide access to a printed circuit board using a bent paper clip .
" This can be inserted through a hole in the plastic surrounding the internal compartment , and does not leave any external marks , " the Cambridge researchers explain .
Handily the Ingenico PED provides a concealed compartment designed for the insertion of optional SIM - sized cards to expand its functionality .
The compartment is not intended to be tamper - proof and provides a concealed compartment to hide the wiretap , if not direct access to the circuit board .
The Dione PED does not provide a concealed compartment to hide the wiretap , but is still vulnerable .
The Cambridge researchers drilled a 0.8 mm hole from the rear , through which they inserted a 4 cm needle into a flat ribbon connector socket .
A thin wire connection from this link and interfaced by a small board could be used to send entered data to a laptop .
The Cambridge researchers conclude that the attack is far easier to pull off than the banking industry claims .
What should have required $ 25,000 needed just a bent paper clip , a needle , a short length of wire and some creative thinking ; attaching them to the data line takes minutes with some practice .
A small FPGA or microcontroller board with some non-volatile memory can easily fit inside the Ingenico PED ’s compartment and record transaction details without the cardholder ’s knowledge , while a wire routed from the back of a mounted Dione PED to a recorder under the counter will not be detected unless the cardholder conducts a very close inspection – and knows what to look for .
The recording circuit can be very small and either battery operated or attached to the PED ’s power supply ; with a full transaction requiring about 1 kB of storage , even a small memory can record thousands of transactions .
Detecting such a tap from within the PED is extremely difficult , since high input impedance probes do not significantly distort signals , and proper termination suppresses reflections .
" This attack can capture the card ’s PIN because UK banks have opted to issue cheaper cards that do not use asymmetric cryptography to encrypt data between the card and PED , " the Cambridge researchers note .
A demo of the attack ( video here ) featured on UK news programme Newsnight on Tuesday .
It gets worse .
To ensure backward compatibility , PIN entry devices read data on magnetic strips , as well as on chips on newer credit cards .
Hackers tapping into the link between a card and the processing device could get all the data needed to make a cloned card .
Add in the corresponding PIN , and fraudsters could withdraw cash at the many ATMs overseas not upgraded to read chips and therefore solely reliant on easily - fakeable magnetic stripes .
Tampered PIN entry devices have already been used for fraud .
Last December , £ 80,000 was stolen from 1,500 people in Leicestershire when crooks cloned their cards using a doctored device in a local petrol station .
The process to determine PIN reader security is substandard , the Cambridge team argues .
Evaluation should be more open and defective devices should be refused certification , they say ..
The Cambridge Chip and PIN scenarios pose little threat in the real world , according to APACS , the banking association which spearheaded the introduction of Chip and PIN in the UK .
" The types of attack on PIN entry devices detailed in this report are difficult to undertake and not currently economically viable for a fraudster to carry out , " a spokesman said .
Ross Anderson , a member of the research team and professor of security engineering at Cambridge , said : " The lessons we learned are not limited to banking .
Other fields , from voting machines to electronic medical record systems , suffer from the same combination of stupid mistakes , sham evaluations and obstructive authorities .
Where the public are forced to rely on the security of a system , we need honest security evaluations that are published and subjected to peer review . "
The Cambridge team presents its findings in full in May at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy conference in Oakland , California .
Anderson 's colleagues are Saar Drimer and Steven Murdoch . ®

* UPDATE , 5:33 P.M. : More problems continue throughout LA County at the beach , in Santa Monica .
At Los Angeles City Hall , two City Councilmembers had an emergency press conference telling voters to pay attention when voting and Dharma & Greg Actor Mimi Kennedy explains what 's going on in a video interview with LAist .
Also , Hillary Clinton answered our interview questions .
We 're getting reports of problems from readers , writers and the media .
John Ennis , one of the founders of Video the Vote , gave LAist this update .
Most of the confusion today is over people who are not registered as Democrat or Republican who want to vote in the primaries .
The issue might be that they moved and they thought they were up to date .
If you are a non-partisan voter , all you have to do is go to either a Democratic or Republican voting booth .
Other than a few precincts not opening on time , Ennis says things seem to be running smooth , but it 's early in the day he warned .
To report a bad voting experience , call Video the Vote at 866 - OUR - VOTE
Here are some other comments we 've heard around the interwebs , if you have any stories to tell , let us know in the comments !

" Neighborhood friends and I voted this AM over at the Fairfax Library Branch .
There was a delay because the machine that " counts " our inked up ballots was on the fritz .
The staff was overwhelmed and frankly did n't know what to do .
Two folks said ' Get a Mac . '
It was funny and sad , and scary .
I thought the machine was a Diebold and therefore our Demo votes would somehow toggle over , or just toggle off — but after some research , this is what that machine is : http://www.inkavote.com/precinct_ballot_counter.htm "

The Czech government has begun an 890,000 - dollar information campaign supporting the U.S. plan to set up a radar station in the Czech Republic .
Opponents of the plan  led by the Social Democrats  want some of that money to fund alternative information campaigns so as to create an actual debate on the issue and prepare the population for the possibility of a referendum .
The radar system  officially presented by Washington as offering protection to the West from missile attacks by " rogue states " such as Iran and North Korea  would have two elements : a radar in the Czech Republic and an anti-missile base in Poland .
" We decided to start an alternative information campaign since we feel the government is brainwashing the Czech public , and we chose to visualize this problem for both the public and politicians in a mocking fashion , " Lenka Kukurova , action campaigner for Greenpeace Czech Republic , told IPS .
Members of the Greenpeace organization recently staged a protest depicting a scene in which a U.S. general dictates to Czech ministers how to promote the base .
The ministers  could be seen holding sponges and washing giant brains placed on the heads of activists who represented the public .
" The action was very attractive for the electronic and printed media and we received good feedback , " said Kukurova , " I think its because we are not just protesting , we are offering alternative information . "
Growing disapproval of the base among the Czech public precipitated the Greenpeace information campaign .
Most Czechs do not trust Washingtons justification for the radar and parallels have been drawn to the situation that lead to the 2003 intervention in Iraq , when the U.S. claimed the Iraqi regime had developed weapons of mass destruction .
Government politicians insist that the public is unqualified to deliberate on the base and some believe they have already decided in fervor of it .
Even the right - wing media have cautioned the government .
The cabinet should at least " finance the functioning of an expert team . . . with the participation of people who are regarded as authorities  whether justifiably or not  by the radars opponents , " read a piece carried by the Czech daily Lidove Noviny on Aug .
7 .
The government has appointed a public relations expert , Tomas Klvana , to work as spokesman on the U.S. radar issue .
It has also hired the AMI Communication public relations agency to help promote the idea .
Klvana lectures at the New York University in Prague and is a representative of British American Tobacco in the Czech Republic .
He also writes for the leading dailies Mala Fronta Dnes and Hospodarske Noviny , which both support the radar .
Shortly after his appointment last summer Klvana admitted supporters of the base " have not been coping well with communication , " but also said it was difficult to speak to people from the regions " with rational arguments . "
On Nov. 2 Klvana launched an advertising campaign  as part of the government information program  involving information posters that will be placed on 500 benches and telephone booths .
Civic initiatives challenging the government plans are gaining steam .
A letter by 50 famous personalities was sent to Czech President Vaclav Klaus calling for a referendum on the base .
The letter accuses the government of scaring the public with false arguments such as threats that if the radar base is not built , in the future conscription may be reinstated .
Klaus , who is favorably but moderately inclined towards the radar , argues that the presence of foreign troops in the Czech Republic would require national consensus .
He says he will not veto a referendum proposal by parliament .
A call for a referendum was already rejected by parliament on Oct. 26 .
Opponents of the referendum claim difficult decisions should be left to politicians : " By his or her vote and taxes the voter is paying both for professional political decisions and also for politicians  willingness to take on responsibility for complex and thankless decisions , " right - wing daily Mala Fronta Dnes wrote on Sept.
1 .
Klaus accepts that the radars absence from the 2006 election campaign makes the referendum initiative necessary .
The President has been critical of the governments approach to the issue .
He says that the publics concerns about the radar cannot be easily dismissed , calling them " natural and very human . "
Locals of the areas surrounding the possible site of the base in the Brdy hills , south of Prague , fear the densely populated area could be the target of international terrorism and have raised questions about the possible health risks of radiation emitted by the radar .
The mayors of the potentially affected localities  overwhelmingly opposed to U.S. plans  have established an association to resist the base and are demanding that the government meet with them directly to assess the possibility of harmful health effects from radiation .
Opposition leaders and a group of scientists attacked a study conducted by the defense ministry  which deemed the radar harmless  for its lack of independence and superficiality .
" The study cannot be regarded as trustworthy , " reads a statement by scientists from the Brno - based Electrical Technology Institute .
" If a university student of radio technology were to defend this as his final thesis , he would most probably fail , " the experts said .
The defense ministry has conceded there were mistakes in the original study but claims to have corrected them .
Chief Public Health Officer Michael
Vit has announced that another study on the radars health impact will be presented soon .
Supporters of the radar stress the importance of strengthening Czech ties to the worlds only superpower .
Many right - wing Czechs resent pacifist movements for what they regard as their pre-1989 sympathies towards the Soviet Union , and the right - wing press regularly accuses the plans opponents of lacking realism and harboring radical anti-American feelings .
Historical resentment towards the presence of foreign troops is also playing a role , with opponents of the radar viewing the rejection of the U.S. base as an ultimate proof of the countrys independence from foreign superpowers .

The D.E.A. declined to comment on the call - tracing program , except to say that it “ exercises its legal authority ” to issue administrative subpoenas .
The N.S.A. also declined to comment on it .
In a separate program , N.S.A. officials met with the Qwest executives in February 2001 and asked for more access to their phone system for surveillance operations , according to people familiar with the episode .
The company declined , expressing concerns that the request was illegal without a court order .
While Qwest ’s refusal was disclosed two months ago in court papers , the details of the N.S.A. ’s request were not .
The agency , those knowledgeable about the incident said , wanted to install monitoring equipment on Qwest ’s “ Class 5 ” switching facilities , which transmit the most localized calls .
Limited international traffic also passes through the switches .
A government official said the N.S.A. intended to single out only foreigners on Qwest ’s network , and added that the agency believed Joseph Nacchio , then the chief executive of Qwest , and other company officials misunderstood the agency ’s proposal .
Bob Toevs , a Qwest spokesman , said the company did not comment on matters of national security .
Other N.S.A. initiatives have stirred concerns among phone company workers .
A lawsuit was filed in federal court in New Jersey challenging the agency ’s wiretapping operations .
It claims that in February 2001 , just days before agency officials met with Qwest officials , the N.S.A. met with AT&T officials to discuss replicating a network center in Bedminster , N.J. , to give the agency access to all the global phone and e-mail traffic that ran through it .
The accusations rely in large part on the assertions of a former engineer on the project .
The engineer , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said in an interview that he participated in numerous discussions with N.S.A. officials about the proposal .
The officials , he said , discussed ways to duplicate the Bedminster system in Maryland so the agency “ could listen in ” with unfettered access to communications that it believed had intelligence value and store them for later review .
There was no discussion of limiting the monitoring to international communications , he said .
“ At some point , ” he said , “ I started feeling something is n’t right . ”
Two other AT&T employees who worked on the proposal discounted his claims , saying in interviews that the project had simply sought to improve the N.S.A. ’s internal communications systems and was never designed to allow the agency access to outside communications .
Michael Coe , a company spokesman , said : “ AT&T is fully committed to protecting our customers ’ privacy .
We do not comment on matters of national security . ”
The feel of classic Hollywood permeates a renovated 1920s Spanish Revival home in Whitley Heights that sits on a bluff facing the Hollywood sign and surrounding hillside .
An early celebrity enclave , Whitley Heights was Hollywood ’s first National Historic District and home to such stars as Rudolph Valentino , Bette Davis , Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson .
Today the neighborhood ’s Mediterranean - style homes sit under towering eucalyptus and mature pine trees .
“ We loved the history of the neighborhood , ” says James Everingham , a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who renovated the house with his wife , Brooke Davis .
“ It felt magical at night , like being in a European village .
We ’re into historic preservation so pulled the original floor plans and relaid the bottom floor to make more sense for modern living while preserving the 1920s feel . ”
Some floors were leveled , and green and black subway tiles , typical of the period , were placed in updated bathrooms .
The ceiling in the living room was raised 3 feet , and new plumbing , heating / air conditioning and electrical systems were installed .
A distinctive circular ceiling overlaid with gold leaf above the breakfast nook in the kitchen was added by artist Tania Seabock , who was commissioned to work on the U.S. Treasury Building and Trump Tower in New York .
On the ground floor is a dining room with a picture window overlooking the Hollywood Hills , a hall bathroom with shower , a large kitchen with walnut floors , two bedrooms and a guest bathroom .
A third bedroom is used as an exercise room .
A laundry closet with a stacked washer - dryer and a storage closet are tucked between the dining room and guest bedroom under a gold - leaf ceiling archway .
Replicas of lighting fixtures and chandeliers from the period are found throughout the house , such as a beaded shade and crystal pendant chandelier at the top of the staircase landing .
Upstairs is a living room with wood - burning fireplace that leads to an outdoor deck .
The master bedroom shares a bathroom with a fifth bedroom that is used as an office .
Outdoor patios on opposite sides of the house offer entertainment space and gardens .

The GOP blocks passage of a bill that would have banned torture outright even as Bush had threatened to veto it .
Bush and his criminal conspirators -- the GOP leadership in Congress -- have thus worked mightily to cover up his crimes , obstruct justice and make legal the crimes that Bush has already committed .
But that 's not all .
The GOP is moving to quash an investigation of Bush that will involve " obstruction of justice " , an investigation that one hopes will end in Bush 's impeachment , removal , arrest and trial for war crimes .
WASHINGTON ( AFP ) -
The US government has asked a Congressional committee to suspend its probe into the destruction by the CIA of videotapes , citing ' significant risks ' to its own investigation , the New York Times reported Saturday .
The US Justice Department 's request Friday to the House Intelligence Committee came after the panel had summoned two CIA officials to testify next week -- a hearing that now is likely to be postponed , the daily reported .
The committee had demanded that the CIA produce by Friday all cables , memorandums and e-mail messages related to the videotapes , as well as the legal advice given to agency officials before the tapes were destroyed .
The deadline passed without the arrival of any of those documents , the Times wrote .
-- US government seeks hold on probe into torture tapes
BRIAN ROSS : And did you know the CIA officers feel without a doubt you had the legal right to do what you were doing ?
JOHN : Absolutely .
Absolutely .
I remember - I remember being told when - the President signed the - the authorities that they had been approved - not just by the National Security Counsel , but by the - but by the Justice Department as well , I remember people being surprised that the authorities were granted .
JOHN : You know , you may not think about it , but -- but exhaustion is -- is a very difficult thing to handle .
It 's one thing to be tired .
It 's another thing to be so tired that you begin to hallucinate .

And after a while some people just can't take it anymore .

Give me two hours of sleep , I 'll tell you anything you wanna know . "
BRIAN ROSS : Really ?
JOHN : Uh- huh ( AFFIRM ) BRIAN ROSS :
And that 's after how long generally ?
JOHN : I recall the handful of times it was used on people it was usually 40 hours plus .
They just simply could n't take it anymore .
There is probable cause and mounting evidence that the " authorization " for the widespread tactic of torture by the US goes all the way to the White House -- Bush himself !
In any case , " Water boarding " is not the only torture procedure that US torturers employ .
Photos from Abu Ghraib depict a veritable smorgasbord of horrors .
Integral to Bush policy is " sleep " deprivation " -- the subject of correspondent Brian Ross ' interview found on Uruknet
Like all criminals desperately trying to cover their tracks , the conspirators forgot an important detail and it is too late to rewrite the history .
The destruction of the so - called torture tapes violated a federal court order .
Are Externalities an Intellectually Sound Bridge Between Us and Them ?
By Bryan Caplan
When Princeton ’s Roland Benabou visited GMU a couple weeks ago , he made an argument I ’ve occasionally heard before : Non-economists would disagree with economists less , and respect our views more , if we put more emphasis on the concept of externalities .
When economists talk about markets , the argument goes , we usually seem tone deaf to non-economists ’ concerns .
If we put more emphasis on the concept of externalities , non-economists could see that it is easy to translate their concerns into our language – and that we have every reason to take their concerns seriously .
As a rhetorical strategy , Benabou ’s probably right .
Non-economists are much more anti-market than economists .
If we told them that the economic way of thinking is consistent with ( or better yet , justifies ! ) their anti-market prejudices , we ’d be more popular .
But is this an intellectually sound way to bridge the divide between economists and non-economists ?
I think not .
If we explain the concept of externalities properly , non-economists will continue to give us the cold shoulder .
Here ’s why .
1 . The concept of externalities relies entirely on economists ’ standard notion of willingness to pay .
If people are willing to pay to preserve a rare species of monkey , there may be an externality .
If no one cares , there ’s no externality .
The upshot is that the concept continues to slight non-economists ’ concerns about fairness , intrinsic value , equality , etc .
2 . If an externality exists , the economically efficient solution is normally a tax or subsidy .
That ’s it .
But non-economists are usually looking for an excuse for government to ban or nationalize .
At minimum , non-economists want to use hands - on regulation – not just add a tax and say “ OK , problem solved . ”
Someone who uses an externalities argument to justify e.g. existing ( or stricter ! ) EPA regulation does n’t really understand the argument .
3 . The concept of externalities focuses on non-excludable costs and benefits .
The upshot is that we can go down the list of e.g. environmentalist causes and pick out a major subset that probably do n’t qualify as externalities problems .
Recycling ?
If people are paid the market value of what they recycle , it ’s hard to see the externality .
National parks ?
If user fees ca n’t sustain them , you have to fall back on a lame “ existence value externality ” story .
4 . Most fundamentally , externalities can afflict any social institution – markets , governments , non-profits , etc .
So there ’s nothing inherently anti-market about the concept .
You can use externalities arguments to complain about auto emissions .
But you can just as easily use the concept to complain about voter irrationality .
If the externalities of government decision - making are severe enough , externalities provide an efficiency argument for living with market failure rather than doing something about it .
Bottom line :
If economists are upfront about all of this – and we should be – the concept of externalities is not going to make us many friends .
Economics has a lot of unpalatable lessons to teach .
Our job is to teach them nonetheless .
Barack Obama reportedly said something very important and long overdue to a group of some 100 Cleveland Jewish leaders on Sunday â€ ” that being pro-Likud and being â€œpro-Israelâ€ are two different things .
â€ œI think there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says unless you adopt a unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel that youâ€ ™re anti-Israel and that canâ€™t be the measure of our friendship with Israel .
If we can not have an honest dialogue about how do we achieve these goals , then weâ€ ™re not going to make progress.â€ 
He said even more about the confined nature of the debate over Israel and its security in this country , according to the dispatch in the Jewish Telegraph Agency ( JTA ) .
Apparently in defense of his consultations with Zbigniew Brzezinski , who has been harshly critical of neo-conservative influence in the Bush administration , Obama said :
â€ œFrankly some of the commentary that Iâ€™ve seen which suggests guilt by association or the notion that unless we are never ever going to ask any difficult questions about how we move peace forward or secure Israel that is non military or non belligerent or doesnâ€™t talk about just crushing the opposition that that somehow is being soft or anti-Israel , I think weâ€ ™re going to have problems moving forward.â€ 
And he contrasted those constraints on the debate here with the breadth and vigor of the discussion of those same issues in Israel itself .
â€ œThere was a very honest , thoughtful debate taking place inside Israel .
All of you , Iâ€™m sure , have experienced this when you travel there .
Understandably , because of the pressure that Israel is under , I think the U.S. pro-Israel community is sometimes a little more protective or concerned about opening up that conversation .
But all Iâ€™m saying though is that actually ultimately should be our goal , to have that same clear - eyed view about how we approach these issues.â€ 

Self - Censorship by Journalists
Initially , there has been self - censorship by journalists .
Indeed , journalists who have even asked innocuous questions about 9/11 have been threatened .
And , referring to another topic , a leading MSNBC news commentator has said that there is self - censorship in the American media , and that :
As Air Force Colonel and key Pentagon official Karen Kwiatkowski has written ( at page 26 ) :
Censorship by Higher - Ups
In fact many journalists are warning that the true story is not being reported .
See this announcement and this talk .
And a series of interviews with award - winning journalists also documents censorship of certain stories by media editors and owners ( and see these samples ) .
There are many reasons for censorship by media higher - ups .
One is money .
The media has a strong monetary interest to avoid controversial topics in general .
It has always been true that advertisers discourage stories which challenge corporate power .
Indeed , a 2003 survey reveals that 35 % of reporters and news executives themselves admitted that journalists avoid newsworthy stories if “ the story would be embarrassing or damaging to the financial interests of a news organization ’s owners or parent company . ”
False flag terrorism is the most controversial topic there is .
Exposure of the truth about 9/11 would challenge the government and the corporate status quo .
Exposure of the truth of 9/11 would directly damage the bottom line of the war profiteers ( see below ) .
It would also damage the financial interests of the news organizations , since revelation of the truth would show how bad the mainstream media has been in covering real news , thus encouraging more people to get their news from other sources .
In addition , the Bush administration is allowing tremendous consolidation in ownership of the airwaves .
The large media players stand to gain billions of dollars in profits if the administration continues to allow monopoly ownership of the airwaves by a handful of players .
The media giants know who butters their bread .
So there is a spoken or tactit agreement : if the media cover the administration in a favorable light , the MSM will continue to be the receiver of the government 's goodies .
And censoring the truth about 9/11 is a large part of covering the administration in a favorable light .

Hydrogen as an everyday , environmentally friendly fuel source may be closer than we think , according to Penn State researchers .
" The energy focus is currently on ethanol as a fuel , but economical ethanol from cellulose is 10 years down the road , " says Bruce E. Logan , the Kappe professor of environmental engineering .
" First you need to break cellulose down to sugars and then bacteria can convert them to ethanol . "
Logan and Shaoan Cheng , research associate , suggest a method based on microbial fuel cells to convert cellulose and other biodegradable organic materials directly into hydrogen .
The researchers used naturally occurring bacteria in a microbial electrolysis cell with acetic acid -- the acid found in vinegar .
Acetic acid is also the predominant acid produced by fermentation of glucose or cellulose .
The anode was granulated graphite , the cathode was carbon with a platinum catalyst , and they used an off - the - shelf anion exchange membrane .
The bacteria consume the acetic acid and release electrons and protons creating up to 0.3 volts .
When more than 0.2 volts are added from an outside source , hydrogen gas bubbles up from the liquid .
" This process produces 288 percent more energy in hydrogen than the electrical energy that is added to the process , " says Logan .
Water hydrolysis , a standard method for producing hydrogen , is only 50 to 70 percent efficient .
Even if the microbial electrolysis cell process is set up to bleed off some of the hydrogen to produce the added energy boost needed to sustain hydrogen production , the process still creates 144 percent more available energy than the electrical energy used to produce it .
For those who think that a hydrogen economy is far in the future , Logan suggests that hydrogen produced from cellulose and other renewable organic materials could be blended with natural gas for use in natural gas vehicles .
" We drive a lot of vehicles on natural gas already .
Natural gas is essentially methane , " says Logan .
" Methane burns fairly cleanly , but if we add hydrogen , it burns even more cleanly and works fine in existing natural gas combustion vehicles . "
The range of efficiencies of hydrogen production based on electrical energy and energy in a variety of organic substances is between 63 and 82 percent .
Both lactic acid and acetic acid achieve 82 percent , while unpretreated cellulose is 63 percent efficient .
Glucose is 64 percent efficient .
Another potential use for microbial - electrolysis -cell produced hydrogen is in fertilizer manufacture .
Currently fertilizer is produced in large factories and trucked to farms .
With microbial electrolysis cells , very large farms or farm cooperatives could produce hydrogen from wood chips and then through a common process , use the nitrogen in the air to produce ammonia or nitric acid .
Both of these are used directly as fertilizer or the ammonia could be used to make ammonium nitrate , sulfate or phosphate .
This research is published in the Nov. 12 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences online .
The researchers have filed for a patent on this work .

前編では、クロージャと、私なりにクロージャと区別している `ブロック ' についての比較を、高階関数にブロックをそのまま渡す様なコードについて試みました。そこではクロージャとブロックに明確な差異はありませんでした。
しかし、手続きを無名関数として定義し、それにシンボルを束縛して利用する様な形態になると様相が変わってきます。名前を付けるからではなく、定義と評価
( 実行 ) の字句的な位置が変わってくる ( 可能性がある ) からです 。
( let ( (y 5 ) ( ar # f ) ( f # f ) ) ( set ! ar ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ) ( set ! f ( let ( (y 2 ) ) ( lambda ( x ) (* x ( set ! y (+ y 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( let ( ) ( map f ar ) ) ) => ( 3 8 15 24 35 )
ここでは、最上位のブロックで f というシンボルを束縛しておき、更にコードブロックに束縛しています。通常は let でそのまま束縛するでしょうが、ここでは説明を判り易くするために、二段階の束縛にしています。
これまでの例示と異なり、このコードでは、コードブロックの定義と評価
( 実行 ) のスコープが異なり、レキシカルスコープとダイナミックスコープの相違が発生することになります。
また、この違いを明確にするため、自由変数 `y ' も、二段階に束縛されています 。( Elisp だと error になってしまうので )
このケースを Elisp で表現してみると 、
( let ( (y 5 ) ( ar nil ) ( f nil ) ) ( setq ar ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ) ( setq f ( let ( (y 2 ) ) ( lambda ( x ) (* x ( setq y (+ y 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( let ( ) ( mapcar f ar ) ) ) => ( 6 14 24 36 50 )
と、遂に Scheme ( Gauche ) と Emacs Lisp の間で結果が異なることになりました。
Elisp の場合で は、f を定義した時点で束縛されている y ではなく、評価の時点で参照可能な、最上位のブロックでの y の束縛が適用されます 。
これがレキシカルスコープとダイナミックスコープの違いということになります。
また、この様な予め手続きを用意しておく様な場合、手続きを返す手続き ( これもまた高階関数ですね ) を用意するのが一般的ではないでしょうか。すると、
( let ( (y 5 ) ( ar # f ) ) ( define ( make - f y ) ( lambda ( x ) (* x ( set ! y (+ y 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( set ! ar ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ) ( let ( ) ( define f ( make -f 2 ) ) ( map f ar ) ) ) => ( 3 8 15 24 35 )
の様になります。これを Elisp に置き換えた場合も 、
( let ( (y 5 ) ( ar nil ) ) ( defun make -f ( y ) ( function ( lambda ( x ) (* x ( setq y (+ y 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( setq ar ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ) ( let ( ) ( fset 'f ( make -f 2 ) ) ( mapcar 'f ar ) ) ) => ( 6 14 24 36 50 )
と、やはり結果は異なる様です。やってることは一つ前に挙げたコードと同じですからね。
ここで、表面的には判別不能ですが、これらのケースに於ける
Elisp の場合、f の評価 ( 実行 ) 時点で は、f を定義、または生成したときの束縛である 「 2 に束縛された y」 は存在すらしていません。存続期間切れですね。( GC によって回収されていなければ空間上に残ってはいるでしょうが、論理的には存在しないのと同じですよね )
このエクステントの違いについても何とか説明を試みたんですが…… 例えば以下の様に。
( let ( ( a1 # f ) ( a2 # f ) ( f # f ) ) ( set ! a 1 ' ( 1 2 3 ) ) ( set ! a 2 ' ( 4 5 ) ) ( let ( ) ( set ! f ( let ( (y 2 ) ) ( lambda ( x ) (* x ( set ! y (+ y 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( cons ( map f a 1 ) ( map f a 2 ) ) ) ) => ( ( 3 8 15 ) 24 35 )
これは、二回に分けた map に、それぞれ f を適用することで、最初の適用時にインクリメントした自由変数 y の内容がそのまま保持され、二回目の map で f を適用するときに保持されている値が引き継がれて評価されていることを示すコードです。
フレームを跨がって状態が保持されており、継続して利用可能であるということですね。
これを Elisp で実装してみると 、
( let ( a1 a 2 y f ) ( setq a 1 ' ( 1 2 3 ) ) ( setq a 2 ' ( 4 5 ) ) ( setq f ( let ( (y 2 ) ) ( lambda ( x ) (* x ( setq y (+ y 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( let ( ) ( cons ( mapcar f a 1 ) ( mapcar f a 2 ) ) ) ) =>
Wrong type argument : number - char - or - marker - p , nil
となって、自由変数 y が nil なために error となります 。
しかし、これはスコープによるものと解釈する方が妥当でしょう。
それならば、と 、
( let ( a1 a2 ( y 5 ) f ) ( setq a 1 ' ( 1 2 3 ) ) ( setq a 2 ' ( 4 5 ) ) ( setq f ( let ( (y 2 ) ) ( lambda ( x ) (* x ( setq y (+ y 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( let ( ) ( cons ( mapcar f a 1 ) ( mapcar f a 2 ) ) ) ) => ( ( 6 14 24 ) 36 50 )
として最上位のブロックで束縛しておき、評価時に
y へのアクセスを可能にしてみると、この自由変数の存続期間内に収まってしまうため、正しく状態が保持される結果となってしまいます。
と言う訳で、エクステントの違いについての説明は、私には無理な様です。
多分、動的スコープな言語では無理なのではないでしょうか。(勝手に結論付けてしまいましたが)
静的スコープで無限エクステント*でない*実装があれば説明できるのではないか、と思うのですが。
とここまで書いて、結局何が判ったかと言いますと、
コードブロックをそのまま高階関数に渡す様なコードの取り回しに於いては、クロージャが使えないと言われる言語環境でも、同じ様に利用することが可能な場合がある。
但し、それはあくまで、静的スコープと動的スコープ、無限エクステントと有限エクステントといった枠組みの違いが表面化しないから可能だというだけのことである。
ということになりましょうか。
ごめんなさい、自信はありません。

Judge : Saudi threats apparently ' rolled over ' British government RAW STORY
Published : Friday February 15 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The British government appeared to have " rolled over " in response to pressure from Saudi Arabia to drop an investigation into alleged bribery in an arms deal with BAE Systems PLC , a High Court judge said Thursday .
Lord Justice Alan Moses made the comments while hearing a challenge brought by two lobby groups to the legality of a Serious Fraud Office decision to stop the investigation in December 2006 .
" Saudi Arabia 's rulers threatened to make it easier for terrorists to attack London unless corruption investigations into their arms deals were halted , according to court documents revealed yesterday , " David Leigh and Rob Evans report for The Guardian .
" Previously secret files describe how investigators were told they faced ' another 7/7 ' and the loss of ' British lives on British streets ' if they pressed on with their inquiries and the Saudis carried out their threat to cut off intelligence . "
The Campaign Against Arms Trade and anti-corruption group Corner House argue the decision to halt the probe was illegal because it was based on tainted advice from then - Prime Minister Tony Blair and his government .
The activists also argue it contravened the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 's anti-bribery convention , disregarded Saudi Arabia 's obligations under international law and was against British law .
Blair took responsibility for the decision to halt the probe , saying the investigation threatened national security interests .
That argument was reiterated on Thursday by the fraud office 's lawyer , Philip Sales , who said the decision was taken by the agency 's director because there was a serious and imminent threat to national security .
Sales said Saudi Arabia threatened to withdraw cooperation on issues crucial to British public safety , including those « in light of the Islamist terrorist threat .
However , the two groups argue the government also put pressure on the fraud office to drop the investigation because BAE faced the loss of a lucrative jet fighter contract .
The activists ' lawyer , Dinah Rose , said the government had not disputed allegations that Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan , the former ambassador to the United States and now head of Saudi Arabia 's National Security Council , told Blair during a meeting in July 2006 to stop the inquiry or BAE would lose a 10 billion pound ( US $ 19.6 billion ) contract to buy Typhoon Eurofighter jets .
Rose said Blair then placed " irresistible pressure " on the fraud office 's director , Robert Wardle , to stop the investigation .
" We submit that the prime minister , with the greatest respect , crossed the line , " she said .
Documents presented to the court also revealed that BAE sent a ' strictly private and confidential ' memo to Britain 's attorney general , Peter Goldsmith , saying the inquiry should be called off because it jeopardized the new contract .
Goldsmith 's office responded by saying it was not appropriate for him to read such a memo .
Lord Justice Alan Moses , one of two judges presiding over the judicial review , repeatedly questioned why no attempt was made to see if the threats could be mitigated , or to explain to those making the threats that the fraud office was independent from the government , before ending the inquiry .
" As far as we know , we have seen nothing that suggests that anybody did anything other than just roll over in the face of that , " he said .
Rose said a greater threat was the perception that Britain would give in to a threat delivered at the right time , in the right manner .
" That could seriously implicate our national security , " she said .
The fraud office was investigating allegations that BAE , one of the world 's largest arms makers , ran a 60 million pound ( US $ 126 million ) slush fund offering sweeteners to officials from Saudi Arabia in return for lucrative contracts as part of the Al - Yamamah arms deal in the 1980s .
Al - Yamamah , meaning ' the dove , ' was the name given to an agreement under which BAE supplied Tornado fighter jets and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia , which paid the British government with oil .
The contract to buy Typhoon Eurofighter jets superseded the Al - Yamamah agreement .
BAE , Britain 's largest defense group , has always said it acted lawfully .
Prince Bandar bin Sultan has also denied that he profited from the deal .
The judicial review , which is expected to last two days , will consider only if the decision was legal , not if it was right or wrong .
If the court finds in favor of the activists , the fraud office can be ordered to reconsider its decision .
It would be able to draw the same conclusion , providing all legal procedures were correctly followed .
The British government sold its majority BAE stake in 1981 when BAE became a public limited company .
An investigation by the U.S. Justice Department is ongoing .
Further excerpts from Guardian article : # Prince Bandar , the head of the Saudi national security council , and son of the crown prince , was alleged in court to be the man behind the threats to hold back information about suicide bombers and terrorists .
He faces accusations that he himself took more than £ 1bn in secret payments from the arms company BAE .
He was accused in yesterday 's high court hearings of flying to London in December 2006 and uttering threats which made the prime minister , Tony Blair , force an end to the Serious Fraud Office investigation into bribery allegations involving Bandar and his family .
The threats halted the fraud inquiry , but triggered an international outcry , with allegations that Britain had broken international anti-bribery treaties .
Lord Justice Moses , hearing the civil case with Mr Justice Sullivan , said the government appeared to have " rolled over " after the threats .
He said one possible view was that it was " just as if a gun had been held to the head " of the government .

Three polar bear cubs at a German zoo were at risk of starvation after being rejected by their mother .
Keepers at the Nuremberg Zoo decided not to intervene and feed the cubs since it would be a manipulation of nature .
The deputy director of the zoo , Helmut Maegdefrau , told the British newspaper The Observer they were " cautiously optimistic " the mother bear would catch on and eventually start caring for her offspring .
" We expect to be branded as being cruel to animals , " he said .
" But the fact is in nature , if something goes wrong , it goes wrong .
If you do n't let the mothers practice , they 'll never learn how to bring up their cubs . "
The zoo has said it was determined not to create a sensation such as the one surrounding Knut , the popular polar bear cub rescued from similar unfortunate circumstances at the zoo in Berlin .

On a sunny afternoon in Baqubah , a convoy of Iraqi troops and U.S. soldiers depart the small base they share on a mission to bring blankets and heating oil to a nearby village .
They drive down an empty road , passing packs of dogs and curbs scarred by weeks of steady roadside bombs .
Suddenly , the team 's humanitarian operation turns deadly as an explosion rips into the lead humvee .
Sgt. Chester Jones and Sgt. Maj .
Eddie Del Valle help rush a critically injured young sergeant to the field hospital .
Jones , a medic , cradles the soldier 's injured head as he vomits , while another helps change bandages soaked through with blood .
It is twilight as troops from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team , 1st Cavalry Division , tow the blasted humvee back to base .
They cover it with a tarp , then get the news that they fear :
The young soldier , Sgt. Jay Gauthreaux , has died from his wounds .
That was just over one year ago .
Today , Del Valle and Jones are back home at Fort Hood , Texas , after their second Iraq deployments .
Like tens of thousands of this war 's veterans , they look back on their time in the country with a complex mixture of pride , frustration , satisfaction , and sadness .
Del Valle recalls , for instance , the emotional task of cleaning out Gauthreaux 's room the morning after the attack , packing up photos of the fallen soldier 's 4 - year - old son .
" He 's the same age as my little daughter , " says Del Valle , " so you put yourself in that situation . "
Jones saw war 's human toll every day while training Iraqi Army medics , but that did n't lessen the shock of losing his good friend .
" I did n't realize it was G until I ran to the truck and pulled his body back , " Jones says .
" With training , you learn to try and push that stuff aside , " he adds , " but it 's tough . "
Just as wars leave a lasting mark on soldiers , they tend to change the culture of the armies that fight them .
As the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq approaches , American troops are reflecting on their experiences even as they await how their mission will be judged .
So , too , the institution of the military is wrestling over its own narrative for this war , assessing how well America and its commanders have used one of the most powerful tools available to any nation .
The lessons it takes away from the experience of its soldiers and marines will influence how it adapts and organizes itself — and how it cares for those sent to do the nation 's fighting .
What is immediately clear is that this conflict has put enormous demands on American troops .
They are warriors on some days , diplomats on others , in a conflict with no clear front lines and a changing cast of adversaries .
And while they are grateful that the American public has steadfastly supported them , regardless of feelings about the war itself , many soldiers report a sense of disconnection , too .
America as a nation is not waging this war , many tell you —its military is .
Recent security gains in Iraq , particularly the sharp declines in combat deaths , have come as a welcome development .
But there remains a heavy burden on America 's fighting men and women .
Commanders express grave concerns for troops shouldering wars on two fronts with no end in sight , particularly the half million who have served more than one combat tour since 2002 .
Soldiers in Iraq , who have seen the duration of their deployments extended as a result of an inadequate post - invasion plan , work seven days a week for 15 months straight , minus two weeks for a trip home to visit family .
And they do it all , they joke , without beer ( American troops today are forbidden to drink while at war ) .
More than 60,000 troops have been subjected to controversial stop - loss measures — meaning those who have completed service commitments are forbidden to leave the military until their units return from war .
Sacrifice .
The news that their yearlong tour was lengthened by three months hit the team hard , says Del Valle .
" That was the worst .
It 's like when you 're real thirsty , and you 're about to reach for the bottle — and somebody pulls it far away from you . "
Midway through medic Jones 's tour , his wife called to ask for a divorce .
" I 'm not mad at her , because I can't blame her , " he says .
" She was tired of being alone . "
Jones has been deployed to Iraq two of the past five years , which has left him little time to see his children , now ages 4 and 2 , grow up .
The sacrifices are great , and sometimes soldiers wonder why they keep making them .
On the night that Gauthreaux died , Del Valle and Capt .
Christopher
Whitten , the gunner that day , talked about their career choice over a game of chess at a small shop on their base as the Iraqi owner served them tea and warm bread .
They express a brief moment of doubt about the extent to which what they do is really understood by most Americans .
" You get in a humvee every day because that 's the job that is feeding your family .
I also believe in what we 're doing here , " says Del Valle .
" Our soldiers here are giving 100 percent for every American guy back in the States . "
Whitten nods , adding , " It makes you wonder , does anybody really appreciate what that guy gave up today ? "
It is not an uncommon question in this combat zone .
Historians will tell you that wars throughout the ages , whatever their outcome , tend to wreck armies and wear out soldiers .
Troops hasten to add that the belief that they are making a difference in their jobs helps mitigate the immense strain of being a soldier today .
" I would argue that you have n't seen an army like this since the demise of the Roman legion — such a small number of forces able to influence the world , " says Clinton Ancker III , a retired Army colonel and director of the Combined Arms Doctrine Directorate .
When the 3rd Brigade Combat Team arrived in Baqubah , there was widespread corruption and heartbreaking violence against civilians .
During the tour of Del Valle , Whitten , and Jones 's brigade , they drove out terrorists and saw some life return to the markets , children to soccer fields .
It is the sort of impact that makes a military career attractive , they say .
But the desire to make a difference can lead to even greater frustration when troops return after previous tours in Iraq to find what they consider to be little change or even backsliding during a counterinsurgency campaign in which the very definition of victory is still a lively topic of debate .
That frustration can be compounded , too .
Ancker argues that soldiers are under " a lot more stress " now than they were in Vietnam .
" The atmosphere is more physically demanding .
And in Vietnam , we were guaranteed at least a year between deployments , " he says .
When soldiers are injured — physically and psychologically — they are at the mercy of a deeply overburdened system that they cannot always count on to take care of them .
Camaraderie .
The military has drawn lessons from past wars , notably Vietnam , reorganizing the Army into brigade combat teams in part to encourage unit cohesion and camaraderie .
This has promoted the sort of psychological bonding that gives troops a sense of support in the face of the enormous demands , says Jeffrey LaFace , the division chief of the Army 's Combined Armed Center .
That camaraderie is clear on forward operating bases throughout Baghdad , where troops organize flag football matches and barbecues and decompress in coffee shops and Internet cafes with fellow soldiers and marines who have become close friends over the years .
" Soldiers go in as units , with the same group of guys that they have known since they were privates in Kosovo and Bosnia , " says LaFace .
These " adopted families , " he adds , help to stem " some of the weirdness that we had coming out of Vietnam . "
That weirdness included soldiers who shot officers when they did n't want to do a mission and riots in U.S. military prisons overcrowded with deserters .
It is another notable legacy of the troubled Vietnam - era Army that many of today 's volunteer soldiers have little desire to see the nation return to the draft .
" It 's the only thing that would make me get out of the Army , " says Capt .
Scott Hubbard , who recently returned from a tour in Iraq .
The last thing you want to do , he adds , is fight next to someone who does n't want to be next to you .
Despite the strains , the retention rate for troops in Iraq remains high , commanders point out .
Their concern , though , is whether it will stay that way .
" The entire Army leadership — and rightfully — we get a little nervous , " says Peter Chiarelli , the military assistant to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and until 2006 the widely admired No. 2 commander in Iraq .
" All of us are extremely concerned that we could cross a line without even knowing it . "
Some commanders in Iraq worry that they are flirting with those lines now as demands on soldiers show little sign of letting up .
There is growing evidence that post - traumatic stress is taking a toll :
The number of troops who tried to commit suicide or injure themselves increased from 350 in 2002 to 2,100 last year .
So , too , can the simple fear and fatigue that accompany daily patrols .
One active duty commander recalls a unit that had gone months without a serious casualty , only to have a soldier hit by a sniper weeks before the unit was scheduled to head home .
The commander was approached by an officer carrying a spreadsheet that charted out the number of times company commanders had gone out on patrol or operations over a two - week period .
" I had cases where I had officers who by their job nature should be going out all the time , who'd only gone out two or three times , " he says .
" It was probably related directly to losing soldiers , personal fear , and the fact that you 're only a month or two out from going home , " he continues .
" I asked them , ' Have you considered the effect this has had on your soldiers ? '
I remember what a leadership challenge it was , and I imagine that a lot of similar things are occurring in other battalions . "
Changes , challenges .
Today , troops discuss such leadership challenges at countless outposts in Iraq and at the premier centers of military learning .
These chats are not always pretty .
Some note , for example , that Congress has fewer military veterans than in the past and , perhaps as a result , shows too much deference to the military leaders who testify on Capitol Hill .
" Congress does n't ask the tough questions they should be asking , because they 're afraid that they 're going to be accused of not supporting the troops , " says one captain on patrol in East Baghdad .
His buddy agrees .
" Debates in Congress do n't hurt our feelings .
That 's what we 're here for , freedom of speech . "
There is little doubt within the military itself , particularly among more junior officers , that this freedom of speech includes a growing willingness to question the decisions of commanders leading the war .
That is driven in large part by the experience they are getting in the field :
In today 's military , the average captain has spent more time in combat than most World War II veterans — and more than some senior officers now in the military .
Indeed , military leaders acknowledge this change .
" We 've got to listen to the young folks — they have lived this conflict in a different way — and make sure their lessons are incorporated into this Army , " Chiarelli says .
" In order to do that , you 've got to be willing to accept a dialogue in which many of the things that old guys like me thought are challenged . "
Those challenges include new ways of thinking about how decisions are made .
The Army has recently launched its own " Red Team University " to train officers to be , in essence , the opposite of yes men .
Graduates of this program are then placed in brigades to question the assumptions behind decisions in hopes of averting tactical and strategic missteps .
And though many argue that soldiers ' grumbling about their commanders ' decision is a tradition as old as the Army itself , Richard Kohn , a war historian at the University of North Carolina , believes one thing is clear : " I think that coming out of the war , you 're going to have a much more candid military . "
Informed support .
That candor , too , must include presenting a realistic picture of the war effort to the American public , say the students at Fort Leavenworth , Kan .
Not doing so in advance of the Iraq war was a mistake , they add — one that should not be repeated .
" We should now consider whether we can ever successfully go to war for an extended period of time without the informed support of the American people , " writes Chiarelli in a recent article for the journal Military Review .
But garnering that informed consent presents a dilemma :
How does a military defined by its can - do culture paint a more realistic portrait of war ?
It might begin , troops say , with managing expectations — of the American people and of the soldiers themselves .
" We expected to come in and throw another 3 - pointer and everyone stand up and cheer , " says Hubbard .
" There was a lot of emotion , a lot of rhetoric , all the country music songs getting everybody fired up , " he adds .
" I think a lot of folks screaming for war — on both sides , political , civilians , military — just do n't understand what it takes . "
And that remains a cause of concern for troops today .
Maj .
Kareem Montague , an Iraq veteran and Harvard graduate , wonders too about the war 's impact on a country in which only a small slice of its citizens are serving in the military , and how it may affect the civil - military relationship .
" It 's not that it 's unhealthy , but it 's becoming more and more separate , " observes Montague , now a master 's student in the prestigious School of Advanced Military Studies at the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth .
" If you have fewer and fewer people who have served , you have to worry about whether you can have an intelligent conversation about how the military can best serve the country . "
Ask soldiers here why they signed up , and many will say for duty , an instinctive feeling they have that you cannot be a citizen without doing this .
Many others say the money is a big incentive — specifically , money for an education that they could n't otherwise afford .
" I did it for college , and because I had nowhere else to go , " says one Baghdad - based soldier .
Another confides that he sometimes feels like a mercenary and a " walking advertisement for one of Cheney 's defense companies — like they just want us to be on TV all geared up in products . "
The conversation leads another soldier to privately comment later that , " The burden of this war falls disproportionately on the poor . "
Faye Crawford , the mother of Sergeant Gauthreaux , wrestles with that point .
She is now raising her son's 4 - year - old son —he was a single father — and she says that sometimes in her darkest moments she has blamed herself for not having enough money to send her son to college .
" If I could have sent him to college ... " she begins , and her voice trails off as she chokes back tears .
She knows , too , that her son loved what he did , and he believed that he was helping people in Iraq .
" He would say , ' Mama , you should see their faces .
They 're so grateful . ' "
But Crawford wrestles with her son's sacrifice as the war fades from the front pages .
" You hear that the economy is more important in the election than the war is , " she says .
" Sometimes I worry that people are already forgetting . "
Strains .
The evening that the team learned Gauthreaux had died , Del Valle contemplated getting out of the Army , imagining what his own death would do to his wife and daughter .
Now home at Fort Hood since December , Del Valle , a native of Puerto Rico , has been promoted to the rank of command sergeant major .
During his time in Iraq , he helped his own soldiers through some rough times and grew close to his Iraqi Army counterpart .
Today , Del Valle is prepared to deploy again .
" I think it would be kind of selfish for me to walk away from the Army now , " he says .
The family strains on U.S. soldiers are immense , but Jones says troops are also helping another country rebuild itself and its families as well .
" That matters a lot , " he says .
" I went over and trained a medical platoon .
Those guys are really proficient now , and I 'm proud about that , " adds Jones , whose next assignment will be as a recruiter .
SAN FRANCISCO 
Yahoo is planning to lay off hundreds of employees in an effort to increase its profitability , prop up its deflated stock price and narrow the focus of its sprawling Internet portal to a smaller number of crucial areas , people close to the company said Monday .
The final number of layoffs from Yahoo ’s work force of about 14,000 is yet to be determined and is likely to be announced around the end of the month , perhaps during Yahoo ’s conference call on Jan. 29 with analysts after it reports fourth - quarter results , these people said .
Company executives are still trying to determine exactly which areas will be cut .
One person close to the discussions said a final plan , or perhaps a few alternative plans , would be submitted to the board at a coming meeting .
The plan ’s final shape may be influenced by the company ’s fourth - quarter performance , this person said .
Yahoo declined to comment specifically on any plan for layoffs .
In an e-mail statement , a company spokeswoman , Diana Wong , said : “ Yahoo plans to invest in some areas , reduce emphasis in others , and eliminate some areas of the business that do n’t support the company ’s priorities .
Yahoo continues to attract and hire talent against the company ’s key initiatives to create long - term stockholder value . ”
Discourse.net :
A number of the best internet commentators are discussing today 's news that a few of the leading Congressional Democrats may have been - probably were - briefed about the administration 's plans to torture ( waterboard , and maybe more ) suspected terrorists being held in secret CIA facilities abroad .
There 's confusion about the facts , with few of the people allegedly briefed confirming the story .
Notably , however , it appears that of those briefed , only Rep. Jane Harman objected .
( Note that we 're still at an early spin stage here - more facts about who said what to whom are likely to come out . )
The emerging consensus in the blogosphere seems to be that even if they had the presence of mind to object , the Representatives and Senators who were briefed were in a bind : as members of the Intelligence Committees or the leadership , they signed various secrecy pledges which stopped them from going public .
To go public , it seems to be agreed , was to " jeopardize their careers and risk jail " as Kevin Drum put it ; even so , Matthew Yglesias suggests that this called for civil disobedience , and that the representatives should have dared the administration to arrest them .
All this misses a critical aspect of our constitutional structure .
Thanks to the Speech and Debate Clause there was a way for any Senator or Representative who wanted to blow the whistle to do so in a way that involved no risk of jail or fines - at worst they might have lost their security clearances ( and even there the law is a little murky ) .

South Africa has come face to face with its apartheid past when a " shocking " video emerged of white university students force - feeding and racially humiliating five poor black cleaners .
The four students are heard referring to the old " Boer " college way of life during the footage , which saw the elderly workers being made to drink bottles of beer , run races , play rugby and then kneel and eat meat which had been urinated upon .
News of the video yesterday sparked rioting at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein , once the Afrikaans heartland of the Orange Free State .

One of the white students can be seen urinating on the food in images from the video
The black cleaners are then forced to kneel on the floor and eat the food
The humiliating video represents what the white students think about integration , according to the narrator
Police arrested scores of black and white demonstrators as university vice chancellor Frederick Fourie fought desperately to calm tensions as tutorials were cancelled .
He said the video was made last September , since when two of the students had left .
The remaining two had been suspended and the police called in to investigate .
" I am deeply saddened that students apparently see nothing wrong in producing such an offensive and degrading video , " he said .
" I have publicly said several times that the UFS is not a place for racism .
" It 's a gross violation of the human dignity of the workers involved .
We have immediately started with a most urgent investigation on this matter . "
The video is thought to have been made in response to the university 's integration policy on student accommodation .
Up until the end of the last student year in December , the 3,000 students on campus lived separately .

The cleaners were humiliated on camera
Attempts to change that this academic year led to riots last week with students complaining they had not been consulted .
The video was made in a male - only digs which are still all - white but that is due to change under the new policy .
The narration on the video starts : " Once upon a time the ' Boer ' lived peacefully here on Reitz Island ( the name of the student hostel ) , until one day when the less - advantaged discovered the word ' integration ' in the dictionary . "
The amateur footage shows garlic being put into a dish full of meat which looks like dog food .
The narrator is heard saying : " We know they 're less privileged so we 're adding a bit of meat . "
Another student puts the bowl on the toilet and urinates into the mixture .
The concoction is then handed out in plastic glasses to the cleaners .
All five – four women and a man - spit out the first mouthful , but try to finish it amid loud encouragement from the students .
The video ends with the words : " That , at the end of the day , is what we think of integration . "
The footage then shows one of the students asking a cleaner : " What does ' sefebe ' mean in Afrikaans ? "
She replies : " a black whore " .

The horrifying video sparked riots at the university today
It is unclear how the footage was released or how long it had been circulating at the university .
The video was last night widely condemned .
The SA Students Congress said : " The barbaric behaviour of the Afrikaaner students in that university still resembles the old apartheid order . "
Liana Van Wyk , a spokeswoman for the opposition Democratic Alliance , said it was " shocking and inhumane " .
She added : " It looked like they were willing [ participants ] but they did n't know what purpose the video served ... it was quite humiliating at the end to see the quite senior ladies on their knees eating the meat . "
“ They were slapping him and punching him , ” he said .
“ This is the way people react toward someone accused of witchcraft .
There are lots of such cases . ”
Mr. Bulio is right .
In parts of Angola , Congo and the Congo Republic , a surprising number of children are accused of being witches , and then are beaten , abused or abandoned .
Child advocates estimate that thousands of children living in the streets of Kinshasa , Congo ’s capital , have been accused of witchcraft and cast out by their families , often as a rationale for not having to feed or care for them .
The officials in one northern Angolan town identified 432 street children who had been abandoned or abused after being called witches .
A report last year by the government ’s National Institute for the Child and the United Nations Children ’s Fund described the number of children said to be witches as “ massive . ”
The notion of child witches is not new here .
It is a common belief in Angola ’s dominant Bantu culture that witches can communicate with the world of the dead and usurp or “ eat ” the life force of others , bringing their victims misfortune , illness and death .
Adult witches are said to bewitch children by giving them food , then forcing them to reciprocate by sacrificing a family member .
But officials attribute the surge in persecutions of children to war — 27 years in Angola , ending in 2002 , and near constant strife in Congo .
The conflicts orphaned many children , while leaving other families intact but too destitute to feed themselves .
( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton has lost a large amount of support among African - Americans , with a majority of black Democrats now supporting Sen. Barack Obama , according to a new poll out Friday .
Sen . Barack Obama has the support of a majority of black Democrats , a poll found .
In a national survey by CNN / Opinion Research Corp. , 59 percent of black Democrats backed Obama , an Illinois Democrat , for their party 's presidential nomination , with 31 percent supporting Clinton , the senator from New York .
The 28 point lead for Obama is a major reversal from October , when Clinton held a 24 point lead among black Democrats .
" There 's been a huge shift among African - American Democrats from Clinton to Obama .
African - American Democrats used to be reluctant to support Obama because they did n't think a black man could be elected .
Then Obama won Iowa and nearly won New Hampshire .
Now they believe , " said Bill Schneider , CNN senior political analyst .
" Obama 's lead over Clinton among black men is more than 50 points , and among black women , once a Clinton stronghold , Obama has an 11 point advantage , " said CNN polling director Keating Holland .
It also appears the recent bickering between Clinton and Obama and their campaigns over race has hurt both candidates .
Clinton has the support of 42 percent of all registered Democrats in the new survey , down seven points from last week 's CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll .
Obama has the backing of 33 percent of those questioned , down three percentage points in a week .
The beneficiary appears to be former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina , who jumped 5 points , to 17 percent .
" Why have Clinton and Obama both lost support over the past week ?
One word : squabbling .
If two candidates get into a fight , the third candidate usually gains .
Sure enough , John Edwards gained , " Schneider said .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio is at 3 percent in the new poll , with former Sen. Mike Gravel of Alaska with support of less than 0.5 percent .
In the battle for the Republican presidential nomination , the survey suggests Sen .
John McCain remains the front - runner , but his support among registered Republicans has dropped 5 points since last week 's survey , which was taken immediately after the senator from Arizona won the New Hampshire primary .
McCain is at 29 percent , with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 20 percent and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney at 19 percent , up five points from last week .
Romney won Tuesday 's Michigan primary .
" There was a Michigan bounce , " Schneider said .
" But McCain still leads .
Conservatives , however , are divided between McCain at 26 percent , Huckabee at 24 percent and Romney at 20 percent .
Saturday 's South Carolina GOP primary should tell us if there 's going to be a conservative favorite in this race . "
About half the interviews for the new poll were taken before the Michigan primary results were known .
The poll indicates Huckabee may be hurt by perceptions about his leadership abilities .
" Nearly half of registered Republicans say he does not have the leadership skills and vision a president should have .
Romney and McCain score much better on this measure , " Holland said .
Rudy Giuliani is at 14 percent in the new survey .
That 's a drop of four points from last week 's poll for the former New York mayor .
" Giuliani 's support is half of what it was in November , when he last led in the national polls .
Giuliani has a problem on issues .
Forty - five percent of registered Republicans say they disagree with him on issues that matter to them .
McCain ranks highest among registered Republicans on both measures , " Holland said .
Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee has the backing of 9 percent of registered Republicans in the survey , with Rep. Ron Paul of Texas at 6 percent and Rep. Duncan Hunter of California at 1 percent .
Looking ahead to the general election , the GOP has several matters to address .
The poll indicates Democrats are much more enthusiastic than Republicans about voting so far this year .
" If that pattern persists , turnout may be a concern for the GOP in November , " Holland said .
When all voters nationwide are asked to evaluate the major candidates in both parties , only one Republican candidate , McCain , fares well on issues and personal qualities .
Most registered voters say Clinton and Obama -- as well as McCain -- have the necessary leadership skills and vision to be president .
But most voters do n't feel that way about Romney , Giuliani and Huckabee .
The same is true on issues .
A majority of registered voters nationwide say McCain , Obama and Clinton agree with them on issues that matter , but a majority of voters disagree with Romney , Giuliani and Huckabee on important issues .
The economy continues to top the list of the public 's biggest concerns , with Iraq , terrorism and health care not far behind .
Four in 10 Americans now say the economy is in good shape , down 6 points since December and 14 points since the fall .
Nearly six in 10 , 59 percent , say the economy is in poor shape .
Regarding Iraq , the number of Americans who say things are going well for the U.S. has jumped 12 points since November , to 46 percent .
Support for the war has grown 3 points in the same time .
The poll involved interviews with 1,393 adult Americans , including 448 registered voters who describe themselves as Democrats and 377 registered voters who describe themselves as Republicans .
They were interviewed from January 14 - 17 .
The poll 's sampling error is plus - or - minus 5 percentage points for the Republican respondents , 4.5 percentage points for the Democratic respondents , and 8 percentage points for the African - American Democrat respondents .

In this article , he borrows from his " Listening to the ' Inarticulate ' : William Widger 's Dream and the Loyalties of American Revolutionary Seamen in British Prisons , " Journal of Social History , III ( Fall 1969 ) , 1 - 29 .
The rules of war are laid down by militarily strong nations .
These nations define their modes of making war as legal ( although they do not always abide by their own rules ) , while criminalizing alternate modes of warfare rising from the limited strength of the militarily weak .
During the American Revolution , the U.S. was militarily weak .
It compensated for that weakness at sea by engaging in a very effective form of legalized piracy called privateering .
Privateers were denounced by the British in ways that resonate with the denunciation of terrorists that we hear these days .
When these Americans were captured by the British , they were not recognized as legitimate prisoners of war but were rather held in special camps , with reason to expect they would be hanged .
After the Revolution , the U.S. , as a small - navy nation , continued to cling to this mode of warfare , and refused to abide by international bans of privateering until it became a large - navy power and finally rejected privateering .
By the time of the Revolution ( 1776 -- 1783 ) , privateering had become an old American institution and industry , which lured the young to sea with seductive promises of a share of the booty .
Although privateers were private vessels , they were armed and governmentally licensed , with " Letters of Marque . "
( In the Revolutionary era , Congress authorized privateering in March 1776 ; and Article I , section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power " To declare War , grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal , and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water . " )
Heroic tales of John Paul Jones aside , there was not much of a U.S .
Navy during the Revolution .
The U.S. forces at sea were primarily privateers , preying on British commerce .
They were extremely effective in capturing British merchant ships , cutting off British supplies and raising insurance rates for shipping .
Although they did not constitute a US Navy , American privateers were a significant presence at sea , and played an important role in the success of the Revolution .
When privateersmen were captured , they were not recognized as prisoners of war , since they were civilians , and civilians of rebellious colonies to boot .
They were held indefinitely in special camps , in particular the notorious prison ship Jersey , in the Wallabout Bay off Brooklyn , and in Mill and Forton Prisons in England .
These were places of bad food , overcrowding , bad health , brutal guards and harsh punishment .
( A British Peer , friendly to the American prisoners , responded to the statement that Mill was run by a" dirty fellow " : " Government keeps dirty fellows , to do their dirty Work . " )
During the Revolution , these three complexes held upwards of ten thousand and perhaps as many as twenty or thirty thousand captured American seamen .
The Americans were not granted the recognition of prisoner - of - war status , but were rather deemed rebels , pirates , murderers , candidates for hanging , detained under a suspension of habeas corpus and ineligible for exchange during most of the war .
Prisoners taken into Mill were told that they were committed " for rebellion , piracy , and high treason on his Britannic Majesty 's high seas , there to remain during his Majesty 's pleasure , until he sees fit to pardon or otherwise dispose of you . "
Americans used what the British defined as illegitimate means in their quest for legitimacy and independence .
Today 's detentions by the U.S. are very similar to what was done to Americans by the British during the Revolution .
At the end of the War for Independence , Benjamin Franklin -- who had done his best to help captured Americans in British prisons -- attempted unsuccessfully to write into the Peace Treaty an article banning privateering in future wars .
Although American privateers had been effective , Franklin had admirable and prescient Enlightenment feelings about the involvement of civilians in wars .
But Franklin 's idealism got noplace .
And , so long as the U.S. remained a small - navy nation , it continued to rely on this method of warfare , in the War of 1812 ( with Jefferson 's endorsement ) and beyond .
As late as 1856 , the U.S. refused to abide by an international treaty banning privateering , stating that , as a small - navy nation , it needed privateers .
In the Civil War , Congress authorized the president to commission privateers , and the Confederacy made use of privateers .
( Today , there are calls for revival from a few ultra - free - marketers and , from the Nixon Center , as a weapon against terrorism . )
Today 's disputes around indefinite detention and the use of terror against civilians should take note of the fact that American civilians were victims of this kind of detention during the Revolution , and the U.S. was born in what was seen at the time by its more powerful adversary as a form of terrorism .
Although we are rightly revolted by suicide bombing and other attacks on civilians , this is clearly a method that helps weak powers do battle with stronger powers , partly correcting the military imbalance -- as did privateering .
And our country has an extraordinary and continuing record of killing civilians in warfare .
Among the powers of the strong is the power to deem such killings by themselves to be legal and proper , while killings by the weak are deemed improper .

Wait just one minute here .... it is a huge mistake to jump to 9/11 as the single flavor of terrorism at play , and I do n't think this original article made that connection .
Certainly no one disputes that Al Quaida 's 9/11 and similar attacks around the world are unjustifiable , and I can understand outrage as the response to drawing parallels between some of the activities of American colonists in this regard .
But that assumes that all the people that are currently being labeled as " terrorists " by us are one united ideological group .
Clearly , they are not .
Just look at the various factions at work in Iraq if you need confirmation of this .
That is not to defend the actions of all of these people , or to even say I or anyone else on this discussion board is positioned to sort one kind from another .
But it is dangerously simplistic to just dismiss all of the opposition to our actions , particularly in Iraq , as somehow equivalent to 9/11 .
For example , please do n't forget that while there is a very nice laudable new draft constitution in place in Iraq right now , there are also something on the order of 100 " Orders " that Paul Bremer passed before the transition .
For example , Order 39 allows foreign companies to own 100 percent of Iraqi assets outside of the natural - resource sector ( which is most of Iraq 's manufacturing industries , banking industries , basically everything that is n't oil ) and any investors can take 100 percent of the profits they make in Iraq out of the country .
They are not required to reinvest one penny , and they are also not taxed on those profits whatsoever .
Under the same order , they can sign leases and contracts lasting up to 40 years .
While the subsequent Iraqi government can overturn this order , they cannot do so easily or quickly , and in the event they do , the investors are entitled to sue the government for the value of the balance of the contracts .
This certainly does n't square with UN Security Council Resolution 1483 passed May 2003 , which while recognizing the US and Britian as Iraq 's " legitimite occupiers " and thereby empowering Bremer to enact laws as Iraq 's administrator without Iraqi representation , it also still requires that both the US and Britian " comply fully with their obligations under international law including in particular the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Hague Regulations of 1907 . ”
These laws were created to prevent occupying powers from economically stripping the nations they administer , and provides explicitly that occupiers do not own the various assets of a country such that they can authorize the sale of those assets to third parties .
Neverthless , Order 39 was passed , and while we may not hear much about it in this country , the economic effect of this order most assuredly is not lost on the average Iraqi .
This , among other far reaching Orders Bremer enacted , was one of the main points of contention Ayatollah Ali al Sistani , as one example , vehemently opposed and threatened to refuse to acknowledge the provisional government , the constitution , or any of Bremer 's orders as a result .
In light of the fact that the rules of law currently in effect in Iraq make it extremely difficult if not impossible for Iraqis to rebuild and have ownership in their own infrastructure , instead providing unprecedented sweetheart business incentives to foreign investors only , I do n't think it is so difficult to understand why foreign businessmen from a broad spectrum of nations have become the targets of choice for horrific acts of violence .
In light of Order 39 , the rather logical response of the oppressed is , heck , if the occupiers are going to hold a fire sale of all our stuff , maybe we 'll just make it too damn scary to show up to the cash register .
Given the oppressive nature of the economic circumstances , what should we really expect ?
Why , if we really want to see Iraqis live autonomous , free lives in a democracy , would we go to extraordinary lengths to cut them out of the ownership aspect of their own assets , while making the same extraordinarily attractive to foreigners ?
When the British forced the colonists to buy British goods when other countries offered the same products at lower prices , in order to help keep companies like the East India Company from going under , our ancesters said , take your tea and stick it !
and we dumped it in Boston Harbor , among many demonstrations of our unwillingness to submit to these unfair , oppressively imposed economic measures .
Yet , now we find ourselves in the role of King George wondering why those darn stubborn Iraqis do n't just tow the line like we tell them to .
Terrorism is the one effective tool left to the militarily weak when confronted by what they perceive to be intolerable circumstances perpetrated by the militarily strong .
You do n't have to like it any more than I do , but the parallels between things our forefathers have resorted to under similar circumstances are really not that different .
The acts themselves are more violent today , but we by and large live in a more violent world ; I doubt seriously if our American Revolution was fought today , that we would be satisfied in expressing our outrage with the British by simply dumping tea in Boston harbor for example .
I 'm not defending these people -- but I am saying , it is a dangerously simplistic mistake to paint all of these people with the same 9/11 brush , particularly when our own history with regard to resorting to things considered " outrageous " and being " acts of terrorism " is not all that dissimilar .
With every act of defiance from the colonists , King George ( ha , his name was George too ) got angrier and angrier , and attempted to clamp down even harder -- and look where that strategy got them .

If you thick it bias to allow the content to be mostly anti-american then i guess you agree that the western media is bias in the opposite direction .

I introduce to you all your average college student .
Thank you , sir , for such a vivid display of intelligence , sincerely .
In no way have you just aided in the furthering of a stereotype , one that paints us as gibbering idiots who 'll do anything for attention .
Indeed , let it be known that none of us actually give a damn about furthering our education .
We 're all just in it for that piece of paper that 'll help us compete in the job market .
Your sense of humor is impressive .
You DO know that non sequitur humor became old a long time ago , yes ?
Same goes for poo and fart jokes .
Have fun with your drinking games , buddy .

I would like to say right off the bat that I am reading this article for a history class , and that would explain the immature and grossly misspelled messages that are above .
I do want to say , that the right - wing pseudo intellectuals become enraged by anything that smells slightly of anti-American sentiment , and even things that do n't .
The author of this article is simply comparing the means by which these revolutions took place .
One had a morally sound reason ; the other has a religious radical motivation .
These are two completely different motivations .
This article is not treason , nor is it anti-American , rather it is a logical analysis of history .
What this assignment has taught me , if nothing else , is that I do not know who to trust , when looking back on history .
How can I be sure that I am being told the truth ?
Brooks Bockelman - 10/8/2003
This response is toward all the readers out there who have no idea what they are talking about .
Obviously , many of you have never herd of heroification .
Heroification is where our , the United States , textbooks use a degenerative process to make people over to be heroes .
Basically the educational media fail to teach the truth , in an effort to clear any blemishes from our past .
Our country does n't want to admit that we have done many things that we would look down upon .
Many of the people that respond to this article are very naive in that they seem to think that our country does no wrong .
Well , they are wrong and they need to know that our country has plundered , stolen , and even killed many innocient civilians .
Plus they need to stop putting down Jessie Lemisch , he is by no means an anti-American .
He just understands how the rules of military tactics work , and that there is always an imbalance in military powers .
And he is also right in that privateering , and other forms of terrorism , is just a method for the " underdog , " to balance out the tower .
Do n't get me wrong , I by no means believe we deserved the 9/11 attacks , but people who read this article need to understand the point of the article , and not focus on the relationship to the 9/11 attacks .

They did however rape Vietnamese women and children , killed the innocent and massacred in the name of " freedom . "
Not just in Vietnam but to list the countries affected by American terrorism would take too long .
Do n't get me wrong , innocent people of 9/11 did not deserve what they got .
But the American government 's arrogance , ignorance and disregard for nations that do not uphold American interest will all but assure these acts will be repeated .
Jessie Nguyen - 3/25/2003
You are naive and misinformed .
In your eyes , your military fights with honour and only against those who are able to retaliate .
Millions across the globe KNOW otherwise .
Amerian Terrorism is prevalent but not acknowledged by its citizens because they 're brainwashed .
Do n't take this as a personal attack .
Instead take the opportunity to research the atrocities and crimes committed by troops in Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , El Salvador , Cambodia ... many countries have suffered at the hands of the US Army .
To strengthen your support for your government , it is necessary to examine the validity of claims made against it .
This will help you understand more and beyond what is taught at these fine educational institutions .

Benjamin Raty - 10/6/2002
I see your points , and thank you for addressing mine .
I suppose I was speaking in a more general sense ; I was n't addressing this article about the colonists privateering , nor was I expressing confusion over Al Qaeda 's stated goals and plans .
What I was referring to , more specifically , is that in our desire to defend ourselves , I worry that we may be overlooking our own contributions to this crisis .
No , I am not saying we should curl up in a ball and allow our enemies to cruelly destroy and kill us , nor should we assume responsibility for the crimes committed by them last Fall , or at any other time .
Instead , I am suggesting that , when the smoke clears , perhaps we should take a good hard look at ourselves to be certain we 're doing everything we can to be as blameless as possible in the way we conduct ourselves throughout the world .
Perhaps we should begin examining ourselves now , and do so through the lense of history .
If there were no moral obligations on anyone 's part , then this argument comes down to a question of strategy and tactics - how do We defeat Them ?
Naturally in such a setting questions about our involvement in the events leading up to a conflict would be irrelevant .
However , if our nation really was founded upon principles , then principles should be the primary guiding force in our policies ( foreign and domestic ) .
I do n't believe that revenge , arrogance , and a myopic view of our own importance is of much help .
Nit -picking for the sake of nit- picking is absurd and cowardly , but examining our weaknesses with the intent to strengthen ourselves and make improvements can be of much value , if the chorus of voices against such efforts do not drown them out completely .
I 'm not very succinct , for which I apologize .
What I 'm ultimately trying to say is , just because
They committed a terrible crime against
Us does not then mean , ex post facto , that we 're spotless ourselves .
Al Qaeda 's lack of morality does not somehow eradicate our own errors , and if we honestly look at our past behavior , we 've certainly helped to fuel many of the fires that are now burning bright against us .
Regardless of our mistakes , people such as Osama bin Laden are free to choose how they will respond , and they alone are responsible for the choices they make .
Examining our mistakes now at the expense of protecting ourselves would be folly .
Instead , let us defend ourselves , eradicate the threats against us ( Al Qaeda , et al ) and carefully monitor our policies and principles in the future so that we do n't create another Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein ( whom we initially " cultivated " as assets against other failed projects of ours , such as Iran ) .
We may be quite content and happy with our society and our technological , military , and economic prowess , and why not ?
However , to allow this contentment to develop into arrogance toward the rest of the world is foolish .
The United States is great for the intangibles it represents , not the material wealth it has accumulated .
Jake Scott - 9/30/2002
I do n’t believe that the majority would agree with his statements on terrorism simply because they misinterpret what he ’s really trying to say .
I do n’t think that Lemisch is trying to justify terrorism today through our nation ’s use of it long ago ; he ’s simply trying to explain the practice of terrorism and the repetitious cycle of how it has appeared and the manner it has been dealt with throughout history .
It has hit home to me now that there are masses of closed - minded people living in our world today just through reading a few responses to Lemisch ’s writing .
In one of these posted messages , William D. Brewer , a “ well - educated and logical ” man states “ by churning out self - hating , specious trash like this , you demean yourself ” .
He also says “ I am aware of my country ’s failings , past and present .
But I love it nonetheless , and I find no reason to manufacture reasons to hate it ” .
Sadly , I believe that this man ’s view embodies the negative ideals that this essay is primarily written about ; if our nation ’s history is n’t totally positive , righteous , and full of reason , we should totally wipe it from the history books and from any mention of it whatsoever .
America , past and present , is full of virtues and vices .
God help William D. Brewer and the masses like him if they ever have to think about a debatable point in history ever again .
It may be hard for us to link our country ’s acts with some sort of terrorism in the American Revolution , but is n’t asking the question “ why ? ” what education is all about ?
Eat that , William D. Brewer .
Josh Lawrence - 9/15/2002
Perhaps it may also occur eventually -- and hopefully - - to Professor Lemisch that the American " Revolutionaries " were not , as popularily described , revolutionaries ; they wanted things to stay as they had been for the near two centuries that there had been British colonies .
The colonies each had a legislature that was often quite comparible to the legislature put into effect after they won their revulotion .
The " terrorists of the 18th century " were protecting an invasion of a tyrranny in which their main qualm with was Britain 's refusal of acknowledging the colonial legislatures .
I may be mis-informed , but I do not believe that the Taliban has been invaded by a tyrranny that wished to disrupt is legilature ; rather , I believe that the Osama 's regiment attacked civilians because of their cowardly nature .
If the idea that the U.S. attacked civilians , as the terrorists of today have , is still held by people then perhaps they would want to consider this .
The United States targets militaries that are designated for combat with foreign peoples in time of war .
Germany and Russia targetted civilians and only fought other armies when they could n't avoid it .
The Taliban , at the bottom of the list , targetted the World Trade Center , because of what it was : a WORLD TRADE CENTER and the most populated area on earth ( if you look at it two dimensionally ) .
The latest 's quest is for world domination while the earliest 's mission is to try to create world agreement enough to maintain peace .
Lastly , I would just like to give my credentials .
I am a 17 - year - old student who has been at college for the past year and will have an associate 's degree in 8 - 9 months .
If America is worried about it 's youth , let them worry about their old ; let them worry about their current in power ; but first , look at themselves before they look elsewhere .
If I am mis-informed , please write a post and I shall research it and try to find the correct -- most informed -- way to understand history .
Thank you .

The questions may be honest , but the argument is not .
We already know why al - Qaeda hates us : they hate us because we are an obstacle to their goal of building a World Islamofascist Empire .
How many Bin Laden tapes do you have to watch to figure this out ?
They are NOT attacking us because of our 18th century shipping depredations , nor because of differences in environmental policy , corporate accounting errors , the legacy of the slave trade or Japanese internment during World War Two .
No nation has ever won a war by trying to " understand " why it is under attack , they win by FIGHTING BACK .
Given the massive preponderence of force we enjoy , it must be pleasant to sit back and nit -pick about America 's past evils .
However , it is worth pointing out that those " terrorists " WON against a vastly superior power all those centuries ago , in no small part because of a lack of resolve on Britain 's part .
For this they lost some colonies , but soon recovered .
The price of our failure in the present war is the destruction of Western Civilization itself .
Perhaps when the esteemed professor faces a Sharia religious court for crimes against Wahhabi Islam he can point out that we 're all terrorists and no one is fit to judge another .
Alec Lloyd - 8/26/2002
I was going to reply , but Mr. Pyle far outstripped anything I could offer .
Well done .
HNN should be ashamed to publish this blatant political screed , which any undergrad with a moiety of military history from the period could refute .
The only redeeming feature is that it is instructive of how far safe , tenured academics are willing to contort history to blame the country that shelters and sustains them .
This piece is an embarrassment to academia and HNN .
Markham Shaw Pyle - 8/24/2002 Douglas Ryan , too charitably , I would submit , contends that Professor Lemisch has a point , whatever his motives .
It is precisely his ' central point ' – irrespective of any readings into his text of what may or may not be his agenda – that is facially wrong .
This purportedly ' indisputable ' central point – which I think Douglas Ryan correctly abstracts as '... great powers have the major role in defining what methods of warfare are legitimate and what are illegitimate , and therefore what kinds of combatants are entitled to the protections of POW status and what kinds are not ' – is simply incorrect .
Imprimis , the law of war is not , as Professor Lemisch would have it , ' laid down by militarily strong nations ... [ whose governments ] define their modes of making war as legal ... while criminalizing alternate modes of warfare rising from the limited strength of the militarily weak . '
The law of war has developed from moral and equitable precepts ultimately religious in their origin , and was developed largely at the hands of religious institutions and individual churchmen and theologians .
It was the papacy , long before there was a ' king 's peace ' to offend against , that declared ' the Truce of God , ' Treuga Dei , and called upon successive Holy Roman Emperors as their secular arm to enforce the same .
Take the Second Lateran Council of 1139 , for instance , and its ban on certain classes of weapon ( the crossbow , notably ) .
Just War
Theory derives markedly from Aquinas and his Thomist successors on the one hand and from Arminian Protestant Reformers , notably Richard Hooker in England and Hugo Grotius , of course , in Holland , on the other .
Grotius is generally regarded as the father of the modern concept of applying legal principles to warfare ; and what has Grotius to say ?
' I saw in the whole Christian world a license of fighting at which even barbarous nations might blush .
Wars were begun on trifling pretexts or none at all , and carried on without any reference of law , Divine or human , ' he says at the outset ; and again , ' For God has given conscience a judicial power to be the sovereign guide of human actions , by despising whose admonitions the mind is stupefied into brutal hardness . '
Moreover , in the halcyon Edwardian days that preceded the Great War , it is , I think , universally acknowledged that the Royal Navy was still the classic sample of a pre-eminently powerful navy serving one of Professor Lemisch 's Naughty Old Hegemons .
Yet it was the British – led by the redoubtable Jacky Fisher – who , at the pre-War Hague Conferences , resisted ' criminalizing ' various aspects of naval warfare that in fact were of more utility to the lesser powers than to the Royal Navy .
Not even someone too dim not to recognize the phrase ' left culture ' as a peculiarly risible oxymoron could be so silly as honestly to believe that the law of war , a concept evolved by transnational religious bodies , is actually a construct put together by more powerful nations to trammel weaker ones .
Which brings us , secundum , to the fact that Professor Lemisch is pretty evidently not a naval historian per se , whatever his background with the short and simple annals of merchant mariners .
Were he an historian of naval operations and combat , he would recognize that , for example , the privateers of the Elizabethan era were the servants of the two preponderant open - ocean naval powers of the period , England and the Netherlands , and it was Spain that , for all its ponderous capacity to wage land warfare , was the weaker naval power , even after the Portuguese anschluss and despite its Mediterranean experiences , Lepanto included .
In the American Revolution , the British made use of privateers ( such as the vessel West Florida , operating out of Lake Pontchartrain ) as well , to project added power in such auxiliary theaters as the Gulf of Mexico .
The Americans 's Spanish allies , under Galvez , captured a dozen privateers in the course of the Revolution .
Pace Professor Lemisch , then , it is simply incorrect to say that privateering was eo ipso the weapon and mark of the weaker power , although it has certainly been so used .
I here pause to note that Professor Lemisch 's effusions on Ben Franklin 's one - man crusade against privateering are a bit curious in light of such facts as that Dr Franklin helped negotiate , and signed , the 1785 Prusso - American Treaty that includes matter of fact provisions for privateering in concert if engaged against a common enemy , that while in Paris during the war he commissioned three privateers himself ( the Black Prince , Black Princess , and Fearnot ) so as to capture as many RN sailors as possible ( thus forcing a cartel of exchange so as to get the imprisoned American privateers out of such places as the Old Mill , Plymouth , and Forton , in Portsmouth ) , and that Franklin is not recorded as objecting to Art.
I , Section 8 , of the Constitution in all his time as part of the Convention that drafted that document .
A minor point , perhaps , but significant of the sloppiness that pervades Professor Lemisch 's argument : particularly in light of
the fact that the Prussian treaty , and contemporaneous treaties and proposed treaties ( ' of amity and commerce , ' usually ) between the United States and such comparatively minor states as some of the ' Barbary ' statelets , various German and Italian statelets , and , for that matter , decrescent Spain , together were treaties between effective ' equals ' in ' power relationships ' at least insofar as any naval might was concerned , yet they recognized privateering as legitimate and hardly worthy of remark ; and
in light of the other inconvenient fact that , thanks in part to HMG 's having already secured final peace treaties with Spain and France , Britain had the whip - hand in concluding the 1783 Treaty , and had the whole thing been about ' power relationships and the way in which more powerful states criminalize weaker states 's methods of warmaking , ' then – especially with Professor Lemisch 's complaisant , anti-privateering Franklin present – privateering would have been banned in the document .
Professor Lemisch 's claims again do not pass muster .
It is equally incorrect to suggest that the 1856 Declaration of Paris was an imposition of new and self - serving rules by stronger maritime powers upon weaker ones , just as it is a flat misrepresentation for Professor Lemisch to say the United States ' refused to abide by [ this ] international treaty . '
( What the United States did was decline to join the damn thing , a very significant distinction legally and ethically , and one the professor is anxious to elide for his own , rather obvious reasons . )
In fact , the 1856 Declaration of Paris reads , in pertinent part , ' The Governments of the undersigned Plenipotentiaries engage to bring the present declaration to the knowledge of the States which have not taken part in the Congress of Paris , and to invite them to accede . '
That the United States declined the invitation to accede to any such thing is not , as Professor Lemisch would have the unwary believe , proof – he would doubtless say ' further proof ' – of American criminality .
As the Declaration concludes , ' [t ] he present Declaration is not and shall not be binding , except between those Powers who have acceded , or shall accede , to it . '
Moreover , Professor Lemisch is again disingenuous in asserting that ' the U.S. refused to abide by [ the 1856 Declaration of Paris ] , stating that , as a small - navy nation , it needed privateers . '
The United States declined to accede to the Declaration when a proposed American amendment , exempting all private property from seizure upon the high seas , was not universally accepted .
By the same token , the United States has ever since voluntarily abided by the Declaration 's precepts , partially in the War Between the States and wholly in the Spanish - American War and all subsequent conflicts .
It may finally be noted that the signatories to the Declaration represented the parties to the Crimean War and its settlement : France , Great Britain , the Ottoman Empire , Sardinia , Russia , the Austro - Hungarian Empire , and Prussia .
If Sardinia , Prussia as it existed in 1856 , the Sublime Porte , and the Habsburgs represent , as Professor Lemisch necessarily insists they represent , the ' strong naval powers ' on a par with Russia and France , much less the British Empire , I have clearly missed one hell of a memo .
Tertium , we come to the most tendentious aspects of Professor Lemisch 's repellent little exercise in intellectual dishonesty .
Professor Lemisch 's first sleight of hand is to use the word ' terrorism ' – a fairly modern word for a phenomenon that is in degree , if not in kind , all too modern – out of context , and apply it indiscriminately to American actions at the time of the revolution ( or at least , formally , to what the British allegedly considered American actions to constitute ) .
This is simply false .
HMG did not consider the Americans ' terrorists . '
The government and the Crown considered them , simply , ' damned rebels . '
The illegitimacy of American privateering was not that it was privateering – God knows there was a hoary British tradition of just that – but that it was American : a rebel government – de facto and precisely not , in the British view , de jure – had neither the right nor the power to issue letters of marque .
To the extent there is an iota of truth to Professor Lemisch 's assertion that ' [ w ] hen privateersmen were captured , they were not recognized as prisoners of war , since they were civilians , ' their alleged ' civilian ' status derived not from their privateering , but precisely from a refusal to recognize them as legitimate privateers because they represented ' rebellious colonies to boot . '
( Mr Lincoln , Mr Secretary Stanton , and Mr Secretary Welles adopted precisely that reasoning vis-à - vis the Confederate States : the entire Confederate States Navy were , in the Union 's view , pirates , because the CSA had not the legitimacy , in Yankee eyes , to commission vessels of war . )
Indeed , you may catch sight of the pea between the thimbles in Professor Lemisch 's sleight of hand by considering this statement of his :
' By the time of the Revolution ( 1776 - 1783 ) , privateering had become an old American institution and industry , which lured the young to sea with seductive promises of a share of the booty . '
Note that : ' by the time of the Revolution , ' privateering was a long - standing enterprise in the colonies .
That can be true if and only if the colonies , at the behest of or at least with the assent of the Crown and the British government of the day , had engaged for some period before the Revolution in privateering on behalf of – you guessed it – Great Britain .
And that is of course the case , as Anderson , for example , relates in his recent history of the Seven Years 's War : Anglo - American privateers worked with the Royal Navy against a weaker opponent ( certainly weaker at sea ) , the French .
Even Professor
Lemisch lets slip the obvious fact , fatal to his argument , that ' [t ] he Americans were not granted the recognition of prisoner - of - war status , but were rather deemed rebels … .
Prisoners taken into Mill were told that they were committed " for rebellion , piracy , and high treason " ….'
Precisely .
It is on par with General Gage 's refusal to grant General Washington certain of the courtesies , let alone the customs and usages , of war , because , as he sneered , ' I acknowledge no rank that is not derived from the King . '
Is this uncomfortable fact consonant with the frankly absurd claim that twenty years after the Seven Years 's War , Great Britain 's quarrel with American privateers was that they were privateers , rather than that they were rebels and thus not legitimately privateers at all ?
Of course not , and presumably Professor Lemisch is not such a fool as not to know this .
Which in turn means he is being ... disingenuous , shall we say ?
Having attempted – disingenuously at best – to conflate terror attacks with privateering , the legitimacy of which in fact turned solely on the question of whether or not the commissioning government were itself legitimate , Professor Lemisch begins his second game of three - card monte by trying – pace Douglas Ryan 's innocent conviction that Professor Lemisch has no agenda and is not concerned to establish moral equivalency claims – to conflate the Revolution with the motives of al - Qaeda , its methods with theirs , and the imprisonment of Americans as ' rebels ' with the detention of unlawful combatants as , well , unlawful combatants .
This is as false as it is contemptible , and it is hard to imagine that the falsehood is not deliberate and witting ( when a man who is not a fool acts the part of a man who must be either fool or knave , there are not too many innocent conclusions to be drawn , folks ) .
What are the evidences of Professor Lemisch 's having this agenda ?
Well , it 's hard to beat such expressions of naked animus as ' our country has an extraordinary and continuing record of killing civilians in warfare .
Among the powers of the strong is the power to deem such killings by themselves to be legal and proper , while killings by the weak are deemed improper . '
( It 's even worse that the first statement , at least , is demonstrably false . )
But let us set the man 's obvious bias aside and consider the merits – if any – of his claims .
Item : the claim that ' Today 's disputes around indefinite detention and the use of terror against civilians should take note of the fact that American civilians were victims of this kind of detention during the Revolution , and the U.S. was born in what was seen at the time by its more powerful adversary as a form of terrorism . '
To the extent the ' American civilians ' referenced are crew members of captured privateers , they were not civilians ; it is Professor Lemisch 's point in other places that they were PWs being wrongly treated as civilian criminals .
The reason for their detention and for the circumstances of their treatment was not that they were ' terrorists , ' a word North and Germain would not have recognized , but that they were unlawfully commissioned by an illegitimate rebel government , and were thus – and only thus – traitors .
By comparison , detainees held by the United States as unlawful combatants are not treated or considered as civilian criminals as such ( though they may have committed civilian crimes ) or as traitors ; their assigned status as unlawful combatants derives from a series of international conventions , most recently the Hague and then the Geneva Conventions , and ancillary conventions relative to such matters as the protection of civilians and of commercial aircraft .
And these conventions are not the imposed fiats of a few powerful nations , but rather represent the common conviction of nations great and small , the signatories and High Contracting Parties thereto .
Item : the colonists engaged in 'a very effective form of legalized piracy called privateering .
Privateers were denounced by the British in ways that resonate with the denunciation of terrorists that we hear these days .
When these Americans were captured by the British , they were not recognized as legitimate prisoners of war but were rather held in special camps , with reason to expect they would be hanged . '
The term ' legalized piracy ' is an oxymoron .
Privateering is precisely not piracy , being undertaken in the service of and by commission of the national government as a measure of war .
Professor Lemisch may , idiosyncratically , find British complaints about American privateering ' resonant ' with the civilized world 's unanimous condemnation of al - Qaeda , but he offers no discernible reason why anyone else ought .
In fact , the British criticism had everything to do with the privateering 's being American ( that is , rebel - chartered ) and nothing to do with its being privateering , as we have seen .
The British refusal to recognize the American seamen as PWs , likewise , was bound up entirely with British non-recognition of the American government they served ( a non-recognition that , insofar as the creation of an independent American government was the dispositive issue of the war , could hardly be avoided ) .
It is impossible for anyone with the least smattering of intellectual honesty to conflate this in any way with the current situation of
detained unlawful combatants
in the service of no government whatever ,
taken in arms but not in uniform ,
belonging to an organization without any recognizable chain of responsible military command ,
hiding within civilian populations ,
and regularly engaged in acts of perfidy as defined in international law ( to which covenants and conventions the nations of which the detainees are citizens are all signatories .
Yes , even Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia ) .
These detainees are stunningly textbook examples of what unlawful combatants taxonomically ARE , and their treatment is equally a textbook example of what unlawful combatants are to expect under international law .
Item : ' [ w ] hen privateersmen were captured , they were not recognized as prisoners of war , since they were civilians … Franklin had admirable and prescient Enlightenment feelings about the involvement of civilians in wars .
But Franklin 's idealism got noplace .'
As commissioned privateersmen , these men were not civilians , nor were they non-combatants , save only to an enemy that refused to recognize the legitimacy of their commissioning authority ( just as the North would do to Confederate regular naval personnel , let alone privateers ) .
Straining to establish an analogy with current detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere is liable to give anyone less intellectually boneless than Professor Lemisch a severe hernia .
Item : ' They were held indefinitely in special camps … places of bad food , overcrowding , bad health , brutal guards and harsh punishment .
[***]
Today 's detentions by the U.S. are very similar to what was done to Americans by the British during the Revolution . '
This is simply facially false , and utterly base .
Currently detained unlawful combatants in US custody , so far from being condemned to bad food , overcrowding , illness , brutalization , and punishment , are being afforded every privilege they are entitled to under Conventions III and IV of the 12 August , 1949 Geneva Conventions , and it may be a trifle more than they are entitled to ( note those documents 's references to saboteurs , unlawful combatants , and perfidious acts ) .
Item : ' Americans used what the British defined as illegitimate means in their quest for legitimacy and independence .
[***]
Although we are rightly revolted by suicide bombing and other attacks on civilians , ' – damned decent of the professor to grant that concession , is n't it ?
– ' this is clearly a method that helps weak powers do battle with stronger powers , partly correcting the military imbalance – as did privateering . '
By contrast , of course , and leaving aside the incessant false statement that privateering was eo ipso a weapon of the weaker power , our enemies are using what all the world , in conventions too numerous to detail , defines as ' illegitimate means ' of conducting hostilities : in addition to which , they are conducting hostilities as a private criminal gang , without even the fig leaf of an affiliation with any present , proposed , or prospective government .
They 're not even nation - based revolutionaries , they 're merely a widespread coalition of racketeers .
And notice how the Good Professor manages to sneak suicide bombers – a ' Palestinian ' phenomenon – into what purports to be an examination of the methods , motives , and detentions of extremists who have contracted to attack , not Israel , but the United States .
Yeah , that was real slick , there .
And what ' quest ' are we looking at here ?
What is the end that the gentleman would insinuate justifies these means ?
It is at least assuredly not independence ( from whom ? ) or legitimacy : again , the detainees whose plight this is ostensibly about are members of a transnational , non-state criminal gang that has no such purposes .
It makes as much sense to speak of their actions in terms of a ' military ' imbalance as it would to speak of the Sicilian Mafia as engaged in infantry operations against the police .
No , the harder you look at Professor Lemisch 's tissue of tendentiousness , his congeries of falsehoods and half - and quarter - truths , the more you see it for what it is : the scaffolding for his petty , historically false little agenda .
And the more it becomes evident that he not only has no point , he has no shame .
His propositions are false in detail , deliberately misleading overall , logically invalid , historically inaccurate , and politically and morally despicable .
I wash my hands of the man .
don kates - 8/23/2002 Mr. Karr 's comment is simply unresponsive : during WWII , the US and Britain deliberately , INTENTIONALLY , killed many civil -
ians by area bombing Japan and Germany respectively ; Japanese troops killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians both directly and by bombing ; the Nazis notoriously murdered vast numbers of civilians throughout Europe ; under Mao China killed vast numbers of its own civilians , especially during " the great leap forward ; Stalin 's Russia deliberately killed Russians by the the tens of millions in the 1930s and thereafter
Nothing even remotely comparable in intention and scope happened ( by the U.S. ) in the Phillipines or other places mentioned by Mr. Karr .
Ronald Dale Karr - 8/22/2002
If one could estimate the numbers of civilians killed by all of the nations in the world in the 20th century , undoubtedly Germany and the Soviet Union would top the list .
But who would be next ?
Japan ?
Cambodia ?
China ?
Iraq ?
Yugoslavia ?
Certainly not the land of the free and the home of the brave !?
Or could it be ?
A lot of Philipinos , Germans , Japanese , Koreans , and Vietnamese fell victim to U.S. bombs and bullets .
I wonder .
John Horst - 8/22/2002
Any point that he might have is lost on his failed attempt at reinventing history , in the same way that Mr. Bellesile 's points have been lost in his fantastic account of the history of colonial America .
Regardless of how desperately either of these authors want things in history to support their particular agenda , simply stating vehemently over and over again the same misinformation will not make it so .
Douglas Ryan - 8/22/2002
This is not my field , but it seems to me that Professor Lemisch 's detractors ( how 's that for an understated description ) are missing or ( more likely ) distorting his point .
Though I admit his title , by announcing that ' The United States Was Born in " Terrorism " and Piracy ' , might lead one to believe he is morally equating revolutionary - era privateers and modern terrorists , it seems clear to me , upon reading past the title , that he is not doing so .
After all , he clearly sympathizes with the former ( describing , for instance , the horrors they suffered in prison ) and says that " we are rightly revolted by " the actions of the latter .
It seems to me that the main comparison he is drawing is , rather , between England of the late 18th century and the U.S. of today .
And it is not ( at least , not obviously from the text ) a moral comparison he draws but an historical one , between their positions of power relative to their attackers .
The central point seems hard to dispute : that great powers have the major role in defining what methods of warfare are legitimate and what are illegitimate , and therefore what kinds of combatants are entitled to the protections of POW status and what kinds are not .
Now , it is not clear to me what Professor Lemisch would say this parallel implies about how we should view today 's events and today 's Guantanamo detainees .
I fear it is this : that Americans should see a glimmer of their former selves in Al Qaeda members , who are reduced to practicing what are generally regarded as illegitimate methods of warfare because they lack the option of exerting power through legitimate means .
IF that is his point ( and it may not be ) , I would only respond that while it may be a good argument for granting them more legal rights than they are presently being afforded , it is a weak argument for granting them sympathy , for the glimmer of similarity is very faint indeed .
First , the powers of destruction held by well - funded modern terrorists , sheltered by distant foreign governments , are far greater than those available to revolutionary - era privateers , and those powers have all - too - often been exercised in recent years against targets which by no stretch of the mral imagination could be termed legitimate ( i.e. military ) .
Second , if one hopes to win sympathy ( from me , anyway ) for one 's use of illegitimate means of securing the legitimate goal of self - determination , one must be able to present credible evidence of prior efforts to achieve that goal through legitimate means .
But Usama bin Laden is ( or was , if he 's dead ) no frustrated politician a la John Hancock ; he is a bandit who pays for political protection and otherwise shuns formal political processes .
Finally , it is doubtful whether Al Qaeda 's goal is anything nearly as legitimate as self - determination for Arabs or Muslims or the Third World or whatever ; it seems to me that if the organization has any vision of a better world , it is that of a repressive theocracy .
As I say , thought , on the matter of the implications of his parallel for today 's problems I may have caught Professor Lemisch 's ' drift ' all wrong .
If so I would be very interested to hear his reply .
John HOrst - 8/22/2002 According to the British ' Cruizers and Convoys '
Act of 1708 , English sailors were paid handsomely for doing their jobs .
It is idiotic to suggest that America invented the concept of
" to the victors go the spoils of war " .
It is true that the English government often resorted to using pressgangs to man their ships , particularly in time of war , but their primary goal was to attract desirable , able bodied and motivated men .
Thus the prize money concept .
The author is confusing English propoganda for an objective observation of the day .
The English new right well that in order to maintain support at home for the war in America , they'd have to portrey the patriots as lawless thugs and savages , ( e.g. , terrorists ) , definitely in the minority .
They would have to impress upon their own society that they were in fact saving the majority of law abiding British subjects in North America from this lawless rabble .
Another example of this propaganda was the English attempt at disparaging the practice by American riflemen of shooting British officers in battle .
This was yet another demonstration that the rebels were lawless thugs , ( e.g. , terrorists ) , intent on undermining the very principles of " civilized " war .
Yet , the Americans did not invent this , ( the Prussians did ) they simply perfected it .
In fact , the English thought it was a good idea too , and allowed Patrick Ferguson to form a select group of riflemen to counter the American sharpshooters .
Additionally , the English army failed to recognize the Militia fighting them in the early years of the war as " legitimate prisoners of war " as you put it , as evidenced by the slaugther of many who attempted surrender at New York and other places ( remember " no flint " Grey ) .
But I suppose we should call such famous groups as the Maryland 400 ( who Washington lovingly deemed " the old line ) terrorists and complete your analogy .
Good attempt at revising history , Mr. Lamisch , unfortunately it simply does n't fly .
Benjamin Raty - 8/21/2002
Disregarding this article for a moment , and speaking in more general terms , the question I have is : what is constructive criticism ?
It seems , from what I 've read , that people only label criticism constructive when it comes in a form that is not threatening ; one that they can easily reject , either logically or emotionally .
What is wrong with questioning why other people in the world hate us ?
Are we so secure in the workings of our nation - especially our foreign policy - that we feel we can do no wrong , and that no other nation or people may have a legitimate grievance against us ?
Is n't introspection a good thing ?
As historians is n't it our duty to examine the events of the past so that , among other things , we can offer some sort of explanation for the happenings in our world ?
Would n't labeling a person as anti-American for questioning the majority imply then that the behavior and ideas of the majority are always justified ?
If no one raises any critical questions , are we assuming that the majority always acts morally , while by virtue of not being a part of this majority , those in the minority are necessarily in the wrong ?
I mean these as honest questions , and not merely an attempt to argumentative .
I am simply a student who is a bit taken back by how personal and acidic these arguments have become .
If anyone wishes to answer them , I 'd be very appreciative .
William D. Brewer - 8/21/2002
I am sure that a lofty academic such as Jesse Lemisch will not be interested
in answering the criticism of a conservative layperson such as myself .
But
I found his article comparing U.S. privateers with modern terrorists so
infuriating , I can't help but respond .
Anyone with the slightest acquaintance with history will know that the
assertions made in this article are false , the arguements specious , and the
comparison of privateers to terrorists ridiculous .
The obvious anti- U.S .
bias is clumsy , obvious , and offensive in the extreme .
It is well known that letters of Marque and other privateering arrangement
were used by many countries , over many centuries .
it is also understandable
that while considered legitimate in the eyes of the sponsor , the privateer
was usually just a pirate in the eyes of the intended victim .
But to
suggest that this equates to one man 's terrorist being another man 's freedom
fighter is ridiculous .
It is true that the history of piracy and privateering contains many
examples of what we would call criminal , barbaric behavior .
But I challenge
Mr. Lemisch to present one example of a wartime U.S. privateer deliberately
engineering the mass slaughter of British civilians , particularly women and
children , for the express purpose of terrorizing England .
This equivalence of Privateers with terrorists is little better than a
baldfaced lie , unsupportable by historical evidence or common sense .
I
shudder to think how much anti U.S. propaganda and outright nonsense this
malefactor has shoved into the eager ears of unsuspecting students .
I am sure that by now this message has been deleted as an angry rant from
another right wing nut , firmly in the grip of mindless , sheeplike
patriotism .
But on the off chance it is being read to the end , I assure you
this is not the case .
I am aware of my country 's many failings , past and
present .
But I love it nonetheless , and I find no reason to manufacture
reasons to hate it , and assume the worst at every turn .
Since 9/11 , the academic world has gone into overdrive , imploring us to ask
ourselves why they hate us .
Outside of the Colleges , this message has
fallen flat with leaden thump .
Ask yourself why .
Do you really believe we
are all just mindless , ignorant sheep ?
I fear many of you do .
But rest
assured , I am well educated and logical , and I know exactly why I believe
what I believe , and I have no doubts about where my loyalties lie .
There
are many millions who feel as I do .
If you have constructive criticism , we
will listen .
But by churning out self hating , specious trash like this , you
demean yourself , and detract from the value of any reasonable criticism you
might have .
William Penn Fallin - 8/21/2002
Why do you find it desirable to publish such anti-American propaganda as the one you did on Privateering ?
Is this your chosen method of subtly informing your readers about just how BAD you think America is as a nation ?
The extent of your efforts in trying to legitimize the murderous Islamic terrorists as nothing more than just " good ole boys " fighting for a " legitimate " cause , sets one to wondering if you ( perhaps ) are on the payroll of one Osama bin Laden or the Royal House of Saud .
Oh yes , one more thing , do you really welcome notes like this or do they get cast aside with the normal disdain of the self appointed liberal INTELLECTUAL ?
I know other people have written you but I see no evidence that you even acknowledge them .
I 'll refrain from any further discussion on your despicable piece until I know that my words are going some place other than your trash bin .

I think anyone , especially a professor emeritus , should be careful about ascribing moral equivalency between American revolutionaries and Muslim terrorists .
My knowledge of the privateers is minimal , but it sounds like their primary goal was to disrupt trade , not to kill civilians .
A vital and fundamental difference .
The problem I have with these types of articles is that the authors define terrorism so broadly it becomes a meaningless term .
barbara kessel - 8/21/2002 Jesse Leammish
don kates - 8/19/2002
Piling falsehood on falsehood , the author concludes by asserting that the U.S. has an " extraordinary " record of killing civilians .
As any honest evaluator familiar w/ the history of warfare in general , and guerrilla war in particular would say , the U.S. has a very ORDINARY record of murdering civilians , from the Seminole Wars through the Phillipine insurrection to Korea and Vietnam , w/ some tragic episodes in other wars thrown in .
Regardless of the nationality involved armies commit atrocities in wartime ; and the suppression of guerrillas invariably occurs with particularly hideous atrocity .
Compared to the record of European nations in their colonial wars , there is ( at worst ) nothing extraordinary about the American record .
Reference may also be made to WWII in which the U.S. engaged in terror bombing of civilians in Japan and , to some extent , in Germany as well .
Britain 's record in WWII is far worse .
And , though the Nazis ' record as to terror bombing is not nearly so bad , both the Nazis and the Japanese engaged in the torture and murder of civilian populations ( and suppression of guerrillas ) far beyond anything the U.S. has ever done .
Perhaps the author would call the Nazi - Japanese record " super-duper-extraordinary . "

Those who are interested in Mike Abramowicz 's prediction markets posts may also be interested in this new NBER working paper I just saw on SSRN :
Historians have long wondered whether the Southern Confederacy had a realistic chance at winning the American Civil War .
We provide some quantitative evidence on this question by introducing a new methodology for estimating the probability of winning a civil war or revolution based on decisions in financial markets .
Using a unique dataset of Confederate gold bonds in Amsterdam , we apply this methodology to estimate the probability of a Southern victory from the summer of 1863 until the end of the war .
Our results suggest that European investors gave the Confederacy approximately a 42 percent chance of victory prior to the battle of Gettysburg / Vicksburg .
News of the severity of the two rebel defeats led to a sell - off in Confederate bonds .
By the end of 1863 , the probability of a Southern victory fell to about 15 percent .
Confederate victory prospects generally decreased for the remainder of the war .
The analysis also suggests that McClellan 's possible election as U.S. President on a peace party platform as well as Confederate military victories in 1864 did little to reverse the market 's assessment that the South would probably lose the Civil War .
Muslims and Christians are like to rays of light coming from the same source .
60:8 ] GOD does not enjoin you from befriending those who do not fight you because of religion , and do not evict you from your homes .
You may befriend them and be equitable towards them .
GOD loves the equitable .
[ 60:9 ] GOD enjoins you only from befriending those who fight you because of religion , evict you from your homes , and band together with others to banish you .
You shall not befriend them .
Those who befriend them are the transgressors .
Thus , we learn that we are only enjoined from befriending those who fight us because of religion .
Let 's go back to the verse immediately after 5:51 , to see if it now sheds some more light on the issue .
[ 5:57 ]
O you who believe , do not befriend those among the recipients of previous scripture who mock and ridicule your religion , nor shall you befriend the disbelievers .
You shall reverence GOD , if you are really believers .
God teaches us throughout the Quran that there are righteous Jews and Christians .
So , if we think we are righteous , and they are righteous , what could possibly be the problem between us , or obstacle for us to be friends ?
[ 7:159 ]
Among the followers of Moses there are those who guide in accordance with the truth , and the truth renders them righteous .
[ 5:46 ]
Subsequent to them , we sent Jesus , the son of Mary , confirming the previous scripture , the Torah .
We gave him the Gospel , containing guidance and light , and confirming the previous scriptures , the Torah , and augmenting its guidance and light , and to enlighten the righteous .
[ 5:47 ]
The people of the Gospel shall rule in accordance with GOD 's revelations therein .
Those who do not rule in accordance with GOD 's revelations are the wicked .
[ 2:62 & 5:69 ]
Surely , those who believe , those who are Jewish , the Christians , and the converts ; anyone who ( 1 ) believes in GOD , and ( 2 ) believes in the Last Day , and ( 3 ) leads a righteous life , will receive their recompense from their Lord .
They have nothing to fear , nor will they grieve .
[ 3:113-114 ] .
They are not all the same ; among the followers of the scripture , there are those who are righteous .
They recite GOD 's revelations through the night , and they fall prostrate .
They believe in GOD and the Last Day , they advocate righteousness and forbid evil , and they hasten to do righteous works .
These are the righteous .
[ 3:199 ]
Surely , some followers of the previous scriptures do believe in GOD , and in what was revealed to you , and in what was revealed to them .
They reverence GOD , and they never trade away GOD 's revelations for a cheap price .
These will receive their recompense from their Lord.
GOD is the most efficient in reckoning .
We learn , however , from the Quran that the Christians are closer to the believers ( submitters - Muslims ) than the Jews .
This is just a statement of fact by God almighty , that we can still witness during our time .
God is the best knower of the emotional structure of His creations and therefore was this statement of fact in 5:82 .
We can witness from the conflict in the Middle East for example , how very emotional the Jews get and how they react to conflicts with their friends , their enemies or even among themselves inside Israel .
Could it be that the current wave of British youth delinquency is largely in the eye of the beholder ?
It certainly seems to be the cause du jour - headlines about ' Binge Britain ' , campaigns to stop underage drinking and stories about ex-soldiers being drafted into classrooms as teachers .
Then the dark stuff : ' happy slappers ' locked up for filming fatal beatings ; fathers stabbed ; broken bottles brandished in a club frequented by Prince William .
To view all this is to visualise a Britain that makes the violent excesses of A Clockwork Orange resemble a nursery outing in Balamory .
While fictional miscreants are one thing , from Graham Greene 's Brighton gangs , and the tribal clash of Quadrophenia , through to the pretty - boy warfare of West Side Story , the real deal is quite another .
The question is , are we genuinely seeing the dawn of the new yobbery or is it just youth - business as usual , spotlit and overreported , for the titillated masses ?
Let 's be clear about one thing : genuine antisocial behaviour is not a ' youth thing ' , it is a ' crime thing ' .
It is not only the young who indulge in antisocial , homicidal or psychopathic behaviour , though they are the only ones who get grouped together .
Odd when you think about it .
When older people commit crimes , we do not ring 5 Live ranting about a ' middle - aged crime wave ' .
Why , then , are ' teenage louts ' in Blackpool automatically twinned with ' young thugs ' in Luton ?
Moreover , what can really be so ' new ' about a culture documented by Alan Parker 's borstal - set Scum as early as 1979 ?
It seems to me that one of the bittersweet by - products of ageing is a tendency towards rosy - specs revisionism about not only one 's own youthful conduct , but also the behaviour of one 's entire generation .
As in : ' We were n't angels , but we were never as bad as that ' , followed by a pause as we gaze back fondly on our young selves - lying in meadows , say , sipping Panda Pops .
In truth , all generations have had their fair share of drinking , smoking , drugging , shagging , fighting and general miscreant carryings - on .
And even when not behaving in a delinquent manner , we were scaring the bejesus out of older people without realising it - by the very fact of our existence .
It 's all in the framing .
When my friends and I thought we were so cool in the 80s , lurking outside Tower Records with the boys with the soaped mohawks , it did n't occur to us that we probably unsettled nine out of 10 passersby .
The same goes for every generation - from the Brylcreemed Teds through to the hoodies on street corners .
While looking terrifying on the outside , on the inside and to each other , these youths are not scary at all .
Nor are they ' new ' .
Where teens are concerned - cider - sozzled degenerates , leaning against walls , holding spitting competitions are veritable design classics - they 've been around forever .
If you want ' new ' , try the relatively recent social embarrassment of fake youth - all we oldies and fogies , in our 30s and 40s , who rather pathetically consider ourselves to be ' with it ' , because we have pages on Facebook , own iPods , and watch Skins
The culture of fake youth sprang to mind when Children 's Commissioner Albert Aynsley - Green condemned the use of ' Mosquitoes ' ( the dispersal machines used by shops that emit a piercing noise that only under - 25s can hear ) .
Aynsley - Green said they ' demonised ' young people , ' creating a dangerous and widening divide between the young and old ' .
I beg to differ ; if anything , there does n't seem to be enough of a ' young - old ' divide these days .
We could probably do with a Mosquito - like machine to disperse the fake youths as we flail around outside our age bracket like sightless movie zombies .
Indeed , far from being the worst generation ever , it seems to me that today 's young have been remarkably patient about sharing ' being young ' with the old .
It may not be the young who have changed for the worse so much as the not - so - young ; the fake youth generation who can't and wo n't let go and are probably so far beyond help now that we actually consider ourselves to be better at being young than genuine yoof , with their unfortunate complexions and happy - slapping shenanigans .
Indeed , while not to diminish genuine suffering around the country , it probably would n't hurt to ask a few pertinent questions .
Are the new yobs really so much worse these days ?
Or are their worst excesses simply publicised and criticised to an unprecedented degree ?
As for those of us stuck in fake youth , we may kid ourselves we are young , but we betray ourselves simply by the way we perceive and judge the ' louts ' leaning against the bus shelter .
We demand the Rooney rellies , Coleen
Coleen McLoughlin , the future Mrs Wayne , is said to be banning the extended , ' fun- loving '
Rooney clan from this summer 's nuptials .
This would be a PR travesty .
Coleen 's 21st birthday party endeared her to the nation and not just because of those little buns with her face on .
With the cavorting , occasionally stumbling , guests , one girl flashing a breast at the tabloids , you could almost smell the Pernod , taste the lovebites , feel the grim determination to complete the macarena .
But there was also a feeling of honesty and sweetness .
As in : finally , a ' proper do ' , rather than just another stuffy , showbiz pose - a- thon .
Coleen must amend that guest list at once .
Quite apart from anything else , everyone knows that ' embarrassing rellies ' are as much a wedding staple as a tiered cake .
They came , they saw , they did some plumbing .
And how we 'll miss them

It appears that many of them had the plan all along to make money , then go back to Poland and build their real lives .
Now , weary of the UK's high cost of living , food and lack of career opportunity , they 're downing tools and returning home in droves .
Well , good luck to them .
After visiting Krakow , I have long had a soft spot for the Poles .
So I am pleased to see them giving immigration a certain diva - like panache .
They were happy to come over here for a look - see , picking up those menial jobs few Brits seem to want to do .
Now they 're just as happy to go home and I hope they are taking with them the only downside to the Polish invasion - the frighteningly good - looking girls .
A minor point , you may feel , but it 's unnerving when you just pop into the chemist for your vitamins and find yourself served by the Polish Rachel Weisz .
Overall though , is n't this great - a kind of flexi approach to immigration ?
And perhaps a long overdue wake - up call .
The most depressing phrase in the English language has to be ' bloody immigrants ' - the whole thing a reflection of that dreary , surly attitude infecting the country that somehow as a nation we 're threatened or diminished by new arrivals .
Phooey .
The fact of being an immigrant alone does not make you interesting , but their influx down the years must be a large factor in Britain remaining interesting .
Now Polish immigrants are making it clear that for them the British chapter is over .
They are ' going home ' , but on their own terms .
It will be interesting to see whether the big immigration issue of the future will be not how to keep them out , but how to make them stay .
Mr Darling was talking to MPs after setting out a proposal to turn the firm's £ 25 bn Bank of England loan into bonds and sell them to investors .
The bonds would be guaranteed by the government to speed up a private sale .
If a private sale is not reached , the bank will come under temporary public ownership , the chancellor reiterated .
Either way , savers ' money will be protected by the government .
Northern Rock shares ended 46 % higher at 94.25 pence .
" The proposal that I set out today for a solution to Northern Rock - which is underpinned by Government support - is one which best meets our objectives of protecting taxpayers and depositors and maintaining financial stability , " Mr Darling told the House of Commons .
Bidders have until 4 February to come forward with rescue proposals based on the Treasury 's plans .
The scheme was proposed by investment bank Goldman Sachs and was given the green light by Prime Minister Gordon Brown over the weekend .
No British government has ever provided financial help on that scale to a business

BBC business editor Read Robert 's thoughts in full
Peston interview
In effect , it turns Northern Rock debt into government bonds or gilt - edged stock .
That would mean the taxpayer would be exposed to Northern Rock for a much longer period than planned , for five years or longer , analysts said .
The Treasury 's plan still needs to be approved by the Financial Service Authority ( FSA ) , and to satisfy the European Commission 's rules on state aid for companies .
' Unprecedented '
" The scale of the financial support the Chancellor has today promised to provide to Northern Rock is breathtakingly large and without precedent , " said the BBC's Business Editor Robert Peston .
" No British government has ever provided financial help on that scale to a business . "
Banks in general found it harder to get funding after the credit crunch last summer , but Northern Rock was harder hit than others .
Its business model relied on the wholesale credit market to raise money - mainly by selling mortgage debt in the form of bonds .
But after significant losses made by investors in loans to US homebuyers with poor credit history , financial institutions became reluctant to buy mortgage debt .
This is a perfectly good solution to the Northern Rock problem

Read Chancellor Alistair Darling 's statement in full
Following Mr Darling 's statement , Shadow Secretary George Osborne said : " This is a part nationalisation because the government takes the bulk of the risk and the private sector takes the bulk of the upside . "
Vince Cable , the Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , said outright nationalisation would have been a better and more transparent option than what was being proposed .
Conservative Treasury spokesman , Philip Hammond , earlier told the BBC that the government 's plan did n't appear to have taxpayers ' interests at its heart .
" What we 're seeing here is a package which is actually designed to save Gordon Brown 's face by postponing the moment of reckoning , " he said .
Sustainable future
Mr Darling said putting the plan into practice depended " entirely on the terms on which a deal can be struck " .
" Northern Rock would need to demonstrate how it can operate sustainably in future without any government support , " he added .
Northern Rock 's Bank of England loan facility will be extended until 17 March to allow time to examine the proposed financing structure with Northern Rock and interested parties .
At the moment there are three front - runners : Olivant , the consortium led by Virgin , as well as the Rock 's current board , which is developing its own standalone plan .
Olivant chairman Luqman Arnold said : " We have always said our plan seeks to find common ground between all stakeholders in Northern Rock by restoring the fortunes of the company and its brand . "
Reports over the weekend said that Sir Richard Branson 's Virgin Group was preparing to make an improved offer for the beleaguered lender .
According to the Sunday Times , Virgin is preparing to cut its proposed stake in Northern Rock from 54 % to 45 % .
Such a move would allow existing shareholders more room to share in any recovery in the price of Northern Rock stock .
Public ownership
Observers have said the Treasury 's funding proposals could attract other suitors , now that a buyer would not have to shoulder the whole £ 25 bn worth of Bank of England loans .
This had been a key sticking point in a private sale , with Virgin and Olivant unable to secure private loans to pay back this debt in the crisis - hit money markets .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Other businesses are not propped up by the government , why should a bank be any different ?
John Carter , Bristol
" This is a perfectly good solution to the Northern Rock problem , " said Simon Maughan , an analyst at MF Global .
Robin Ashby , head of the group representing Northern Rock 's small shareholders , said he bought shares in the bank earlier as a vote of confidence that a deal could be done under the new funding arrangements .
Every year , Hollywood pumps out " historical " epics so distorted , propagandistic and self - serving , you have to wonder just how stupid they think we are .
But , try " fixing " some of those historical inaccuracies and you 'll quickly realize what Hollywood screenwriters have known for years : History is lame .
Here are 11 movies that make us glad no one gives a damn about trivial things like " what actually happened . "

The Flick : Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott present the epic tale of Maximus , a Roman general who became a slave , a slave who became a gladiator , a gladiator who defied an emperor and an actor / director team who threw all the audience goodwill they 'd earned on this away by releasing A Good Year six years later .
The Inaccuracies : Commodus , the hare - lipped Roman Emperor who lusted after his sister in the film , was in real life held in high esteem by the senate and ruled for a successful 13 years ( rather than the ineffectual few months depicted in the film ) .
Also , though the Emperor did , in fact , have an enthusiasm for gladiatorial combat ( he did so incognito ) , he did n't get his ticket punched in the arena .
He was killed in the bath by a wrestler named Narcissus to prevent him taking office as consul .

Why It Would Have Sucked Otherwise :
No one wants to watch Russell Crowe take 13 years to murder an emperor , who is basically a decent guy , only to get beaten to the kill by a wrestler .
We like our villains like we like our Books of Genesis : with implied incestuous relationships .
Also , since any Roman unit that broke ranks when in combat against barbarians would have been mercilessly slaughtered , the movie would have ended within about 15 minutes .

The Mafia 's Ten Commandments have been found after police arrested a top Godfather in Sicily .
Under the secret Cosa Nostra code of conduct , the so - called " men of honour " must avoid bars , other gangsters ' wives and girlfriends and be on time .
The list of rules emerged from documents seized after the arrest of Salvatore Lo Piccolo , 65 , at a secret mob meeting in Palermo , along with his son Sandro , 32 , and two other godfathers .
The 10 ' Mafiosi ' commandments are :
1 . No one can present himself directly to another of our friends .
There must be a third person to do it .
2 . Never look at the wives of friends .
3 . Never be seen with cops .
4 . Do n't go to pubs and clubs .
5 . Always be available for Cosa Nostra , even if your wife 's about to give birth .
6. Appointments must be respected .
7 . Wives must be treated with respect .
8 . When asked for any information , the answer must be the truth .
9 . Money cannot be appropriated if it belongs to others or to other families .
10 .
People who can't be part of Cosa Nostra are anyone with a close relative in the police , with a two - timing relative in the family , anyone who behaves badly and does n't hold to moral values .
Scroll down for more ...
Some of the rules are obvious , such as that absolute silence and secrecy - " omerta " - must be kept at all times .
Along with the rules , police found a holy image bearing the Mafia initiation ritual .
The wording is : " I swear to be faithful to Cosa Nostra .
If I should betray it , my flesh must burn , just as this image burns . "
Lo Piccolo apparently carried the papers everywhere with him in a brown leather briefcase .
People do not just say they enjoy expensive things more than cheap ones .
They actually do enjoy them more
Alamy
EVERYONE loves a bargain .
But retailers know that people will sometimes turn their noses up at a cheap version of a more expensive item , even if the two are essentially the same .
That suggests something is at work in the mind of the consumer beyond simple appreciation of a product 's intrinsic qualities .
The something in question is expectation , according to research published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Antonio Rangel of the California Institute of Technology .
Dr Rangel and his colleagues found that if people are told a wine is expensive while they are drinking it , they really do think it tastes nicer than a cheap one , rather than merely saying that they do .
Dr Rangel came to this conclusion by scanning the brains of 20 volunteers while giving them sips of wine .
He used a trick called functional magnetic - resonance imaging , which can detect changes in the blood flow in parts of the brain that correspond to increased mental activity .
He looked in particular at the activity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex .
This is an area of the brain that previous experiments have shown is responsible for registering pleasant experiences .
Dr Rangel gave his volunteers sips of what he said were five different wines made from cabernet sauvignon grapes , priced at between $ 5 and $ 90 a bottle .
He told each of them the price of the wine in question as he did so .
Except , of course , that he was fibbing .
He actually used only three wines .
He served up two of them twice at different prices .
What is truth ?
The scanner showed that the activity of the medial orbitofrontal cortices of the volunteers increased in line with the stated price of the wine .
For example , when one of the wines was said to cost $ 10 a bottle it was rated less than half as good as when people were told it cost $ 90 a bottle , its true retail price .
Moreover , when the team carried out a follow - up blind tasting without price information they got different results .
The volunteers reported differences between the three “ real ” wines but not between the same wines when served twice .
Nor was the effect confined to everyday drinkers .
When Dr Rangel repeated the experiment on members of the Stanford University wine club he got similar results .
All of which raises the question of what is going on .
There are at least two possibilities .
The point of learning is to improve an individual 's chances of surviving and reproducing : if the experience and opinions of others can be harnessed to that end , so much the better .
Dr Rangel suspects that what he has found is a mechanism for learning quickly what has helped others in the past , and thus for allowing choices about what is nice and what is nasty to be made speedily and efficiently .
In modern society , price is probably a good proxy for such collective wisdom .
However , goods can be desirable for a reason other than survival value .
Many of the things for which high price is an enhancement are purchased in order to show off , as any male confronted with the wine list in a fancy restaurant knows .
Indeed , conspicuous consumption and waste are an important part of social display .
Deployed properly , they bring the rewards of status and better mating opportunities .
For this to work , though , it helps if the displaying individual really believes that what he is buying is not only more expensive than the alternative , but better , too .
Truly enjoying something simply because it is exclusive thus makes evolutionary sense .
Besides its role in giving cachet to wine , this may be the explanation for the sort of modern art that leaves the man in the street cold .
Art collecting is a high - status activity par excellence .
Many lowlier mortals regard it as pretentious .
If Dr Rangel is right , though , pretence may not be the true explanation .
The collector who has paid millions for a plain - coloured canvas or a pickled sheep probably really does think it is beautiful .
Whichever explanation is correct ( and both might be ) , Dr Rangel 's research also has implications for retailers , marketing firms and luxury - goods producers .
It suggests that a successful marketing campaign can not only make people more interested in a product , but also , truly , make them enjoy it more .

With medical costs rising , record numbers of people losing their coverage and healthcare at the top of the domestic agenda , health insurers found themselves Wednesday in the cross-hairs of regulators , elected officials and law enforcement in California and across the nation .
New York Atty .
Gen. Andrew Cuomo said the nation ’s largest health insurers have rigged rates they pay for physician visits , leaving patients with higher medical bills .
In Los Angeles , City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo has assembled a team of investigators and prosecutors to probe industry practices such as canceling patients ’ coverage after they get sick .
Today he is set to unveil a first - of - its - kind website to solicit information about insurance cancellations and delays and denials of treatment .
The announcements follow a yearlong string of fines and citations against insurers in California .
Just last month , amid widening state probes , state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner decided to seek as much as $ 1.3 billion in penalties from Cypress - based PacifiCare as a result of widespread claim problems .

“ Our healthcare system is broken , and it ’s going to take a team effort to fix it , ” Delgadillo said .
“ Through our combined efforts , and the efforts of other prosecutors throughout this nation , we can make a real difference in stamping out fraud and abuse , and secure for American consumers the protection they deserve . ”
The crackdown echoes the frustration of consumers who revolted in the early 1990s against new health maintenance organizations , many of which sought to cut costs by rigidly regulating patients ’ freedom to choose doctors and limiting the medical care they would cover .
Insurers defend their business practices , saying one of their top goals is to keep health insurance affordable for all .
In fact , they say , many of the practices in the spotlight actually are good examples of their value in holding down healthcare costs .
“ At a time when the costs of medical services soar above inflation every year , health insurance plans ’ tools and techniques are mitigating the damage done to consumers and employers , ” said Karen Ignagni , president of America ’s Health Insurance Plans , a Washington - based trade group , speaking about the Cuomo announcement .

Once again , however , patients , physicians and hospitals are complaining in lawsuits and to public officials that health insurers are running roughshod over them .
Politicians are hearing the complaints -- and finding ways to embrace this hot issue .
Presidential candidates all have health insurance platforms , some of them critical of insurers .
Poizner and Cuomo are seen as likely gubernatorial candidates .
Delgadillo ’s term as elected city attorney expires this year , and he is ineligible for another .
But he , too , is seen as a candidate for another elected office .
Cuomo alleged in a news conference Wednesday that a company called Ingenix helped its parent , UnitedHealth Group , and other insurers low - ball payments to physicians who provided care to patients outside their healthcare networks .
The company sells data to insurers who decide how much they will reimburse patients for out - of - network visits .
If insurers pay less , physicians may bill patients for the difference .
Advertisement
For example , he said , a market survey showed physicians typically charge $ 200 for a routine visit .
But the insurers , using Ingenix data , claimed to their members that the typical rate was $ 77 .
Applying the 80 % reimbursement rate , they covered $ 62 , leaving the patient to pay $ 138 out of pocket .
“ Getting insurance companies to keep their promises and cover medical costs can be hard enough as it is , ” Cuomo said in a news conference .
“ But when insurers like United create convoluted and dishonest systems for determining the rate of reimbursement , real people get stuck with excessive bills and are less likely to seek the care they need . ”
Cuomo said Ingenix data are used by the nation ’s five largest insurers , including UnitedHealth , which purchased California ’s PacifiCare two years ago .
Cuomo added that the alleged scheme could affect 70 % of Americans with health coverage .
His office issued subpoenas for information to several big health insurers , including Health Net Inc. , Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp .
The insurers pledged to cooperate with the investigation .
United defended the integrity of Ingenix data , saying it was “ rigorously developed , geographically specific , comprehensive and organized using a transparent methodology that is very common in the healthcare industry . ”

Noting the pending California allegations against United , American Medical Assn.
President - elect Nancy Nielsen said Cuomo ’s complaint suggests a broader pattern of improper business practices and “ calls into question the validity of a system that health insurers have used for years to reimburse physicians and their enrolled members . ”
Insurance trade groups said the use of data to standardize medical reimbursements shows the value insurers bring to healthcare .
“ It ’s unfortunate that today ’s media event ignored these facts and failed to address the appropriateness of charging out - of - network patients $ 200 for ‘ simple doctor visits ’ lasting ’ 15 minutes ’ -- which equates to a billing rate of at least $ 800 an hour , ” said Ignagni of America ’s Health Insurance Plans .
“ As medical costs continue to soar , this is the discussion that public policy leaders need to have . ”
Working for several months , the Los Angeles city attorney ’s task force is focused on industry practices that affect patients financially as well as medically .
Advertisement
The website to be launched today -- www.protectingtheinsured.org -- invites patients , physicians and hospitals , as well as current and former insurance employees , to provide information on problems they ’ve had with insurers .
“ At a patient ’s most vulnerable moment , the insurance company wo n’t pay for care or will cancel the policy altogether , ” Delgadillo said .
“ Industry schemes to maximize profits at the expense of patients are unfair and unlawful , and must be stopped . ”
The task force includes former FBI agents with experience investigating healthcare fraud and white - collar crime , as well as veteran prosecutors .
It is headed by Jeffrey Isaacs , a former assistant U.S. attorney who led high - profile corporate and white - collar federal cases .
State law authorizes city attorneys ’ offices to bring criminal and civil enforcement actions against businesses engaging in unlawful , unfair or fraudulent practices as well as deceptive or false advertising .
The city attorney is also empowered to sue firms operating , headquartered or doing business in Los Angeles when the facts suggest they have broken the law .

The city attorney could seek restitution for victims -- such as restoration of insurance coverage -- as well as civil penalties and other remedies .
The task force was initially focusing on insurers ’ widely disputed practice of canceling patients with individual policies after they submitted claims for medical care .

Remember that game Super Paper Mario that came out for that system the Wii ?
Yeah , you might have heard of it .
And remember how it revolutionized platformers by offering levels that could be played in 2D and 3D ?
Yeah , it was pretty neat ; I could n’t agree with you more .
Well , forget everything about that game and feast your eyes on upcoming PC indie game Fez .
Honestly , I do n’t have any words for how freakin’ cool the above gameplay footage is .
This gem in the making apparently exists somewhere here at GDC and I am determined to find it before the week is over .
Operation : Play Fez begins !
While not much info is known about this Independent Games Festival finalist , Fez is obviously a platformer with a ridiculously cute ( and adorably animated ) main character .
That is all well and good , but the minute I saw the game break the traditional 2D perspective and morph into this crazy 2D / 3D ridiculously well - designed hybrid I almost fell of my chair and cried with happiness .
Okay , fine , I did fall off my chair and cry with happiness .
But it was all worth it .
If this is a sign of what game design is going to be like in the future , I am so happy to be a part of this industry .
Fez is getting a lot of buzz here in San Francisco and rightfully so .
I have to get my hands on this thing .
Is it too early to call “ game of the show ? ”
The Chancellor said the public would gain after the market improved Darling statement
The crisis in graphics Northern Rock is to be nationalised as a temporary measure , Chancellor Alistair Darling has said .
Neither of the two private proposals to take over the beleaguered bank offered " sufficient value for money to the taxpayer " , Mr Darling said .
He said the public would gain if the government held on to Northern Rock until market conditions improved .
Ron Sandler , nominated by the government to run Northern Rock , said savers ' deposits would be secure .
' Dither and delay '
But shadow chancellor George Osborne told the BBC that the Conservatives would oppose plans to nationalise Northern Rock .
" After months of dither and delay we have ended up with this catastrophic decision , " said Mr Osborne .
" We now have the situation where the government will be making decisions on whether or not to foreclose on people 's loans in a falling housing market , " he added .
The Government is totally financially inept and I certainly would n't give it the keys to my piggy bank
Armand Borisewitz
Northern Rock shareholder
The Rock : your comments
In quotes : reaction to move Is Darling still in control ?
A consortium led by the Virgin group was leading bids to run the beleaguered bank , while a management buyout had also been considered .
But ministers have decided that nationalisation - the first such move since the 1970s - was the only option .
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson criticised the government 's decision : " We believe we had a very strong proposal , an experienced team and one of Britain 's best brands .
" We believe nationalisation is not the right answer and that a commercial solution would have been the best way forward . "
Ill - prepared Explaining the government 's decision , Mr Darling said : " It is better for the Government to hold on to Northern Rock for a temporary period and as and when market conditions improve the value of Northern Rock will grow and therefore the taxpayer will gain . "
" The long - term ownership of this bank must lie in the private sector " .
Northern
Rock got itself into financial difficulties last year because its business model left it ill - prepared for the global credit crunch .
It was forced to ask the Bank of England for emergency funding , triggering the first run on a British bank in more than a century .
The bank will be run at arm 's length and on a commercial basis
Alistair Darling
Chancellor 's statement in full Q&A : the nationalisation Nationalisation will be pushed though parliament with emergency legislation on Monday .
Shares in Northern Rock will be suspended on Monday morning .
Under nationalisation rules , shareholders will be offered compensation for their holding , at a level set by a Government - appointed panel .
Investors could begin legal action if they are unhappy with the amount offered , with BBC Business Editor Robert Peston saying that it was " inevitable " that the government would be sued by shareholders who felt they had been " fleeced " .
Job threat UK taxpayers are now subsidising the bank in loans and guarantees to other lenders to the tune of about £ 55 bn .
The Treasury now feels that nationalisation offers the most certainty of securing these guarantees , Mr Peston said .
It is thought that the business model it proposes will be similar to those put forward by the Virgin Group and the in - house management consortium .
These were likely to see a downsizing of the bank , with job cuts among its 4,300 employees likely , observers say .
Ron Sandler says it will be " business as usual " at the bank
Recovery is new boss 's goal The Treasury had already recruited Mr Sandler , the former boss of the Lloyd's of London insurance market , to lead Northern Rock , in case it were nationalised .
Mr Sandler is widely regarded as having restored confidence in Lloyd 's after its years in financial disarray .
He said the changes would have no impact on the guarantees made to lenders , or the government - backed support for savers ' deposits .
" It is business as usual , " he said .
Mr Sandler is well known to Prime Minister Gordon Brown , and worked for the Treasury in developing the so - called stakeholder pension and investment products that were intended to help those on lower incomes save for retirement .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It 's easy to knock the government but they did n't cause this problem Simon , London Chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee John McFall said that he welcomed the Government 's decision to nationalise .
" They have explored every avenue .
At the end of the day the biggest issue is the safeguarding of taxpayers ' money .
If nationalisation saves that money , that has to be the correct step in the long term . "
Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Vince Cable said that the right decision had been taken , though " belatedly " , and that the government should have walked away from the prospect of a private takeover some time ago .
" The important thing now is to do the right thing and the government has got to immediately establish what the problems are with this bank . "

What are these ?
WASHINGTON  Videotape of the Navy mission to shoot down a dying spy satellite made available Thursday shows an interceptor missile ascending atop a bright trail of burning fuel , and then a flash , a fireball , a plume of vapor .
A cloud of debris left little doubt that the missile had squarely hit its mark as the satellite spent its final days orbiting more than 130 miles above the Pacific Ocean .
A different kind of doubt still lingers , though , expressed by policy analysts , some politicians and scientists , and not a few foreign powers , especially China and Russia :
Should the people of the world be breathing a sigh of relief that the risk of a half - ton of frozen , toxic rocket fuel landing who knows where has passed ?
Or should they be worried about the latest display of the United States ’ technical prowess , and see it as a thinly veiled test for a shadow antisatellite program ?
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , who personally gave the order to go ahead with the satellite shootdown Wednesday , told reporters in Hawaii on Thursday that he was prepared to share some details of the operation with China to ease its concerns that the debris might still prove dangerous .
Adm. Timothy J. Keating , the commander of American forces in the Pacific , has reached out to several nations in the region to explain the mission , as well .
Addressing the diplomatic concerns , senior officials dismissed questions raised by the Chinese and the Russians , and echoed by some arms control analysts , about whether the episode was really a test of space weaponry .
They pointed out that the missile used in the operation , the Navy ’s SM - 3 interceptor , was designed to counter a limited ballistic missile attack and had to be reprogrammed for this unexpected task , the likes of which the authorities are unlikely ever to face again .
Study : Spanking May Lead to Sexual Problems Later Researchers say the discipline tactic can lead to risky sexual behaviors .
Feb. 28 , 2008  --
Children whose parents spank them or otherwise inflict physical punishment may be more likely to have sexual problems later , according to research to be presented Thursday to the American Psychological Association .
The analysis of four studies by Murray Straus , co-director of the Family Research Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire - Durham , suggests that children whose parents spanked , slapped , hit or threw objects at them may have a greater chance of physically or verbally coercing a sexual partner , engaging in risky sexual behavior or engaging in masochistic sex , including sexual arousal by spanking .
" It increases the chances of sexual problems , " though " it 's not a one - to - one causation , " Straus says .
Elizabeth Gershoff , an assistant professor of social work at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor , who reviewed 80 years of spanking research in 2002 in the APA 's Psychological Bulletin , says Straus ' work appears to be the first to link spanking with sexual problems .
Gershoff says that though many children have been spanked ( 85 percent in one 2007 survey ) , problems may depend on how they process the spanking .
" They may internalize that to mean that in loving relationships sometimes there 's pain or physical aggression , " she says .
Another possible lesson is that " whoever is stronger and has more power can overpower the other person and use physical aggression to control the other person 's behavior . "
But linking sexual problems with spanking is a " big leap , " says human - sexuality researcher John DeLamater of the University of Wisconsin .
" It 's probably one of many elements that might contribute to sex problems or risky sex , but it 's a long leap . "
Most children who are spanked escape from long - term harm , says Straus , 81 , a sociology professor who says he occasionally spanked his own children but later became a staunch critic of spanking .
His work on violence in families is regarded as landmark research .
He is scheduled to present the studies today at the psychological association 's Summit on Violence and Abuse in Relationships in Bethesda , Md . Three are yet unpublished ; one has been submitted to a journal .
He plans to include two in a book this year .
The fourth was included in a 1994 book .
The two most recent studies examine sexual coercion and risky practices among 14,252 college students between 2001 and 2006 .
The third study , of 440 high school students from New Hampshire , examined risky sex , such as premarital sex without a condom .
The fourth study , of 207 students from the Northeast , focused on masochistic sex .
In each case , Straus found that those who had experienced corporal punishment had increased probability of coercing sex , risky sex or masochistic sex .
The literature on effectiveness of spanking to correct behavior is still " very mixed , " says Robert Larzelere of Oklahoma State University , who has studied parents ' disciplinary methods .
" Like any discipline tactic , it depends on how it 's used , " he says .
The cost to the taxpayer of abandoned Whitehall computer projects since 2000 has reached almost £ 2bn , not including the bill for an online crime reporting site that was cancelled this week , a survey by the Guardian reveals .
The failure of the multimillion - pound police site marks the latest chapter in the government 's litany of botched IT projects , with several costly schemes biting the dust .
Blunders overseen by Downing Street have included the much - derided £ 486 m computer upgrade at the Child Support Agency ( CSA ) , which collapsed and forced a £ 1bn claims write - off , and an adult learning programme that was subjected to extensive fraud .
Top of the ministries for wasting public money is the Department for Work and Pensions , which is responsible for squandering more than £ 1.6bn by abandoning three major schemes — a new benefit card which was based on outdated technology ; the upgrade to the CSA 's computer which could not handle 1.2 m existing claims ; and a £ 140 m streamlined benefit payment system that never worked properly .
The Guardian 's survey of abandoned projects is not exhaustive and the total of £ 1.865bn is likely to be a considerable underestimate of the actual cost to taxpayers because neither Whitehall nor the National Audit Office , parliament 's financial watchdog , keep definitive lists of which schemes go wrong .
Also it does not include the major modifications required to fix new systems that have failed to perform as required .
One example is the pilot work done on the new £ 12bn NHS computer system .
Outdated technology was installed at Bexley hospital in south London , and it has had to be replaced after it was found to be " unfit for purpose " .
Another example is the huge modification required to a new computerised single payments system for farmers run by the environment ministry Defra 's Rural Payments Agency .
The government has had to set aside about £ 300 m to meet possible EU fines for making the wrong payments to thousands of farmers .
The abandoned police site , which was launched in 2003 , allowed the public to report non-urgent crimes and provide photographic and video evidence through the internet .
The system — linked to police forces around the country — then prioritised the information and distributed it to the correct forces .
It was being used to report about 30,000 crimes a year but began to falter when defence technology company Qinetiq was brought in to build a replacement in 2005 .
Costs began to spiral and the new system was deemed to be unfit for purpose , resulting in suspension of the service last March and closure in December .
The deal is now subject to a legal dispute , with Qinetiq claiming that it has completed the work it was contracted to do .
The National Police Improvement Agency , which manages IT systems for the police , would not give details of how much money had been spent on the portal , but documents obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act showed that running costs had risen above £ 5 m a year in 2006 .
The replacement system was not fit for live use due to " a range of serious defects and delays , " a spokeswoman said .
" It is not possible to issue more details as it is now subject to legal proceedings . "
Earlier this year , one senior Whitehall official called into question the heavy spend and high rate of failure .
Joe Harley , programme and systems delivery officer at the Department for Work and Pensions , said the government 's £ 14bn annual spend on IT could be used to build thousands of schools every year or to employ hundreds of thousands of nurses in the NHS .
" Today only 30 % , we estimate , of our projects and programmes are successful , " he told a conference .
" It is not sustainable for us as a government to continue to spend at these levels .
We need to up the quality of what we do at a reduced cost of doing so . "
The extensive list of failed projects calls into question other major government IT programmes , such as the proposed £ 5 bn ID cards scheme .

It took investigators two years to infiltrate and bring down UK - based OiNK , an invite - only music sharing site that was much loved by its smallish community .
As we reported at the time , the IFPI and the BPI lauded the takedown as a major victory against piracy .
After the echoes of OiNK 's final snort dissipated , one could hear the virtual rumbling of a new stampede : the post -OiNK explosion .
The closure of OiNK has led directly or indirectly to the establishment of nearly half a dozen new file - sharing sites .
Is this what the IFPI and BPI had in mind ?
Somehow we doubt it .
The theory is that " busts " will eventually drive such sites out of existence , as they need to go deeper and deeper " underground " to avoid being busted .
What appears to actually be happening is something quite different : the free advertising for P2P that comes from these closures not only helps spread the word about the existence of such sites , but it also appears to motivate more folks to step up their involvement in setting up , running , and supporting such sites .
In short , it 's a call to arms .
It 's also not hard to find out where the OiNK action has moved to , either .
In the last three days , Ars writers have been able to gain access to nearly all of the new sites to pop up in the wake of OiNK , and the reasons why are so simple , yet utterly elusive to those who are working day and night to close these sites : it 's not the supply of " P2P sites " that drives this , it 's the demand from users online , across the globe .
Supply is not the same as demand
The Romans had a funny way of looking at social disorder .
In general , they viewed leaders as far greater threats than those they led .
This gave way to the kind of social " management " school that preferred to brutally punish or kill a leader , while letting everyone else go .
The Romans , as you may know , had more than their share of uprisings , riots , and all - out revolts as a result .
The focus on shutting down popular P2P / BitTorrent tracker sites operates under the same philosophical strategy : cut off the head , and the body should die .
Shut down the site , and now you have thousands of users who can't be pirates anymore .
Of course , never was there such a silly — or obviously wrong — idea .
The response to the death of OiNK was not a withering of the file - sharing community .
Instead , what happened was the establishment or planned launch of three major new P2P sites and at least two underground networks .
The Pirate Bay did its usual thing and announced their plans to resurrect OiNK as the cleverly - named BOiNK ; Torrent Freak brought news of The Pirate Bay 's plans to everyone several days ago , but BOiNK is still nowhere to be seen .
Given the fact that these guys brought Suprnova back , there 's little reason to doubt them , though .
Meanwhile , both What.cd and Waffles.fm have stepped into the void created by OiNK 's closure , as have two underground services claimed to have been started by former members .
dAiMeSeL , an administrator for one of the DC ++ hubs who corresponded with Ars Technica anonymously , said that plans for their hub were already under way when OiNK was shut down , but that the closure only helped feed the demand for a new site .
dAiMeSeL said that the demand to admit new users was too high , and that the big worry is that " another mole could slip in . "
Waffles.fm is also having growing problems .
The site has had to ask its members to refrain from selling invites to the invitation - only service .
The invites are in high demand , but someone could also risk the community 's security by selling invites off to a mole .
Then the site pulled the plug on all new registrations , as the admins found it difficult to keep up with demand .
In an interview with Threat Level , a site admin said the site was also the target of a DoS attack in its earliest days , apparently from a disgruntled OiNK member who did n't get an invite .
By and large , however , the story is one of cooperation and recovery .
It 's not professional site admins who really make any of this possible .
It 's the throng of users who will , at a moment 's notice , become site admins or contribute in other ways to rapidly bring up not one , but a handful of potential replacements in a time of " need . "
This is the reason why you can't kill the OiNKs and Suprnovas of the world , and expect change .
The demand is there , and so is the technology to keep this game of cat and mouse going for a very long time .
news Obay Unveiled
Since fake pharmaceutical ads for a drug called “ Obay ” starting appearing across Ontario ( and elsewhere ) last week , everyone from street artist Frank Shepard Fairey ( aka OBEY ) to Scientologists to comedian Maggie Cassella has been fingered as the culprit behind them .
Last Friday , three days after the ads seem to have launched , we traced them , with no small amount of confidence , to a substantially less dramatic source––Colleges Ontario , an advocacy organization representing twenty - four colleges across the province .
The organization would neither confirm nor deny their involvement to either Torontoist or , several days later , The Star , but still told us all to wait a few weeks for …something .
As far as mysterious ad campaigns go , this one was almost perfect : only breadcrumbs to trace back to the source , a city left to talk about the ad and its message and what it all meant ( which , of course , was precisely the point ) .
But it ’s finally official : Rob Savage , Colleges Ontario ’s Director of Communications , called Torontoist moments ago to confirm that Colleges Ontario is indeed behind the ads , and the organization just sent out a press release with information about a media launch event next Monday at ( fittingly ) Centennial College that promises to reveal “ the news behind Obay and its side effects on Ontario ’s Post - secondary Education . ”
Torontoist will be there .

South Africa announced Monday that it would allow the killing of elephants as a population control , a move strongly condemned by animal welfare groups .
Beginning in May , the government will lift a 13 - year ban on elephant culls , usually carried out by shooting entire herds , including youngsters , from helicopters .
The move could hurt the country ’s tourist industry , with animal welfare lobbies calling for a tourist boycott to protest culling .
South Africa slaughtered more than 14,500 elephants from 1967 to 1995 , before halting the practice because of international pressure .

“ From 1 May there will no longer be as a policy a moratorium on the culling of elephants .
We will allow culling in certain parts of the country .
But there is no intention of wholesale slaughter , ” Environment Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk said Monday .
The guidelines call for humane killing , specifying that a rifle of at least .375 caliber be used .
Sharpshooters usually kill entire herds because of the complex social structure of elephants and because the young need to be taught social behavior by adults in order to survive .
Animal welfare organizations , which strongly oppose the reintroduction of culling , said there was no humane way to kill elephants .
Animal Rights Africa vowed to campaign for a tourist boycott .
Though elephants are endangered in other parts of Africa , the population in South Africa is robust .
But the issue of culling is emotional for many , because of elephants ’ intelligence and elaborate social behaviors .
Elephants have been known to grieve for their dead .

South Africa has 18,000 elephants , including more than 12,500 in Kruger National Park , one of the country ’s major tourist attractions .
SANParks , the agency in charge of parks and national game reserves , called for culling in a 2005 report to the government , arguing that too many elephants threaten other species .
Van Schalkwyk said Monday that there was also concern about elephants ’ effect on the landscape and the people living near the herds .
Before culling , reserve managers will have to prove that they have excess elephants and that killing is the only effective option .
“ We do n’t support culling in any shape or form , ” Christina Pretorius , Cape Town - based spokeswoman for the International Fund for Animal Welfare , said in a telephone interview .
“ We do n’t believe there ’s any humane way to cull .

“ Culling elephants is not going to be popular .
. . .
Certainly people will take that into account when making decisions about where they ’re going to take their holidays , ” she said .
Pretorius called on the government to ensure that the guidelines allowing culling were properly enforced .
If culling is carried out , she said , “ it has to be subject to very serious checks and balances . ”
Animal Rights Africa said culling was “ cruel and morally reprehensible , ” and that elephants have emotions similar to those of humans .
Advertisement
“ The latest research has proved that elephants have a sense of self - awareness , placing them in a unique category with great apes , dolphins and humans , ” the organization said .
“ How much like us do elephants have to be before killing them becomes murder ? ”
Pretorius said the IFAW did not believe that all other options had been properly examined , such as the creation of so - called transfrontier parks to allow elephant populations to roam freely from one country to another .
Proponents of transfrontier parks say that as elephant populations wander to different regions , season by season , the environment has time to recover .
Some researchers are working on elephant vasectomies and female contraceptives , but these are expensive and are practical only in limited populations where all individuals are identifiable .
Susan Lieberman , global species director for the World Wildlife Fund , said in a telephone interview that she believed there were humane culling methods but did not want to speculate on which these were .
Advertisement
“ It ’s not something anybody welcomes at all , but we also have to look at the broader conservation management issues , ” she said .
“ The option of doing nothing does not exist .
We have immense sympathy for wildlife managers in South Africa .
They ca n’t just walk away and ignore it . ”

Berkeley -- Physicists at the University of California , Berkeley , have built the smallest radio yet - a single carbon nanotube one ten - thousandth the diameter of a human hair that requires only a battery and earphones to tune in to your favorite station .
The scientists successfully received their first FM broadcast last year - Derek & The Dominos ' " Layla " and the Beach Boys ' " Good Vibrations " transmitted from across the room .
In homage to last year 's 100th anniversary of the first voice and music radio transmission , they also transmitted and successfully tuned in to the first music piece broadcast in 1906 , " Largo " from George Frederic Handel 's opera " Xerxes . "
" We were just in ecstasy when this worked , " said team leader Alex Zettl , UC Berkeley professor of physics .
" It was fantastic . "
The nanoradio , which is currently configured as a receiver but could also work as a transmitter , is 100 billion times smaller than the first commercial radios , and could be used in any number of applications - from cell phones to microscopic devices that sense the environment and relay information via radio signals , Zettl said .
Because it is extremely energy efficient , it would integrate well with microelectronic circuits .
" The nanotube radio may lead to radical new applications , such as radio - controlled devices small enough to exist in a human 's bloodstream , " the authors wrote in a paper published online today by the journal Nano Letters .
The paper will appear in the print edition of Nano Letters later this month .
Authors of the nanoradio paper are Zettl , graduate student Kenneth Jensen , and their colleagues in UC Berkeley 's Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems ( COINS ) and in the Materials Sciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( LBNL ) .
COINS is a Nanoscale Science and Engineering Research Center supported by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) .
Nanotubes are rolled - up sheets of interlocked carbon atoms that form a tube so strong that some scientists have suggested using a nanotube wire to tether satellites in a fixed position above Earth .
The nanotubes also exhibit unusual electronic properties because of their size , which , for the nanotubes used in the radio receiver , are about 10 nanometers in diameter and several hundred nanometers long .
A nanometer is one billionth of a meter ; a human hair is about 50,000 - 100,000 nanometers in diameter .
In the nanoradio , a single carbon nanotube works as an all - in - one antenna , tuner , amplifier and demodulator for both AM and FM .
These are separate components in a standard radio .
A demodulator removes the AM or FM carrier frequency , which is in the kiloHertz and megaHertz range , respectively , to retrieve the lower frequency broadcast information .
The nanoradio detects radio signals in a radically new way - it vibrates thousands to millions of times per second in tune with the radio wave .
This makes it a true nanoelectromechanical device , dubbed NEMS , that integrates the mechanical and electrical properties of nanoscale materials .
In a normal radio , ambient radio waves from different transmitting stations generate small currents at different frequencies in the antenna , while a tuner selects one of these frequencies to amplify .
In the nanoradio , the nanotube , as the antenna , detects radio waves mechanically by vibrating at radio frequencies .
The nanotube is placed in a vacuum and hooked to a battery , which covers its tip with negatively charged electrons , and the electric field of the radio wave pushes and pulls the tip thousands to millions of times per second .
While large objects , like a stiff wire or a wooden ruler pinned at one end , vibrate at low frequencies - between tens and hundreds of times per second - the tiny nanotubes vibrate at high frequencies ranging from kiloHertz ( thousands of times per second ) to hundreds of megaHertz ( 100 million times per second ) .
Thus , a single nanotube naturally selects only one frequency .
Although it might seem that the vibrating nanotube yields a " one station " radio , the tension on the nanotube also influences its natural vibration frequency , just as the tension on a guitar string fine tunes its pitch .
As a result , the physicists can tune in a desired frequency or station by " pulling " on the free tip of the nanotube with a positively charged electrode .
This electrode also turns the nanotube into an amplifier .
The voltage is high enough to pull electrons off the tip of the nanotube and , because the nanotube is simultaneously vibrating , the electron current from the tip is an amplified version of the incoming radio signal .
This is similar to the field - emission amplification of old vacuum tube amplifiers used in early radios and televisions , Zettl said .
The amplified output of this simple nanotube device is enough to drive a very sensitive earphone .
Finally , the field - emission and vibration together also demodulate the signal .
" I hate to sound like I 'm selling a Ginsu knife - But wait , there 's more !
It also slices and dices ! - but this one nanotube does everything ; it performs all radio functions simultaneously and extremely efficiently , " Zettl said .
" It 's ridiculously simple - that 's the beauty of it . "
Zettl 's team assembles the nanoradios very simply , too .
From nanotubes copiously produced in a carbon arc , they glue several to a fixed electrode .
In a vacuum , they bring the electrode within a few microns of a second electrode , close enough for electrons to jump to it from the closest nanotube and create an electrical circuit .
To achieve the desired length of the active nanotube , the team first runs a large current through the nanotube to the second electrode , which makes carbon atoms jump off the tip of the nanotube , trimming it down to size for operation within a particular frequency band .
Connect a battery and earphones , and voila !
Reception by the initial radios is scratchy , which Zettl attributes in part to insufficient vacuum .
In future nanoradios , a better vacuum can be obtained by insuring a cleaner environment , or perhaps by encasing the single nanotube inside a second , larger non-conducting nanotube , thereby retaining the nanoscale .
Zettl wo n't only be tuning in to oldies stations with his nanoradio .
Because the radio static is actually the sound of atoms jumping on and off the tip of the nanotube , he hopes to use the nanoradio to sense the identity of atoms or even measure their masses , which is done today by cumbersome large mass spectrometers .

いきなりお仕事の愚痴で申し訳ないのです。
私たちが作っている機器の下位ユニットのソフトの出来が酷いです。
どういう風に酷いかというと、ちょっと通信ログみれば一発で（仕様をしらない人間でも「ああ、こりゃコピペして修正を途中し忘れたな」と解るような）バグが普通にあったり、2個同じものをもつ構成なのに片方づつ全く違う挙動をしたり（バグも両ポートで違う^^ ;) 。もちろん(? )
コッチを直せばアッチがデグレードで、いつまで経ってもまともに動くようになりやしません。
で、あまりの酷さゆえ、彼らのコードのレビューが開かれたのですが。おぉ、これは凄い。こんなに見事なコードをみたのは初めてでした。
最長不倒関数、芸術的字下げ、strcat の嵐、グローバル変数の多用(しかも同類を構造体に纏める事すらしない)、コメント無し・define
無しで使われる数多のマジックナンバー、strcat の嵐、ナンバリングされた変数名、関数名、..etc.Cプログラミング診断室の駄目な部分を抽出して見事に贅肉をそぎ落としたような、余りに美しくも完璧なダメコード。
実は残念ながらレビューには同席できなかったので（他がトラブっていたです
TT ) 、私は後日コードをみせてもらったのですが、あまりの見事さに笑いがこみあげてきちゃって、あたしゃクック、クックと笑ってしまいました。（本人の目の前でなくてよかった）
そんなコードに、巨大なフローチャート(A3で印刷してもミニマム文字だよ）というおまけ付き。もう完璧です。
* * *
しかし、レビューへの突っ込みに対する彼らの受け答えは、コード以上に想像を絶するものだったそうです。以下伝聞ですし、けっこう誇張が入っているかもしれませんが、でもだいたいこんな感じだったそうな。
Q. 2個同じ機器を抱えているが、コードも2つある。共通関数化しないか
A. 2個同じものがある機器構成でもセンサ類のレジスタは別になる。だから共通の関数にできないのは
あたりまえ だ
Q. 関数が尋常じゃない長 さ( 700 行 ) なので可読性のため分割しませんか
A. 関数コールであちこちに飛ぶ方が かえって読みにくい * 1
* 1 A. そもそも、 コードの可読性は品質には影響しない 。可読性をあげて良いことがあるのか 。
Q. 定数がコードに直に書かれているが、これを # define にしないと 置き換えが大変ではない か
A. 定数は仕様だ。変わらないでしょ？ 変わらないなら変更を考慮する必要はない のでは 。
のでは。 A. 可読性？可読性を挙げても(ry
Q. とにかくコードが酷い。そもそも 構造化プログラミング は知っているの か
A. 構造化プログラミングは知っている。しかしいつでも適用できるモノという訳ではない
A. 見解の相違はあるかもしれないが、 これが我が社の文化（伝統的スタイル） であり、他の社員でもメンテナンスする関係上、 このスタイルを変えるつもりはな い
Q. コメントが殆どない。もう少し何とかならないか
A. コメントがあるとコードはかえって読みづらくなる
Q. 一度でもテストすれば発覚するような不具合が多すぎる。テストはしたのか？
A. テストはしていない 。これからは行うようにする 。
次から次に飛び出す破壊力抜群の迷言に、誰もがあっけにとられてしまったとのことです。笑うしかないよね、トホホ。

コードを見た同僚が ぽそり名言。 「 ここまでコードの共通化がされてないと、ホワイトボックステストでもブラックボックステストと変わらないよな・・・。」
...あぁ、そうね。ホントにそうですね ( T△T
The introduction of satellite images into map search interfaces has excited both virtual sightseers and local app developers .
Further innovations like Google ’s Street View have caused consternation from privacy advocates while further pumping up the buzz about online mapping .
In 2008 , we can expect further innovations that stretch the envelope while dynamic map interfaces solidify as basic table - stakes for all local sites .
In gearing up for this year in local search , I thought I ’d give you a pure entertainment piece — here ’s a guide to the top coolest things to see in Google Maps .
Yum !
Brands , Inc. ’s subsidiary , KFC , built this brilliant ad back in 2006 , geared to be viewable by space aliens .
It was purposefully built just off Extraterrestrial Highway , near Area 51 :
I pointed out the swastika - shaped building below back in 2006 , along with a few other map enthusiasts .
In September of 2007 , the U.S. Navy bowed to pressure from radio commentators and the Anti-Defamation League and agreed to change the building ’s profile at a cost of $ 600 k .
In the media feeding - frenzy , I got accused of “ costing the taxpayers $ 600 k ” on a few blogs and forums , and one or two flamewars broke out in the comments on my Flickr page .
Giant thumbprint in a park in Great Britain .
This thumbprint is actually a large maze designed by Chris Drury .
Evidence of drunken parking ?
This building in the Netherlands sports a Morris Mini parked on its side .
The lights on the car turn on at night .
Yet more Minis parked on a building — this time the Minis are parked on top of a pub in Great Britain .
When all the satellite pics are stitched together to allow users to pan continuously in mapping programs , there are frequently some funky effects which can happen at transition edges .
One common phenomenon is when two pics taken at different angles are spliced together , causing tall buildings and other structures to appear to be leaning sharply .
This is called the “ Escher Effect , ” and this sample comes from downtown Dallas :
This is purportedly the largest Coca - Cola logo in the world , created near Arica , Chile , out of something like 70,000 coke bottles to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the company :
Back in January of 2007 , Google publicly announced they were planning to send a plane over locations in Australia to update Google Maps images .
Quite a few people attempted to communicate messages by displaying large text on the ground for the “ Australia Day Flyover ” as it was called , but very few actually accomplished it due to a miscommunication over the date of the flight .
However , the Tourism Australia ministry managed it by paying a sand sculptor to form the letters of their domain name on Bondi Beach near Sydney :
“ Giant pink bunny , ” killed in a drive - by in Italy .
People are increasingly trying to get their messages seen in Google Maps satellite view , but most aerial messages already appearing in the pics were originally intended for people viewing from airplanes .
For instance , this message written in a field adjacent to Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska :
Some of the best - documented messages found in Google Maps have been marriage proposals like this one :
Another patriotic - themed image is this American flag found on a river bank in Pennsylvania :
Street View has raised all sorts of privacy concerns and people have taken great glee at pointing out people captured going into strip clubs , peeing in public , or doing various private activities .
In this example , one of the traditionally photo - shy superheroes , the Green Lantern , is the one caught by the roving camera eye , looking out a shop window in Boston :
There are quite a few pictorial mazes that show up in Google Maps , particularly corn mazes and such in the US .
This UK maze was built to celebrate the 200th birthday of Brunel , a famous British engineer :
There ’s a whole subgenre of art called “ Crop Art ” that ’s rendered in growing plants in patterns to form pictures when viewed from above .
This example is a rendering of Da Vinci ’s famous Vitruvian Man , located in Italy :
Similar to Crop Art , “ Earth Art ” or “ Land Art ” is created by moving or scraping soil and rocks to create images .
This huge image from a hillside in Mongolia celebrates Ghenghis Khan :
When the early Greek inventor Daedalus ’s son , Icarus , plummeted from the sky after his wax - and - feathers wings experiment failed , his body ’s impact left this deep indentation crater which subsequently filled with water , leaving this man-shaped lake in Brazil :
A man with the surname of “ Luecke ” in Texas decided to write his name big by leaving these trees when he was clear - cutting the land .
According to reports , astronauts are able to see these letters from space :
Quite a few companies promote themselves by painting their logos onto their building rooftops .
This example is particularly clever , since the Salvation Army apparently realized they could leverage their building ’s close proximity to the Seattle Seahawks Stadium and they ’ll forever after enjoy free promotion whenever news organizations fly over when covering sporting events .
One thing that some people spend a whole lot of time doing is looking for UFOs and Crop Circles .
Here ’s a really great crop circle of the Mozilla Firefox logo – a brilliant piece of promotion and linkbait if there ever was one :
We promised 20 awesome images .
Here ’s a bonus one :
OK , we faked that one !

That does n’t mean we always use language to convey reality .
Language is a social medium with social purposes .
Sometimes , we use it not to communicate facts about the world but to filter them .
We euphemize bribes as “ contributions ” to preserve the dignity of lobbyists and legislators .
We phrase treaties vaguely because if they were clear , nobody would sign them .
We invent subtle sexual overtures to avoid a confrontation if the other guy turns out not to be gay .
We complain about doublespeak but rely on double meanings .
These are the aspects of our duality : brain and mind , matter and metaphor , fact and frame , science and politics , information and implication .
Even their common lesson has two sides .
On the one hand , we must face the limits of our mental construction .
We have trouble understanding intellectual property because our ideas of possession and theft are based on physical objects .
We have trouble with evolution because we think of adaptation as something that individuals do in their lifetimes , not something a species does over generations .
We confuse differences in group averages with claims of group superiority .
We ’re prone to cronyism because our notions of community arose from family and tribe .
In criminal trials , we resist objective explanations of subjective behavior .
In sum , Pinker warns , “ the machinery of conceptual semantics makes us permanently vulnerable to fallacies in reasoning . ”
On the other hand , we are not imprisoned by them .
The dialectic of creativity and reality - testing has taken us far beyond other animals and can take us farther .
The next step is to dump our most natural and mistaken metaphor — education as the filling of empty minds — and recognize that we learn by extrapolating , testing , modifying and recombining mental models of the world .
That ’s the two - faceted human nature Pinker wants to show us through the window of language .
But as he does so , one more face appears in the glass : the reflection of the man looking into it .
Being a scientist is hard .
You ’re supposed to keep your personality out of the way , justifying every topic of interest by some larger theoretical goal .
Pinker tries .
“ I like to think I have a better reason to introduce you to my little friends , ” he pleads , referring to verbs and his infatuation with them .
But as Pinker ’s little friends consume the book , it becomes clear that he ’s a geek .
It starts on the first page .
The book is pegged to the anniversary of Sept. 11 , and that ’s the first topic Pinker addresses .
Here is Pinker ’s angle :
Was it one “ event ” or two ?
This question makes a $ 3.5 billion difference to the World Trade Center ’s owner and his insurance company , but you ’d be hard pressed to think up a more pointy - headed question about the murder of nearly 3,000 people .
The riffs continue : verb taxonomies , the nuances of “ politeness theory , ” the comparative languages of South American tribes .
At one point , Pinker draws up a game - theoretic matrix for the question “ Would you like to come up and see my etchings ? ”
Etchings , of course , are code for sex .
But in Pinker ’s case , you get the feeling that this guy actually would prefer to show you his etchings .
That ’s his kink .
He ’s interested in the stuff of life , but he ’s even more interested in how we depict it .

NASA 's Swift Satellite Catches a Galaxy Ablaze With Starbirth
Robert Naeye
Goddard Space Flight Center
Combining 39 individual frames taken over 11 hours of exposure time , NASA astronomers have created this ultraviolet mosaic of the nearby " Triangulum Galaxy . "
" This is the most detailed ultraviolet image of an entire galaxy ever taken , " says Stefan Immler of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. Immler used NASA ’s Swift satellite to take the images , and he then assembled them into a mosaic that seamlessly covers the entire galaxy .
The Triangulum Galaxy is also called M33 for being the 33rd object in Charles Messier ’s sky catalog .
It is located about 2.9 million light - years from Earth in the constellation Triangulum .
It is a member of our Local Group , the small cluster of galaxies that includes our Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy ( M31 ) .
Despite sharing our Milky Way ’s spiral shape , M33 has only about one - tenth the mass .
M33 ’s visible disk is about 50,000 light - years across , half the diameter of our galaxy .
Swift ’s Ultraviolet / Optical Telescope ( UVOT ) took the images through three separate ultraviolet filters from December 23 , 2007 to January 4 , 2008 .
The mosaic showcases UVOT ’s high spatial resolution .
Individual star clusters and star - forming gas clouds are clearly resolved , even in the crowded nucleus of the galaxy .
The image also includes Milky Way foreground stars and much more distant galaxies shining through M33 .
Young , hot stars are prodigious producers of ultraviolet light , which heat up the surrounding gas clouds to such high temperatures that they radiate brightly in ultraviolet light .
The image shows the giant star - forming region NGC 604 as a bright spot to the lower left of the galaxy ’s nucleus .
With a diameter of 1,500 light - years ( 40 times that of the Orion Nebula ) , NGC 604 is the largest stellar nursery in the Local Group .
" The ultraviolet colors of star clusters tell us their ages and compositions , " says Swift team member Stephen Holland of NASA Goddard .
" With Swift ’s high spatial resolution , we can zero in on the clusters themselves and separate out nearby stars and gas clouds .
This will enable us to trace the star - forming history of the entire galaxy .
” " The entire galaxy is ablaze with starbirth , " adds Immler .
" Despite M33 ’s small size , it has a much higher star - formation rate than either the Milky Way or Andromeda .
All of this starbirth lights up the galaxy in the ultraviolet .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday March 3 2008
We exaggerated the precociousness of John Stuart Mill in saying he wrote his famous work Utilitarianism in 1861 at the age of 19 in the article below .
He was 55 at the time .
Discuss the positive aspects of mental disorder , and the British public seems to feel threatened .
When actor Stephen Fry gave an account of his bipolar disorder , he was accused of " normalising " what was a " severe mental illness " , that he had the luxury of shunning treatment due to his privilege and wealth .
These sorts of criticisms missed the point : his wealth was earned largely because of his so - called disorder .
The years when he was contributing to hit TV shows such as A Bit of Fry and Laurie and Black Adder were largely fuelled by protracted periods of elevated mood - in the form of mild mania , or " hypomania " .
On the other hand , straightforward depression ( unipolar depression ) has no elated , productive , hypomanic side and , as a consequence , very few people have written about the positive aspects of the condition .
The focus has been on the acute symptoms of what can be an incapacitating illness , while forgetting that depression has meaning , and that there is a life after recovery .
The assumption that depression is a disease has been reinforced and perpetuated by biologists , psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies , all of whom have a vested interest - consciously or unconsciously - in the clinical perspective .
This might be an appropriate model for the more severe " melancholic " forms of depression that psychiatrists tend to see , but not for the majority of cases of depression .
Most depression is dealt with in the GP surgery or resolves itself without a single medical consultation .
Most of the time , depression is hidden from view because of the stigma attached to it .
Although technological advances in antidepressant treatments have undoubtedly been responsible for the alleviation of much suffering , strict adherence to the medical ( disease ) model is preventing a more complete understanding of why we as a species are so susceptible to depression , with at least 20 % of men and 25 % of women experiencing the condition in their lifetimes .
The disease model may also be engendering a sense of powerlessness in those with depression or ex-sufferers .
What so commonly goes along with this perspective is the implication that the condition is due to some unusual constitutional weakness .
The only solution , therefore , is chemical .
It is a complete nonsense to talk of depression being unusual when it is plainly common .
The search for a " depression gene " has foundered because the genetic underpinnings are spread across the population , like the genes determining height .
Most of us probably have a moderate susceptibility to the condition under certain stressful circumstances .
Nevertheless , we see GPs overprescribing antidepressants , and the World Health Organisation talks of increasing access to " treatment " to deal with the global epidemic in depression - related disability - predicted to be second only to heart disease as the most important cause of disability by 2010 .
All of this ignores the " ultimate " cause of depression .
My recent review of theories and personal observations suggests that depression might serve some useful functions .
It also highlights how ideas that have been around since the 1960s have been largely ignored by the mainstream media .
The " war of depression " - between the view that depression is enlightening and the view that it is hindering - has raged for a long time .
The truth is that short - term pain can lead to longer - term gain .
A recently published follow - up study of depression in Holland - the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study ( Nemesis ) - used a sample of 165 people with a major depressive episode , and provides some preliminary scientific evidence to suggest that depression is indeed helpful in the longer term .
Researchers who were looking for evidence to suggest that depression leaves people chronically disabled were surprised to discover the opposite .
Life 's trials
The population they followed from before illness to the period after recovery showed that people seemed to cope better with life 's trials after depression than they were doing before its onset .
In the group as a whole , averaged ratings of vitality , psychological health , social and leisure activities , occupational performance and general health all significantly improved upon recovery from depression , compared to functioning prior to the depression .
A minority of individuals got worse after a depressive episode , mostly in the realms of general health , vitality , and physical functioning .
However , much to the researchers ' surprise , severity of depression and availability of treatment were not significant predictors of this decline .
It was more to do with additional problems such as social isolation , having a physical illness , or drug or alcohol addiction .
Depression can lead to great insights and achievements .
The precocious philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote his famous work , Utilitarianism , in 1861 at the age of 19 and became depressed at the age of 21 .
Upon recovery , he confessed that the experience had taught him an important lesson - that he should not sacrifice his social and emotional development to intellectual ambition .
More than 2,000 years ago , Socrates warned of the same danger : melancholia was thought to be a consequence of rigorous philosophising .
However , Aristotle believed it to be a state of immense moral and spiritual value because of the insights it could bring .
Evolutionary theories of depression explore why the condition has apparently persisted so commonly and universally since ancient times .
Culturally sensitive surveys of traditional communities of the world suggest that the " core elements " of depression are indeed universal .
Certain communities in Africa regard depression as a natural consequence of an inter - dependent way of life , and those with depression are given time out from normal responsibilities until they recover .
Furthermore , we see the behavioural manifestation of depression occurring in other mammals that have the same capacity for maternal bonding , intimate relationships , and play , and that have similar brain biology .
To explain why depression has not been " bred out " through Darwinian natural selection , theories have suggested that rather than being a defect , depression could be a defence against the chronic stress that misguided people can put themselves under .
It is possible that depression defends us against the tendency to deny our true needs by chasing unobtainable goals and helps to bring these needs into sharper focus .
More specifically , the proposed benefits are as follows : removal from a stressful situation , introspection , problem solving , the development of a new perspective , and reintegrating this with the community upon recovery .
This sequence is repeated in the legends , myths , tribal beliefs , and religions of the world that tell the story of solitary exploration in adversity leading to personal growth .
Depression may bring about a " rebirth " because it removes self - delusion .
There is some evidence from scientific studies to show that depressed people are rather more realistic in their thinking than " healthy " individuals - the phenomenon of " depressive realism " .
It prompted the scientific journalist Kyla Dunn to write : " One cognitive symptom of depression might be the loss of optimistic , self - enhancing biases that normally protect healthy people against assaults to their self - esteem .
In many instances , depressives may simply be judging themselves and the world much more accurately than non-depressed people , and finding it not a pretty place . "
With recovery , and with the lifting of mood , a new kind of truth could emerge that lies somewhere between the overly optimistic and the overly negative .
The new truth would be devoid of blind optimism : a more humble assessment of the depressed person 's own capability , containing a more balanced picture of his or her perceived strengths and limitations .
Other functions have been proposed by evolutionary psychologists .
Ed Hagan has suggested that getting depressed is like going on strike for better pay and conditions - it is a way of making the wider social network more aware of your needs .
Paul Watson has suggested that the sobering quality of depression makes us more aware of any changes that might need to occur in that social network .
Coping strategies
Depression may have forced our ancestors to look again at their strengths and their limitations , their coping strategies , their direction , their priorities , their supports .
Regardless of the reason for falling into depression , the journey has the potential to make us better equipped , in a general sense , for life .
If we are too busy to think and feel , to be mindful , depression might represent the first opportunity to take an honest inventory of ourselves .
If the modern world prevents us from learning from depression , perhaps it is the fault of the modern world and not this ubiquitous human condition .

U.S. Customs Seizing Laptops
I ’ve heard many anecdotal stories about U.S. Customs and Border Protection seizing , copying data from , or otherwise accessing laptops of people entering the country .
But this is very mainstream :
Today , the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Asian Law Caucus , two civil liberties groups in San Francisco , plan to file a lawsuit to force the government to disclose its policies on border searches , including which rules govern the seizing and copying of the contents of electronic devices .
They also want to know the boundaries for asking travelers about their political views , religious practices and other activities potentially protected by the First Amendment .
The question of whether border agents have a right to search electronic devices at all without suspicion of a crime is already under review in the federal courts .
The lawsuit was inspired by two dozen cases , 15 of which involved searches of cellphones , laptops , MP3 players and other electronics .
Almost all involved travelers of Muslim , Middle Eastern or South Asian background , many of whom , including Mango and the tech engineer , said they are concerned they were singled out because of racial or religious profiling .
Some of this seems pretty severe :
“ I was assured that my laptop would be given back to me in 10 or 15 days , ” said [ Maria ]
Udy , who continues to fly into and out of the United States .
She said the federal agent copied her log -on and password , and asked her to show him a recent document and how she gains access to Microsoft Word .
She was asked to pull up her e-mail but could not because of lack of Internet access .
With ACTE ’s help , she pressed for relief .
More than a year later , Udy has received neither her laptop nor an explanation . [ … ]
Kamran Habib , a software engineer with Cisco Systems , has had his laptop and cellphone searched three times in the past year .
Once , in San Francisco , an officer “ went through every number and text message on my cellphone and took out my SIM card in the back , ” said Habib , a permanent U.S. resident .
“ So now , every time I travel , I basically clean out my phone .
It ’s better for me to keep my colleagues and friends safe than to get them on the list as well . ”
Privacy ?
There ’s no need to worry :
Hollinger said customs officers “ are trained to protect confidential information . ”
I know I feel better .
I strongly recommend the two - tier encryption strategy I described here .
And I even more strongly recommend cleaning out your laptop and BlackBerry regularly ; if you do n’t have it on your computer , no one else can get his hands on it .
This defense not only works against U.S. customs , but against the much more likely threat of you losing the damn thing .
And the TSA wants you to know that it ’s not them .

“ The sit - downers did everything they did for nothing ” — Flint Delphi worker
UAW moves to ram through massive Delphi concessions
By Shannon Jones
27 June 2007
The United Auto Workers bureaucracy is attempting to force through rank - and - file ratification of the recently announced contract with auto parts maker Delphi , which cuts wages by half and imposes unprecedented health and pension benefit concessions .
With locals holding votes Wednesday and Thursday , workers are being given scant time to consider the far - reaching significance of the agreement and mobilize against it .
As more details emerge , the sweeping character of the capitulation by the union is becoming clear .
The UAW is surrendering virtually all the gains made by auto workers over the past 70 years in exchange for a worthless promise from Delphi to preserve at most a few thousand jobs .
Among other things , the contract will impose pay cuts of up to 50 percent , slashing top rates from $ 27 to as low as $ 14 .
The deal slashes health benefits and freezes the defined benefit pension plan .
Only 4 of 29 plants are to continue operating as Delphi facilities .
Another 10 will be shut down and the rest will either be sold as soon as possible or continue operating under third - party management until a buyer is found .
A copy of the UAW - Delphi memorandum of understanding posted by a dissident union faction reveals additional terms of the contract not previously leaked by the press .
These include elimination of the jobs bank , a program that allows laid - off workers to continue receiving 95 percent of their previous wages until they are rehired .
In its place the company is offering severance pay of $ 1,500 for every month of service up to a maximum of $ 40,000 .
This is an attempt to win support for the contract from a section of new hires , who are not eligible for the jobs bank until achieving three years seniority .
Further , the memorandum of understanding calls for the implementation of so - called competitive operating agreements , which would rip up existing work rules , combine job classifications paving the way for speed - up , more job eliminations and an enormous increase in the intensity of exploitation .
The agreement stipulates that to achieve cost savings “ the local parties will not be constrained ... by existing agreements / past practices . ”
It is generally recognized that the unprecedented concessions granted Delphi will determine the framework for contract negotiations with General Motors , Ford and Chrysler set to begin in July .
The automakers are demanding what is being described as a “ transformational ” agreement that could slash pay and benefits $ 30 an hour .
Gary N. Chaison , a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester , Massachusetts , told the New York Times , “ The UAW will have an extremely difficult time getting the Big Three to preserve anything that it had to give up at Delphi . ”
Reacting to the settlement , General Motors stock rose 2.3 percent on Monday .
Investment firm Goldman Sachs lifted GM ’s rating from “ neutral ” to “ buy . ”
At local union meetings held Monday , UAW leaders shamelessly praised the new contract , although its basic terms are substantially the same as those the union had denounced during the 20 months of negotiations since Delphi declared bankruptcy .
However , behind its bluster , the union bureaucracy expressed extremely nervousness that opposition could emerge to the contract and undermine its joint efforts with GM , Ford and Chrysler to push through concessions when labor contracts expire in September .
WSWS reporters attempting to cover the informational meeting for workers at the Flint East facility in Michigan found a sheriff ’s deputy stationed at the parking lot entrance in front of the UAW Local 651 union hall .
The officer had instructions from the Local 651 leadership to keep the press and non-UAW members off the property .
The UAW asked for police protection , not from the establishment media , which has generally repeated the lies of the bureaucracy , but to intimidate opposition to the agreement , both within and without the local .
Delphi workers in Flint are set to vote Thursday on the contract .
Local 651 is the bargaining agent for about 1,000 workers at the Delphi ’s Flint East plant .
About 90 percent of these workers are so - called second - tier workers , brought in at a $ 14 - an - hour pay rate agreed to by the UAW in 2004 for new hires .
In an exchange with the media , UAW Local 651 President Art Reyes praised the tentative contract , noting that Delphi had pledged to keep most of the 1,000 jobs at the plant until 2011 under third - party management .
“ This is a positive agreement , a good agreement , ” he said , “ It was a wonderful feeling ; it has been a great weekend . ”
However , Reyes indicated he would not be sticking around long at Flint East to take advantage of Delphi ’s generosity .
“ Eventually I will be pooling back to General Motors , ” he noted .
Following the meeting , a WSWS reporting team was able to interview workers as they left the union hall .
The team distributed the WSWS article posted June 25 titled , “ US auto union accepts massive wage cuts and layoffs in pact with Delphi , ” which called for a rejection of the contract .
In speaking to workers it became evident many were resigned to voting for the contract , given the alternative , as they were told by the UAW , of losing their jobs .
In particular , new hires , who are already working at the lower pay and benefit rates , were susceptible to the “ something is better than nothing ” argument advanced by the bureaucracy .
Since 2004 , when the UAW agreed to let Delphi bring in new hires and temporary workers at $ 14 an hour , the number of senior workers making the standard $ 27 hourly pay rate has fallen to just 4,000 out of the remaining UAW - represented workforce of 17,000 .
In attempting to push through this sellout Delphi , GM and the UAW are counting on the fact that in Flint and other cities throughout the Midwest — devastated by the shutdown of auto and other basic industry facilitated by the betrayal of the unions — $ 14 an hour , a wage that borders on the poverty level , is considered “ good money ” by many younger workers .
As an additional incentive to vote for ratification , all new hires and temporary workers will become permanent employees under the agreement .
The home of the sit - down strikes in 1936 - 37 that established the UAW at GM , Flint once boasted among the highest per capita incomes in the nation , employing some 80,000 unionized workers in the auto plants .
After decades of plant closings and layoffs , today there are only a few thousand auto jobs left and the city has been become a center of social degradation , with more than half of its children growing up in poverty .
A young Delphi worker with one year in the plant expressed the pressure he faced to ratify the agreement .
“ What are you going to do ?
This is twice as much as I was making before .
I do n’t think it ’s fair that people are making twice as much .
It ’s the same job ; we should get the same pay .
It ’s divide and conquer . ”
Another younger worker with one year at Delphi expressed her frustration , “ They [ Delphi executives ] are making multimillion - dollar bonuses but wo n’t give us anything .
We ’re making cars that we ca n’t afford to buy .
It takes two , sometimes three working in a household to get through . ”
Cheryl Morgan , a former Chevrolet worker with 30 years seniority who transferred to Delphi , told the WSWS , “ The sit - downers did everything they did for nothing .
Now we are going to have to fight hard to get back what they had .
“ There is nobody in the UAW with guts .
They fold any time management puts anything on the floor .
They may end up closing the doors here anyway . ”
Another senior Delphi worker said he planned to vote no , even though he was transferring to a General Motors plant .
“ I have a handicapped daughter .
If I take the buyout I have one year ’s insurance .
I am worried about my friends too .
What if you have kids in college ?
“ The guys in the UAW are kicking our butts . ”
Water seems like a fairly simple concept .
You turn on the tap , put glass underneath , and drink .
Sadly , it is not this simple for white people .
On the whole , they are unable to put a glass under a tap and just drink .
In fact , this is such a strange concept that the city of New York had to launch a rather large PR campaign to show white people that it was possible to actually drink the water that comes out of the tap !
Up until this point , white people were consuming most of their water in the form of expensive bottles like Fiji , Aquafina and Dasanai .
To this day , many white people continue to get their water in this fashion , and it is important to be aware about how your choice of water can say a lot about who you are .
Logically , you would assume that drinking the most expensive premium bottled water ( Fiji and Voss ) would be enough to show the world that you are too good for tap water .
And a few years ago , you would have been right .
But lately , advanced white people have been getting very upset about all of the waste that comes with drinking 15 - 20 bottles per week .
The leading edge of white people have started to use sturdier , refillable bottles .
But do not assume this is from the tap .
Most white people need to run their water through some sort of filter ( Brita or PUR ) before they put it into their bottle .
This allows them to feel good about using a refillable bottle , but it also makes it more complicated , which they also like .
Previously , the gold standard was the Nalgene bottle , however recent studies have shown the plastic can leak toxins into the water .
Currently , white people on the cutting edge are really into metal bottles of water with a twist cap .
It is recommended that you buy one of these as soon as possible .
Having one will give you precious leverage over any white person who is drinking from a plastic bottle .
“ Oh bottled water ?
really ?
I mean it ’s cool , but I kind of thought you cared about the earth . ”
If you see someone drinking a Fiji water , you do have the opportunity to go in for the kill .
“ Do you know that your bottle of water has a bigger carbon footprint than me ?
I think they were originally going to call it ‘ aboriginal blood ’ but that bottle was as close as they could get .
You know , legally . ”
Again , this should only be used in extreme situations .
Following your confrontation , the white person is likely to have a metal bottle just like yours .
If this happens , there will be an implicit pact whereby they will do favors for you provided you do not tell everyone they got their bottle after you .
NOTE : whoever makes the metal bottles did not pay for the link .
They just had the best pictures .
This is the second part of what I expect to be a series of articles where I propose aligning the constitution with god , mine .
This post builds off of the first installment , which you might want to read first .
A few minutes watching TV , especially male focused TV like sports , and one gets assaulted by the advertising for ED prescriptions and male enhancements pills .
The ads are more than a little suggestive , and hard to explain to my 4 and 9 year old daughters when and if they watch hockey games with me .
Nurses ( Ali ’s coined term for breasts , as in that is where a mommy ‘ nurses ’ her baby ) slipping out of a top during the Super Bowl , easy to explain .
A male erection , not so easy .
Thank you Ali , for adding a new term for breast to the American language .
I can hear it already .
( Insert surfer accent here , think Spicolly from Fast Times at Ridgemont High . )
“ Whoa , dude , check out those nurses ! ”
And he is n’t talking about hospital employees either .
I digress .
Lets get back to the sin at hand .
The advertisements are offensive to me , and therefore god .
A few years ago the conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh was arrested when re-entering the country because he had a prescription bottle of Viagra , written for someone else .
Eventually the charges were dropped , apparently the doctor had requested a different name be placed on the bottle to protect Mr. Limbaugh ’s privacy .
Fine , I can live with that .
And god tells me she can too .
What God and I can’t live with is , regarding a little discussed fact of the case , is that RUSH LIMBAUGH WAS / IS AN UNMARRIED MAN !!!!!
An unmarried man , traveling with a prescription for Viagra , a drug meant to raise a man ’s flag when they ca n’t do it themselves .
Why would a single man go to the Dominican Republic with a prescription for ED ?
Google “ Dominican Republic sex industry “ .
Oh , that ’s why .
Well that clears that up .
At least the reason for the trip , if not the sordid details .
Imagine it , a conservative pundit not living up the standard he so callously pushes on everybody else .
The shock .
The horror .
Actually , it seems like this happens at least once a week to one of them .
I can accept a man who chooses medicine over god ’s will to lower his flag .
Though I find it hypocritical to trust in god then medically treat the ailments she gives you .
It ’s not right , but I can accept some people are less virulent ( god ’s will ) than others and need a little man-made help .
But not if you are n’t married .
To a woman .
If you are a man .
Not a dog .
Or a cat .
Or a woman .
Dogs and cats , go read something else .
OK , I ’ve confused the issue .
Let me begin again , marriage between a man and woman , Viagra OK .
Not good , but OK .
All those other marriages , I ’ll discuss in another post .
Single men , NO Viagra .
( Sorry Rush , god has determined you need to keep your flag in your pants . )
And so , as my first proposed amendment to the constitution , to align it with god , we shall limit the distribution of ED prescriptions to any male or female with a VALID marriage license .
I , I mean god , will determine what is valid .
Through me , of course .
And we ’ll throw in a blurb limiting all advertisements for ED drugs , and for that matter anything remotely sexual or doing with female hygiene , to C - Span .
They need the viewers .
Who said god is n’t merciful ?
For those of you wondering why I said females can get the prescription , let me just add that a properly subservient wife will notice when her man gets a little down , and will slip these pills to him without him knowing it .
Good for his ego .
Please note , I do n’t advocate this for the woman ’s benefit .
Though god might , she ’s big on women ’s issues .
( Go figure ) .

Hollywood had hoped otherwise , but it has been a good year for The Pirate Bay , despite all the legal hassles .
Most impressive is the explosive growth in number of torrents and peers that are using the Pirate Bay tracker .
The Pirate Bay now tracks nearly 1 million torrents and over 8 million peers at any given point in time .
This is quite a change compared to last year , and there is no sign that this trend will stop anytime soon .
December 2006
576.080 torrents ,
4.274.698 peers
December 2007
914.717 torrents
8.390.682 peers
To keep up with the growing demand from its users , The Pirate Bay has added more and more hardware to their server park .
Another significant change this year is the migration from Anakata ’s Hypercube to the open source Opentracker software .
The new software is more stable , uses less resources and supports UDP tracking .
The Pirate Bay ’s Brokep told TorrentFreak that they should be able to double the amount of peers on the trackers without any hardware upgrades .
“ Since the last performance tweaking and router - tweaking we ’ve removed all bottlenecks . ”
Brokep said , and he expects the tracker to hit 10 million peers during the next big holiday .
There is also a downside to this positive news of course .
The growth of The Pirate Bay is in part due to the problems at Demonoid had this year and the fact that Isohunt ( TorrentBox ) disabled access for US users to their trackers because of the issues they have with the MPAA .
Demonoid and TorrentBox were the second and the fourth most used public BitTorrent tracker respectively , so this was a great loss .
It is estimated that approximately 50 % of all public . torrent files are now tracked by The Pirate Bay , it is scary to imagine what will happen if their servers will stop working .
Luckily there ’s also good news , as new trackers such as sumotracker.org and denis.stalker.h3q.com became pretty popular in just a few months .
Both newcomers track more than a million peers now .
Besides this ,
The Pirate Bay have already announced that they ’re not going anywhere .
They told us that they will simply move to another country if they are outlawed in Sweden , without downtime !
The high bids totalled $ 3.2 billion in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission 's auction of wireless spectrum licenses in the 700MHz band after three rounds and a day and a half of bidding .
That figure is far short of the $ 10 billion Congress and the FCC expect to raise in the auction , which opened Thursday , but bidding could continue for weeks .
In most cases , the high bids do n't yet meet the FCC 's reserve price set for minimum winning bids .
A fourth round of bidding was scheduled for today .
The 700MHz auctions represent the last large chunk of spectrum available for the FCC to auction in the foreseeable future .
The spectrum , now used to carry over - the - air television signals , can be used to carry long - range wireless broadband traffic .
Consumer groups have said the spectrum represents the " last , best hope " for a nationwide wireless broadband network that competes with cable and telecom broadband services .
For sale is 62MHz of spectrum in the 700MHz band .
In late 2005 , after a decade of debate , Congress passed a law requiring U.S. TV stations to move to all - digital broadcasts and abandon analog spectrum between channels 52 and 69 .
The deadline for TV stations to end broadcasts in the 700MHz band is February 2009 .
After three rounds , 906 of the 1,099 available spectrum licenses had bids , with four more licenses receiving bids than at the end of round two late Thursday .
High bids had totalled just under $ 2.8 billion after round 2 , and just over $ 2.4 billion after round one Thursday morning .
Top Bid
The top bid after the third round was $ 1.49 billion for eight of 12 regional licenses in the C block , a 22M Hz block of spectrum covering all 50 states .
The bidding for those C block licenses was up from $ 1.24 billion at the end of the second round .
The FCC 's reserve price for the C block is $ 4.6 billion , and the winning bidders of C block spectrum must allow any legal devices to connect to their network , including mobile phones purchased from other carriers .
The second highest bid remained $ 472 million for the D block , a nationwide 10MHz chunk of spectrum to be paired with another 10 MHz set aside for public safety agencies .
The bidder of the D block would be required to build a national network to be jointly used by public safety agencies and commercial customers .
The high bid for the D block has remained unchanged since round one .
Bidding in the auction is anonymous .
The A block , a 12MHz piece of spectrum covering parts of New York and the northeastern U.S. , also generated interest .
The high bid was $ 119.8 million after the third round , up from $ 100 million after the second round and $ 83.2 million after the first round .
A similar chunk of spectrum in the E block , also covering the same area , has generated a high bid of $ 59.9 million after the third round .
The high bid for a 12MHz block called the B block , for a local New York City license , stood at $ 85.6 million after rounds two and three .
High bids for five blocks in the Chicago , Los Angeles and Washington , D.C. , areas were between $ 28 million and $ 55 million after round three .
Ugh , is DRM coming to shackle USB too ?
You betcha .
The USB Implementer 's Forum is planning to rollout a variant of tethered USB in 2008 to carry compressed high - def video between TVs and mobile devices .
It appears unrelated to USB 3.0 and targets both laptops and personal media players -- however you might choose to define that .
A spokesman for the organization said that developers " could layer HDMI 's HDCP encryption on top . "
So it 's not definite .
But with the studios fighting hard to " protect " their content , well , it 's a given that some form of DRM will be there .
The new USB linkage is meant to complement HDMI which primarily carries uncompressed video between living room A/V equipment ... and an increasing number of media - centric laptops .
Thing is , DisplayPort , expected to make a big showing at CES in January , already comes with a slathering of HDCP and is the purported VESA standard for moving HDTV from your laptop to a digital television .
To confuse matters more , Kleer Corp is also working on a mid-2008 wireless and wired technology for carrying SD video based on its existing wireless audio technology .
Proof that the best part about having standards is that there are so many to choose from .
Detailed images from Hubble 's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer ( NICMOS ) reveal an infant galaxy , dubbed A1689 - zD1 , undergoing a firestorm of star birth as it comes out of the dark ages , a time shortly after the Big Bang , but before the first stars completed the reheating of the cold , dark Universe .
Images from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope 's Infrared Array Camera provided strong additional evidence that it was a young star - forming galaxy in the dark ages .
" We certainly were surprised to find such a bright young galaxy 13 billion years in the past " , said astronomer Garth Illingworth of the University of California , Santa Cruz , USA and a member of the research team .
" This is the most detailed look to date at an object so far back in time . "
According to the authors , the measurements are " highly reliable " .
" This object is the strongest candidate for the most distant galaxy so far " , states team member Piero Rosati from ESO , Germany .
" The Hubble images yield insight into the galaxy 's structure that we cannot get with any other telescope , " added astronomer Rychard Bouwens of the University of California , Santa Cruz , one of the co-discoverers of this galaxy .
The new images should offer insights into the formative years of galaxy birth and evolution and yield information on the types of objects that may have contributed to ending the dark ages .
During its lifetime the Hubble telescope has peered ever farther back in time , viewing galaxies at successively younger stages of evolution .
These snapshots have helped astronomers create a scrapbook of galaxies from infancy to adulthood .
The new Hubble and Spitzer images of A1689 - zD1 show a time when galaxies were in their infancy .
Current theory holds that the dark ages began about 400,000 years after the Big Bang , as matter in the expanding Universe cooled and formed clouds of cold hydrogen .
These cold clouds pervaded the Universe like a thick fog .
At some point during this era , stars and galaxies started to form .
Their collective light heated and cleared the fog of cold hydrogen , and ended the dark ages about a billion years after the Big Bang .
" This galaxy presumably is one of the many galaxies that helped end the dark ages " , said astronomer Larry Bradley of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , USA , and leader of the study .
" Astronomers are fairly certain that high - energy objects such as quasars did not provide enough energy to end the dark ages of the Universe .
But many young star - forming galaxies may have produced enough energy to end it . "
The galaxy is so far away it did not appear in visible light images taken with Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys , because its light is stretched to infrared wavelengths by the Universe 's expansion .
It took Hubble 's NICMOS , Spitzer and a trick of nature called gravitational lensing to see the faraway galaxy .
The astronomers used a relatively nearby massive cluster of galaxies known as Abell 1689 , roughly 2.2 billion light - years away , to magnify the light from the more distant galaxy directly behind it .
This natural telescope is a gravitational lens .
Abell 1689 is one of the most spectacular gravitational telescopes known and its gravitational properties are very well known .
Though the diffuse light of the faraway object is nearly impossible to see , gravitational lensing has increased its brightness by nearly 10 times , making it bright enough for Hubble and Spitzer to detect .
A telltale sign of the lensing is the smearing of the images of galaxies behind Abell 1689 into arcs by the gravitational warping of space by the intervening galaxy cluster .
Piero Rosati says : " This galaxy lies near the region where the galaxy cluster produces the highest magnification - which was essential to bring this galaxy within reach of Hubble and Spitzer . "
Spitzer 's images show that the galaxy 's mass is typical of galaxies in the early Universe .
Its mass is equivalent to several billions of stars like our Sun , or just a tiny fraction of the mass of the Milky Way .
" This observation confirms previous Hubble studies that star birth happens in very tiny regions compared with the size of the final galaxy " , Illingworth said .
The faraway galaxy also is an ideal target for Hubble 's successor , the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) , scheduled to launch in 2013 .
Even with the increased magnification from the gravitational lens , Hubble 's sharp " eye " can only see knots of the brightest , heftiest stars in the galaxy .
The telescope cannot pinpoint fainter , lower - mass stars , individual stars , or the material surrounding the star - birth region .
To see those things , astronomers will need the infrared capabilities of JWST currently being developed by NASA , ESA and CSA in a major international collaboration .
The planned infrared observatory will have a mirror about seven times the area of Hubble 's primary mirror and will collect more light from faint galaxies .
JWST also will be able to view even more remote galaxies whose light has been stretched deep into infrared wavelengths that are out of the reach of NICMOS .
" This galaxy will certainly be one of the first objects that will be observed by JWST " , said team member Holland Ford of Johns Hopkins University .
" This galaxy is so bright that JWST will see its detailed structure .
This object is a pathfinder for JWST for deciphering what is happening in young galaxies . "
The astronomers noted that the faraway galaxy also would be an ideal target for the ESO / NRAO / NAOJ Atacama Large Millimeter Array ( ALMA ) , which , when completed in 2012 , will be the most powerful radio telescope in the world .
" ALMA and JWST working together would be an ideal combination to really understand this galaxy " , Illingworth said , noting that : " JWST 's images and ALMA 's measurement of the gas motions will provide revolutionary insights into the very youngest galaxies . "
The astronomers will conduct follow - up observations with infrared spectroscopy to confirm the galaxy 's distance using ESO 's VLT and the Keck telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii .

This Saturday , construction will start on a three - metre high , five - kilometre long fence in Sydney 's CBD to protect leaders attending next week 's Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) conference .
The fence will cause major traffic disruptions throughout the city and local workers and residents will have to go through special ID checks at access points .
But Sydney 's Deputy Lord Mayor is appalled by the security measures being taken to protect officials attending the conference and wants to hang a huge banner from the city 's Town Hall saying , " Cage Bush , not Sydney " .
The council will vote on the proposal .
The city 's chamber of commerce has attacked the idea as " madness " , saying such a decision would be rude and could affect businesses all over Australia .
Just last week , New South Wales police unveiled a new $ 600,000 water canon , warning that if APEC demonstrators got wild , they would get very wet .
Another visible part of security will be a five - kilometre long , three - metre high steel fence separating the Opera House , Botanic Gardens and a large part of the CBD from public access .
Workers will start building the fence this weekend .
Greens Councillor Chris Harris , who is also Deputy Lord Mayor of Sydney City Council , says he wants the council to take a stand against APEC - and particularly against US President George W Bush .
" I 'm sitting in Town Hall today and there 's Army personnel wondering through Town Hall with all these fancy devices , " he said .
" This is the kind of stuff you see in despotic regimes .
This is fearmongering , right - wing , red neck stuff that 's being [ exported ] out of America [ and ]
I think we should distance ourselves from it as far as we can .
" We 're forcing the citizens of Sydney , the businesses that operate in the city , to forego hundreds of millions of dollars in business to protect one bloke .
I just think this is extraordinary .
" So first of all we 're asking that council acknowledge that and then the second thing I 'm asking council to do is to demonstrate to our citizens how we feel by putting a banner up on Town Hall that says very simply , ' Cage Bush , not Sydney ' . "
' Irreparable harm '
Patricia Forsthye , executive director of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce , believes a banner strung up at Sydney Town Hall would do irreparable harm to the city .
" If what we saw was a ' Cage Bush , not Sydney ' sign from the Sydney Town Hall , I think the only conclusion you could draw is that far from being gracious hosts , that we are rude , " she said .
" The reality is people around the world people will see the people of Sydney have little respect or regard for APEC , for what it stands for , or for the leaders and in this case and in particular the President of the United States .
" I think that will become the feature of media stories , rather than the significant opportunity we have to promote and showcase Sydney .
" I 'm confident that the Sydney City Council will see through this see this as some sort of particular political grandstanding by one particular counsellor , and I hope that 's how they treat it . "
Other demonstrators have warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Hu Jintao could be targets for protests because of Chechnya and Tibet , but those leaders are not on the Deputy Lord Mayor 's hit list .
" George Bush is the one that has carried on this , and started this war on terrorism and basically ... tried to turn democratic societies into fearful places , " Cr Harris said .
But Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore does not think the council will vote to hang the banner .
" I do n't support that proposal .
I believe that Sydney , the global city of Australia , should be able to host a forum for world leaders , " she said .
Cr Moore says she has concerns about the use of water canon and fencing off part of the city , but says the council should concentrate on helping those affected by the security shutdown and not involved in organising protests .
And she says regrettably , most of the security in place for APEC is necessary in an era of global terrorism .
" It seems that it is and I think it 's really regrettable , " she said .
" I think the days [ are gone ] when world leaders were greeted by welcoming motorcade , happy faces on the street waving flags and welcoming our visitors - that 's the approach I 'd much prefer . "
As HD Radio braces for a sliver of success – adding advertisers and a new wave of portable receivers – critics say tight control by big radio companies at the top is smothering the fledgling industry 's chances .
" Radio 's most popular formats were created by radio rebels , outlaws , misfits and ne'er - do - wells – not by corporate marketing executives , " says Robert Hughes , co-owner of San Diego rock station KPRI , which has no immediate plans to broadcast in HD .
Over the last two years , about 1,500 U.S. radio stations have made the leap to digital broadcasting , terrestrial radio's response to the overwhelming success of the iPod and the threat posed by satellite radio .
The technology – known as HD Radio , although the letters do n't stand for " high definition " or anything else – allows stations to broadcast in higher fidelity and offer secondary channels to listeners with special digital radios .
Stations spend an estimated $ 100,000 each to upgrade their transmitters to carry digital signals , according to the HD Digital Radio Alliance trade group , which is dominated by huge radio companies .
But so far , digital radio has generated nearly no buzz .
HD Radio technology company iBiquity Digital estimates about 200,000 HD radios were sold last year , and predicts between 1 million and 1.5 million will be sold this year .
But car manufacturers are beginning to offer digital radios as an option , and home sets are becoming cheaper , although they 're still plagued by reception problems .
Peter Ferrara , the trade group 's president , says another development will spur HD Radio 's success : a less power - hungry digital radio chip , to debut at the Consumer Electronics Show in January .
Another sign that HD Radio is gaining traction :
The trade group announced last Monday that it will , for the first time , allow advertisers to underwrite blocks of time on the hundreds of subchannels that piggyback onto parent stations ' digital signals .
There could be " a BMW oldies station , a Starbucks coffee channel , " says Ferrara .
The group still wo n't allow actual commercials on the subchannels , however , and DJs remain rare .
Plus , members of the alliance cannot offer formats – say , oldies from the 1980s – on their subchannels if duplicate formats already exist in their local markets .
" There 's not much free market there , is there ? " says program director John Decker of San Diego public radio station KPBS , which broadcasts in HD but is n't a member of the trade group .
But Ferrara says the alliance just wants to support " a diverse ... array of unique content . "
Many of the formats currently broadcast on digital subchannels would probably never survive on a profit - hungry radio station .
Subchannels in cities from Syracuse , N.Y. , to San Antonio feature a syndicated gay - oriented format created by the monolithic Clear Channel chain .
Elsewhere , subchannels offer up Irish music , " tropical , reggae and beach music , " and 24/7 comedy .
To KPRI 's Hughes , this focus on niche programming sounds like satellite radio , which is not doing well .
The premise for HD Radio " is under a pretty serious cloud , " he says .
As for commercials and DJs , industry analysts say they should have been on subchannels from the beginning because listeners expect them .
" The myth is that ( listeners ) find the DJs annoying , " says radio consultant Donna Halper .
" They find them annoying when they babble endlessly . "
Despite HD Radio's slow and possibly flawed start , Ferrara says the technology will take off in time .
" FM radio took 10 to 15 years to get its footing , " he says .
" I do n't think HD Radio will take nearly that long . "
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened criminal inquiries into 14 companies as part of a wide - ranging investigation of the troubled mortgage industry , F.B.I. officials said Tuesday .
The F.B.I. said it was looking into possible accounting fraud , insider trading or other violations in connection with loans made to borrowers with weak , or subprime , credit .
The agency declined to identify the companies under investigation but said the inquiry , which began last spring , involves companies across the financial industry , including mortgage lenders , loan brokers and Wall Street banks that packaged home loans into securities .
It is unclear when charges , if any , might be filed .
As part of its investigation , the F.B.I. is cooperating with the Securities and Exchange Commission , which is conducting about three dozen civil investigations into how subprime loans were made and packaged , and how securities backed by them were valued .
State prosecutors are also investigating various areas of the mortgage industry .
clojure is the best lisp yet
I 've dabbled in a few lisp dialects , but I generally become frustrated with some deficiency or other .
I had been holding out some hope for Paul Graham 's arc , but when I tried it out , I was n't exactly blown away .
Common Lisp has a rather bloated library of functions , many with disgustingly long names .
Arc has indeed successfully addressed this problem , and so has clojure : the longest function name I could find in Clojure 's succinct and powerful library was the outlier " clear - agent - errors " .
Lisp is old enough that many dialects have trouble with modern character encodings .
Arc does n't support anything but ASCII ( so far anyway ) , and although elisp does it seems to regard UTF - 8 with suspicion .
Clojure supports UTF - 8 out of the box , even inlined in your source code .
Many lisps have a shocking shortage of useful library modules for common tasks , especially related to networking or particular file formats , when compared to Perl , Python , etc. , and creating bindings for existing C or other native libraries can be pretty tricky .
Clojure allows you to directly use any part of any existing Java library , no special bindings needed .
With a large variety of libraries comes name collisions .
Arc apparently has n't addressed this problem yet , while clojure has all the namespace support you 'll need .
JavaScript and other modern languages have demonstrated to me the power of hashes and the utility of being able to easily initialize them with literals in my code , yet few lisps make this convenient .
Clojure has rich support for sorted maps , hash maps , and struct maps ( which allow you to efficiently store a large number of hashs with common keys ) , including succinct syntax for creating new ones .
Besides cleaning up some of lisp 's historic weaknesses , clojure provides several innovative new features .
For example , the idea of data structure interfaces allows you to write code that can work the same on a variety of concrete types .
The ( conj ... ) function adds an item to a collection , whether that collection is a list , a vector , or a hash .
I also found it interesting that Clojure 's built in data structures are all immutable .
The API makes working with these convenient , and should allow you to avoid common hassles when dealing with concurrency .
There are many other little details that clojure seems to have tweaked for the better compared to older lisps .
The syntax for defining macros is a little tidier , ( cond ... ) is a bit more succinct , and it even has support for literal regular expressions .
I do n't know that many lisps , and none of them very deeply .
But for what it 's worth , clojure is my favorite .
My Interview with Ron Paul
Over the last few months , I 've received hundreds of e-mails from people asking me to interview Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul , so I did .
It 's refreshing to interview a politician who does n't mince words .
It 's even more refreshing to interview one who understands the benefits of limited government .
Here , then , is the first in a series of columns on my talk with Ron Paul .
Some of Paul 's answers are shortened .
What should government do ?
Ron Paul : Protect our freedoms .
Have a strong national defense .
Look at and take care of our borders .
Have a sound currency .
That was the responsibility of the federal government , not to run our lives and run everything in the economy and extend the interstate - commerce clause and the general - welfare clause to do anything they want to do .
So defense , the military , police forces enforce contracts , and that 's about it ?
That 's it .
We would have a court system to enforce contracts , and when people do harm to others , when they take property or injure property , or pollute a neighbor 's air , I think there 's a role for government to protect our environment through private - property rights .
So keep us safe , enforce contracts , run the courts , pollution rules and otherwise butt out ?
Leave us alone ?
Basically that , which would mean if I 'm elected , I should immediately take a pay cut .
You know , because I would n't have so much to do .
The Department of Education .
You 'd get rid of it ?
Yes .
We do n't need it .
How will people get educated ?
We might get better education .
The evidence shows , since the 1950s , since the federal government 's gotten involved , the quality of education has gone down , and the cost has gone up .
The federal government should have no role ?
There 's no authority for it , and .
they 've proved themselves inefficient .
The one city they 're totally in charge of is Washington , D.C. Thirteen thousand dollars a year per student .
They have more guns , more drugs , more violence .
So there 's no evidence that the government can do a very good job .
The Department of Energy .
We do n't need a Department of Energy .
It serves the interests of big business .
Other cabinet departments ?
Department of Agriculture , Commerce , Health and Human Services , Housing and Urban Development .
You 'd get rid of all of them ?
Yeah .
Of course , that 's not on the immediate agenda , but they 're unnecessary , and we should think about what kind of a country we would have without these departments , and I think we would have a better country , and all those problems that they 're supposed to solve , I think , would be lessened .
The Commerce Department ?
We do n't need the Commerce Department to have commerce ?
No , absolutely not .
Homeland Security .
Is n't that a role for the federal government ?
Not really , not the way that 's designed .
That 's the biggest bureaucracy of them all .
There are some parts that are OK .
You know , they put the Coast Guard in there , and they put FEMA in there , and everybody 's bunched together .
And I think it was failure of government on 9/11 , not the fact that we did n't have the Department of Homeland Security and .
a national ID card , and this constant surveillance and loss of our privacy .
Failure of government how ?
We spent $ 40 billion on intelligence gathering , and it did n't prevent ( the 9/11 attacks ) from happening .
But the government was in charge of the airlines .
FAA , they were supposed to inspect the people as they went on , and you were n't supposed to resist any takeovers , and ( passengers and pilots ) were n't allowed to have a gun .
Maybe if you and I had the airlines , we might have said , " Hey , you know , we want to protect our passengers .
Maybe we should have a stronger door on there , maybe we ought to give our pilots a gun . "
So 9/11 would n't have happened .
So government creates too many rules , and the wrong ones ?
That basically it .
Most of the time well - intentioned -- but good intentions will not solve our problems .
Next week , Rep. Ron Paul talks about the war in Iraq .
( FORTUNE Small Business ) --
Next month , eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) intends to implement a controversial new policy that will entail holding payments sent through PayPal for up to 21 days for certain " high - risk transactions . "
Furious at the prospect of waiting to receive funds , sellers have been publicly speculating about how much money PayPal ( and its parent company , eBay ) makes off the accruing interest on funds under PayPal 's control - and whether a desire to retain those funds for longer spurred eBay 's holding plan .
However , company executives and industry analysts say the money PayPal makes off such payments has a negligible impact on its bottom line .
Any funds PayPal holds for dispersal are automatically deposited in a corporate bank account , which earns interest , according to Paypal representative Amanda Pires .
The money is kept there until it 's ready for distribution .
PayPal , which processes payments for eBay auctions as well as e-commerce transactions from elsewhere on the Internet , counts interest payments on those funds as one of its revenue streams .
That 's a perfectly legal practice , as PayPal is classified as a deposit broker , according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) spokesman David Barr .
" Deposit brokers make money being deposit brokers , " Barr said .
" That 's the reason they 're in business .
As long as fees are disclosed , that 's fine from our standpoint . "
Indeed , Paypal 's user agreement - which all accountholders must read and accept - states : " Paypal may combine your funds with the funds of other Users and place those Pooled Accounts in one or more bank accounts in PayPal 's name . "
This applies to any user funds that are in the company 's " custody . "
The agreement further states that accountholders " irrevocably transfer and assign to PayPal any ownership right that you may have in any interest " that accrues in these accounts .
But the revenue generated from this practice is miniscule given PayPal 's total revenue picture , said Thomas Weisel Partners managing director Christa Quarles .
" Money 's definitely being made on the float , but is that the purpose at the end of the day ? " said Quarles , who covers eBay .
" Our sense is it 's not necessarily material in its contribution . "
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) Director of Internet Research Mark Mahaney arrived at similar estimates by examining PayPal 's public quotes of average " stored value . "
Mahaney approximates the interest earned on the float at " single - digit millions per quarter , and at most $ 10 million a quarter . "
All that 's a drop in the bucket , said Quarles .
In 2007 , PayPal generated $ 1.8 billion in revenue .
EBay 's total 2007 revenue was $ 7.7 billion .
EBay does not break out PayPal 's earnings in its financial statements , meaning analysts must rely on their own estimates of the division 's profits .
" I understand sellers are angry about [ the 21 - day policy ] , but the fee changes are really what 's going to drive broader revenues at eBay , " Quarles said .
PayPal 's Pires said accountholders should be aware that they have the power to collect interest for their own use on delayed funds .
It 's as simple as enrolling in the company 's PayPal Money Market Fund , Pires said .
For enrolled accountholders , any funds earmarked for a hold are diverted into the Money Market Fund rather than PayPal 's corporate bank account , Pires said .
The dividends earned are credited to user accounts on a monthly basis .
" Every U.S. accountholder has the ability to invest in the Money Market Fund , " Pires said .
PayPal 's Money Market Fund is run by Barclay ( BCS ) 's Global Investments .
No minimum balance is required , and the fund 's current interest rate is 3.46 % .
The company would not disclose what percentage of PayPal 's 57 million active accountholders have enrolled in the fund .
But Pires said the fund is a " well - utilized service by our customers . "
Barr of the FDIC notes that PayPal does not ultimately fall under the jurisdiction of the FDIC , which regulates banks and banking institutions .
Regulation of deposit brokers or money - transfer operations falls to individual states , he said .
Alana Golden , spokeswoman for California 's Department of Financial Institutions , said PayPal 's plans for a 21 - day holding period do not run afoul of any DFI regulations .
The DFI regulates only PayPal transactions that involve transmitting money to foreign countries , and has no jurisdiction over PayPal 's domestic operations .
Therein lies PayPal 's competitive advantage , said Quarles of Thomas Weisel Partners .
" They 've figured out how not to be regulated , and they 've done that globally , " Quarles said .
" [ PayPal ] has gone to great pains to be not considered a bank . "

Today I learned about printing presses
For one of my classes we went on a field trip to the library ( on campus ) and talked about how they first started making printed books .
I got to look at some movable type letters and hold some books that are over 400 years old .
Did you know that upper case and lower case letters are called that because the letters were stored in cases , one above the other ?
Pretty crazy , right ?
Also did you know that paper used to be made out of old rotten peasants ' undies ?
Well it was made of old rags and rotting was part of the process .
I bet there were some undies in there though .

( Ecstasy ) OFFICER POSING AS HIGH SCHOOLER LEADS DRUG STING
9 Are Arrested in Falmouth
FALMOUTH --
She was new in school , a demure blonde with a sob story .
With her mother dead and father chronically absent , the girl said , she needed to get high to kill the pain .
For three months , students at Falmouth High bought her story and sold her the drugs she said she needed .
But yesterday , the real story emerged .
The girl who some students yesterday said they knew as Keane was in fact a fresh - faced cop whose three months at Falmouth High School culminated before the start of classes yesterday when nine teenage boys were led out of their homes in handcuffs on charges of selling her marijuana and ecstasy .
Police had decided on the strategy in response to some parents ' complaints about rampant drug use at Falmouth High School .
But the tactic enraged other parents , who said the teens had been lured in by a dishonest and manipulative police sting inappropriate for a public high school .
" My kid was impressed by this pretty undercover drug officer , " said the mother of a 16 - year - old Falmouth student arraigned yesterday in juvenile court .
" He has issues with low self - esteem , and this pretty girl gave him attention , " said the mother .
" He wanted to impress her by providing her with what she needed .
The approach by the police was not justified .
Drugs may be a problem at the school , but they have to change their approach . "
The undercover officer had presented herself as a senior whose mother had recently died and whose father was in the Navy , according to students .
According to police , she made 31 purchases of marijuana and one purchase of ecstasy from nine teenage male students since January , when she began attending classes .
Yesterday morning , based on the information she gathered , Falmouth police conducted early - morning raids at students ' homes , arresting four 17 - year - olds , four 16 - year - olds , and a 14 - year - old on charges ranging from possession of marijuana with intent to distribute to vandalism .
Police also confiscated $ 3,500 from the home of one of the 16 - year - olds .
Parents and classmates of the defendants filled Falmouth District Court for the arraignments .
The 17 - year - olds , identified as [ names and towns redacted ] , were arraigned as adults and pleaded not guilty .
[ 3 names redacted ] were charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana and distribution .
[ name redacted ] was charged with conspiracy to violate the controlled substance act .
Names of the minors and details of their cases were not released .
After the proceedings , the boys and their parents left the courthouse without commenting .
Police also would not comment yesterday on the undercover investigation , but court documents offered details on some transactions between the officer and students .
When [ name redacted ] allegedly talked with fellow students in his business class about smoking pot , according to the court records , the officer , overheard him .
She approached [ name redacted ] on Jan. 17 to arrange a purchase of a small amount of marijuana for $ 40 , the records said , and handed him the money .
Later that day , [ name redacted ] gave her a small bag of marijuana in the school parking lot , the records said .
[ name redacted ] 's parents posted $ 500 bail .
He is due back in court May 16 .
[ name redacted ] allegedly sold the undercover officer a bag of marijuana for $ 100 on March 21 in front of his home .
She had driven to his house , according to the records .
" I need some money , I 'm broke . . . no gas in my car , " [ name redacted ] allegedly told the officer .
" Now you have some money , " she said .
[ name redacted ] allegedly replied , " No , I keep my drug money separate from my personal money . "
[ name redacted ] 's parents posted $ 500 bail , and he is due back in court on April 12 .
[ 2 names redacted ] are due back for preliminary hearings April 26 and May 16 , respectively .
Yesterday , some law - enforcement officials questioned the tactics used by Falmouth police .
Matthew Machera , former Suffolk assistant district attorney , said he had never heard of police doing such undercover work in high schools and called the tactic used in the Falmouth bust " outrageous . "
" What strikes me as odd is if it was so prevalent , why did an undercover police officer have to dig so deep ? " he asked .
" As a prosecutor I would n't be comfortable with this .
Why should she have to make up a sob story ?
That 's something you 'll have to explain to a jury . "
School officials raised questions , too .
Glenn Koocher , executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees , said undercover drug stings are rare in high schools in the state .
" This is the kind of stuff you see in made - for - TV movies , " he said .
Most schools have police officers who keep an eye on drug problems , said Boston - area high school principals .
And while drugs are pervasive in most high schools , principals in Needham and Belmont said they have not heard of any undercover officers posing as students .
" I do n't think the community would accept that , " said Paul Richards , principal of Needham High School .
Tom Scott , executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents , said that he has heard of undercover narcotics work in schools , but that it 's not common .
" It 's done where there are serious concerns and they need to go deeper into the scope of the problem , " he said .
" I think it is done . . . [ when ] they do n't have enough information .
It is a decision made as a last resort . "
Several students yesterday described the undercover officer as shy but always looking for a party .
" She would tell people that her mother was dead and that her dad was in the Navy and that she needed pot to cope , " said Julia Massi , a 17 - year - old senior who said she was in English class with the officer .
" She made people feel bad for her .
She would say ' Hey , if you see a party , give me a shout . ' "
Jamie Heide , 16 , a sophomore and member of the school 's track team , said the undercover officer talked about drugs incesssantly .
" It seemed like she was trying to score from everyone , " he said .
Dennis Richards , the superintendent of Falmouth schools , said police had approached the school " before the first of the year " about putting an undercover officer in the high school .
The school had done such a sting some years ago and he was open to doing it again , he said .
" Our principal , Paul Cali , had experienced a similar situation six years ago , so he was familiar with it .
I listened to Paul and the police , and I supported it . "
Richards acknowledged the schools had problems with drugs but said it was among a minority .
" Drugs are a concern in most communities around the country , and it 's no different here .
But I believe we 're dealing with a small group of students , " he said .
Most students indicated in a school survey they had not used marijuana in the past month , he said .
" About 85 percent said they had n't , " he said .
Massi said she took that survey , but got bored because it was so long , and filled in some responses without reading the questions .
" A lot of students did n't want to tell the truth , " she said .

CHARLESTON , South Carolina ( CNN ) --
At Anjay 's Salon in Charleston , the only thing louder than the hair dryer is the chorus of political opinions .
Analysts say black women are more engaged and hold tremendous power in selecting the Democratic nominee .
On this day , owner Angela Jackson is outnumbered .
She is the only one supporting Sen. Hillary Clinton over Sen. Barack Obama in South Carolina 's Democratic primary Saturday .
" When you apply for a job , they ask you , do you have experience ?
They hire you based on experience .
Hillary 's been in office how long ? "
Jackson asks .
Customer Carol Singleton responds , " For me , Hillary , yes , she was a wife of a president , but she was not a president , so she does n't earn credit for more experience than Obama .
To me they 're equal . "
Stylist Shanese Jones says , " I just feel like it 's his time .
I think he 's ready . "
Watch women say what 's important to them »
While three say they 're undecided , the rest of the women in the salon say they plan to vote for Obama .
Analysts say black women this year never have been more engaged in a political campaign or held such power in determining the Democratic nominee .
Recent polls show black women are expected to make up more than a third of all Democratic voters in South Carolina 's primary in five days .
For these women , a unique , and most unexpected dilemma , presents itself :
Should they vote their race , or should they vote their gender ?
No other voting bloc in the country faces this choice .
Democratic analyst Jehmu Greene says , " We 've all wanted the day to come where there was a black person in the White House , where there was going to be a woman in the White House .
I do n't think we imagined it would be having to decide one or the other . "
Greene says women , including herself , face pressure to vote their race .
In the African - American community , there is a perception that race trumps gender , she says .
Clinton supporters are seen as sellouts , Greene and others say .
Hairdresser Shontell Horlback , who is undecided , says , " It 's not like I 'm selling out , not that I 'm not keeping it real ' cause I am , but keeping it real is actually the best candidate for the job . "
Jackson , the Clinton supporter , says she does n't care what others think .
" They do n't pay my bills .
And they 're not attached to my belly .
Nobody is attached to my belly but me .
They do n't feed me , clothe me .
I do n't care what they think .
...
She 's a woman , I 'm a woman . "
Jackson met Clinton at a National Association for the Advancement of Colored People dinner in November .
A picture of them together is boldly displayed in her salon .
A half a dozen pictures of salon employees with former President Clinton also are on what Jackson calls her " Wall of Fame . "
He visited the shop last fall to drum up votes for his wife .
Salons are a target for the campaigns -- across the state they have turned into caucuses of sorts .
They 're where women gather and gossip .
Among them is Toni Dawson : " I make the decision because with Hillary , so many Republicans and independents hate her so much that if she was to become president , I think she would get nothing done because there is so much hate for her , " she says .
" With Obama , he 's a fresh face .
I think he can unite everybody . "
For many here , the decision may come down to experience versus grass - roots energy and excitement .
Greene says , " Black women are really politically savvy , and the question of experience is weighing heavy on their mind .
Maybe race does trump gender as they 're looking at this decision , but I think they also put a very high premium on experience , and that in itself is the real dilemma they are facing . "
Obama supporter Jones reminds the others that " we ca n't focus on what Bill Clinton did for the U.S. "
" We can thank him for that .
He 's no longer our president anymore , " she says .
" We need to focus on her and what she can do to make our country better . "
While race and gender play a role , most women here say they plan to vote based on the issues .
They rank health care , education and the economy in order of importance .
Women say the candidates ' spouses likely also will be part of the decision .
Some black women says they consider Michelle Obama a " rock star . "
They say they are impressed with her strength and like the idea of a strong black woman in the White House if Obama were to go all the way .
Bill Clinton also connects with black women .
They say he 's committed to civil rights and African - Americans .
And of course , there is the " Oprah " factor .
The famous talk - show host is supporting Obama and has campaigned for him in the state .
Greene says that Oprah Winfrey " opened up the door for black women to take a closer look at him .
She said , ' This is my candidate , this is who I 'm backing , ' and I think that made a lot of black women say , " We 've been with the Clintons for several decades , and we think we should take a look at this guy , maybe we should see what he is about . '''
Support for Clinton among women has been growing , while Obama is gaining among African - Americans , the results in last week 's Nevada caucuses show .
How will it go this time around ?
Greene says she believes that " black women will stick with Hillary . "
" I think they are going to take a very long look at her experience , her work to fight for civil rights , fighting for women 's rights , fighting for human rights , and that 's going to play well with them , " she says .
Salon owner Jackson does n't hide what having a woman president would mean to her .
" If she could run for president , then I could run for president one day , right ? " she asks .
If only both candidates were on the same ticket , then women here say that the decision would be a no - brainer .
" Maybe Hillary 's a great vice president for Obama , " Singleton suggests .
Either way , whether it's a woman or a black man , everyone in this salon says they agree it'd be a great day for America .

XML is ten years old today .
It feels like yesterday , or a lifetime .
I wrote this that year ( 1998 ) .
It ’s really long .
The title was originally Good Luck and Internet Plumbing but the filename was “ XML - People ” and I decided I liked that better .
I never got around to publishing it , so why not now ?
Remember , it ’s ten years old ; some of the people and companies are in different places now .
[ Update :
In the comments , John Cowan writes Where Are They Now ?. ]
Ted · Theodore Holm Nelson looks like Peter O’Toole , with a personal style similarly extravagant .
Ted ’s
Web page used to say “ software designer ” , but he ’s never actually built any that mattered ; in truth he ’s a what - if person .
He wrote two good books back in the sixties , Computer Lib and Literary Machines , asking , essentially , what if you put computers to work with language , not just numbers ?
Put the right way , this question leads in some pretty entrancing directions ; for Ted , they were the milk of paradise , and started him building a system named Xanadu .
He ’d invented the word “ hypertext ” ( which is what both h’s stand for in http://www.god.com/love.html and similar billboard fodder everywhere ) , and Xanadu was going to be the universal hypertext that would contain everything worth caring about .
A lot of people spent a lot of time and a lot of other people ’s money and to make a really long story short , Xanadu never shipped .
But it ’s still a live project , Ted claims .
Whether or not Xanadu ever could have worked , or has a future , is n’t that interesting .
Xanadu was one of the great what - if questions , and today ’s World Wide Web is the best answer so far , which gives Ted his place in history .
He is for now in Japan , at a good university near Kamakura , where the great Buddha welcomes all comers .
He ’s had some tough years and he ’s tired , but still strong , and still asking what - if questions .
Mind you , not all of them are going to have answers as big as the Web .
He ’s a wonderful orator and I ’d go out of my way any time to hear him hold forth on pretty well anything .
Many people think
Ted is wrong about any number of important technical issues , but asking the right questions is way more important than getting the right answers .
TimBL · Tim Berners - Lee is sometimes abbreviated TimBL , which rhymes with “ thimble ” .
We have to call him TimBL because there ’s another Tim in this story , namely me .
TimBL ’s a computer programmer by trade .
He used to be a staff geek at CERN , the big physics factory in Switzerland , where hundreds of physicists from everywhere work in tribal shifts , spending tens of millions in hard - won research grants pursuing the neutrino ’s mass ( if any ) and the Higgs boson ’s existence ( or not ) .
These people produce information , lots of it and all the time ; they need to share it around , but the printed scientific journals that used to serve this purpose are just impossibly slow and do n’t help much .
By the time TimBL went to work at CERN , the Internet had been running for a few years , serving only big computers and the first wave of emailers .
The CERN computer group wanted collaboration over the Net , and thought that hypertext , Ted ’s invention , might be the way .
So TimBL built a hypertext that worked across the Internet .
Lots of computer scientists had been chiseling away at the problem for years , but TimBL ignored the entire body of theory and pasted together the simplest possible version with one - way pointers carrying no guarantees of what ( if anything ) they pointed at .
No computer scientist could have conceived of anything so tenuous and fragile .
That turned out to be the World Wide Web , and TimBL is now famous .
In mid-1998 , the McArthur foundation recognized him as an official genius and wrote him a high - six - figures cheque , which is nice because a lot of other people who did n’t invent the Web have made a lot of money there .
TimBL is thin , pale , and twitchy , a well - bred British baby - boomer who circumlocutes and temporizes and gets to the point slowly .
Englishly , he deplores confrontation and can find a way to paint any blood - feud in the colours of unfortunate misunderstanding .
His publications suggest strong idealism , an overriding vision of the future of information space .
His detractors say he ’s a good second - rate programmer who was at the right place at the right time and got lucky .
The McArthur foundation says he ’s a genius .
I ca n’t figure out what he ’s getting at half the time , or why he does things , but I ’ve known a couple of real geniuses and that ’s not necessarily a symptom .
As with most people in this story , you can read what he has to say about himself .
TimBL currently serves as Director of an organization called the World Wide Web Consortium ( everyone says W3C ) , which is the Web family ’s marriage counselor .
By ’ 94 , a lot of people had realized that there was some serious money to be made on the Internet , and a lot of little startups were entering the corporate toddler phase .
The big parental figures like Microsoft and MCI and Sun had learned that none of them could ( quite ) corral the Internet for themselves , and it was obvious that their failure to get along might send the whole industry down the crapper .
So they built the W3C , and put a bunch of academics and dreamers and social liberals in charge of it .
“ For the children ’s sake ” so to speak .
Which is not exactly in line with the ethos of late - modern capitalism , but it must have seemed like a good idea at the time .
If a bunch of businesses get together to agree on shared infrastructure , that arguably contravenes all sorts of antitrust laws .
To get around this , the W3C is structured as a dictatorship , with TimBL having the last word on everything ( the charter is reminiscent of Iran ’s constitution ) , so that all the decisions and policies and standards are nominally the work of one person .
And there ’s no point in litigating against one person ( even after the McArthur grant ) for antitrust violations .
TimBL will certainly be remembered as the chief inventor of HTML ( hypertext markup language ) and HTTP ( hypertext transfer protocol ) which together are the glue that allows all the world ’s computers to paste pretty web pages on the inside of your computer screen .
TimBL now lives in Boston .
Ted and TimBL · Back when he was still trying to convince a skeptical public that the Web was useful , TimBL ’s path crossed Ted ’s at a conference ; hypertext ’s past meeting its future .
Ted dismissed TimBL ’s work as a toy , which was more or less true ; but when when a toy ’s range is the breadth and depth of the Internet , you have to remember that TV and the railways were also once toys .
It turns out that Bill Gates was also at that conference , and both Ted and TimBL were more interested in impressing him than each other .
Both struck out .
Charles · Charles F. Goldfarb is a Jew from New York who got a Harvard law degree and went to work for IBM .
How much more conventional can you get ?
This was in the sixties , and IBM hired him to help them sell their stuff to , and install it at , lawyers ’ offices .
Lawyers deal mostly in text , and at that time processing text with computers was mostly unexplored territory .
Charles and a couple of colleagues eventually invented something they called GML , which allegedly stood for Generalized Markup Language , but then Goldfarb ’s two colleagues had last names beginning with M and L. GML turned out to be really useful in big - time text processing applications , and after some years ’ evolution became an official “ ISO Standard ” , under the name SGML , for Standard Generalized Markup Language .
Becoming such a standard is no mean feat .
ISO , headquartered in Switzerland , is conservative , bureaucratic , and slow ; irritating but arguably beneficial in an organization that exists to write rules for the world ’s infrastructure .
Charles , fiftyish now , is dark , burly , balding , bearded , Californian .
He wears Western - style string ties , talks energetically with a lot of hand movement and still a New York rasp .
He ’s been out of IBM and on the Web now for a few years , but remains synonymous with SGML .
He has been known to say that developing standards is a war of attrition ; the last person left sitting with unglazed eyes around the conference table often gets things their way .
Charles has one of the world ’s true iron butts ; an argument with him is like trying to defend a sandcastle from an incoming tide .
Furthermore , he ’s often right .
This article is n’t really about technology , but I need to explain that SGML , despite the acronym , is not a language but a “ meta - language ” – you use it to build your own computer languages for your own purposes .
Which is a very good idea , because the purposes of people are multifarious indeed , a custom language is often a good solution to a thorny problem .
One of the most famous languages built this way is HTML – the one that TimBL invented for his working answer to Ted ’s original question .
Yuri · Yuri Rubinsky died in early 1996 ( suddenly , of a heart attack ) before our story really got started , and his death affected a lot of people , including me ; I excerpt here from my contribution to his collective online obituary :
I do n't understand how a person can found a software company , tough it out through the bad days , lead it through the vale of Internet Fairy Dust , turn a silly idea into a PC Mag Editor ’s Choice , simultaneously be a pusher , mover , and shaker in the WWW and SGML worlds , get a novel published , wrestle with ISO , and never , so far as I know , cut a throat , stab a back , or crush an ego .
That it is possible to be successful and honourable at the same time is something we should take seriously to heart ; in these days it seems too little respected , or even expected .
That alone would be a monument ; maybe the only important one .
But there are lots of others ; a substantial part of the community , the technology , and the business .
[ Recently … ] he and I walked about 40 blocks home across San Fran … , late at night , talking excitedly about some stuff we want to do on the Web , that might yet turn into another monument .
You know those hills , neither of us were exactly slim nor fit , and we laughed at our own heavy breathing as we slogged up , over and down .
Tough to think that we wo n't be doing that again .
Yuri , a Canadian of Russian descent ; was born in Beirut , Lebanon ( a place we ’ll hear from again ) and , and while his family was Gentile as far as he knew , looked like a caricature of a mid-European Jewish intellectual .
He came out of the typesetting business , built a new company and led it into the SGML business .
He got Charles ’ big book published and wrote its foreword .
Yuri was one of the first to see that TimBL was onto something , becoming an early Web evangelist , getting his company to ship one of the first useful Web authoring tools .
Yuri believed passionately that while TimBL ’s HTML was a cool application , the Web really needed something like SGML if it was going to grow up .
But then he died .
Jon · Jon Bosak is a writer who escaped into high tech from the inspiring but stingy publishing world ; not the first by any means .
Almost any product has to come with instructions on how to make it go , and complicated products like airplanes and Internet switches and cars have to come with complicated maintenance manuals .
This charmless necessary stuff is charmlessly called “ techdoc ” .
Jon is a techdoc guy , one of the best .
He used to work for Novell , the Utah - based networking company .
He did very well there , saving them tons of money and building one of the first really good and useful Web sites , where all the Novell customers could look up the latest and greatest techdoc without having to shuffle paper .
This work was all based on SGML , Charles ’ invention ; Jon ’s use of it to drive a Web site worked beautifully and should have been a signpost for the industry .
Jon , another boomer , is shortish , and looks like the child that might have been born to John Lennon and a Kennedy .
His attire is resolutely and consistently brown and tweedy ; he wears wire rims , and struggles constantly under the weight of loads of computer technology .
We all carry computers now ; Jon , however , has the biggest , heaviest laptop money can buy , and travels , just to be sure , also with a speakerphone and small printer .
In his brown clothes , with bulging satchels , he looks like Kenneth Grahame ’s Mr. Rat off to a picnic .
Jon is a highly effective platform speaker ; he has mastered the unusual but good rhetorical technique of driving home a key point by lowering his voice , speaking more slowly , and closing his eyes .
Jon went from Novell to work for Sun Microsystems , a big , sexy , Silicon Valley computer company ; he lives in Los Altos in the heart of the Valley .
Jon and Yuri went way back , sharing the view that the Web needed SGML ; but the Web was being built in suburban California warehouses by kids in shorts and T - shirts , who saw SGML as a big , corporate , blue - suit kind of thing .
Nonetheless , Jon decided that TimBL ’s W3C should make SGML happen on the Web .
The W3C did n’t see it that way and ignored him ; since he would n’t shut up and go away , they told him sure , he could launch an “ SGML on the Web ” activity if he did all the work , but to shut up and go away while he did it .
We ’ll jump a little bit ahead in the story here ; Jon ’s SGML - on - the - Web eventually became known as “ Extensible Markup Language ” ( XML for short ) and is now a certifiably Big Deal on the Internet .
So from here on in , we ’ll just say “ XML ” and save space ; but we ’re really talking about Standard Generalized Markup Language on the World Wide Web .
James · James Clark is a computer programmer .
People in the trade will tell you that a good programmer is n’t twice as good as an average one , but many times as good .
There ’s no meter to measure such things , but I ’ve worked for , and with , and managed , a lot of them , and my experience is that the performance of working programmers varies by a factor of at least 100 .
James is at 100 .
His ancestors made enough money that he , a GenXer , does n’t really have to work .
He is our story ’s second Englishman , but is less polished and much more direct than TimBL .
He has not let the fact that he is a deity in our technical community go to his head , is good company for dinner or a beer , and unpretentious on the Web .
James is thin , darkish , open - faced , does n’t stand out in a crowd ; is erudite on wine , fine cooking , and text processing .
What James cares about is typography , and in particular how to arrange for computers to do it better than they do now .
What he does about it is write fine software and give it away for free .
James decided the world needed good SGML software .
Unfortunately , SGML , as defined by Charles and his committee , was insanely complex and studded with options , many of which interacted in surprising and hard - to - understand ways .
Thus , SGML software was scarce , expensive , and often flaky .
James wrote a program called SP ( for SGML Parser – one could imagine something sexier ) that is so good that it has become the de facto definition of what is SGML and what is n’t .
Naturally , he gives it away for free .
He lives in Bangkok because he likes Thai food and the language .
He may have friends or family who are not Internet , programming , or typography geeks , but I ’ve never met any .
He works on problems that interest him .
A German software company which once tried to buy some consulting from James ( they subsequently retained me , which is how I know ) were gently discouraged , with the explanation that he was quite expensive and really only interested in challenging problems .
How expensive , they asked .
If he were to come visit them and advise them on their problems , he would require a donation be made , in the amount of £ 10,000 , to a Thai charity of James ’ choice .
Jon and James ·
When Jon was launching the XML project , he took advantage of the W3 C ’s obliviousness to load the committee with people that he thought good , without regard to their corporate positioning .
The first was James ; since his name is one to conjure with , Jon persuaded him to accept the title of “ Technical Lead ” .
He deserves his place in this story if only for having invented the acronym XML – if we assert that X stands for Extensible , then it does .
The XML project has run mostly by teleconference and email .
James is not pushy on the phone , and his soft South England vowels do n’t cut through the echo-y , static -y line from Bangkok very well , so we have to listen hard to hear what he says .
Which we do .
Tim ·
This is me , a fortysomething Canadian raised mostly in Beirut ( there it is again ) .
I ’m profoundly bookish and discovered early that writing is always difficult , sometimes boring , and usually poorly paid , while computer programming is mostly easy , only rarely boring , and remarkably lucrative .
I ’m a good programmer ( somewhere in the middle of that scale where James scores 100 ) , a competent writer , and ( for my profession , where standards are low ) an unusually good orator .
This , despite my general disorganization , laziness , and lousy management skills , has been enough to get me through .
I ’m average size , average weight , fair , largely bald , with a vaguely Mennonite look caused by wearing a beard sans mustache , and speak average toneless mid-North - American .
Before XML , the most fun I ’d had at work was helping with the computerization of the Oxford English Dictionary .
The OED , in its computerized form , was stored in almost - but - not - quite SGML , and I was a fan of the basic ideas starting about 1987 .
A couple of colleagues and I started a company based on that technology , which proved only marginally interesting to the real world ; we limped along for years until the Web came along and suddenly everybody wanted one .
I built one of the first big Web search engines and we did an IPO and I got sick of corporate life and went independent .
I live in Vancouver , Canada .
Jon and Tim ·
In May 1996 , I delivered the closing speech at an SGML conference in Munich , exhorting SGML to simplify itself and get with the Web .
Jon wandered up just afterward and asked me to join his XML project .
I said no .
A couple of weeks later I realized what a good idea he had , and called back to say yes .
Jon said no ; but then he changed his mind too .
Jon and I see eye to eye on most points , and appreciate each other ’s obsessions .
Also I think we work well together on a stage ; Jon smaller , browner , still , focused ; I larger , pinker , louder , animated .
Eve · Eve Maler , a Honolulu - born boomer now in suburban New England , toiled for years , like Jon , in the techdoc mines .
I mentioned earlier that SGML ( and XML ) are used for inventing your own computer languages .
Languages are n’t easy – birthing a new one is on the same order of difficulty as a screenplay , or a family of typefaces , or a housing development .
Eve is perhaps the world ’s leading expert on the practice of how you go about doing this ; the book she co-wrote on the subject is probably the best reference .
Eve is buxom , curly - haired , full of smiles .
Some people foolishly conclude that she is a technical lightweight and usually end up exposing their foolishness in public .
In particular , Eve ’s years in techdoc have made her a virtuoso among editors ; no mistake , no matter how small , escapes her probing eye .
Michael · C. Michael Sperberg - McQueen has a name that is unusually long by any standard and was , during our many months of teleconferences , mangled every time by the operator .
He knows a great deal about the use of computers to get complicated things printed , and is a language designer of some repute .
Michael is erudite on a frightening variety of subjects , speaks perfect German , is a polished writer and a competent computer programmer .
He became famous in the SGML community first as a gifted and stirring speaker – the perennial closing - keynote at our big conferences – and as a leader of the Text Encoding Initiative ( TEI ) .
The TEI is the result of years of collaborative work by many of the world ’s best humanities - computing academics .
It is a family of SGML - based languages which are used to store an amazing variety of electronic scholarly texts including Chaucer , Strindberg , the correspondence of Proust , Serbian Proverbs , Voltaire , and Japanese Map Task Dialogues .
Michael , about 8 feet tall , correspondingly broad - shouldered , and with a bit of middle - aged spread , would be an intimidating presence were he not so professorial .
He is at all times in strict conformance with the dress code of the Midwestern academic : tweeds , checks , scarf , cloth cap .
The Honeymoon · I guess at some point I have to mix some events into this story .
Jon formed the committee , which started work in August 1996 .
Michael and I were appointed co-editors of XML .
We worked out the technology in telephone conferences and group email .
On the committee were some other people that do n’t get their own write - ups here ; this is totally unfair , because they did as much of the work as the people you are meeting .
But since I ’m the writer , I get to pick the cast of characters , based on how much fun they are to write about .
In one sentence : XML is a meta - language built by taking SGML , throwing out most of the little - used advanced features , building in good foreign - character support , and a few other technical tweaks not worth expounding on here .
The world seems to like it .
Our first draft specification came out in November 1996 .
Its construction was a wonderful experience .
Jon had stacked the committee with people who knew meta- languages , who understood the Web , and who knew what worked and what did n’t .
Jon did not invite Charles on board , and whereas Charles has never said a word about this , it is reasonable to suppose that he is hurt to this day .
We all knew each other , used the same vocabulary , and wanted more or less the same thing .
We had technical differences , passionate at times ; but the progress was fast and steady .
Charles and Michael and Tim ·
We on the committee were working hard , designing XML at top speed and having fun doing it .
Eventually , we reached the vexatious question of whether we had to be 100 % compatible with SGML ; Michael and I had some ideas for changes that felt like real improvements .
Charles got wind of this and went nuts .
To introduce our changes would have been to betray our heritage , to split the industry , to throw away a decade ’s gains , to spit , it seemed in the face of all that was good and sacred .
So he launched a war of attrition , his chief tactic being to telephone the members of the committee , one by one , and fill the phone line with heated ( and in some part reasonable ) arguments against our apostasy .
He was not unreasonable , he was not sleazy , and he was not unfriendly .
He was also not willing to get off the phone until you ’d conceded his point .
Since he had a habit of calling up after 8 PM , this could get seriously trying .
Charles ’ butt proved more ironic than those of a substantial number of committee members , his incoming tide washed away the opposing arguments .
Enough , eventually , that the committee was split on the issue , more or less evenly , and most of the new ideas died unborn ( in retrospect , this was not entirely a bad thing ) .
It still seems unreasonable to me that one person can by sheer endurance beat down a committee of 11 , who are on average 10 years or more younger , but there you go .
Lauren · Lauren Wood is a New Zealander whose adult life has been in Australia and Germany .
She has a Ph.D. in theoretical nuclear physics and speaks fluent German , but discovered the same work - pay relationship between physics and programming that I discovered between writing and programming .
She has now been toiling in the publishing software mines for years .
Lauren is smallish , slenderish , dark - haired , pale - skinned , large - eyed , and speaks with an Auckland lilt that can veer into complete opacity on words with a strong “ O ” , such as “ word ” and “ cold ” .
She is cheerful , patient , and very good company .
Tim and Lauren and Yuri · I met Lauren at a conference in Montreux ; she was working for a German company that sold , among other things , my company ’s software .
Then I met her again at a conference in Singapore , and she visited me in Vancouver .
Pretty soon I was trying to convince her to stay in Vancouver , but there was the little matter of a job and citizenship and so on .
Fortunately , I ran into Yuri at an airport .
In the near - empty pallid grey of the baggage - claim , he twisted my arm to help him write a book about SGML on the Web .
I twisted his arm to help get Lauren a job in Vancouver ( where he had a programming shop ) .
Since I was short of time , he failed to get my help with the book .
Since our industry is short of talent , the job was no problem .
Canadian immigration issues melted away like the infrequent Vancouver snow in the face of a native English speaker with a Ph.D. , a marketable skill , and a company begging to hire her .
In her new job , Lauren quickly got involved in the XML project .
We were married in November 1996 , just after XML was unleashed on the world .
Jean · Jean Paoli is a citizen of France but really Lebanese , a typical Levantine ethnic cocktail : dark , burly , hirsute , chubby - faced .
Jean , like I , left Beirut for more favorable climes when the people of Lebanon , funded and encouraged their neighbors and by the great powers , took up civil war as a pastime .
He was the main brain at a little French software company that sucked at the teat of the European Union and other continental bureaucracies , and had a nice line of SGML products very early on .
Jean was closely involved with the European research establishment , and clued into the Web just about on day one .
His was a famous face in the SGML world , and everyone noticed when , one day , he packed his bags and moved from Paris to Redmond to work for Microsoft .
Jean was a charter member of Jon ’s XML project ; the idea that Microsoft would actually pay attention to our dream was more than a little intoxicating .
Jean , a leading co-conspirator during XML ’s honeymoon , soon leaves the story , for reasons we ’ll get into later .
Phil · Phil Karlton died in 1997 ( in an Italian auto accident while on vacation ) , so only takes a brief turn on this stage .
Way into the top half of that 1 - to - 100 programming proficiency scale , he had a good academic career , then worked at the revered Xerox Palo Alto Research Center .
Xerox PARC was where they invented icons and pointers and windows and workstations ; but management was too dumb to ever make serious money from these things .
Phil went to work for Netscape , the startup darling of the Internet , not in its first days , but around the time it achieved critical mass .
His job there was to provide general technical leadership ; he was old enough that his son was also on the Netscape programming staff .
Phil was an ugly bald whiskery sweet man , with lots of rough edges and an apparently - perfect 20 - year marriage that , I think , intimidated many whose relationships are more mundane and compromise - laden .
He drove an NSX and played ball - hockey and lived intensely ; all this is well - documented .
Lauren and Tim and Phil · Phil , his wife Jan , Lauren and I are meeting for dinner at a nice Italian restaurant on El Camino in the Valley .
Since we have a positive personal buzz , the deal is that this is a social engagement , not a technology debate nor a plot - hatching session .
The hostess leads us to a small table beside a large , boisterous party .
Phil asks her who the people are ( you need to be careful in the Valley ) .
From Microsoft , she says , and Phil , in his booming rasp , answers without a pause “ Microsoft ?
I wo n’t sit beside them – let ’s go over there . ”
Over dinner , despite our best efforts , conversation veers again and again into matters of Internet politics and markup languages and software technology .
Phil lets this happen , but every time a new acronym or piece of jargon or person ’s name flies across the table , he stops , turns to Jan ( who is an artist – not geeky at all ) , and explains in clear layman ’s terms what or where or who it is .
Such consideration is not common ; even at second hand , it is moving .
Ned and Mick · Some of the people in this story are companies .
Ned is Netscape and Mick is Microsoft .
Yes , any company , au fond , is just a collection of people .
But some companies , at some times , are more than that , and their representatives are both less and more than people .
Less , because they perforce speak with a voice not their own , and more , because that voice is the voice of hundreds or thousands ( of colleagues ) , and of millions or billions ( of dollars ) .
For example , while Jean was just Jean at the beginning of the process , once Microsoft got really interested he stopped being Jean and starting speaking with Mick ’s voice .
It ’s hard to argue with a company , because they make their decision off stage , and their role in a dialogue is then to win their point , not to strive for truth .
And as XML became increasingly successful , Jean ’s role on our committee was filled by a succession of other Microsoft staffers , whose individual personalities matter little .
Mick is a domineering , ruthless , greedy , egotistical , self - centered , paranoid bastard .
Whether or not he ’s actually a crook is , as they say , currently the subject of litigation ; but he ’s not good company or a good friend .
The ruthlessness and greed would not be so irritating ( we swim , after all , in late - capitalist waters ) were they not accompanied , at all times , by Mick ’s claim to speak not in his own interest , but selflessly on behalf of his millions of customers , whose needs only he understands .
Thus , anyone who disagrees is conspiring against the interests of the world ’s computer users .
Mick ’s other really irritating habit is constant grating prating about “ great ” products and “ innovation ” .
Certain Microsoft executives are going to spend eternity fleeing around the bolgias of Hell from demons wielding branding irons on which “ great software ” and “ innovation ” glow white - hot .
A very large majority in the computing trades think the products are mostly pretty poor , and see the company as the single greatest roadblock to innovation in our profession .
Netscape a.k.a.
Ned was definitely the new kid on the block .
His parents were an academic staff geek who added pictures to the Web , and a money manager who ’d launched a couple of high tech high flyers .
Ned came from nowhere at just the right time and suddenly Owned The Internet , in large part because Mick had n’t noticed it ; if Bill had paid more attention to Ted and TimBL at that long - past conference , the world would be different .
Coming from nowhere and Owning The Internet turn out to be bad influences in the young life of a company .
Ned was like a rookie pitcher who burns ‘ em up in his first 20 games with a wicked screwball , but wo n’t listen to the pitching coach who tells him to mix them up , nor to the trainer who tells him he ’ll burn out his arm , nor to the manager who tells him the hitters will eventually figure that screwball out .
While Mick got with the XML program , Ned steadfastly ignored it .
Jon ’s XML gang disliked this , so all of us pounded on Ned ’s door , besieged him with email , called everyone we knew with a line in , trying to send the message that this was important , and that Mick was getting into it big time .
Ned did n’t have time for us , because Ned Owned the Internet and do n’t you forget it .
Lauren and Phil · Lauren had met Phil in connection with another W3C activity , and they had hit it off .
She was known to be one of the SGML bigots who were playing this XML game , and yet she seemed young , Web - oriented , pragmatic ; not one of the crusty ISOfied bureaucrats .
So Lauren got a call one day , and took a quick trip from Vancouver to Silicon Valley .
It ’s the same time zone , you can get up in Vancouver and make a 10:30 meeting down there , which is fine because technical meetings in the Valley are never before noon .
She spent the day closeted with Phil and a bunch of other senior Netscape hacks , and , it seems , made the sale .
Ned was now officially an XML fan .
Ned and Tim · Trouble was , Ned still Owned The Internet , except for Mick was pouring hundreds of millions into Internet R&D so he could give software away , drive Ned into out of the business , and Own The Internet himself .
Thus Ned was preoccupied , and did n’t really have anybody on staff who understood XML issues .
The solution was pretty obvious to me .
I was independent , remember , and I ’d been doing all this XML work pro bono , first of all because it was a good thing to do , and because I thought I ’d have some spare time while my business picked up .
It turned out to be hot stuff , and very time - consuming , and I did n’t want to let go , but I did want to get paid .
So I gave Ned the big pitch – offering myself as their eyes and ears ; they ’d get to find out what was going on , they ’d visibly be no longer ignoring XML , and I ’d make some money .
They bought that pitch , which was certainly a good deal for me ; basically I was getting paid for what I ’d been doing anyhow ; all I had to do was to write them a weekly email report , and pay regular visits to brief their engineers .
Except for those regular visits never happened ; their engineers were too busy Owning The Internet to pay attention to outside ideas .
Eve and TimBL ·
It ’s early 1997 ; at a nice restaurant in Santa Clara , a few of us gather for dinner with TimBL .
This is the first time he has actually spoken with the XML gang , and the first time some of them have met him .
I am sitting next to Eve , across the table from TimBL .
TimBL starts to expound another of his brilliant ideas , which while technically not half bad , exhibits profound ignorance of a decade of history .
Imagine a young priest sitting down with a conclave of cardinals and explaining that the Catholic message would be so much more coherent if they dropped all that rococo blessed - virgin - Mary - mother - of - God stuff .
After a certain amount of this , Eve is literally shaking with fury , the volume is up , and the waiters are watching our table nervously .
On the way back to our hotel , Lauren , looking puzzled , asks me a reasonable question : “ were you flirting with Eve ? ”
And I am forced to admit that I had put my hand on her thigh more than once .
But these were cautionary cool - it - buddy pats ; I ’d had this vision of Eve hurtling across the table to get a stranglehold on TimBL , and I ’d bet on Eve in that fistfight any day .
It would have been seriously bad publicity for XML if one of our committee members were publicly to inflict violence on the Inventor Of The Web .
Mick and TimBL and Tim · First thing I did in co-operation with Ned was publish a paper that got a lot of attention around the W3C and sent some smiles Ned ’s way .
Mick went ballistic ; this was the period before the Department of Justice had really started nosing around , when Netscape delenda est was the tune of the day in Redmond , and no blow was too low .
So Jean called me up and wondered if I would drop Ned and start working with Mick ; the details did n’t really matter , but the price would be good .
I declined , since I was having too much fun , and as I told Jean , Ned really needed the help .
“ Tim , ” said Jean , “ personne n’est irremplaceable , ” but his voice was sad , because I was n’t buying it .
So Mick called up TimBL and said “ one of the XML co-editors has been co-opted by the evil Ned , and we ca n’t have that ” .
I was ordered to resign as co-editor , and Jon was ordered not to reappoint me without unanimous consent , which Mick would of course withhold .
I refused to go gentle into that good night ; in fact , I sustained a childish tantrum for some weeks , scurrying around soliciting support from other committee members and publishing an intemperate Philippic .
Mick ’s idea was that my defenestration should be accomplished quietly and with the minimum of fuss .
Thus my shrill public squealing was acutely embarrassing for all concerned , and gave the Mick - haters ( there are lots ) opportunities for gleeful if not entirely sincere Expressions Of Grave Concern At This Questionable Process .
In all this nastiness , Jon distinguished himself by ( outward ) reasonable calm , and by refusing to do anything on grounds of expedience , requiring rather a basis in principle for each action .
Three weeks after my execution , I was exhumed and revivified ; you ’ll still see my name on the front of the XML specification .
It probably helped that it would have been difficult at that time to find someone else with the spare cycles and expertise .
As part of the deal , Jean was named the third XML co-editor , which was a good idea anyhow .
Nov. 14 , 1996 · XML was officially unleashed on the world on Nov. 14 , 1996 at the annual SGML conference , which draws a thousand or two to the frozen Northeast .
Nine members of the XML committee sat in a semicircle on the stage .
Jon and Michael and James and I spoke to a packed and electric room .
James , who has a tendency to mumbling and jargon , was dynamic , even cracked a joke .
Charles was not in the audience .
The SGML community , smelling Internet money and the mainstream , took about 15 seconds to buy in .
Jon and I turned our attention to selling it to the rest of the world .
We besieged technical journalists , scrambled for speaking spots at every significant industry conference .
We thought we ’d face a brick wall of resistance and indifference and were determined to batter through it .
It melted .
It turned out that Jon and Yuri had been right all along ; the Web apparently needed more or less exactly what we ’d been building .
You can read about it now in newsstand magazines – TIME and The Economist , forsooth – and a few of us , Jon and I as chief evangelists , but others as well – have become low - grade Internet celebrities as a result .
Of course , then the honeymoon was over .
The people in this story do n’t matter any more .
The voices around the table – and there are more of them – are those of Microsoft , Sun , IBM , Adobe , and so on , not of individuals .
There ’s less debate and more posturing .
Some voices are lightweights and add little value , but each jealously demands its time slot .
This is n’t about technology any more , and certainly not people , it ’s business .
The Internet business , for all the visionary rhetoric , has to do with nothing but money and power and executive ego .
Dinner With Ted · Spring 1998 in Brisbane , Australia .
This is the 1998 version of the same conference where , in 1996 , the XML idea was born .
This is the official World Wide Web conference , and Ted has been invited to receive an award for his contributions ; in his remarks , he hushed the thousand - odd people in the room , saying “ Thank you .
This is a first ; nobody ’s ever given me an award before . ”
That evening , someone organizes a dinner date for Ted and a bunch of the XML tribe , including Jon and Eve and me .
It ’s a lovely restaurant on the riverfront with good food and good wine and lots of it ( Australia ’s like that ) .
A warm wind blows in scents of the Great Barrier reef .
We talk and talk about fine books and fine computer programs and fine food , and we disagree often , at high volume and in high good humor .
It ’s all luck , it ’s just luck sings Joni Mitchell , and we ’re in a profession and at a time where there ’s a lot of it about ; still , sharing laughs around the table , on the waterfront under Southern stars , with an inventor of the world you work in , that ’s really a lot of luck .
James and Lauren and Tim · Spring 1998 , late evening in a hotel lobby in Seattle .
We ’re at the first - ever big commercial XML conference ; though poorly marketed and programmed , it ’s drawn over seven hundred people out of the woodwork .
Clearly we ’re catching a good break in the Internet wave .
James , true to form , has hidden for a few weeks in Bangkok and quietly built some XML software that is the best and fastest anywhere .
From the stage on the morrow it will be announced that it ’s getting wired into two of the Internet ’s most influential software suites ( Mozilla and Perl , for those who know such names ) .
We ’ve realized , over dinner , that James ’ working name for his code , xtok ( sounds like something you buy at a head shop ) , just wo n’t do .
We sip a good local beer and have fun with names …
James is settling on expat , which might stand for “ excellent XML processor and toolkit ” , on top of which he is one .
Then a bloated suited Industry Leader sees us inexplicably ignoring all the other suited Decision Makers drawn northwest by the smell of money rising over a new acronym .
He butts in to offer his opinion on Strategic Media Convergence or some such , so we finish our beers and go to bed .

The creators of the virus are after bank logins and personal data
In the last month , the malicious program has racked up about 5,000 victims - most of whom are in Europe .
Many are falling victim via booby - trapped websites that use vulnerabilities in Microsoft 's browser to install the attack code .
Experts say the virus is dangerous because it buries itself deep inside Windows to avoid detection .
Old tricks
The malicious program is a type of virus known as a rootkit and it tries to overwrite part of a computer 's hard drive called the Master Boot Record ( MBR ) .
This is where a computer looks when it is switched on for information about the operating system it will be running .
" If you can control the MBR , you can control the operating system and therefore the computer it resides on , " wrote Elia Florio on security company Symantec 's blog .
Mr Florio pointed out that many viruses dating from the days before Windows used the Master Boot Record to get a grip on a computer .
Once installed the virus , dubbed Mebroot by Symantec , usually downloads other malicious programs , such as keyloggers , to do the work of stealing confidential information .
Most of these associated programs lie in wait on a machine until its owner logs in to the online banking systems of one of more than 900 financial institutions .
The Russian virus - writing group behind Mebroot is thought to have created the torpig family of viruses that are known to have been installed on more than 200,000 systems .
This group specialises in stealing bank login information .
Security firm iDefense said Mebroot was discovered in October but started to be used in a series of attacks in early December .
Between 12 December and 7 January , iDefense detected more than 5,000 machines that had been infected with the program .
Analysis of Mebroot has shown that it uses its hidden position on the MBR as a beachhead so it can re-install these associated programs if they are deleted by anti-virus software .
Although the password - stealing programs that Mebroot installs can be found by security software , few commercial anti-virus packages currently detect its presence .
Mebroot cannot be removed while a computer is running .
Independent security firm GMER has produced a utility that will scan and remove the stealthy program .
Computers running Windows XP , Windows Vista , Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2000 that are not fully patched are all vulnerable to the virus .

U.S. News & World Report
March 22 , 2008
As the fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq fades from the front pages , analysts are turning their attention to what is often called the forgotten war .
Many fear that progress in Afghanistan is stalled and that the country is in need of major new measures to reinvigorate the war effort against the Taliban and other extremist factions .
To that end , talk is increasingly turning to a troop surge for Afghanistan .
The conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank , which was instrumental in designing the current surge strategy in Iraq , in January convened an “ Afghanistan Planning Group ” that will shortly announce recommendations for an influx of troops into Afghanistan as well .
“ It ’s clear to everyone who looks at it that more troops are necessary in Afghanistan , ” says Frederick Kagan , an AEI fellow and an architect of the surge strategy in Iraq .
It is clear to U.S. military officials that efforts in Afghanistan are faltering and that more troops could help turn the tide .
Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry , former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and now the deputy chairman of NATO ’s military committee , says that there is currently a shortage of maneuver and infantry forces in the country .
What ’ s more , he adds , there are not enough troops to train the Afghan Army and police .
“ That ’s the greatest shortfall , ” he adds .
To that end , the U.S. is now sending some 3,200 marines into the country .
Half of them will serve as trainers , and the other half will serve as combat troops backing up British troops in violent , drug- producing Helmand province .
But American soldiers — stretched to the limit in Iraq — are at a premium .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has repeatedly called on NATO member countries to contribute more troops to the troubled country .
To date , these pleas have not inspired an overwhelming response among NATO partner countries .

1. Surfing will slow
PEERING into Tech.view 's crystal ball , the one thing we can predict with at least some certainty is that 2008 will be the year we stop taking access to the internet for granted .
The internet is not about to grind to a halt , but as more and more users clamber aboard to download music , video clips and games while communicating incessantly by e-mail , chat and instant messaging , the information superhighway sometimes crawls with bumper - to - bumper traffic .
The biggest road - hog remains spam ( unsolicited e- mail ) , which accounts for 90 % of traffic on the internet .
Phone companies and other large ISPs ( internet service providers ) have tolerated it for years because it would cost too much to fix .
Besides , eliminating spam would only benefit their customers , not themselves .
How so ?
Because the big fat pipes used by ISPs operate symmetrically , with equal bandwidth for upstream and downstream traffic .
But end -users have traditionally downloaded megabytes of information from the web , while uploading only kilobytes of key strokes and mouse clicks .
So , when spammers dump billions of pieces of e-mail onto the internet , it travels over the phone companies ' relatively empty upstream segments .
That can't last .
For a start , millions of gadgets are joining the human hordes .
Any gizmo worth its silicon these days has its own internet connection — so it can update itself automatically , communicate autonomously with other digital species , and anticipate its user 's every whim .
AFP
Part of the solution ?
Soon , portable media - players , personal navigators , digital cameras , DVD players , flat - panel TV sets , and even mobile phones wo n't be able to function properly without access to the internet .
Expect even digital picture frames to have a WiFi connection so they can grab the latest photos from Flickr .
Meanwhile , users are changing the way they use the internet : they are now uploading , as well as downloading , gigabytes galore — thanks to the popularity of social networks like Facebook , YouTube and MySpace .
Hailed by the industry as the wave of the future , “ user - generated content ” is proving to be a tsunami of unprecedented proportions .
Everyone , it seems , is suddenly a budding Martin Scorsese , bent on sharing his or her home - made videos with fellow YouTubers .
Once the biggest files being shared via Napster and other P2P ( peer - to - peer ) networks were MP3 music tracks occupying a few modest megabytes .
Today , music videos and TV episodes of hundreds of megabytes are being swapped over the internet by BitTorrent , Gnutella and other file - sharing networks .
And it 's all two - way traffic .
The whole point of P2P is that everyone who is downloading is simultaneously uploading to others .
That 's just the beginning .
Legal or otherwise , swapping multi-gigabyte high - definition video and movie files is becoming increasingly common .
In fact , it will soon be the norm .
Television networks have found they can make more money from advertising while giving their show away for free over the internet than they can from broadcasting them .
Now the movie studios are learning to do much the same .
The result is a gridlock .
That the telephone companies are running out of bandwidth can be seen from their equipment orders .
Cisco , the leading supplier of core routers used to direct traffic over the internet 's backbone , has just had another bumper quarter , with net income up 37 % over the same period a year ago .
Juniper Networks , another information - technology firm , did even better .
Both companies credit the proliferation of social networks , the craze for internet searching , multimedia downloading , and the widespread adoption of P2P sharing for the surge in new business .
While major internet service providers like AT&T , Verizon and Comcast all plan to upgrade their backbones , it will be a year or two before improvements begin to show .
By then , internet television will be in full bloom , spammers will have multiplied ten - fold , WiFi will be embedded in every moving object , and users will be screaming for yet more capacity .
In the meantime , accept that surfing the web is going to be more like travelling the highways at holiday time .
You 'll get there , eventually , but the going wo n't be great .
2. Surfing will detach
Earlier this month , Google bid for the most desirable chunk ( known as C - block ) of the 700 - megahertz wireless spectrum being auctioned off by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) in late January 2008 .
The 700 - megahertz frequencies used by channels 52 to 69 of analog television are being freed up by the switch to all - digital broadcasting in February 2009 .
The frequencies concerned are among the world 's most valuable .
They were used for broadcasting UHF television because they suffered little atmospheric absorption , could be beamed for miles , and could then penetrate all the nooks and crannies in buildings .
Their relatively short wavelength makes the transmission equipment compact and the antennas small .
Mobile phone companies lust after the 700 megahertz frequencies because of their long range and broadband capabilities .
They see lots of lucrative things like mobile television and other broadband services to offer customers .
But the 700 megahertz band is also the last great hope for a “ third pipe ” for internet access in America .
Such a wireless network would offer consumers a serious alternative to the pricey and poor DSL ( digital subscriber line ) services they get from the likes of AT&T and Verizon , and to the marginally better cable broadband Comcast provides .
Over the past couple of months , techdom has been abuzz with rumours about Google getting into the mobile phone business — with a G - Phone to trump Apple 's iPhone .
That 's highly unlikely .
The speculation was triggered by the company 's recent unveiling of its Android operating - system for mobile phones .
But the whole point of Android is not to allow Google to make fancy handsets , but to make it easier for others to do so .
The aim , of course , is to flood the market with “ open access ” phones that have none of the restrictions that big carriers impose — like not being able to download software and games from other makers , or search the internet freely , or make free VoIP ( voice of internet protocol ) calls from within a WiFi hotspot .
Android has been made available to a group of manufacturers orchestrated by Google and known as the Open Handset Alliance .
One of the nimblest of the group , HTC of Taiwan , has already started showing a BlackBerry - like prototype based on the Android operating system .
Expect to see a raft of Android phones from other manufacturers over the coming months .
Nor is Google in the business of building a network of cellular antennas and fat communications pipes .
Should it win the bidding for C - block , it would presumably team up with Frontline Wireless , a startup with serious expertise and money behind it .
That 's because Google 's core business is organising knowledge and giving users access to it .
Google makes its money — and lots of it — from matching advertisers to consumers who use its search engine to look up things , not from tinkering with slim - margin ventures like wireless networks .
But despite owning the world 's largest knowledge base — with over 60 % of the online search market — Google is at the mercy of others who control the on-ramps to the internet .
That rankles .
Worse , it has no way of getting at the other billion users who rely more on mobile phones than personal computers to organise their lives .
Clearly , the time has come to muscle into the moribund mobile - phone business .
Bidding $ 5 billion or more ( the reserve is $ 4.6 billion ) to beat out wireless heavyweights like AT&T and Verizon could give Google the option to become a cell - phone operator in partnership with Frontline , with a ready supply of handsets from its alliance partners and none of the hassles of running a network .
Alternatively , it could become an internet service provider with a long - range wireless network to rival the WiMAX networks being built by Sprint and others .
But Google may want to do neither .
Sceptics note that Google single - handedly persuaded the FCC to attach all manner of “ open access ” provisions to the C - block of frequencies — something that was anathema to the mobile - phone companies .
Verizon even sued the FCC in a bid to block its move to open access .
Having failed to do so , Verizon now says it will open its network to third - party devices sometime in the future — and presumably for an additional charge .
But the FCC is not just taking Verizon 's word for it .
The winner of the C - block of frequencies , whoever that may be ( and Verizon is the odds - on favourite ) , will have to open the network to any device that meets the basic specification .
And the devices themselves will have to be open to other suppliers ' software and services .
In short , win or lose , Google has already achieved its objective .
Internet searches will doubtless be as popular among mobile - internet surfers as among their sedentary cousins .
Owning at least 60 % of the mobile search market is the prize Google has been after all along .
3. Surfing — and everything else computer - related — will open
Rejoice : the embrace of “ openness ” by firms that have grown fat on closed , proprietary technology is something we 'll see more of in 2008 .
Verizon is not the only one to cry uncle and reluctantly accept the inevitable .
Even Apple , long a bastion of closed systems , is coming round to the open idea .
Its heavily protected iPhone was hacked within days of being launched by owners determined to run third - party software like Skype on it .
Apple 's initial response was to attempt a heavy - handed crackdown .
But then a court decision in Germany forced its local carrier to unlock all iPhones sold there .
Good news for iPhone owners everywhere : a flood of third - party applications is now underway .
The trend toward openness has been given added impetus by the recent collapse of the legal battles brought by SCO , a software developer .
Formerly known as Santa Cruz Operations , the firm bought the Unix operating system and core technology in 1995 from Novell ( which , in turn , had bought it from its original developer , AT&T ) .
Short of cash , SCO initiated a series of lawsuits against companies developing Linux software , claiming it contained chunks of copyrighted Unix code .
Pressured by worried customers fearing prosecution , a handful of Linux distributors settled with SCO just to stay in business .
But IBM , which uses Linux , was having none of it , and fought the firm through the courts until it won .
SCO is now operating under Chapter 11 of the American bankruptcy code .
The verdict removed , once and for all , the burden that had been inhibiting Linux 's broader acceptance .
Linux is now accepted as being Unix - like , but not a Unix - derivative .
Bulletproof distributions of Linux from Red Hat and Novell have long been used on back - office servers .
Since the verdict against SCO , Linux has swiftly become popular in small businesses and the home .
That 's largely the doing of Gutsy Gibbon , the code - name for the Ubuntu 7.10 from Canonical .
Along with distributions such as Linspire , Mint , Xandros , OpenSUSE and gOS , Ubuntu ( and its siblings Kubuntu , Edubuntu and Xubuntu ) has smoothed most of Linux 's geeky edges while polishing it for the desktop .
No question , Gutsy Gibbon is the sleekest , best integrated and most user - friendly Linux distribution yet .
It 's now simpler to set up and configure than Windows .
A great deal of work has gone into making the graphics , and especially the fonts , as intuitive and attractive as the Mac's .
Like other Linux desktop editions , Ubuntu works perfectly well on lowly machines that could n't hope to run Windows XP , let alone Vista Home Edition or Apple 's OS-X .
Your correspondent has been happily using Gutsy Gibbon on a ten - year - old desktop with only 128 megabytes of RAM and a tiny 10 gigabyte hard - drive .
When Michael Dell , the boss of Dell Computers , runs Ubuntu on one of his home systems , Linux is clearly doing many things right .
And because it is free , Linux become the operating system of choice for low - end PCs .
It started with Nicholas Negroponte , the brains behind the One Laptop Per Child project that aims to deliver computerised education to children in the developing world .
His clever XO laptop , costing less than $ 200 , would never have seen the light of day without its clever Linux operating system .
But Mr Negroponte has done more than create one of the world 's most ingenious computers .
With a potential market measured in the hundreds of millions , he has frightened a lot of big - time computer makers into seeing how good a laptop they can build for less than $ 500 .
All start with a desktop version of Linux .
Recent arrivals include the Asus Eee from Taiwan , which lists for $ 400 .
The company expects to sell close on four million Eees this financial year .
Another Taiwanese maker , Everex , is selling its gPC desktop through Walmart for $ 199 .
When firms are used to buying $ 1,000 office PCs running Vista Business Edition and loading each with a $ 200 copy of Microsoft Office , the attractions of a sub - $ 500 computer using a free operating system like Linux and a free productivity suite like OpenOffice suddenly become very compelling .
And that 's not counting the $ 20,000 or more needed for Microsoft 's Exchange and SharePoint server software .
Again , Linux provides such server software for free .
Pundits agree : neither Microsoft nor Apple can compete at the new price points being plumbed by companies looking to cut costs .
With open - source software maturing fast , Linux , OpenOffice , Firefox , MySQL , Evolution , Pidgin and some 23,000 other Linux applications available for free seem more than ready to fill that gap .
By some reckonings , Linux fans will soon outnumber Macintosh addicts .
Linus Torvalds should be rightly proud .
NASA : Major Step Toward Knowing Origin of Cosmic Rays

Robert Naeye / Rob GutroGoddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md.301-286-4453/4044Robert.P.Naeye@nasa.gov / Robert.J.Gutro@nasa.gov GREENBELT , Md. -- Recent observations from NASA and Japanese X -ray observatories have helped clarify one of the long - standing mysteries in astronomy -- the origin of cosmic rays .
Outer space is a vast shooting gallery of cosmic rays .
Discovered in 1912 , cosmic rays are not actually rays at all ; they are subatomic particles and ions ( such as protons and electrons ) that zip through space in all directions at near - light speed , with energies tens of thousands of times greater than particles produced in Earth ’s largest particle accelerators .
Cosmic rays incessantly bombard Earth , smashing into the atoms and molecules high up in the atmosphere , and producing cascades of secondary particles that reach the surface .
Since the 1960s scientists have pointed to supernova remnants -- the tattered , gaseous remains of supernovae -- as the breeding ground of most cosmic rays .
These remnants expand into the surrounding interstellar gas , an energetic interaction that produces a shock front containing magnetic fields that can accelerate charged particles to enormous energies , producing cosmic rays .
According to theory , charged subatomic particles bounce like pinballs around the shock front .
They pick up speed until they move nearly the speed of light .
Last year , observations from NASA ’s Chandra X-ray Observatory suggested that electrons are being accelerated rapidly ( as fast as theory allows ) to high energies in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A.Now , Yasunobu Uchiyama of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) , and four colleagues , have observed the signature of the shock acceleration of electrons , and demonstrated that magnetic fields in supernova remnants are stronger than previously thought , and are thus fully capable of producing cosmic rays .
In a study published in the October 4 , 2007 , issue of the journal Nature , Uchiyama ’s team used Chandra and JAXA ’s Suzaku X -ray satellite to look at the northwest edge of supernova remnant RXJ1713.7-3946 , located a few thousand light - years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius .
With Chandra ’s high spatial resolution , the team monitored X - ray hot spots that brightened and faded in less than a year .
In particular , a bright hot spot seen in July 2005 was invisible in both July 2000 and May 2006 .
Such rapid X - ray variability shows that particles are rapidly being produced and lost in a small region of space .
Because these same hot spots barely moved from 2000 to 2006 , Uchiyama and his colleagues could set an upper limit to the speed of the shock front : 10 million miles per hour .
This result helped the team deduce the strength of the magnetic field .
Only one known process can explain the Chandra observations .
Electrons must be spiraling along magnetic - field lines and radiating away their energy as so - called synchrotron radiation .
For such a rapid increase and decrease in X - ray intensity , electrons must be accelerating and emitting synchrotron radiation in the presence of a magnetic field hundreds of times stronger than typical fields in interstellar space .
" Magnetic field strength lies at the heart of cosmic - ray acceleration theory , " says Uchiyama .
" Previous estimates of magnetic fields in supernova remnants were based on indirect arguments .
In our study , we determine the magnetic field in a direct manner . " " This is an extremely important paper , " adds physicist Don Ellison of North Carolina State University in Raleigh , who is not a member of Uchiyama ’s team .
" This is the first time such rapid X - ray variability has been seen in a supernova remnant .
It has been generally accepted that certain X - ray emission in supernova remnants is synchrotron radiation from high - speed electrons , but it is important to nail it down and get a measurement of the magnetic field .
" Suzaku spectra of RXJ1713.7 provide independent evidence of rapid acceleration .
They show that the hot spots have tangled magnetic fields , which allow particles to bounce back and forth rapidly until they are accelerated to very high energies .
Since electrons and protons of a given energy are accelerated at the same high rate , but protons do n’t radiate away their energy as electrons do , Uchiyama ’s team argues that protons will be accelerated to the higher energies needed to match the energies seen in cosmic rays striking Earth ’s atmosphere .
" This paper is important in that it seems to show that cosmic - ray protons can be accelerated to higher energies than previously thought , " says physicist Robert Streitmatter of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , who is not a member of the team .

From one - time revolutionary Joschka Fischer to former RAF defense lawyer Otto Schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite - of - passage for German politicians .
Those two went on to become the last German administration 's foreign and interior ministers .
Until now , however , no one ever suspected that Chancellor Angela Merkel boasts equally street - smart credentials .
A woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , Merkel revealed in an interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung 's magazine to be published Friday , Feb. 28 , that as a veteran of the infamous Berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins .
During her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of Mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist East Berlin .
Apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to Berlin from Leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .
So what 's a girl to do but reach for the nearest crowbar ?
Radical chic
A far cry from the German Chancellery
Others might have resorted to scanning the classifieds , but Communist East Germany raised its citizens to get their hands dirty .
It 's hard to imagine her western colleagues , such as prissy Family Minister Ursula von der Leyen , taking similar action -- let alone gym - lovin ' Condoleezza Rice or ultra-groomed Hillary Clinton , who would surely balk at the lack of running water , outside toilets and hungry rodents that are par for the course in the average squat .
But Merkel , the first German chancellor to have grown up in the GDR , is made of sterner stuff .
And unlike in the West , squatting in East Berlin did n't necessarily entail endless cans of beer , dogs on strings and torn leather jackets .
It just meant moving into a vacant apartment .
" The state renting agency was no longer aware of which buildings were empty and which were n't , " she said .
" I took advantage of their confusion out of desperation . "
But while her peers on the other side of the Berlin Wall saw squatting as a rejection of mainstream society , indulging in free love , experimenting with drugs and never failing to play their music really loud , Merkel the pastor 's daughter made sure she paid rent .
" I simply transferred money to the state renting agency , " she said .
" At the time all money was most welcome . "

Is it that time of the month already ?
Yeah ... must be ... Reid has the Senate Dems ready to capitulate on telecom immunity tommorow , so yeah ...
Reid 's urging the de facto immunity tactic of allowing the government to substitute itself for the telcos in court ... where Bush and company will just say " State secrets .
Go Cheney yourselves . " and walk out of the courtroom .
A fig leaf has been arranged to cover the capitulation where the telcos will be allowed to walk only " if " the FISA court finds that they acted reasonably .
And this is the same FISA court that backed the government over 99 % of the time even before it was massively expanded by Bush .
So with another Dem capitulation imminent it 's time for Holt again .
Coincidence , perhaps , but it 's strange how it always turns out this way .

Cheat codes for Diebold voting machines to enhance voting experience Official : “ What good is democracy if it ’s not fun and unpredictable ? ”
Diebold Elections
Systems confirmed today that the latest version of their proprietary voting software includes numerous cheat codes which can be used by voters to unlock special ballot areas which award votes to candidates via several unique , interactive methods .
Video - game channel G4 ’s Cheat !
series originally broke the story during last week ’s broadcast after a review of Diebold ’s brand - new software .
A Diebold official acknowledged the presence of the cheat codes , which have since been published on several websites and in gaming magazines .
“ The cheat codes are there to make voting more fun , ” said a Diebold spokesperson .
“ This way , if you get stuck on the second level of a screen of boring amendments , you do n’t have to just quit .
You can enter a code and it opens a whole new realm of entertainment and interaction . ”
“ Our research shows that the demographics of voters are changing , that younger people are using our products .
This is merely an effort to reach a new audience .
We ’re a business after all , and satisfying our customers is our bottom line — whether it ’s a state elections official or not . ”
Reports of working cheat codes and their effects are floating around the internet in forums and chat rooms .
“ To get to the networked version of Grand Theft Auto : Washington , DC , you hit ‘ Up , Up , Down , Down , Left , Right , Left , Right , B , A , Start ’ before you do anything .
You ’ll then be able to play against any other voters in the same precinct as you , ” read one example found at a cheat code community website .
“ The best advice I can give you is to find a Rampage power - up and take out as many people who are registered as whatever political party you want to nail — just look for the elephant or donkey icon over their heads — or looking at the skin color often is just as good if you ’re mowing people down en masse .
Also , the flame thrower is your friend , ” the website informed .
Early voters claim that Diebold ’s tweaks truly enhance the voting experience .
“ They ’ve really improved the graphics .
The modeling and shading is beautiful , and if you ’re any good you can get your candidate an extra thousand - or - so votes , ” said a Volusia County , Florida man who voted early .
“ Unfortunately , the dude next to me kinda sucked , so he had negative votes for his candidate after it was all over , whoever that was ” said the voter .
“ Sorry dude , but that ’s democracy .
Right ? ” http://theministryoftrut...hance-voting-experience/

Call Senator Senator Feinstein at ( 202 ) 224-3841 or any of these phone numbers :
San Francisco : ( 415 ) 393-0707
Los Angeles : ( 310 ) 914-7300
San Diego : ( 619 ) 231-9712
Fresno : ( 559 ) 485-7430 and say something like this : I am calling about the spying bill currently being considered by the Senate .
I urge you to fight for a bill that ’s constitutional and respects the rule of law .
Please vote NO on the current Senate Intelligence Committee spying bill , and keep telecom immunity out of any bill that comes up for a vote .
Please reject any bill that allows for the warrantless surveillance or “ bulk collection ” of Americans ’ phone calls and emails .

Folks maybe its time to do some civil disobedience just like our fore fathers who took a simple piece of paper that said FUCK YOU to the authorities of the time .
Every step of the process is pure BS , vote memory cards lost , hackable software , unverifiable everything .
Super tuesday is going to be a super mess and give everyone a super headache and the media will snow ball it over as a super landslide for more of the same super policies by the same super people and it will all be thanks to those SUPER machines and our super dupper voting process
So maybe just maybe I will break out my voting machine ...

This is all about Holt being able to claim that he wrote and got passed a piece of election reform legislation .
That 's all .
It 's not about his writing and getting passed a piece of good legislation that protects the integrity of our elections .
Shame on him .
He knows better , but he 's going for his own pass numbers , and not looking out for our interests .
The very basic problem of why it is that our legislators are not on to this is that this corrupt elections system got them all elected .

The EI movement is not the only one to split on issues from time to time .
Even professional and experienced judges , when making decisions , do not always fall in line with the facts and the law .
In the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , 8 judges verbally duked it out .
Four accused another four of helping the terrorists , and the responding four said the four accusing judges were drama queens .
That is a Dredd paraphrase , but notice the sharp battle lines drawn :
Like Judge Randolph , I would not ordinarily write a separate opinion on a denial of rehearing en banc , but his suggestion that the panel ’s decision was not only erroneous but also dangerous should not go unremarked .
( DC Opinion , page 6 ) .
The court was split 5 - 5 on whether to grant a rehearing en banc ( where all eleven judges review the decision of a 3 - judge panel of the same court ) .
The Supreme Court , then , will decide the fate of captives of the military once again and it may be a verbal slug - fest along ideological lines too .
These daze the military gummit finds it hard to follow orders , and would rather give them instead .
The bushies dig that idea already , having decided to take orders from " military officers on the ground " rather than " civilian office holders on the hill " sent there by the people .

The anti-Kucinich money probably comes from the vast amount of " unaccounted for " funds the career pentagon accountants were looking for on 911 when something hit the very offices they were in .
But hit no - where else " strangely " .
Evidently the " turrists " did n't want Americans to know what the penties were doing with that trillion dollars ?
Yeah , that 's the ticket .
We then saw 13 tons of $ 100 bills " lost in Baghdad " , soon after the penties sent it there in giant C5A military transports .
I expect that the anti-Kucinich wealth was " magic anti-turrist elekshun funds " from the penties .

My take on the M$M .
Experience tells me they lie .
Okay now the analysis !
Analysis :
1 . They are lying , ( What / fact )
2 . Find out who is doing the lying , ( who / identification )
3 . Find out what interests motivate the liars , ( why / motive )
4 . Then determine the desire result from the lying .
( Effect )
After that analysis is done , the truth is plainly evident .
Example : M$ M says : Voting system working A - OK !!!
Analyis : Step 1 : Thats a lie
( truth = voting system isnt A - OK ) Step 2 : Who is telling the lie ?
( Status Quo types , moneied intestests , propagandists ' posing as journalists . )
Step 3 : Why would they lie ?
Lairs would certainly loose their jobs , reputation or life if the American public determined that the system wasnt A - OK .
Step 4 : What is the effect of the lie ?
Purpose of lying is to prop up the status quo - keep out of jail , avoid the hang 's man 's noose , continue to live a life of greed .
Conclusion :
The status quo is lying to us - to allow the status quo to remain the status quo .
Wow I found the truth !
See how easy it is to discover the truth !
Example 2 : M$ M says , 9/11
Truthers are abunch of wackos and the goverment version is true .
Step 1 : Thats a lie
( 9/11 Truther are NOT a bunch of whackos )
( Government version is false ) Step 2 : Who is saying the lies ?
( The status quo types again - government offcials , or others who receive a paycheck from the status quo types . )
Step 3 : Why would they lie ?
( NWO , NUA , mass - murder , billion dollar insurance fraud , bankrupting the USA , eliminating middle class , world economic domination through miltiary adventurism . )
Step 4 : Effect of the lies ?
( Futher step 3 ) Conclusion : Government story on 9/11 is false and the status quo is behind it .
Thy this with impeachment .... its fun !

HBO , cable ’s most popular premium channel , is carefully entering the arena of Internet video .
The channel , a subsidiary of Time Warner , will introduce HBO on Broadband starting this week to subscribers in Green Bay and Milwaukee , Wis. , then spread the service slowly to other parts of the country .
The free service will allow access to about 400 hours of movies and original programming each month .
It will be made available only to people already subscribing to HBO , and it will be marketed and delivered through cable operators .
“ There are a lot of people , particularly young people , who are watching TV through the PC .
We wanted to create a product for them , ” said Eric Kessler , a co-president of HBO .
Most major television networks already make much of their programming available free on the Internet .
But as a channel with 29 million subscribers , HBO cannot afford to bypass its cable partners .
While most networks have embraced browser - based streaming video , HBO ’s programming is to be watched in a separate computer application that downloads shows to the hard drive .
It may face several hurdles : the program is available only on Windows PCs initially ; the downloaded content cannot yet be transferred to portable devices ; and the content expires four weeks after being downloaded .

Spirit 's broken wheel dug up the silica deposits
Scientist on findings
Scientists believe a patch of ground disturbed by the vehicle shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life .
The deposits were probably produced when hot spring water or steam came into contact with volcanic rocks .
On Earth , these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria , said rover chief scientist Steve Squyres .
" We 're really excited about this , " he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) .
Lucky find
It has been described as a fortuitous discovery .
Spirit has been driving with a broken wheel that constantly digs a trough as the vehicle trundles across the Martian landscape .
In May this year , scientists working on the mission noticed the churned - up soil had a much brighter appearance than usual .
The rovers were originally designed to complete a 90 - day mission
Further investigation revealed it to be extremely rich in silica - the main ingredient of window glass - and Spirit was commanded to examine the ground and nearby rocks in detail for extra clues .
The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways .
One hypothesis is that Spirit is seeing hot - spring deposits produced when water dissolves silica at one location and then dumps it in another .
The classic example is a geyser .
The other idea being pursued by the rover team is that they have stumbled across a fumarole , where acidic steam rises through cracks in rocks and strips them of all of their mineral components , apart from silica .
Search for life
" The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other , the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same , " Professor Squyres explained to BBC News .
One of the great things about these deposits is that not only does the hot water provide an environment in which the microbes can thrive , but the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them
Steve Squyres , rover chief scientist
" So this is a representation of what was in the past a local habitable environment . "
The rover is not equipped to look for the evidence of life itself .
It was designed to read the geological conditions in front of it and tell the scientists what the environmental conditions might once have been like .
However , future missions will search for signs of chemical traces that could have been left by life .
Spirit is now camouflaged by the dust resting on its solar panels
Professor Squyres suggested such missions ought to keep an eye out for silica - rich deposits .
And he said any future efforts to return material to Earth laboratories might also like to target these kinds of deposits .
He said : " One of the great things about these deposits is that not only does the hot water provide an environment in which the microbes can thrive , but the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them .
" So you can get wonderfully preserved microbial microfossils . "
' Dicey ' times
Both Spirit and its sister rover , Opportunity , have continued to work long past their designed mission lives of 90 days .
Spirit has been on station for 1,400 days ;
Opportunity , which is on the far side of the planet , has been operational for a slightly shorter period of 1,379 days .
The vehicles will soon have to reduce their activities to preserve power during the reduced sunlight of the Martian winter .
For Spirit , the coming months are likely to be its most challenging to date .
Dust that has settled on its solar panels has significantly reduced the available electricity .
The panels are currently operating at 42 % of maximum performance .
" By the time we get to the depth of the Martian winter , extrapolating what the dust accumulation is , we may have only about 30 % performance , " said John Callas , Nasa 's project manager for the rovers .
Surviving the winter could be " dicey " , he added .

Update :
Here are some more great websites that you might not have seen before , suggested from our readers :
Radley Balko has a great piece up at Reason arguing that it ’s time we considered lowering the drinking age back to 18 .
Balko cites three reasons that the age should be lowered , or at least in favor of the proposition that the Federal Government should not be the one setting the drinking age , and they all make an incredible amount of sense :
The first is that the age set by the legislation is basically arbitrary .
The U.S. has the highest drinking age in the world ( a title it shares with Indonesia , Mongolia , Palau ) .
The vast majority of the rest of the world sets the minimum age at 17 or 16 or has no minimum age at all .
(…)
The second drawback of the federal drinking age is that it set the stage for tying federal mandates to highway funds , enabling Congress to meddle in all sorts of state and local affairs it has no business attempting to regulate â€ ” so long as it can make a tortured argument about highway safety .
(…)
The final drawback is pretty straightforward :
It makes little sense that America considers an 18 - year - old mature enough to marry , to sign a contract , to vote and to fight and die for his country , but not mature enough to decide whether or not to have a beer .
That final one has never made sense to me .
At 18 , I was old enough to do anything I wanted ….. except drink a beer or a glass of wine .
I seldom find arguments about “ fairness ” persuasive , but in this case I think there ’s some merit to it .
There is no logical reason that an 18 year old should not be able to choose whether or not to legally drink alcohol .
Of course , as Balko points out , adults between 18 and 21 are still drinking , they ’re just doing it secretly :
Kenyon College President S. Georgia
Nugent has expressed frustration with the law , particularly in 2005 after the alcohol - related death of a Kenyon student .
And former Time magazine editor and higher ed reporter Barrett Seaman echoed McCardell ’s concerns in 2005 .
The period since the 21 minimum drinking age took effect has been “ marked by a shift from beer to hard liquor , ” Seaman wrote in Time , “ consumed not in large social settings , since that was now illegal , but furtively and dangerously in students ’ residences .
In my reporting at colleges around the country , I did not meet any presidents or deans who felt the 21 - year age minimum helps their efforts to curb the abuse of alcohol on their campuses . ”
That last part is , I think , an important point .
A 20 year old who wants to drink will still find a way to do it , but much like the drug user who finds themselves going after more powerful highs on the black market , they will choose something harder , like gin or vodka , and they ’ll drink more of it .
It ’s time to lower the drinking age and treat adults like adults .

Before you all start shouting , I ’m quite aware the iPhone does mapping too .
But it ’s viewing maps , as opposed to GPS mapping which is a whole lot smarter .
Sure , you could plot from A to B on a mapping service , but it takes more to get updated traffic information , voice control and feedback , as well as navigation .

If you ’ve visited a bookstore in the last few years , you may have seen those cute books about fairies or gnomes where it looks like the author found and smashed one of the poor creatures between the pages .
The whimsical drawings of the squashed little folk are at once both cute and gross ; you almost expect to see fairy intestines sticking out like a gruesome bookmark .
These are fictional field guides to strange and fantastic creatures lurking at the edges of everyday life .
A book very much like this is at the center of the new film " The Spiderwick Chronicles . "
In the film , a man named Arthur Spiderwick ( he had his name changed because Arthur Smith was n’t evocative enough ) wrote just such a book .
In " Arthur Spiderwick 's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You , " the author describes elves , fairies , goblins , dragons , ogres , leprechauns , sea serpents , and other such fantastical creatures .
Spiderwick disappeared , but his great nephew found the book and unwittingly unleashed a pack of goblins who threaten the world .
Not to suggest that Arthur Spiderwick was a plagiarist , but such bestiaries have existed for centuries .
While fictional authors like Spiderwick ( and real authors such as J.R.R. Tolkien ) greatly popularized creatures like dragons , mermaids , elves , and fairies , belief in their existence dates back far earlier .
( In fact some stories of the Loch Ness monster are derived from Scottish folklore about kelpies and water horses . )
Earlier times
There was a time long before XBox — even before the Atari 2600 , if you can imagine — before television brought the world 's wonders into every American household .
A century or so ago , the public was much less sophisticated about what was real and what was n't ; much of the world was still unexplored and shrouded in mystery .
Traveling shows brought amazing creatures from around the world to people who had never seen such wonders .
Animals that now seem commonplace , or at least not extraordinary , were considered very exotic just a century ago .
Bizarre animals called " cameleopards , " for example , appeared as attractions in carnivals and circuses during the 1800s .
These unusual creatures combined the long neck and head shape of a camel with the spots of a leopard .
The public flocked to see these fantastical animals ( we now know them as giraffes ) .
For many having seen a cameleopard , platypus , or kangaroo for the first time , dragons and elves did not seem so far - fetched .
Enter the fairies
It was n't so long ago that at least some of Spiderwick 's fanciful creatures were believed to exist .
In 1917 , two teenage cousins named Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths played with fairies and gnomes in the English countryside near Cottingley .
Interacting with imaginary fairy friends would probably be considered normal behavior for 10 - and 16 - year - old girls , but the pair insisted that the fairies were real .
They even provided proof in the form of five photographs showing little fairy folk playing with the girls .
While some dismissed the photos as obvious fakes , many others were not so sure .
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , creator of Sherlock Holmes , believed that the fairies were real , and wrote a book titled " The Coming of the Fairies , " in which he discussed the fairies and his belief that their existence had been proven .
The girls eventually confessed to the hoax , but many were taken in , and the reality of fairies was the subject of debate among some adults for decades .
Fake field guides
There are also a few modern books that claim to be field guides to unknown creatures around us .
For example , Loren Coleman and Patrick Huyghe have written two " field guides , " one on mystery primates such as Bigfoot , and the other on lake and sea monsters .
Fantasy role - playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons have field guides with detailed information about fantastical creatures as well ( did you know the leprechauns live in families of up to 20 , and that the life span of a goblin is about 50 years ? ) .
Ultimately , of course , Spiderwick and his fairies are fictional .
But audiences will learn one thing about goblins from " The Spiderwick Chronicles " :
They are computer - generated and look like cousins of the green Mr. Mucus guy from the Mucinex commercials .
Good thing he 's not squashed between the pages of some field guide .
Yuck !
Benjamin Radford is a writer and investigator with the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry .
His books and films can be found on his website .
They look like little pieces of confetti in San Antonio ’s parks , vacant houses and empty lots .
Look closer .
The colors resolve into small toxic booby - traps — discarded heroin balloons and orange - tipped , used syringes , waiting for a passerby to step on them .
It ’s a good bet the discarded needle and syringe will carry HIV and hepatitis viruses that could infect the unsuspecting victim .
Dr. Alexandra Loffredo , a family doctor , university professor , and health director at the University Health Center downtown , treated a teenage girl earlier this year who stepped on a used needle that penetrated her shoe and pricked her foot .
She has to return to the clinic at regular intervals to be tested for blood infections that could affect the rest of her life .
“ That ’s a huge ordeal for a 14 - year - old girl , ” Loffredo said .
Clinic staff often see what they call unintended “ community needle sticks ” - usually people in vulnerable neighborhoods — which , of course , are the poorest and most disadvantaged areas of the city .
“ We ’ll have parents of 6 - and 7 - year - old kids who will tell us they see prostitutes working behind their houses , or they always see needles on the ground .
That will start a conversation with the kids about the danger of touching or picking up a used condom or needle , ” Loffredo said .
It ’s not a pleasant subject , but with 13,000 addicts in San Antonio , a flourishing sex trade , and younger addicted mothers and babies , it ’s one that alarms public health officials here .
Taxpayers living miles away from the problem north of Loop 1604 may think the statistics do n’t affect them , but the tax burden to treat the diseases of addiction in the county ’s public hospitals hits everyone .
So , it may seem strange that city police and county prosecutors are raising the stakes in the prosecution of a church - supported needle exchange program .
Believe it .
On Thursday , January 23 , the police department plucked a “ traffic ticket ” misdemeanor from Municipal Court and re-filed it with the District Attorney ’s office as a more serious Class A misdemeanor against three volunteers with the Bexar Area Harm Reduction Coalition , a needle exchange and condom program .
Now , 73 - year - old Bill Day , 67 - year - old Mary Casey and registered nurse Melissa Lujan 39 , face up to a year in jail and a $ 2,000 fine each for allegedly distributing narcotic paraphernalia .
The trio was cited by patrol officers on January 5 while taking used syringes from addicts and prostitutes on the street for disposal by the Metro Health District .
They showed officers what they were doing — reportedly handing out baggies containing a new insulin syringe , a condom , a cotton ball , an alcohol whip , a commercial bottle cap for cooking a drug dose , and referral pamphlets to public - health agencies .
“ It ’s not like they were doing anything sneaky , ” said State Representative Ruth McClendon , a longtime advocate for legalizing needle exchanges in Texas .
“ This group is well known in our community . ”
But in the eyes of the police and the DA , these perfectly legal items , when assembled in a baggie and given away , constitute a “ heroin injection rig . ”
“ You can not flaunt the law regardless of how well - intentioned you are , ” First Assistant District Attorney Cliff Herberg explained .
The case was re-filed as a more serious charge because , Herberg said , “ it meets the elements of the offense . ”
The decision was made in the ordinary process of review given to any charge working its way through the system , he said .
Still , Herberg concedes that the cases were re-filed as Class A misdemeanors only after discussions between him and Assistant Police Chief David Head .
And both men agree that it is not usual for them to review every one of the thousands of misdemeanor cases that come into their respective offices each week .
GOOD DAYS / BAD DAYS
Bill Day was greeted as somewhat of a Christian soldier when he went to Sunday services at downtown St. Mark ’s Episcopal Church across from Travis Park .
“ People came up and shook my hand , hugged me , patted me on the back , ” Day said on Monday .
Asked if he considered the case “ a social - justice issue , ” Day said yes .
“ Look at the first four books of the New Testament .
They all mention tending to the poor . ”
The incident received national media attention over the weekend , and much of the congregation , which includes many prominent San Antonians , seemed glad .
Day is the parishioner who brought the needle - exchange program to the attention of the church ’s community outreach committee in 2005 .
It approved sponsoring the coalition and ponied up funds for a $ 10,000 van for the group ’s use .
Reverend Michael Chalk , rector of St. Mark ’s , rhetorically embraced Day .
“ We ’re just trying to help , ” Chalk said .
“ We ’re called on to alleviate suffering and help the poor as best we can . ”
The mood at the DA ’s office Monday morning was definitely not as buoyant as at the nearby church the day before .
Express - News columnist Jaime Castillo had blasted the needle - exchange prosecution over the weekend , as had the editorial page of the Houston Chronicle .
Reed , a shrewd prosecutor and former judge who ’s butted political heads in Bexar County for three decades , was n’t offering her personal opinion on needle exchange programs to the media .
Herberg was sweating that one out by himself .
The news that San Antonian Gerry Goldstein — one of the “ pros from Dover ” among the nation ’s civil rights attorneys — was going to represent Day did n’t help .
Goldstein was in Aspen at his birthday bash when contacted by the Current last Thursday about the needle - exchange case .
Lyle Lovett was signing Happy Birthday ( in person ) to the longtime ACLU watchdog .
Goldstein called the re-filing of the case to a Class A misdemeanor “ serious overkill ” on the part of the police and the DA ’s office .
“ These are people whose only concern is to try and make our city a better place to live , ” he said of the Bexar Area coalition .
Herberg bristles at talk about overkill .
If it ’s true , as the police report states , that Day told officers he was a county employee , that ’s not only a sin in the eyes of the church , it also could be considered impersonation of a public official , a felony offense .
Were the volunteers looking for a “ test case ” on the needle exchange issue ?
Herberg said he certainly was n’t .
“ This thing was thrown in our laps . ”
Chief Head added that “ there was no communication with field officers to be on the lookout ” for a needle exchange group .
As for Day : “ I think I did know it could become a ‘ cause celebre , ’ ” he said in answer to a reporter ’s question .
McClendon thinks it ’s about time .
“ Texas is the only state in the nation that does not allow for needle exchange , ” she said .
“ Cities throughout the state have programs operated through religious organizations , and law enforcement officers statewide are aware of these programs . ”
BUT IS IT ART ?
Narcotics paraphernalia is one of those wispy legal constructs that require law enforcement authorities to be mind - readers .
Ordinary objects that are perfectly legal can be considered criminal instruments if police decide they are intended to be used unlawfully .
Wire - cutters like the ones electricians carry around today could get a man hanged in 1900 Texas in the vicinity of a barbed - wire enclosed ranch .
Narcotics paraphernalia , in the eyes of a law that has been rewritten and amended a dozen times since first entering the Texas statutes in 1905 , usually refers to an insulin syringe that ’s legal in the hands of your diabetic aunt but maybe not your niece who happens to be a known prostitute with a heroin habit .
Depending on the decade and the drug fashion of the moment , it could also be a crack pipe or a hookah .
Head shops have been selling small pipes that might be construed as paraphernalia for years , and police used to cite them .
But it rarely happens today .
It would be disingenuous to argue that the coalition ’s kits are not used for the injection of illegal drugs .
But police in every city in the country distribute resources and manpower according to the community ’s perceived needs and priorities .
Police Chief Bill McManus was involved in a successful needle exchange program when he was chief of Minneapolis before coming to San Antonio .
Dr. Fernando Guerra , director of the Metropolitan Health District and a practicing pediatrician , says San Antonio suffers “ enormous social and economic costs ” because of IV drug abuse and the sex trade that supports drug habits and spreads STD ’s – sexually transmitted diseases .
And anything that reduces that cost is good policy .
“ There ’s a significant human dimension to all this , ” Guerra said .
“ We see more and more women in their child - bearing years falling into the tragic use of illicit drugs , heroin and methamphetamine .
If they go through pregnancy with continued use , it affects the baby . ”
Guerra said he was currently withdrawing two newborns in his own practice who are addicted to illegal drugs because they were born to addicted mothers .
These children end up in foster care at state expense .
And the cost to taxpayers is tremendous .
Addicts going through end - stage liver disease can cost county health programs hundreds of thousands of dollars before they die , even if they are refused transplants because of continued drug use .
State estimates are that more than $ 100 million was spent over two recent years by Texas public health institutions treating HIV and Hepatitis B and C cases .
“ We ’re really lagging behind ” other cities and states , Guerra said .
“ There ’s this misperception that giving IV drug users needles and syringes promotes drug use .
But these people are dependent on their supply of drugs and they ’re going to inject them however they can . ”
NERO FIDDLES
What particularly galls prosecutors and police about the criticism of their prosecutions is the fact that they were under the impression that needle - exchange programs were on hold for the moment .
They were waiting for the attorney general to issue an opinion on the legality of language placed in the last omnibus health bill by Representative McClendon and Senator Jeff Wentworth .
Inserted late in the session , the language creates a pilot needle - exchange program in Bexar County and only in Bexar County .
With that in hand , county commissioners last fall appropriated $ 60,000 to fund a needle - exchange program to be operated by county government ’s health offices .
But questions were raised immediately about whether the pilot program language in the health codes would override criminal statutes .
“ Susan ( Reed ) flat out ruled that this law did n’t really change the criminal law .
And she made the announcement that she was going to arrest these people , ” recalled Wentworth .
So his office requested the AG ’s opinion last September , and since then , the county ’s needle - exchange workers have cooled their heels gathering statistics .
Herberg points out that the Texas District and County Attorneys Association has written a brief stating that the language authorizing the pilot program fails to protect volunteers from prosecution .
“ It ’s not like we went out looking for a case , ’’ insisted Herberg .
“ They dumped it in our laps and asked us for an opinion on whether it was legal . ”
But why would that language have applied to the church - supported , privately funded coalition plan anyway ?
Curt Harrell , a retired laboratory and blood - bank manager and board president of the non-profit coalition , said too much time has passed already .
Harrell has worked to create and fund HIV and hepatitis reduction programs in Texas for 14 years .
He has testified before House and Senate health committees .
He has seen language put into every statewide health plan since 1998 calling for needle - exchange programs .
And he was glad in 2005 when the coalition was registered with the county , given non-profit status by the IRS , and was finally up and running .
He did all of that work as a volunteer .
Yet on a recent neighborhood “ tour ” to a vacant lot with a dozen discarded syringes less than a mile from Guadalupe Plaza where Pope Paul spoke , Harrell admitted being “ frustrated . ”
“ Every day we ’re not doing what we ’re supposed to be doing , someone else is catching HIV or hepatitis unnecessarily . ”

The entire academic community is based on the idea of taking previous people 's work , and building on it .
" Standing on the shoulders of Giants " is the goal .
Unfortunately , this can only happen when the giants that have gone before give free access to their shoulders .
If a piece of academic research is not made freely available , did it really achieve its goal ?
Did it build on human knowledge ?
No . I am currently working on homeomorphic embedding .
I 'll write more about it in future , but the basic idea is that the relationship\lhdis a type of ordering ( read \lhd as a left - pointing triangle with a bar under it ) .
This ordering happens to be particularly good at ensuring termination .
All is good .
Unfortunately a simple test of this relation takes exponential time , and is therefore infeasible .
But good news - Jonathan Stillman determined how to reduce the running time down to O( size ( ) . size ( ) . ) , a perfectly reasonable time bound .
The algorithm is contained in his thesis , " Computational problems in equational theorem proving " , 1989 .
To obtain his thesis , the only way I can find is this link .
To actually view the thesis , and the very important algorithm contained within , will cost a minimum of $ 46 .
Of course , its entirely possible it will rely on some side condition I can't guarantee , or not meet my needs for some other reason , but I wo n't know until after the money is gone .
I want to take the information , acknowledge it , and use it .
Today I want to build a highly - optimising compiler for Haskell , tomorrow I might put the information to another use .
After I 've used the information , I will make my new discoveries and ideas available for free download on my website .
Hopefully someone will be able to build on my ideas in new ways , and the cycle can continue .
Hopefully one day all the information generated will be available for free on the web , then we truely can build on the work of those who have gone before .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A parcel of mountaintop land behind the famed Hollywood sign has been put up for sale , provoking outrage from Los Angeles city officials and residents worried that building there would spoil one of the most famous postcard views in the world .
A Chicago investment group said on Wednesday it was asking $ 22 million for a 138 - acre ( 55 - hectare ) tract of land just west of the white Hollywood sign on Cahuenga Peak because the Los Angeles city council had failed to come up with cash to preserve its rugged wilderness state .
Keith Dickson , a representative of the group , told a news conference the investors regarded the parcel of land , with its views across Los Angeles and out to the Pacific Ocean , as “ a Van Gogh in a garage sale ” .
Fox River Financial Resources bought the mountaintop in 2002 from the estate of reclusive entrepreneur Howard Hughes , who had planned to build a love nest there for actress Ginger Rogers in the 1940s .
The plan never came to fruition .
Dickson said the remote ridge property had been divided into lots for five luxury homes .
Utility lines , water service and roads would also have to be built .
City councilman Tom LaBonge said he was stunned by the asking price and by the possibility of buildings on the site .
“ That mountain should not be cluttered .
It ’s good for the psyche of Los Angeles , ” LaBonge told the Los Angeles Times .
“ The city should acquire this land .
Everyone was shocked to find out it was privately owned . ”
The Hollywood sign spells out the name of the area in 45 - ft ( 13.7 - meter ) high white letters .
It originally read Hollywoodland and was created as an advertisement for a housing development in 1923 .
The last few letters deteriorated in the late 1940s and the part that remained was restored in 1978 .
SAN FRANCISCO 
Hoping to earn more from its vast advertising network , Google said it planned to begin selling ads to appear inside videos on sites across the Web .
While the money spent on Web video ads is a small fraction of the $ 20 billion spent on Internet ads in the United States , Google is hoping to capitalize on both the explosion in online video and the scale of its advertising network , which analysts say includes a vast majority of Web advertisers and hundreds of thousands of Web sites .
The new program , called AdSense for Video , could help Web publishers in that network make more money off their video clips .
While AdSense for Video is the latest in a string of new advertising initiatives that Google has started over the last two years , few , if any , of those initiatives have created substantial revenue for Google .
They include Google ’s programs to place ads in newspapers , on radio and on TV stations and on a variety of new formats on the Web and on cellphones .
Every Saturday , the president of the United States gives a radio address to the nation .
It is followed by the Democratic response , usually given by a senator or representative .
This past Saturday the Democrats chose retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez to give their response , the same general accused in at least three lawsuits in the U.S. and Europe of authorizing torture and cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment of prisoners in Iraq .
This , combined with the Democrats ’ endorsement of Attorney General Michael Mukasey despite his unwillingness to label waterboarding as torture , indicates that the Democrats are increasingly aligned with President Bush ’s torture policies .
Sanchez headed the Army ’s operations in Iraq from June 2003 to June 2004 .
In September 2003 , Sanchez issued a memo authorizing numerous techniques , including “ stress positions ” and the use of “ military working dogs ” to exploit “ Arab fear of dogs ” during interrogations .
He was in charge when the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison occurred .
Brig .
Gen. Janis Karpinski , who headed Abu Ghraib at the time , worked under Gen. Sanchez .
She was demoted to colonel , the only military officer to be punished .
She told me about another illegal practice , holding prisoners as so - called ghost detainees :
“ We were directed on several occasions through Gen . [ Barbara ] Fast or Gen. Sanchez .
The instructions were originating at the Pentagon from Secretary Rumsfeld , and we were instructed to hold prisoners without assigning a prisoner number or putting them on the database , and that is contrary to the Geneva Conventions .
We all knew it was contrary to the Geneva Conventions . ”
In addition to keeping prisoners off the database there were other abuses , she said , like prison temperatures reaching 120 to 140 degrees , dehydration and the order from Gen. Geoffrey Miller to treat prisoners “ like dogs . ”
And it ’s not just about treatment of prisoners .
In 2006 , Karpinski testified at a mock trial , called the Bush Crimes Commission .
She revealed that several female U.S. soldiers had died of dehydration by denying themselves water .
They were afraid to go to the latrine at night to urinate , for fear of being raped by fellow soldiers : “ Because the women , in fear of getting up in the hours of darkness to go out to the portolets or the latrines , were not drinking liquids after 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon .
And in 120 - degree heat or warmer , because there was no air conditioning at most of the facilities , they were dying from dehydration in their sleep .
What [ Sanchez ’s deputy commanding general , Walter Wojdakowski ] told the surgeon to do was , ‘ Do n’t brief those details anymore .
And do n’t say specifically that they ’re women .
You can provide that in a written report , but do n’t brief it in the open anymore . ' ”
Karpinski said Sanchez was at that briefing .
Former military interrogator Tony Lagouranis , author of “ Fear Up Harsh , ” described the use of dogs : “ We were using dogs in the Mosul detention facility , which was at the Mosul airport .
We would put the prisoner in a shipping container .
We would keep him up all night with music and strobe lights , stress positions , and then we would bring in dogs .
The prisoner was blindfolded , so he did n’t really understand what was going on , but we had the dog controlled .
The dog would be barking and jumping on the prisoner , and the prisoner would n’t really understand what was going on . ”
Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch elaborated on Sanchez : “ For those three months of mayhem that were occurring right under his nose , he never stepped in .
And , also , he misled Congress about it .
He was asked twice at a congressional hearing whether he ever approved the use of guard dogs .
This was before the memo came out .
And both times he said he never approved it .
[ W ]e finally got the actual memo , in which he approves ‘ exploiting Arab fear of dogs . ’ ” Brody dismissed the military report clearing Sanchez of any wrongdoing : “ It ’s just not credible for the Army to keep investigating itself and keep finding itself innocent . ”
This is not about politics .
This is about the moral compass of the nation .
The Democrats may be celebrating a retired general who has turned on his commander in chief .
But the public should take pause .
The Democrats had a chance to draw a line in the sand , to absolutely require Mukasey to denounce waterboarding before his elevation to attorney general .
Now they have chosen as their spokesman a discredited general , linked to the most egregious abuses in Iraq .
The Bush administration passed Sanchez over for a promotion , worried about reliving the Abu Ghraib scandal during the 2006 election year .
Now it ’s the Democrats who have resuscitated him .
Have they no shame ?

Facebook WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Army soldiers committed suicide last year at the highest rate in 26 years , and more than a quarter did so while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to a new military report .
The report , obtained by The Associated Press ahead of its scheduled release Thursday , found there were 99 confirmed suicides among active duty soldiers during 2006 , up from 88 the previous year and the highest since the 102 suicides in 1991 at the time of the Persian Gulf War .
The suicide rate for the Army has fluctuated over the past 26 years , from last year 's high of 17.3 per 100,000 to a low of 9.1 per 100,000 in 2001 .
Last year , " Iraq was the most common deployment location for both ( suicides ) and attempts , " the report said .
The 99 suicides included 28 soldiers deployed to the two wars and 71 who were n't .
About twice as many women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan committed suicide as did women not sent to war , the report said .
Preliminary numbers for the first half of this year indicate the number of suicides could decline across the service in 2007 but increase among troops serving in the wars , officials said .
The increases for 2006 came as Army officials worked to set up a number of new and stronger programs for providing mental health care to a force strained by the longer - than - expected war in Iraq and the global counterterrorism war entering its sixth year .
Failed personal relationships , legal and financial problems and the stress of their jobs were factors motivating the soldiers to commit suicide , according to the report .
" In addition , there was a significant relationship between suicide attempts and number of days deployed " in Iraq , Afghanistan or nearby countries where troops are participating in the war effort , it said .
The same pattern seemed to hold true for those who not only attempted , but succeeded in killing themselves .
There also " was limited evidence to support the view that multiple ... deployments are a risk factor for suicide behaviors , " it said .
About a quarter of those who killed themselves had a history of at least one psychiatric disorder .
Of those , about 20 % had been diagnosed with a mood disorder such as bipolar disorder and / or depression ; and 8 % had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder , including post traumatic stress disorder — one of the signature injuries of the conflict in Iraq .
Firearms were the most common method of suicide .
Those who attempted suicide but did n't succeed tended more often to take overdoses and cut themselves .
In a service of more than a half million troop , the 99 suicides amounted to a rate of 17.3 per 100,000 — the highest in the past 26 years , the report said .
The average rate over those years has been 12.3 per 100,000 .
The rate for those serving in the wars stayed about the same , 19.4 per 100,000 in 2006 , compared with 19.9 in 2005 .
The Army said the information was compiled from reports collected as part of its suicide prevention program — reports required for all " suicide - related behaviors that result in death , hospitalization or evacuation " of the soldier .
It can take considerable time to investigate a suicide and , in fact , the Army said that in addition to the 99 confirmed suicides last year , there are two other deaths suspected as suicides in which investigations were pending .

Newly declassified documents from Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe show former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have set up the 2016 Russia investigation into the Trump campaign .
The information was released Tuesday afternoon in a letter written to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham .
“ In late July 2016 , U.S. intelligence agencies obtained insight into Russian intelligence analysis alleging that U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had approved a campaign plan to stir up a scandal against U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Putin and the Russians ’ hacking of the Democratic National Committee .
The IC does not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication , ” the letter states .
“ According to his handwritten notes , former Central Intelligence Agency Director Brennan subsequently briefed President Obama and other senior national security officials on the intelligence , including the ‘ alleged approval by Hillary Clinton on July 26 , 2016 of a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisors to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by Russian security services . ’”

House cafeteria's new dishes : asparagus , olive oil , Parmesan - Reggiano | John Shinkle / POLITICO
Pelosi pushes gourmet menu
The processed cheese has been replaced with brie .
The Jell - O has made way for raspberry kiwi tarts and mini-lemon blueberry trifles .
Meatloaf has moved over for mahi mahi and buns have been shunted aside in favor of baguettes .
A revolution is afoot at the deli counters , grills and salad bars of the U.S. House of Representatives .

Newly ascendant Democrats may have hit roadblocks on Iraq and fiscal issues , but they have revamped congressional menus , replacing fatty , pre-made foods with healthier , gourmet alternatives .
The once dreary congressional cafeterias now abound with haute cuisine .
The menu transformation is part of Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s “ Greening the Capitol ” plan to make the House campus more environmentally friendly and socially progressive .
But there can be a downside to delicious .
Not everyone is happy with the enhanced offerings .
Many congressional employees have complained that as the food quality has increased , so have the prices .
“ It ’s a big jump from high school cafeteria to fancy - pants gourmet .
I just wish my pay improved , ” said Caryn Schenewerk , a staffer for Rep. Gabrielle Giffords ( D - Ariz . ) .
A fruit and cheese side dish with two small wedges of brie and cheddar , six grapes , two saltines and one strawberry cost $ 4.95 , for example .
House officials explained that the fresher and more varied foods were indeed more expensive but that they had tried to preserve low - cost alternatives such as pizza , sandwiches and prepared salads , which remain around the same price .
Higher prices were n’t the only complaints .
Perhaps it was inevitable that any major change orchestrated by the Democrats , be it legislation or legumes , would draw Republican fire .
One House Republican aide lobbed attacks at the Democrats over e-mail .
“ I really do n’t like Nanny Nancy telling me what I can and can not eat for lunch .
If I want to eat unhealthy , I should have that choice ! ” the aide fumed .
Republican aides have raised questions about why the cafeterias now stock Stonyfield Farm yogurt , speculating that the move would line the pockets of the company ’s CEO , Gary Hirshberg , a significant player in Democratic politics .
That assertion is nonsense , said Jeff Ventura , a spokesman for the chief administrative officer , the House official who oversees the cafeterias .
He said the new food vendor , Restaurant Associates , selected the yogurt producer based on price , quality and consumer satisfaction .
“ The idea that the CAO employs a political litmus test on the hundreds of food items in the cafeterias is nothing short of absurd , ” Ventura said .
Several calls to Restaurant Associates ’ spokeswoman Gina Zimmer were not returned .
Grumbling aside , the menu choices now available present a whole new world of congressional culinary adventures .
There is pan-roasted Chesapeake rockfish with sweet potato fennel hash and yellow pepper relish .
Pears with Stilton cheese and watercress .
Cumin - scented leg of lamb with almond couscous .
There are vegetables with funny names , like bok choy , arugula and jicama .
There are baked goods with Italian names , like biscotti , focaccia and frittati .
There are foods in funny colors , like yellow tomatoes and purple Peruvian potatoes .
There are things that are free of other things , like “ cage - free shell eggs , ” “ rBGH - free milk ” and “ free - range chicken . ”
And things that we do n’t know what they mean , like turkey escabeche ( salad ) , red pepper coulis ( sauce ) and seared barramundi ( fish ) .
A vending machine sells coffee from famed chef Wolfgang Puck , offering brews such as “ Vive la Crème Caramel ” and “ Tropic of Chocolate . ”
Coffee cups have been replaced by “ ecotainers ” and drink cups by “ greenware ” made from corn starch .
The napkins emerge from their dispenser one at a time , making it impossible to grab a whole stack .
Nearly everything is biodegradable .
And the recycling stations , oh , the recycling stations !
They are veritable shrines to a renewable Earth , with four differently shaped slots to sort garbage and lengthy directions on proper sorting .
Soup containers go into the square - shaped “ compostable ” slot , but soup lids end up in the rounded “ landfill waste ” slot .
There are other enviro touches , too .
The new salad bar was constructed from “ green materials . ”
The seafood is “ sustainable . ”
The fruits and vegetables come from local growers when possible .
Energy - efficient vending machines sport a 6 - foot - tall illuminated image of trees .
A poster trumpets the existence of a “ pulper , ” a big machine that mashes up waste into little cubes that go to compost centers , where , eventually , they biodegrade into dirt .
Even the things that have n’t changed seem cooler because their names are in foreign languages .
The taco bar is the “ Taqueria . ”
The grill is “ A la Plancha . ”
The salad bar has expanded to “ Salad / Antipasti . ”
To most Hill denizens , the cornucopia of choices is cause for rejoicing — a significant switch from a menu that previously relied heavily on iceberg lettuce and vanilla pudding .
“ It ’s been long overdue that there should be more healthy options , ” said a congressional science fellow who was not allowed to speak on the record .
“ It was hazardous to my health to eat almost anything they had here before . ”
Ventura said a popular outcry had prompted the changes .
“ We had [ diminished ] satisfaction surveys with [ the earlier contractor ] , ” Ventura said .
“ People were getting disenchanted with the food quality . ”
Nearly everything in the new cafeterias is biodegradable , from plates to utensils to straws , and that situation has produced a few peculiarities .
For example , there are no soup spoons , only teaspoons .
The company that manufactures the biodegradable flatware does n’t make soup spoons yet .
And some people have complained that the compostable straws can melt in hot liquids .
Politico headed to the cafeteria at the Rayburn House Office Building to test this scenario .
A compostable straw placed in hot coffee did indeed become pliable and droop , although it never disintegrated entirely .
Ventura said customers would have to change their behavior to accommodate the environmentally friendly products .
“ We have had a few people observe that [ straw ] phenomenon and we had to tell them , ‘ Sip your coffee like a normal human being , ’ ” Ventura said .
“ We ’re trying to save the planet here . ”
WHEN times get tough , people with an abundance of disposable income are inclined to keep disposing of it while the rest of us are forced to keep our thinner wallets in our pockets .
With that in mind , Tobias Levkovich , Citigroup ’s chief United States equity strategist , has created the Living Large Index , comprising stocks of businesses that cater to affluent consumers .
Profits and share prices of luxury - goods makers , higher - end retailers and travel and entertainment companies should hold up even if businesses serving them suffer from difficult economic conditions , he said .
His index includes names like American Express , Tiffany , Saks , Nordstrom , Royal Caribbean Cruises , the casino operator Wynn Resorts and Callaway Golf .
Mr. Levkovich could have chosen companies with a more exclusive clientele but decided to focus less on the superrich than on modestly well - off people .
There are far more members of the second group than the first , making the companies that cater to them a greater piece of the economic and investment pie .
“ These are upper - income people , but not people who are buying business jets or Picassos , ” he said .
INTRO : PRODIGIES AREN'T GIFTED
Most people recognize the psychological differences between a person of IQ 70 and 100 .
Not just the intellectual gap , but the differences in developmental pace , their joys and frustrations , their trust levels and social experiences .
It took many years for child psychologists to acknowledge similar differences between a person of IQ 100 and 140 .
For the gifted , unlike the mentally disabled , can pass for normal .
In fact , God help them if they do n't .
Still , gifteds ' special needs were eventually recognized , even if they 're still given low priority by schools -- every study I 've seen says the gifted are actually worse off than the disabled in terms of getting their needs met in school .
Mostly they just drift through , being taught way below their level , essentially warehoused .
Mostly they end up teaching themselves .
Or not -- the bored and angry become disciplinary problems and get blamed , when they 're being cheated out of their education and forced to waste their time !
Only in the last generation have these patterns come to light , and the special needs of the gifted been given even token consideration , in the more progressive schools .
But the differences between persons with IQ 140 and 190 are just as large !
And still unrecognized .
It 's understandable -- we child prodigies were too rare , too scattered to be easily sampled and generalized about , at least till the Net ...
But the result is , I 've spent my life being mistaken for a strange gifted person .
I 'm not .
Gifted , I mean ( strange , sure , I 'll cop to that one ) .
I 'm something as different from gifted as gifted is from average .
I look just as eccentric to the gifted as to normal people .
But are my oddities really personal ?
When I study the lives of others in the same IQ range , I suddenly look rather normal -- in fact , more socialized than most .
I 'm not in jail , have n't killed myself or died of stress - related illness .
That puts me well up on the functional side of the over - 180 IQ group right there .
Terman 's classic long - range study chose two examples for this group and said they 'd managed " perhaps the best adjustment that can be made ... "
Five years after picking these two , a follow - up study found them both dead : cancer and suicide .
Suddenly mere allergies and social isolation do n't look so bad ...
Which of the eccentricities of a genius are neuroses or defenses ?
Which arise from the biochemical quirks that create extreme giftedness ?
Which are individual character traits , and which are merely habits of any highly intellligent person ?
Which are the results of a different maturational process ?
Which arise from living among people who can't understand you ?
Unless you have known a reasonably representative sample of geniuses , ( and who has ? ) it 's better to ask than assume you know .
You probably do n't .
For example , I 've noticed that the normal and the gifted treat thought and feeling as somehow antagonistic .
I see this from the outside , but I do n't get it .
When I use abstract concepts they are n't defenses against feeling ; words and ideas do n't push me away from passion .
Why should they ?
Logic and abstractions go back to my infancy .
Analysis was part of my everyday flow as a small child , it was part of the feelings .
Images too : if I try to express what I feel deeply about , I 'm likely to use a dream image , not emotional labels , for such images are realer to me than normal people 's language .
Traditional Native American speech and rhetoric , using concise , carefully chosen images in place of abstract words , is much more intelligible to me than standard English .
About the only white people who use language as I do are small kids ... and artists .
Maybe in this culture ( with its fading Victorian cult of the child ) normal and gifted kids develop the capacity to abstract only after early childhood is over .
Developmentalist Jean Piaget thought it was biology not culture .
But his famous developmental stages happened at different ages and in scrambled order for me .
Biology or culture , I do n't care .
All I know is , his ' universal ' human developmental pattern is NOT universal .
Severely retarded children may never reach many stages at all ; but the severely gifted scramble through them , not in a neatly compressed or speeded - up childhood , but in a chaotic patchwork of talents and disabilities .
At least I did .
An example of pseudo - knowledge about child development that child prodigies can disprove : Freud theorized that the surge of spiritual concerns that usually coincides with puberty was a sublimation of sexual curiosity .
And it 's true , kids at 100 IQ do hit puberty and the big spiritual questions around the same time .
Leta Hollingworth 's study " Children above 180 IQ " , however , found that kids over 180 IQ got obsessed with big questions at 7 not 12 , right on schedule for their mental age ... but they went sex - crazy right on schedule for their physical onset of puberty , at 9 or 10 .
The link between sex and religion was just an artifact of IQ !
I wonder if much of the emotional make - up of normal people -- which I find so different -- consists of these shared associative links , mere coincidences -- stages you all reached at the same time purely by chance .
Or are they coincidences ?
The vast majority may mature at this rate because that pattern is optimal .
But optimal because it 's better or just because it 's the pattern others all share ?
Fascinating theoretically , but what matters for ME is that the associations exist -- never mind why .
I can see them from outside , but not share them .
I never will .
I HAVE MY OWN .
When I betray a lack of these shared associations , I make normal people uneasy and psychologists incredulous : they assume I 'm hiding my " real " feelings .
That 's exactly when I 'm showing them .
Here are some of the differences I 've noticed -- prodigies ' oddities !
DREAMING
My first memories , from age 2 - 3 , are what other people call a dream ; my first recalled body - shape was not human .
I was a horse who woke up as a human child !
I 've never had much trouble recalling dreams , including those from REM states earlier in the night , which in normal people fade out or get overwritten by later cycles in the night .
I wo n't bother listing all the peculiarities of prodigal dreaming that I think exist -- after all , I 've posted a thousand dreams as examples .
In brief , the dream - state for prodigies is clearer and very different from the state described by normal and gifted people , and even may differ physically .
READING
I have no memory of a preliterate childhood world ; in my first memories , I could already read .
I associated reading with dreaming , and saw the three states as equally real : waking , dreaming , reading .
Literacy is n't intellectual for me .
It 's like breathing or eating -- so early , it feels built in from the ground up .
WALKING
Learning to read and learning to walk were associated for me , I think , since they happened around the same time , and both involve mobility into other worlds .
Non-prodigies get anchored in the physical for a few years before the world of ideas opens up to them .
Not me .
ADULT SECRETS
Saying no-- the Terrible Twos -- and learning to read , cracking adult secrets .
Once a child can read , adult secrets are never fully safe .
This happened , for me , right at the start ; I never developed a sense of an adult world of INFORMATION closed off to me .
They could n't spell things or use multisyllabic circumlocutions to slip around my sharp little ears .
I often chose to let adults talk over my head , ignore what they obviously wanted to keep private , but it was a choice .
Conversely , I could n't easily tune out material like TV news that was emotionally toxic for a kid my age .
Normal and gifted kids seem to me to live in a slowly expanding perceptive bubble , with an ignored adult world around it .
The size of the bubble , and its growth rate , vary , but it 's always there .
Prodigies lack such shelter .
ASTRONOMY
I was obsessed with astronomy even at age 3 - 4 .
This is n't a personality quirk : it 's been known for at least fifty years that most 180 +
IQ kids exhibit VERY early curiosity about their place in the universe , and it's not bound to their body as much as their planet .
They want to know the neighborhood -- but their concept of " neighborhood " is a lot wider than other kids ' .
Yet even today , child therapists often mistake this normal aspect of child prodigies for a displaced obsession , covering some other concern .
If your small child knows more about the solar system than you do , get the kid IQ tested early and start reading up and take school psychologists ' evaluations very skeptically - - unless you KNOW they have experience with the severely gifted .
Odds are , they wo n't .
SAFETY
By age 3 or 4 I knew that many adults were ignorant about things I considered basic , like knowing your address in the universe .
I must have concluded very early that many people were mentally so alien I 'd never share their world .
Normal and gifted kids do learn that adults do n't know everything , but it comes much later , when the kids have some physical competence , some sense they can take care of themselves when adults fuck up .
Picture yourself stuck in a bed on life support run by a team of brain - damaged doctors ... and maybe you can see where the prodigy 's go - it - alone syndrome comes from !
DISCIPLINE
Toilet training and literacy around the same time meant they got associated .
Both involved disciplining my body to sit ; I was teaching sphincter and eye - muscles to obey at the same time .
It 's worth noting that most kids get trained to sit still by adults ; for me this training was internal , something I needed in order to go where I wanted - - into other worlds .
I became very self - willed , and I think it began here .
WRITING
For years I felt I was clumsy and my handwriting was hopeless , as my early teachers complained about my handwriting ( forgetting I was younger than my classmates -- most kids my age could n't write at all ) .
It is n't just me --Hollingworth found this pattern was common for child prodigies , right up to teachers forgetting the kid's age !
So I grew up " clumsy " ... yet confident I could pick up any accent and learn any language in next to no time .
Why not ?
I learned to speak and read ( and sing and whistle ) years before I could write or draw legibly .
I wrote early , around age 4 , but that was twice my age when I started reading -- an eternity when you 're small .
Being a fluent reader but physically unable to write , completely separated two tasks that nearly all adults lump together .
It affected my body image -- it was my first defeat by the limitations of my own body .
Only in recent years have I tested my assumption that I 'm clumsy , and found I can draw and sculpt quite well - - even do calligraphy .
RELIGION
Freud claimed religion is displaced sexuality ; one of his proofs was the common correlation between sexual and religious awakening around puberty .
Not child prodigies !
Hollingworth found that by age 5 - 7 , prodigies start facing the big spiritual , moral and metaphysical questions that most humans ask later , around puberty .
Once you reach a certain intellectual maturity the questions present themselves , and geniuses get hit early -- before they necessarily have the emotional resources to handle them .
My parents were idealistic leftists , and I was as vulnerable to my mom's Gandhian pacifism as I would have been to any cult .
It made me special , one of the chosen , and satisfied my need for a moral structure .
It was deadly , of course , because most adults admire Gandhi in theory , but do n't consider pacifism realistic -- certainly not for little boys .
They expected childish amorality or mature pragmatism .
Picture a horse - crazy Catholic girl hitting puberty and suddenly getting very devout , having fantasies of martyrdom ...
This describes me pretty well by age 6 or 7 , and I had much less experience to anchor me than a 12 - year - old .
Nor did anyone recognize what was happening : small boys just do n't have adolescent conversions .
And adult reactions are n't the worst problem : other kids simply can't share a prodigy 's concerns at this stage .
At best , isolation ; at worst , victimization .
PRETEEN CYNICISM
I was angry at my parents too , for not giving me a coherent philosophy .
My father was a scientific pragmatist , a Bertrand Russell type .
My mother 's radical idealism had all the force of a religion .
Their political ideals were reconcilable , and I still share most of them , but the means , the daily application , I had trouble with .
Still do .
This happens to a lot of adolescents , and that 's usually attribute to hormone hurricanes ; but I was digging at my folks by age four and quite convinced they were hypocrites by age 8 , well before puberty , though that did come early too ( 9 or so ; prodigies typically develop a couple of years early , though the body lags behind the brain ) .
TESTING PARENTS ' PHILOSOPHY
I resorted to heavyhanded sarcasm sometimes and amnesia most of the time .
I 'd play cowboys and war and other violent games partly just to have fun but partly to annoy my mom .
I 'd refuse to compete or to fight for real , though , partly because I really believed those things were wrong and partly to poke at my father who thought I was a mama 's boy .
I had to blank out these motives , which were understandable but broke the rule " Do n't hurt anyone . "
I wanted to hurt them enough so they'd wake up and get their act together and tell me which set of values they really believed in , really lived by ...
HIDING
At age 9 - 10 , I learned to hide who I was , or get beaten up .
Even though I was in my first gifted class ( our whole district 's first , in fact ) I still had to hide my full intellect .
When do normal kids learn they must hide their real selves , and that even if they show themselves , others will see them filtered through racist and sexist prejudices ?
For me , this was linked deeply to sex , because the issues came up in the same year .
I learned to shut up about sex and brains at the same time , in the same way ...
These are the early mileposts of development that I KNOW had different timing and therefore different associations for me .
There are more , of course : I wrote this list off the top of my head , focusing on skills and body image .
If it seems from the above like I have a fantasy of some uniform " normal kid " , so be it .
God knows normal and gifted people have one about geniuses .
At least I 've tried to read up a bit on you all .
Do the same about us before you complain .
So much for maturation .
What 's it like as an ADULT prodigy , dealing with the wide range of intelligences I encounter ?
Well ... strange , mostly .
THE GIFTED
Professionals , from doctors to astrophysicists to linguists , find me confusing -- I 'm not one of them , not IN their field , yet I know too much about their field for an amateur , so they often assume I must be a sort of hobbyist OBSESSED with their field .
And they often assume I must share their values , just because I know the jargon ; they 're shocked if I bring up , say , engineering to a psychic , or ESP to an engineer ...
Mistaking my idle curiosity for obsession , just because I casually learned their specialty , is one of the few consistent reactions of gifted specialists to a prodigy .
It 's hard for me to talk about the gifted as a class , since I differentiate a lot between the brightest of them and the more normally gifted -- sharp distinctions between those only 20 IQ points apart .
They 're closest to me , and I was of course lumped in with them all my life , in school , so I react strongly to their individual characters and may almost be blind to their intelligence ( water to a fish ? ) unless they 're near - geniuses .
NORMAL PEOPLE
This must sound strange , but I can barely distinguish between a mildly gifted person , a normal person , and a mildly retarded one .
They 're all so distant from my way of thinking that even quite a large IQ spread does n't mean a thing to me .
In some ways , I get along better with nongifted people , since we 're SO different we do n't threaten each other much .
By giving up all attempts to understand each other , we can just LIKE each other - - rather like dogs and humans -- and frankly , I 'm more like the dog in this analogy .
After all , this civilization was built for normal people ; there are large areas of it that mean nothing to me at all , and never will ( starting with spectator sports ) .
In contrast , the gifted see me as more troubling -- just as ape habits upset people because they 're too close to home , I 'm like them , but not right somehow .
If they do figure it out , they may ...
turn fiercely competitive
get insecure and retreat to their areas of expertise , where they feel securely superior
find me wildly entertaining and want to be my best friend , no matter how I feel
turn covertly vicious : the Mozart - Salieri syndrome .
I 've said nothing here about IQ and race for the simple reason that a gap between blacks and whites of 7 or 8 points ( which is all it is , now ) is nothing .
What I want to know is how to raise everyone 's IQ fifty points or more so I can stop being bored to death .
To any whites out there who still feel smug about this trivial test - score difference , I 'll merely ask : if IQ is genetic , then how about African - Americans living seven years less on average than whites , is THAT genetic ?
Now there 's a gap that counts !
The IQ gap has the same causes : shitty healthcare , malnutrition ( if you 're pregnant , take folic acid and lecithin and C .
Your kids will be smarter -- and healthier ! ) and especially lead poisoning .
Fix those first , before you even open your mouth on the subject of race and genetics , okay ?
( And by the way , if you live in an older house , get your water tested and GET A WATER FILTER if it shows ANY lead .
The hazard is MUCH higher than government standards acknowledge .
It costs money , but sick and retarded kids cost way more than a lead test .
This is not a luxury any more than a lock on your door is .
And if you live or work in a city or on a busy street , when you go home , take your shoes off and wear socks or slippers indoors , Turkish style .
Your shoes track lead - dust in -- and it 's slow poison , especially for kids .
Take megadoses of vitamin C , it helps scrubs lead out .
Do it .
All this sounds extreme , but it wo n't in five years , when current research becomes popular wisdom . )
Sorry .
No literary punch line today , folks .
I 'm exhausted from writing all this .
Coming out of the closet like this is a strain .
It 's been fun , but I 'm going back in now .
Bye .

Response to Bruce Walker 's " The Godless Delusion "
Kelly O'Connor
Bruce Walker 's anti-atheist diatribe , printed in a magazine that touts itself as The American Thinker , is the ultimate in irony .
This story is the clear byproduct of one who appears to be incapable of rational thought and instead chooses to regurgitate rhetoric that was likely force - fed to him in those weekly indoctrination camps known as churches .
Mr. Walker starts out his vitriolic falsehoods with the contention that all people instinctively know right from wrong and that people choose evil .
If that is so , then why the heavy Christian emphasis on child - rearing ?
If we are all born instinctively knowing right from wrong , then any kind of instruction or discipline would be completely unnecessary .
This is a shining example of Christian compartmentalization .
It is clear from their behavior that even they do n't believe their own nonsense .
He continues with the classic argument ( if it can be called that ) that " evil " is more alluring and easier than " good " .
Apparently , he has never studied Euthyphro's Dilemma .
Before we can start assigning qualities to " good " and " evil " , we need to understand what it means for something to be good or evil .
How can he claim that it is easier to do evil deeds than good deeds ?
If that were true , and assuming that humans generally follow the path of least resistance , we would not have survived as a species , much less prospered as we have .
Reciprocal altruism and social cohesion are based on treating others well - at least as well as they treat you .
The Christian definition of evil , of course , equates to sinning against god .
The inclusion of the repression of human sexuality and the subsequent guilt for things as trivial as thoughts would be what Mr. Walker calls " alluring " .
It is alluring because our biology is geared to operate in that fashion .
Our ultimate purpose in life is to procreate and ensure the continuation of our genetic lineage .
Sex is just as necessary for our survival as eating , breathing , or sleeping .
Imagine a world in which monolithic establishments make you feel guilty for thinking about food .
The Christian proscriptions regarding sex are just as ludicrous as that hypothetical circumstance .
Walker goes on to claim that , " All people - especially militant anti-theists - are religious . "
Clearly , he does n't know the definition of the word " religious " , so I 'll attempt to enlighten him .
Religion :
1. a set of beliefs concerning the cause , nature , and purpose of the universe , esp. when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies , usually involving devotional and ritual observances , and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs .
2. a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects : the Christian religion ; the Buddhist religion .
3. the body of persons adhering to a particular set of beliefs and practices : a world council of religions .
4. the practice of religious beliefs ; ritual observance of faith .
5. something one believes in and follows devotedly ; a point or matter of ethics or conscience : to make a religion of fighting prejudice .
( from dictionary.com )
The widespread misunderstanding that atheism is just another religion in which we worship science instead of god is so asinine that it barely warrants a response , but since so many people are swayed by it , hopefully I can clear up some of Mr. Walker 's confusion .
The first definition concerns " a set of beliefs " that " usually [ involve ] devotional and ritual observances " .
The only thing that atheism entails is the lack of belief in deities - there is no positive belief or ritual associated with not believing in something .
I assume that Mr. Walker would also classify those who do not believe in Santa Claus as " religious " .
There is no " fundamental set of beliefs ... agreed upon by a number of persons or sects " either .
Atheists come in all different varieties with the sole common denominator being that we do not believe in supernatural entities .
Likewise , there is nothing to which we all adhere , no rituals , no faith , and no mindless devotees .
Next , he uses everybody 's favorite fallacy and asserts that " No crimes of Judeo - Christians remotely approaches the holocausts of Aztecs , Japanese , Nazis , atheist Russia or atheist Japan . "
It appears that a history lesson is in order here , although I 'm sure that whatever proof is presented will be systematically ignored .
The most glaring mistake here is the reference to pre-WWII Japan as " atheist . "
He himself had previously attributed the atrocities committed by the Japanese to their " national religion " .
Which is it , Mr. Walker ?
The main impetus behind their superiority complex was their Shinto background .
Apparently , the imported Buddhism had n't had enough of an impact on their desire to dominate all of Asia .
Since they were created by the goddess Ameterasu did specifically create them , and their emperor was a direct and divine descendant of her , they felt that they had the right to take over China and Korea .
They were willing to die for their belief as kamikaze ( which means " wind of the gods " in Japanese ) much as Muslim suicide bombers are today .
This is just another example of the violence caused by religious beliefs and further demonstrates the danger of failing to critically examine your personal beliefs .
Despite what he believes the statistics are , for there is no way to know with any accuracy since the Christian regimes did n't tend to keep records of all the heretics , witches , and blasphemers they killed , the atrocities of various so - called " atheist " despots do not validate their belief in god in any way .
People of all faiths , or the lack thereof , are vulnerable to being seduced by power , particularly absolute power .
The best explanation for the Stalinist , or even Nazi , regimes is power - hungry megalomaniacs removing religion in order to ensure the allegiance of the people .
The next statement is downright laughable - crediting Christianity with abolition , prison reform , animal rights , equal rights , medicine , and " systematic intellectual inquiry . "
( Is an * LOL * inappropriate here ? )
Some Christians did support abolition - just as many supported slavery .
It is explicitly permitted in the Bible , so I can see why they may feel that there is nothing wrong with owning human beings .
Prison reform ?
Unless they consider reform to be adding more priests and chaplains to prisons , I can't fathom how the biggest proponents of the death penalty and the members of the Religious Right who want to take public funding away from the already overcrowded prisons are responsible for making them better .
Equality ?
Walker obviously has forgotten the women 's rights movement , when Christian husbands were fighting to keep women under their thumbs because of the biblical command to be the spiritual leaders and its inherent misogyny .
I wo n't even address the medicine and intellectual inquiry points , since I must assume that they were made in jest or disingenuous .
The Church was adept at forcing heretic scientists to recant - under penalty of torture and death , that is .
I do n't understand how Mr. Walker could propose that not only do atheists worship science , but that it debunks itself because of universal constants , such as the speed of light .
First of all , science is a method of determining how the world around us operates using empirical data , observation , and experimentation .
Nothing more .
Certainly nothing to " worship " in a methodology discovered by man ; although , it is similar to his god that was also created by man .
Secondly , nothing in science is " absolute . "
Unless Walker has developed prescience , how can he know what will or will not be discovered in the future ?
To claim that god has created an " absolute , irrevocable bar " to human knowledge is ludicrous .
That 's what nay - sayers have been saying for hundreds of years - man will never fly , we will never get to space , we will never have microchips ... you get the point .
He further claims that it is " highly improbable " that we will learn anything new about the universe .
Somebody needs to buy this man a subscription to Scientific American .
New discoveries are made every day , and it will continue to progress .
At least if the rapture happens , most of the credible scientists will be " left behind " to continue developing new technologies for the rational people on this planet .
To sum up , this was a long response to a short article .
It continually amazes me that it takes twice the time to show how these people are mistaken than it does for them to spew their irrational assertions onto the general public .
It is a pity that so many people are sucked in by this kind of ignorance .
I can only conclude that Bruce Walker is projecting his own delusion onto us when he labels us with the " Godless Delusion . "
Although any delusion would involve some kind of belief that was unsupported by facts ( sound familiar ? ) , I would take the " godless delusion " over the alternative .
The answer is : Yes !
A recently expired grand jury raised the question .
It might have indicted but for a few details .
Think of it .
Bushman and Dickster might have been looking at hard jail time , impeachment , the possibility of war crimes trials .
My recent article -- How the People May Bring Criminal Charges Against Bush -- urged citizens to petition a judge to empanel a grand jury .
My article pointed out that the people themselves may petition a court to convene a grand jury to investigate Bush 's corrupt administration .
Such a panel would have the power of the subpoena and the indictment .
The legal standard for bringing an indictment against Bush or Cheney is " probable cause " .
Since writing the article and while researching existing literature , I learned that the issue of of indictments against Bush and / or Cheney had , indeed , come up in the proceedings of at least one sitting grand jury .
Praise from a Member of a Recently Expired Grand Jury R. S. Nelson ( SF Bay Area ) Shortly after this book [ United States V. George W. Bush et al. ] became available , but before I became aware of it , I asked the federal prosecutor ( or " AUSA " for Assistant US Attorney ) we were working with at the time whether we could indict Bush & Cheney .
As I expected , the question was not answered .
Another member of the federal Grand Jury sharply and quickly asked me " Who would write the indictment ? "
Ms. de la Vega points out in the first paragraph of her Introduction that writing an indictment of Bush & Cheney is not a smart move for an AUSA to make if they wish to remain employed .
Had I known of retired AUSA de la Vega 's book , I might have pushed for our Grand Jury to issue our own indictment without the help of the staff of the local US Attorney 's office !
There just might have been 11 other jurors besides myself who would have voted in favor of such an action ...
While Bush 's Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez would be unlikely to allow prosecution of his fellow Republicans , the issuance of an indictment by a sitting federal Grand Jury would probably garner some interesting news coverage ! ...
On some days the start of the Grand Jury session needed to be postponed until a quorum appeared .
It was during these interludes of waiting with the AUSA present that questions like " Can we indict Bush & Cheney " could be entertained .
I have long believed that Bush , Cheney , Rice , Powell , and Rumsfeld are criminals .
Elizabeth de la Vega provides the evidence and legal framework clearly meeting the " Probable Cause " standard to indict these people .
They appear to have committed serious crimes against the people of the USA , and should be held to account .
That this route is considered is symptomatic of a state of official lawlessness in Washington and disdain for the rule of law throughout the Bush administration .
What can be done when the House of Representatives will not adequately investigate 911 let alone begin impeachment proceedings against George W. Bush ?
Here 's what can be done : the people can petition a judge to convene a grand jury charged with considering a panoply of criminal charges against George W. Bush , Richard Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Condoleezza Rice , and Colin Powell .
There is an appalling lack of general understanding about grand juries .
An early objection was simply the creation of a " legitimate authority " .
A judge IS a legitimate authority .
A grand jury appointed by a judge IS a legitimate authority .
There are only about three ways in which grand juries are convened .
A petition to a judge is one of them .
The people may petition a judge to convene a grand jury and judges have always had that authority .
A grand jury itself has sweeping authority .
Some grand juries have been called " run away grand juries " .
In my previous article , I mentioned that one such panel investigated organized crime in New York and returned numerous indictments against alleged crime bosses .
Make no mistake about it .
A bona fide grand jury , duly appointed by a judge , could investigate and return indictments against all the crooks inside Bush 's corrrupt crime syndicate of an administration .
It was facetiously objected that " .. it is a wonderful idea ... of delivering all of our nuclear war fighting elite up to a Grand Jury . "
Well , we gave that power to Bush !!!
I fail to see how a grand jury , if consisted of straw suckin ' simpletons , could do any worse !
A grand jury investigating the Bush White House would have sweeping powers to define the scope of its own investigation .
It would have the power of the subpoena to back it up .
I recommend the following handbook for the would - be activist : Facts About Grand Juries .
As for the question of who shall write the indictment , I appeal to readers of this forum .
There must surely be someone of the caliber of author Elizabeth De La Vega who could assist a grand jury in the drafting of a comprehensive indictment against Bush and Cheney .
If Alberto Gonzales should try to restrain the scope of such an investigation , my advice would be to investigate Gonzales for possible obstruction of justice .
Clearly , Gonzales ' primary responsibility has been that of an " enabler " tasked with making legal , after the fact , many crimes that have surely been committed by both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
Should anyone doubt that such an indictment could be returned , I recommend de la Vega 's book .
Elizabeth De La Vega builds a legal case that President Bush and top members of his administration engaged in a conspiracy to " deceive the American public and Congress into supporting the war . "
Drawing on her experience as a federal prosecutor , as well as the work of scholars and legal experts , she brings a well - honed legal perspective to the issue .
She presents her argument in transcript form as a hypothetical weeklong presentation to a grand jury , including extensive testimony from three fictional investigative agents .
Despite her somewhat specialized approach , the author clearly defines the legal terms and issues and avoids jargon .
Elizabeth de la Vega is a former federal prosecutor with twenty years of experience .
If anyone could draft an indictment , she can and has done so in her book .
Clearly , the defendants -- George W. Bush , Richard Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Condoleezza Rice , and Colin Powell -- have committed the crime of taking this nation to war upon a fraud , a pack of malicious lies .
The indictment will most certainly charge the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States .
The facts of Ms de la Vegas ' case are indisputable , the case is real .
George W. Bush et al perpetrated a cynical , callous fraud upon the people of the US that resulted in the deaths of some 2,500 American soldiers , over 650,000 Iraqis .
The cost of the " war " has surpassed $ 450 billion dollars as of this writing .
Our founders foresaw problems with a rogue executive and provided the mechanism of impeachment to address the issue .
Unfortunately , the Congress seems content to muddle through to the end of this " President 's " term .
I consider that option to be disastrous .
The Constitutional process is already weakened , perhaps beyond the political will to repair it and the people are increasingly demoralized an ongoing war crime in Iraq , beyond description in terms of its human toll and unimaginable in terms its fiscal effects now and in the future .
Bluntly , Bush is a rogue " President " of doubtful legitimacy who has shown disdain for the very principle that is summarized in three words : " rule of law " .
Various statements attributed to him having to do with the Constitution are credible because they are in character .
Bush is , in fact , on network video tape declaring " ... this would be a whole lot easier if this was a dictatorship ... just as long as I'm the dictator . "
I did n't think it funny .
Let 's get on with it .
Petition a judge .
Empanel a Grand Jury .
There is probable cause NOW to bring indictments against both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
Should Gonzales not allow it , he had best have sound legal reasons for his position .
Else , indict him for obstruction of justice !

What started as a quirky idea to get around the statewide smoking ban appears to be spreading like wildfire .
Dozens of bars are expected to stage " theater nights ' ' this weekend in which patrons are dubbed actors .
The law , which went into effect in October , permits performers to smoke during a theatrical production .
" Two weeks ago , we had one bar doing this , '' said Mark Benjamin , a criminal defense attorney who launched the theater - night idea .
He estimates 50 to 100 bars could be on tap for theater nights this weekend based on phone calls , e-mails and requests for the how - to - stage - a- theater - night packet that he 's devised .
And many bar owners are passing on the information quickly among themselves without getting in contact with him .
State Health Department officials did n't return calls Thursday , but said earlier this week that they are waiting for a state attorney general 's opinion on the legality of theater nights .
State legislators who championed the ban said last week that the loophole likely will be plugged and the bar theater nights will end .
But until that happens , Kenn Rockler , executive director for the Tavern League of Minnesota , said he 's getting calls and e-mails from bar owners .
Lisa Anderson , owner of Mike 's Uptown bar in Hill City , said that last Saturday she staged a " theater night " and packed in four times the usual crowd that has come in since the smoking ban took effect .
Anderson said she has been helping other bar owners who want to put on their own tobacco productions .
" I'm going to continue to do this , '' she said .
" It increased my business . ''
So will Brian Bauman , owner of The Rock nightclub in Maplewood , which staged a theater night Tuesday and nearly doubled the usual crowd .
At least 10 other bar owners wandered through his bar that night , taking stock of the event 's success .
It wo n't work for every bar or restaurant because some are carving out a niche with nonsmokers , he said .
" We 're a rock bar and the majority of the people who come here smoke , '' Bauman said .
Until the state puts a stop to this , " we have every intention of doing this again .
... We have our karaoke night and we have our rock night .
Now we will have our theater night . ''

By virtually every indicator , 2007 was a dismal year for American workers .
Job growth slowed , unemployment jumped and wages lost what little ground they had gained against inflation since 2003 .
There is one sliver of good news : the percentage of American workers who belong to a union rose for the first time in three decades .
The Labor Department reported that the number of workers belonging to a union grew by 311,000 to 15.7 million .
That means union members increased from 12 percent of the American work force in 2006 to 12.1 percent last year .
In the private sector , unions ’ share of workers inched ahead from 7.4 percent to 7.46 percent .
While the rebound is tiny , and might yet prove to be a statistical mirage , it is the first recorded increase in organized labor ’s ranks since the 1970s , when almost one in four workers belonged to a union .
There is little doubt that American workers need unions .
Wages today are almost 10 percent lower than they were in 1973 , after accounting for inflation .
The share of national income devoted to workers ’ wages and benefits is at its lowest since the late - 1960s , while the share going to profits has surged .
The decline in unionization has been a big part of the reason that workers have lost so much ground .
The future of organized labor is not cause for great optimism .
Employers have become more aggressive about keeping unions out .
Competitive pressures from globalization , deregulation and technological change have resulted in the loss of many union jobs .
Along Highway 1 in Western Finland , some rest stops have bathrooms that can be opened only via text messaging .
Otherwise locked , a number is posted on the door to which you text " OPEN . "
The door unlocks and you can do your business .
Advertisement
The surprising aspect is that only standard text messaging rates apply , meaning that the government is n't making money off the service .
So why lock the bathrooms in the first place ?
By putting users ' numbers on record , authorities hope to cut down on vandalism .
We 'd be happy if just it curbed " gush without flush . "

Verizon recently announced that it will allow any mobile device maker to connect to its wireless network for a single , " surprisingly reasonable " certification fee , and it has n't taken long for the analysts and conspiracy buffs to drive themselves into a frenzy wondering what this move could mean .
Is Verizon merely adjusting to the market 's push for more open networks , or does the telecommunications giant have some larger — and possibly more sinister — plan up its sleeve ?
While it 's still not clear what Verizon 's real motivations are , there are a few theories worth considering .
Some observers point out that Verizon 's move merely brings the company 's offerings to the same level as providers using the more popular GSM network , where customers can move their accounts to a new mobile device merely by transferring a SIM card .
In this scenario , Verizon would just be keeping up with its competition .
Other analysts , such as InformationWeek 's Eric Zeman , think the move could be about a future competitor .
Zeman was confused by the lack of support for this announcement by the Open Handset Alliance , the group of companies partnering with Google to develop an open - source mobile phone operating system called Android .
The OHA folks may simply be too busy developing the Android system to concern themselves with what Verizon is doing .
A slightly darker theory is being put forward by people such as Silicon Valley Insider 's Dan Frommer , who believes that the " open network " announcement is merely a way to get the public to accept the idea of paying hefty fees for data network usage .
The idea is to get as many types of devices — not necessarily phones — on the wireless network as possible , and by doing so get people used to the idea of paying by the kilobyte for any kind of access .
This is in contrast to the traditional ISP model where users pay a monthly fee regardless of how much bandwidth they consume ( of course , even with ISPs there is an unstated limit and many will cut you off if you go beyond that level ) .
At the extreme edge of the spectrum we have Robert Cringely , who is not afraid to engage in juicy conspiracy theories .
He believes that Verizon 's move is " straight from the playbook of the old AT&T back in the 1970s , " when the company warned users not to connect third - party land line phones to its network .
He believes that Verizon will release network specifications very slowly and find excuses to not approve most of the third - party device manufacturers that apply for access to its network .
Though not as old as Cringely , I 'm old enough to remember the days when the phone company discouraged customers from using third - party telephones .
However , I also remember that this idea was ultimately doomed to failure .
The idea of an open network where you could plug in any phone from any manufacturer was too good to resist .
There 's no reason why the same could n't happen with mobile phone networks in the future .
So is Verizon really changing its ways and embracing the inevitable ?
Perhaps .
But if so , it 's a rather sudden and extreme reversal of the company 's position .
It was only last year that the CEO of Verizon told the world that Google was n't paying enough to access " his pipes , " and last July the company petitioned Congress to remove an " open access " requirement from the upcoming 700MHz bandwidth auction .
It also sued the FCC before later dropping the suit .
That auction — in which Google is expected to make serious noise — could be the beginning of a major change in the balance of power for mobile networks .
The spectrum , which was previously used by UHF TV broadcast channels 52 through 69 , could be the new battleground in the fight between traditional carriers such as AT&T and Verizon and the new breed of Internet companies like Google who want to get in on the mobile action .
With respect to fiscal policies , a discretionary fiscal loosening in EU countries should be avoided .
There is ample evidence that activist fiscal policies were not effective in stabilising European economies but rather led to sustained increases in the ratios of government expenditure and debt to GDP .
Allowing the free operation of automatic stabilisers in countries with strong fiscal positions and safeguarding the long - term sustainability of public finances are the best contributions that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability .
Indeed , for the first time in its eight - year existence , Netflix has found itself losing customers .
It is not the quality of customer service that is driving them away , but rather the heightened competition from Blockbuster .
Late last year , soon after Blockbuster introduced its Total Access program , which allows members to swap a movie they have rented online for an in - store movie , the nationwide chain began gaining on Netflix ’s base of 6.7 million subscribers .
By the first quarter this year , after years of outstripping Blockbuster in subscriber growth , Netflix added 480,000 new subscribers while Blockbuster signed up 780,000 new members .
And in the second quarter of this year , Netflix , which prides itself on customer loyalty , lost 55,000 customers .
Blockbuster added 525,000 , bringing its total to 3.6 million .
The Hillsboro operation , which occupies about 30,000 square feet of a low building in an office park , is intended to keep the red envelopes coming .
Michael Osier , vice president for information technology operations and customer service , said he rejected cities like Phoenix , Salt Lake City and Las Vegas , which are known as call - center capitals , because of their high employee turnover rates .
He settled on the greater Portland area because of the genial attitude on the part of most service workers .

“ In hotels and coffee shops and the airport , it ’s amazing how consistent people are in their politeness and empathy , ” said Mr. Osier , who is based at Netflix headquarters in Los Gatos , Calif .
“ There ’s an operational language in the industry that people are so jaded about — phrases like ‘ due to high caller volume . ’
We ’re very consciously trying to counter that mentality . ”
Netflix ’s decision to eliminate the e-mail feature was made after a great deal of research , Mr. Osier said .
He looked at two other companies with reputations for superb phone - based customer service , Southwest Airlines and American Express , and saw that customers preferred human interaction over e-mail messages .
“ My assessment was that a world - class e-mail program was still going to be consistently lower in quality and effectiveness than a phone program , ” he said .
When Mr. Osier presented his findings in January to fellow executives , Reed Hastings , the Netflix chief executive , sent an enthusiastic message , BlackBerry to BlackBerry , from across the room .
Mr. Hastings quickly became a supporter of the e-mail elimination project .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Republican presidential front - runner Sen. John McCain on Thursday defended his statement that U.S. troops could spend " maybe 100 " years in Iraq -- saying he was referring to a military presence similar to what the nation already has in places like Japan , Germany and South Korea .
Sen .
John McCain defends his stance on troops in Iraq Thursday on CNN's " Larry King Live . "
This week , Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama both took McCain to task for the comments , saying that if he 's elected he would continue what they call President Bush 's failed policies in Iraq .
" It 's not a matter of how long we 're in Iraq , it 's if we succeed or not , " McCain said to CNN 's Larry King .
" And both Sen. Obama and Clinton want to set a date for withdrawal -- that means chaos , that means genocide , that means undoing all the success we 've achieved and al Qaeda tells the world they defeated the United States of America .
" I wo n't let that happen . "
Last month , at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire , a crowd member asked McCain about a Bush statement that troops could stay in Iraq for 50 years .
" Maybe 100 , " McCain replied .
" As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed , it 's fine with me and I hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al Qaeda is training , recruiting , equipping and motivating people every single day . "
The remaining Democratic contenders for the White House seized on the statement .
Watch McCain talk about Mitt Romney 's endorsement and his critics on the right »
" He said recently he could see having troops in Iraq for 100 years , " Clinton said at an Arlington , Virginia , rally last week in a line she 's repeated on the campaign trail .
" Well , I want them home within 60 days of my becoming president of the United States . "
Obama took a similar tack .
" Sen . McCain said the other day that we might be mired for 100 years in Iraq -- which is reason enough not to give him four years in the White House , " Obama has said on several occasions .
McCain told King he thinks opponents are taking the quote out of context .
He said any long - term troop presence in Iraq would depend on agreement from the Iraqi government .
" If they do n't want to and we do n't feel a need to do so , obviously , the whole thing is keyed to Americans being able to withdraw and come home with honor , not in defeat , " he said .
McCain was endorsed Thursday by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , once considered his fiercest rival for the GOP nomination .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee remains in the race , although McCain has an overwhelming advantage in the number of delegates earned for this year 's Republican convention .

Hello folks
Good news .
There is a way to undercut the warrantless wiretapping :
By hitting the offending companies in the pocketbook , where it counts most !
Sign up for either Working Assets ( now renamed Credo , a long distance and wireless phone company ) or Qwest ( phone and internet provider in many states of the country ) , both of whom have pledged in writing not to wiretap without court warrant , and you will be supporting the right causes while undermining the wrong ones .
Also , the Electronic Frontier Foundation www.eff.org specializes in defending civil liberties where technology interferes .
They offer programs to encrypt emails so nobody else can read them , plus other privacy - increasing tools .
Like the ACLU , they also have attorneys who provide legal defense to those technologically affected in the civil liberties / privacy area .
Check them out !
It 's terribly important to sign up and spread word for much more than privacy 's sake alone :
A ) Anything " warrantless " implies that the power of the judiciary , as fundamental arm of the government whose function is to check / balance the government 's activities , is being undermined .
It 's important that We , the People do everything in our power to preserve that fundamental arm of government :
Thanks to these wonderful carriers above , and to EFF , for providing us with the solution !
B ) I served on the Board of a local ACLU Chapter and know the statistics very well :
It is NOT terrorists who are being wiretapped .
That 's pure nonsense .
It 's ordinary people like you and me , most of them activists .
For further info , log on to the ACLU 's website at www.aclu.org and you will see .
See also my article titled " Oh Say does that Star - Spangled Banner Yet Wave O'er the Land of the Free ? ? ? " here on OpEdNews http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_kathryn__071119_oh_say_does_that_sta.htm
and follow the links I have provided ( many of them , to stress the reality of my point ) :
You will see for yourself who is being affected , and how .
C ) It 's deeply important to the people and the survival of democracy itself that we stress the solutions and the hope .
PLEASE PASS THIS INFORMATION ON TO OTHER CONCERNED FRIENDS !
You could forward this info about the carriers above as email and then ask your friends , in turn , to pass it on .
And write letters to the editor , post to blogs , etc ....
D ) Working Assets ( now recently renamed Credo ) also sends out monthly action alerts .
They contribute 1 % of their proceeds ( at no cost to customers ) to promoting progressive causes , including tree planting in the Amazon rainforest , supporting organizations such as the ACLU and many others , etc .... and have contributed an excess of $ 50 million to these causes over the past thirty years .
What a wonderful group to support !
I just love them .
Also , when switching over to their service , it not only costs you zilch but further , they will even buy out any existing phone contract you might have with your current carrier , pay any of their switchover fees , etc so it 's guaranteed that you will pay nada !
Their rates are very good too .
Check them out !
( I do n't know how Qwest works so sorry , I can't comment ) .
E ) No , I am not affiliated with Qwest or Credo , or with EFF , and know nobody affiliated with them either .
I am just seeking to spread word .
Please do the same !
And thank you !
The jobs listed here have been relocated to the new JavaScript Ninja JavaScript Jobs board .
While I ’m not , currently , looking for any extra work ( a full - time job and writing a book will slow you down a bit ) I ’m frequently forwarded job openings that I would like to pass on to others .

How can a fishermen make more money ?
By catching fewer fish .
That happy lesson is well known in the waters of Australia , as I discovered when I visited the lobster and tuna fisheries there for a New York Times Magazine article .
But now there ’s even better news , for both fish and fishermen , in an Australian study published today in Science .
It turns out that profit - seeking fishermen should want to catch even fewer fish than the “ sustainable ” number calculated by biologists , because leaving more fish in the ocean leads to bigger populations that make for easier and more lucrative fishing in the long run .
Marine biologists have been trying , without much luck in many places , to limit the annual fish harvest so that the fish population reaches a size that produces the maximum possible yield year after year .
But what if , instead of trying to maximimize the number of fish that could be caught , fishermen tried to maximize their profits ?
What would be the size of the fish population with the maximum economic yield over the long run ?
Here ’s the answer and what it means , as explained to me by the lead author of the Science paper , R. Quentin Grafton of the Australian National University :
The key result is that we find that for very different species ( including very long - lived and slow growing species like orange roughy ) that the biomass that maximises the discounted economic profits of fishers ( BMEY ) is larger than the biomass that maximises the sustained yield ( BMSY ) .
Although this has been known to be a theoretical possibility we show that it likely holds for many , if not most , fisheries at reasonable discount rates , prices and costs ( indeed our result holds at very high discount rates for three of the four fisheries we study ) .
The result implies that current fisheries management objective of moving fisheries to BMSY is not ‘ conservative ’ enough and , more importantly , allowing for larger stocks ( larger than BMSY ) is good ( raises fisher profits ) , results in more fish in the sea and also more resilient marine ecosystems .
In other words , it ’s truly a ‘ win - win ’ outcome .
Dr. Grafton says the increased profits also offer a way to deal with the political problems of getting fishermen to forgo immediate profits in order to make more money tomorrow .
He suggests that a government could compensate fishermen for their short - term losses , and then recoup the money by taxing the extra profits in the future .
“ Such a scheme , ” he said , “ coupled with individual harvesting rights that gives an assurance to those fishers incurring the transition costs that they will also be the beneficiaries of larger stocks and higher profits , will go a long way to overcoming fishers ’ objections to lower harvest today . ”
I hope he ’s right , but it ’s not been easy to get fishermen to act with economic rationality .
Some lobstermen in New England would like to move toward the system in Australia , where the lobstermen enjoy easy work and big profits through a system that limits the catch and gives each lobstermen the right to a share of it ( which he can sell when he retires , giving him an incentive to make sure there are lobsters left in the future so that his share sells for more money ) .
But in New England ( as elsewhere ) it ’s been a tough political fight to limit the catch or restrict the number of lobstermen , and the result is the classic tragedy of the commons : overfishing that leaves everyone worse off , including the fish .
I do n’t mean to suggest , by the way , that fishermen are unusual in their irrationality .
Outside my window is another group of people suffering from the same problem : Manhattan drivers stuck in traffic .
Just as fishermen would benefit from fewer boats competing for fish , these drivers would benefit from fewer cars on the street , which would be the result of the scheme proposed by Mayor Bloomberg to charge a fee for cars entering Manhattan ’s congested areas .
Economists have calculated that the drivers would be much better off under the congestion - pricing scheme , because the time they ’d save is worth more than what they ’d pay .
But there ’s been tremendous political opposition to it .
Just like fishermen , a lot of drivers would rather stick with the tragedy of the commons .

Does DRM protect content or restrict consumers ?
Western Digital says the decision to block sharing of music and audio files is an anti-piracy effort .
The ban operates regardless of whether the files are copy - protected , or a user 's own home - produced content .
Digital activists say it is the latest step in a so - called war on copyright theft that is damaging consumer rights .
The shift to a digital world in which all forms of content , from books , music , and TV programmes to films , can be shared effortlessly around the world between people with an internet connection has produced an unprecedented upheaval in attitudes to media , copyright and consumer rights .
Professional content producers have struggled to adapt to this changing world and deal with rampant copyright infringement that threatens to undermine their businesses .
Digital restrictions management ... is a restriction of our rights
Peter Brown , Free Software Foundation
The most popular method of copyright control in the digital age , Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) , is a software - and sometimes hardware - solution designed to prevent copying and to control how different forms of media are used .
Peter Brown of the Free Software Foundation , a leading anti-DRM campaigner , said : " DRM and filtering attempts by firms like Western Digital are an attempt to take control of our computers .
" DRM is bad for society because it attempts to monitor what we do and how we live our digital lives .
It is asking us to give up control of something which gives us some degree of democracy , freedom and the ability to communicate with a large group of people . "
Western Digital has blocked users from sharing more than 30 different file types , if they are using the company 's software , called Anywhere Access .
Mr Brown added : " DRM is never right because it takes away our rights as citizens . "
He said all DRM solutions had been bypassed , rendering the technology useless .
Apple and EMI announced DRM - free tracks earlier this year
" You can't stop the copying of ones and zeroes - its impossible , " he said .
Paul Garland , head of intellectual property litigation at law firm Kemp Little , said it was not possible to say DRM was not working .
" Content creators are struggling to find a way to prevent mass distribution of their creations . "
Alexander Ross , a partner at law firm Wiggin , said : " There is fundamentally two types of operation for DRM - to restrict usage , and track usage .
" That second element is essential and will remain essential - particularly for subscription services , which are beginning to take off .
" If we go down the subscription route , there must be control . "
The common problem with DRM for many users is one of a lack of interoperability .
Many of the world 's leading content producers use DRM systems which are incompatible with one another .
The popular example is the majority of music bought and downloaded from iTunes , the world 's most popular online music retailer , which can only be played in its original form on iPods , machines running iTunes and Apple 's own wireless TV system .
However , iTunes does now sell a selection of music from EMI without DRM .
The biggest problem is that it is actually quite difficult as a consumer when downloading content to know what you are able to do with it
Paul Garland , Kemp Little
The BBC has been criticised for using a form of DRM for its TV downloads that means the programmes cannot be played on Apple Macs and PCs running Linux .
" The reason for a lack of standards across the industry is that there 's no such thing as the industry , " said Mr Ross .
" There is Steve Jobs and Microsoft and the two titans are at odds with one another .
Between them they rule the market . "
Mr Garland said : " The biggest problem is that it is actually quite difficult as a consumer when downloading content to know what you are able to do with it .
There is Steve Jobs and Microsoft and the two titans are at odds with one another .
Between them they rule the market .
Alexander Ross , Wiggin
" If DRM is going to survive , there needs to be much greater effort to tell purchasers what they can or can't do with it . "
Mr Ross said people had to understand they did not have the rights to do whatever they wanted with digital content .
One solution could be to develop information standards to inform people about the rights and restrictions around DRM , said Mr Garland .
He said : " Content owners are entitled to give you what rights they decide to give you ; when you are downloading a piece of music , for example .
They are also entitled to restrict you from circumventing the DRM .
" Trying to circumvent the DRM is an offence in itself .
DRM is part of the law and a legitimate method of trying to protect your copyright content . "
For the music industry the future looks less and less likely to involve DRM , said Mr Garland .
He said : " There is a backlash , people are concerned .
The music industry is now talking a lot more about DRM - free products .
DRM has n't been the way to overcome the copyright infringement problem . "
Mr Ross said that DRM as a copy protection tool might not last much longer .
" However , DRM as a track and rights management system is here to stay - as long as the music industry exists on a royalty model , " he said .
Mr Brown said the industry did not need to use DRM , nor employ laws which prohibit the bypassing of DRM , in order to protect their financial interests .
" Media companies are trying to force people to think about copyright infringement almost in line with murder on the high seas .
" Copyright law is about copying and reproduction of work ; that is on the statue books for everyone and is sufficient to tackle the problem .
" Digital restrictions management ... is a restriction of our rights and the use we make of media files , that historically and legitimately we have been used to .
" The idea this is somehow protecting someone is untrue - it is an attack on us as citizens . "

As UI designers , we ’re always interested in learning , reading user research , understanding best practices and keeping up to date on all the latest approaches and tactics for building websites and applications .
As UI designers , we ’re always interested in learning , reading user research , understanding best practices and keeping up to date on all the latest approaches and tactics for building websites and applications .
One of the most exciting concepts we ’ve started to apply to our thinking is the mobile - first approach , famously pioneered by designer Luke Wroblewski on his blog and then in his subsequent book .
Generally , this approach provides a healthy way to gain focus , cut the fat and get to the heart of what ’s important — for both content and interaction .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
But what happens if you have an existing site or app that was built for desktop without a responsive or mobile strategy in mind ?
And more specifically , what if you , like us , do n’t have the resources , time , or budget to start over from scratch in the near term ?
Despite being a design shop , we at Fresh Tilled Soil found ourselves in this very position .
This is how we addressed it .
The Challenge
As a Web and mobile app UI design firm , we could n’t very well ignore the problem for much longer and let prospective clients pinch , zoom , and squint on their phones to assess whether we were the right agency for them — particularly when we offer mobile Web and native app design services !
So what to do ?
A design firm offering mobile and responsive design solutions should certainly practice what it preaches - especially with the data showing an increasing number of visitors accessing our site from their smartphones .
Because we wanted to share the same information regardless of device type and maintain a single codebase , a responsive approach was the best solution .
Though our resources were limited , we were fortunate enough to have several team members with a limited window of upcoming availability .
We quickly assembled a small team with the goal of rapidly making our entire website truly responsive ( though keeping a particular eye on our iPhone and Android users ) .
Based on our analytics reports , these devices were by far the most popular among viewers of our site .
Our research showed us that 51 % of mobile visits were on iPhones , 40 % were on iPads and the remaining 9 % was broken up between various Android smartphones and tablets .
However , we felt that a truly responsive solution where each of our layouts was fluid made for a better solution than just targeting specific devices .
How To Begin
Identify Key Layouts to Address .
As a group , we discussed what mattered most from a prospective client ’s point of view , then identified which layouts would need custom design and which could be handled directly in the code .
.

Focus On Screen Size Beyond Just Specific Devices .
Once the custom layouts were designed and coded , we identified organic breakpoints between mobile and desktop for further refinement .

Account For New Device Capabilities .

.
We updated graphics to support the higher resolution associated with retina displays .
Design and Code in Parallel .
While the designers got to work on the custom layouts , developers began adapting the website to small screens , converting fixed widths to percentage - based .
A designer and developer then worked side - by - side to further refine the typography , navigation and layouts in code , making improvements in real time .
Our Process In Action
1. Streamline the Navigation
Consider the limited real estate of a mobile screen and examine ways to simplify layouts .
In designing for the mobile experience , the first decision we made was to simplify the navigation to a series of icons that represented each of the sections .
We removed the large background image of our handsome CEO , Richard Banfield , and focused on making it easy to see the positioning statement and start any of the videos .
2. Identify Device - specific Use Cases
Think about what visitors want most from your mobile website and consider how to make it easy for them to access .
We thought it was important for clients who were visiting us for the first time to be able to easily contact us or access a map to our location .
By envisioning this from the user ’s perspective , we decided this content was important enough to be in a prominent location on mobile devices .
Simply showing this section when the device screen width implied a mobile resolution and setting it to not display on larger screens was enough to do the trick .
Contact information and directions were made more prominent in the layout for small screens , to assist clients who are visiting for the first time .
3. Simplify Existing Functionality
Make sure your interactions work smoothly on smaller screens and retain their context .
The portfolio section was simplified on smaller devices to only showcase six projects , and the portfolio detail images now appear above the thumbnails rather than over them to keep the context of the portfolio section .
Interactions were simplified to make sure they would work smoothly on smaller screens .
4. Rethink Potentially Awkward Interactions
If something requires a custom design approach , invest the time to truly optimize it .
Some UI choices that make great sense on a desktop simply fall flat on a mobile screen .
On the desktop version of our website , the team bios slide into view above a grid of team members , with each person ’s details appearing to the left of a larger head shot .
Knowing that these biography layouts would probably have to anchor and jump much higher than the grid and would then require quite a bit of scrolling to read the bio , we came up with an altered design treatment that resembles a modal overlay .
UI approaches that did n’t work well on small screens were given a different design treatment .
It was important to identify that the team section would need custom design early in the process so we could get started designing , testing and iterating .
We used a div that slides up from the bottom of the page , covering about 90 % of it .
The bios were then shortened in length so that each bio could be presented without scrolling in both the portrait and landscape orientations on our target devices .
5. Use Tried - and - true Responsive Patterns
Not every layout needs to be re-designed for a smaller screen .
Sometimes making columns stack and letting their widths fit the screen is the optimal treatment .
On our website , not all sections required custom treatments for smaller screens .
Below the team area , the “ Habitat ” ( article , workshops and events ) section implements a more straightforward responsive approach in which the two - column layout simply stacks vertically .
The detail pages for each of those items also use a similar stacking approach , and we made sure the option to register for a workshop was in a prominent location .
6. Removing Unnecessary Elements
Always consider simplifying .
If something on your desktop website does n’t apply to a mobile context , then maybe you can remove it .
If you find it ’s an improvement , then consider ways to simplify the desktop layout as well .
Toward the bottom of the page , our contact section was greatly simplified to only include a mobile - friendly contact form for prospective clients to get in touch .
Since we already feature the “ call us ” and “ directions ” buttons at the top of the website , we were able to remove the address and map from this section .
The contact section was simplified to remove duplicate elements .
Lessons Learned
Make informed decisions . .
By making the website structure fluid , by testing and by identifying which sections could be reordered or re-structured to optimize for mobile , our small internal team was able to get started immediately and move quickly .

Do n’t over - formalize the process .
As with many design projects , quick sketches and white - boarding sessions , followed by small changes to design comps and actual code , brought the bigger picture into focus without us getting too carried away with an overly formal process .

Understand what devices your audience is using , but take a fully responsive approach . .
Lead Designer Alex Sylvia says , “ We were conscious to test on the devices our clients were using , but we also wanted the design to react organically .
The only way to discover that was to interact with the site at various sizes . ”
By using this approach while also testing on devices we knew our audience was using based on analytics , we got the best of both worlds .

Use the best technology for the job . .
One of our senior UI designers , Alec Harrison , quickly spun out design comps for the team member treatment , using LiveView to immediately showcase the comps on his iPhone .
This provided the right context for improving the design .

Collaboration is key ..
Rather than designing independently , collaborating with a developer to make design decisions directly in code helped us reach an organic solution .
Our lead developer , Sarah Canieso , had this to say about the process : “ This project reiterated for me that responsive projects are very much a collaboration of design and code .
It was a balance between the visual — where the design changed at different breakpoints — and maintaining functionality that would provide a good user experience across devices . ”
The Impact
Since launching the responsive version of our website , we ’ve noticed the following improvements in mobile user behavior :
A 17 % reduction in our bounce rate .
An increase of time spent on our website — up to 3 minutes from just 40 seconds .
Additionally , we ’ve received several compliments from prospective clients who have accessed our website for the first time using their phone .
While a mobile - first approach gets to the heart of simplifying a site or interface for all resolutions , large and small , that just is not always possible .
In a crunch , we feel the process we undertook helped greatly improve our site on smaller devices .
And in the process , it made us even more knowledgeable about supporting various devices with a single codebase .

Egyptian police did not intervene when the bulldozer came
Border breached
Guards with riot shields stood by and then pulled out of the border areas completely as Palestinians passed through the newly - demolished barrier .
Hundreds of thousands have surged into Egypt to buy supplies since the first breaches were made on Wednesday .
Recently Israel tightened a blockade of Gaza , leading to acute shortages there .
Israel imposed the embargo after a sharp rise in rocket attacks from Gaza on its southern towns .
The UN has estimated that as much as half of Gaza 's 1.5 million population has crossed the border in defiance of the blockade .
Barbed wire
The new breach came hours after Egyptian security forces had begun to stop Palestinians from entering their country while at the same time allowing people back into Gaza .
The large yellow bulldozer was driven to the border from the Gaza side , ploughing headlong into the border fence .
Police used water cannon to push people back from the border
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool at the border says Egypt 's attempt to seal it is being seen as a minor interruption by Palestinians in search of supplies .
People were continuing to ferry essential goods such as petrol and cooking oil back into Gaza , as they have for the past two days , eyewitnesses said .
The Islamist movement Hamas , which controls Gaza , said it respected Egypt 's decision to close the border but it did nothing to assist the Egyptians on the ground .
Israel has demanded Egypt take action , as it is worried about arms smuggling .
Egypt may now have to consider talks with Hamas , which it has previously ruled out , he adds .
Riot police armed with electric batons attempted to seal the breach , while water cannons were aimed above the heads of the jostling crowd after some Palestinians threw stones .
Live shots were also fired from both sides .
Egyptian border guards meanwhile began placing piles of barbed wire and chain - link fences along the border in an attempt to re-seal it .
EGYPT - GAZA BORDER 12 km ( 7.4 miles ) long Egyptian side patrolled by 750 soldiers under 2005 agreement with Israel Border crossing terminal south of town of Rafah PA control of terminal under EU supervision collapsed after Hamas takeover of Gaza in June 2007 Border closed almost continuously since
Israel torn over Gaza role Gaza 's rocket threat to Israel Send us your comments
Hamas has said it supports Egypt 's decision to close the border and denied any involvement in the new breach .
But unless the group agrees to help police the border , it will be very difficult to keep it closed , our correspondent says .
The move by the Egyptian authorities came only hours after the US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , urged them to secure the border with Gaza .
Later , Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki promised it would " go back as normal " .
Heightened alert
Israel has stepped up its security since the border fence was destroyed , with citizens warned against travelling to Egypt 's Sinai peninsula .

Timeline : Blockade crisis Profile : Gaza Strip
Israeli officials said police were on increased alert because of warnings about infiltration and fears that militants will acquire more weapons in Egypt .
Overnight on Thursday , the Israeli military carried out two air strikes near the border , killing four suspected Hamas militants .
The commander of the Islamist movement 's military wing in Rafah , Mohammed Abu Harb , was killed along with another senior militant when Israeli missiles hit their jeep in the town , Palestinian medics said .
Another two died two hours earlier in an Israeli air strike on a truck in southern Rafah .
Israel has killed more than 40 Palestinians in Gaza during the past 10 days .
Organic chemists , the scientists that build and study chemicals made mostly of carbon , often represent the molecules of their affection as angular black and white sketches .
To the untrained eye , those drawings sometimes look like frighteningly complicated stick figures .
Last month , over at the Carbon Based Curiosities blog , Excimer and Psi*Psi held a contest to poke fun at those images – particularly ones that look like people .
The most amazing part : Stephanie Chanteau and James Tour , scientists at Rice University , have made molecules that really do look like human stick figures .
In 2003 , they described those chemicals in the Journal of Organic Chemistry .
Several of the contest entries contain little chemistry in jokes .
I will do my best to explain them .
A couple of the submissions were too offensive to show here , so if that sort of humor appeals to you , feel free to check them out on the Carbon Based Curiosities blog .
Grignard reagents are highly reactive chemicals made from magnesium and halogens like bromine .
They are a staple of organic chemistry .

The Winner !
This is a question I had from a reader ( we ’ll get to the double cheeseburger in a minute ) :
My question is about budgeting for food .
I ’ll be starting my first real job soon so I ’m setting up a list of monthly expenses .
I have n’t yet lived on my own , so I do n’t have a good basis for estimating monthly food expenses .
Could you shed some light on the matter ?
My rule of thumb is this : for one month , save the receipts on every food item that you buy , whether it ’s at the grocery store , eating out , or anywhere else .
Then add 10 % to that .
That should be your food budget for a month .
Why add 10 % ?
I find that almost every budget works better with a bit of breathing room in it .
Most months , you ’re better off coming in under budget so that you can put the excess away for debt repayment or savings .
Also , this allows you to easily handle small emergencies within your monthly budget – you already have the slack in place to handle a blown tire , for instance .
On that note , I ’ve read many of your articles about the advantages of preparing food at home .
I ’ve always been told that this option is less expensive than eating out , but intuitively it seems like the cheapest fast food options might be less expensive .
For example , is there any way I can prepare an item – even assuming I buy ingredients on sale or in bulk – and have it cost less per serving than a $ 1 cheeseburger from McDonald’s ?
Negative externalities notwithstanding , is it a better option financially ?
Can you provide a cost - per - serving analysis for some of your recipes to better answer this question ?
Okay , let ’s break it down .
I can get a double cheeseburger from my local McDonalds for $ 1.07 .
It weighs 5.8 ounces , has 440 calories , and has 23 grams of fat ( here ’s more nutrition facts on the item ) , which is 35 % of the daily recommended allowance of fat ( three McDonalds dollar menu double cheeseburgers add up to more than 100 % of your daily fat intake ) .
I will say that in terms of caloric content , it is a pretty good deal , but the calories you get are pretty unhealthy – I can certainly see why people with limited budgets and growing children might go for such things , even though it ’s far from the best choice .
Anyway , there ’s roughly three ounces of meat on the burger , plus cheese , ketchup , and a bun , meaning you can make 16 burgers of equivalent size from 3 pounds of hamburger meat .
Using the global grocery list and other online sources , I obtained some prices for the materials you would need to construct 16 such cheeseburgers .
3 pounds hamburger @ $ 1.99 lb. = $ 5.97
16 slices cheese , store brand = $ 1.99
16 hamburger buns , actually 2 packs of 8 = $ 3.98
1 small bottle ketchup = $ 1.50
… for a total of $ 13.44 .
One does n’t have to pay sales tax on these products as they ’re staple foods .
16 McDonalds double cheeseburgers , on the other hand , cost $ 17.12 .
If you want to do this in bulk , just grill all of the burgers , then freeze them , separating them with pieces of wax paper .
Pull out however many you want per meal , warm them up , then assemble them with the bun and whatever items you want on it .
Is n’t that meat price a bit cheap ?
For making burgers , especially if grilling them , you do n’t want the cheapest meat unless you want a very dry burger .
Part of the cooking process cooks out the fats , leaving water behind as the fats denature and come out of the meat .
There are other benefits here as well .
If you make your own burgers , you can grill them yourself , making them taste fantastic and allowing a lot of the fat to drip out of the meat , making for a leaner , healthier burger .
You can also choose the exact condiments you want on it – I myself like just a hint of mayonnaise on mine .
You can also choose to include other elements which make it healthier or tastier – lettuce , tomato , etc. – at your discretion .
In other words , you can make a healthier , tastier version of the McDonalds $ 1 double cheeseburger at home for less than $ 1 per sandwich .
And if you can beat the lowest common denominator in fast food , you can easily beat the price point of most anything else you would eat out .
As they happily watch their houses swell in value , Americans are changing their attitudes toward mortgage debt .
Increasingly , a home is no longer a nest egg whose equity should never be touched , but a seemingly magical ATM enabling the owner to live it up or just live .
Homeowners took $ 59 billion in cash out of their houses in the second quarter , double the amount in the 2004 quarter and 16 times the average rate of the mid-1990s , according to data released this month by mortgage giant Freddie Mac .
People are cashing out so quickly that the term “ homeowner ” may soon be inaccurate .
Fifty years ago , Americans owned , on average , three - quarters of their house and the lender owned the rest .
These days , it ’s approaching an even split .
This spend - now - rather - than - save - for - later phenomenon has produced undeniable benefits .
Experts attribute much of the nation ’s economic growth to cash - out refinancings , home equity loans and other methods of tapping rising home values .
And additional real estate investments financed by home equity have contributed to the rising home prices that bring owners such pleasure .

But the spending spree has a price .
With the savings rate at zero , consumers ’ eagerness to tap home equity is only worsening their retirement outlook , financial advisors say .
If mortgage rates rise sharply or home prices fall , many homeowners could be in financial turmoil .
They may be unable to service their loans , or could even find that their homes are worth less than their mortgages .
Such a prospect seems unimaginably distant to Doug Levy , a university administrator in San Francisco .
When his two - bedroom condominium rose in value by 10 % -- which took nine months in the hot Bay Area real estate market -- Levy refinanced .
That increased the size of his mortgage but gave him $ 25,000 to pay bills and take a modest skiing vacation in British Columbia .
He ’s considering tapping his equity again if his condo continues to appreciate .

“ It ’s like I ’m sleeping in my piggy bank , ” said Levy , 44 .
“ In this market , real estate is a liquid asset . ”
Bill and Barbara Brockmann have a different view of their house .
The retired Huntington Beach couple is sitting on half a million dollars of equity , but they ’re ignoring it .
They are n’t drawing on it to buy a new car or invest in a condo in Miami .
“ I do n’t like debt , ” said Bill Brockmann , 79 .
“ I do n’t buy anything I ca n’t pay for . ”
Such thriftiness has gone out of fashion .
What was once considered undesirable -- taking on large debt -- is now seen as smart .
And what used to be smart -- becoming debt - free -- is described as imprudent .

“ If you paid your mortgage off , it means you probably did not manage your funds efficiently over the years , ” said David Lereah , chief economist of the National Association of Realtors and author of “ Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom ? ”
“ It ’s as if you had 500,000 dollar bills stuffed in your mattress . ”
He called it “ very unsophisticated . ”
Anthony Hsieh , chief executive of LendingTree Loans , an Internet - based mortgage company , used a more disparaging term .
“ If you own your own home free and clear , people will often refer to you as a fool .
All that money sitting there , doing nothing . ”
The financial services industry is doing all it can to avoid letting consumers be foolish .
Ditech.com touts home loans as a way to pay off credit cards , and Morgan Stanley says they ’re a good way to fund education expenses .
Wells Fargo suggests taking a chunk out of your house to finance “ a dream wedding . ”

One obvious reason for the 69 % rise in mortgage debt over the last five years is the exploding cost of homes , which has far outstripped wage growth .
That ’s led many buyers to interest - only loans and skimpy down payments , both of which minimize their equity .
The proportion of buyers whose down payment was less than 5 % of the purchase price rose from 30.6 % in 2000 to 38.1 % this year , according to a new study by SMR Research Corp .
In California , housing prices have increased so much relative to incomes that buyers must stretch all they can .
Federal guidelines recommend homeowners devote less than $ 30 of every $ 100 in pretax income to housing .
But 40 % of Californians exceed that , according to a new report by the Public Policy Institute of California .
Advertisement
That ’s higher than in 1990 , when the previous real estate boom was cresting after several years in which housing - price rises outpaced salary gains .
The figure then was 36 % .
Some Californians devote much more than a third of their incomes to housing .
The report estimates that about one in seven homeowners in the state are using at least half of their income to pay for their house .
Many of these are first - time home buyers , and many of them are relatively young .
The report calculates that the greatest increase in homeownership rates between 2000 and 2003 came in the 30 - to - 34 age group .
Second - highest was 25 - to - 29 .
“ I think what ’s happening is that a lot of younger renters feel the ship is passing them by , ” said Hans P. Johnson , one of the authors of the report , titled “ California ’s Newest Homeowners : Affording the Unaffordable . ”
“ If they do n’t buy a house now , they think , they never will . ”

If their incomes expand as they age , these new homeowners may pay down their mortgage debt .
On the other hand , they might devote their additional spending power to toys , trips and other fun things , carrying their indebtedness forever .
For Levy , the university administrator , cashing in so quickly made sense .
He bought his condo in expensive Marin County , north of San Francisco , for $ 510,000 in April 2004 .
The bank offered to finance the whole thing , but he decided to be a little conservative and put 5 % down .
By January , the condo was worth $ 555,000 , and Levy refinanced .
He took out $ 25,000 in cash , less than the bank offered to give him .
The money paid off what he describes as “ really ugly ” credit card debt .
The interest rate on the credit card had been more than double the rate on his mortgage , so he saved about $ 600 a month .
Furthermore , his mortgage interest is tax - deductible ; his credit card interest was not .

“ It used to be that all debt was created equal and all debt was evil , ” Levy said .
“ But the tax breaks alone make a pretty compelling case to use home equity to finance just about everything . ”
He still has law school debts .
He ’s tempted to dip in to his condo again -- especially considering it is now worth about $ 600,000 .
“ There is no longer an incentive to paying off your mortgage , ” said Levy .
“ The only way I ’ll ever pay mine off is if I win the lottery . ”
That ’s probably the only way he ’ll ever be able to stop working , too .
“ I ’m never going to be able to retire , because I ’ll never have enough money in the bank . ”

The temptation to add debt can be overwhelming .
Between 1997 and 2003 , the percentage of people who owned their own homes outright , without any mortgage debt , declined from 38.9 % to 34.6 % , according to Census figures .
“ Why ca n’t people stay on diets ?
Because once you get down to a certain level , you start feeling good , and then you splurge , ” said Richard Targett , a research analyst with Ernst & Young .
“ So when your home goes up in value , you take that cruise .
You figure , I got money in my house , I did n’t earn it , let me spend some . ”
But he warned that if home prices stopped their rapid ascent -- which might be happening this summer -- Doug Levy wo n’t be the only one who has to have a job for the rest of his life .
“ If you ’re not working , where would you get the two grand you need every month for your mortgage ? ”
Targett said .
“ We ’re living longer , retiring younger , and do n’t want to give up our lifestyles .
Something ’s got to give . ”

The old way had much less built - in risk .
For the Brockmanns and many others who bought their homes in the two decades after World War II , a mortgage was something that started off big and slowly shrank .
Just as retirement loomed , it dwindled to nothing .
Making that last payment was a welcome milestone for those who knew they now had to live without a weekly paycheck .
This too is changing .
In 1997 , the median length of time remaining on an older homeowner ’s mortgage was a decade , according to Census figures .
By 2003 , the median was 14 years .
During that time , the number of older homeowners who owed more than $ 300,000 on their home went up tenfold .
New products give homeowners increasing leeway as to how much equity they can tap and how fast they can tap it .
Credit cards that allow consumers to draw on their home equity loans are one such device .
Advertisement
CMG Financial Services , a mortgage company in San Ramon , Calif. , introduced another tool this summer : a combination checking account and mortgage .
It works like this :
Your paycheck is deposited into your account and immediately applied to your mortgage principal .
Over the course of the month , as you spend money on food , gas and other necessities , the principal creeps back up .
But the result is that your mortgage debt gets paid off more quickly .
That ’s the theory , at least .
Of course , if you ’re indulgent , you can pay much less of your mortgage -- like none .
Any shortfall is added on to the principal .
“ This loan gives you a lot of power , ” said CMG ’s vice president of marketing , Doug Nesbit .
“ You can use it , you can abuse it . ”

In the old days , retirees who were house - rich and cash - poor generally downsized , perhaps moving in with their kids or retiring to the Sunbelt .
To help consumers avoid those fates , reverse mortgages have been developed , which allow them to drain the equity from their houses while still living in them .
Irvine - based Financial Freedom Corp. says one of the major reasons people buy its reverse mortgages is “ lifestyle enhancement ” -- extra money to have fun .
Financial Freedom says it is on track this year to nearly double the 5,000 reverse mortgages it sold in 2004 in California .
The Brockmanns have resisted all such newfangled products , as well as the advice of their 55 - year - old daughter .
“ Take out a line of credit and go travel , ” Sandi Bandfield said she had suggested .
“ Interest rates are so low , your payments would be next to nothing .
You ’d be enjoying life . ”
They already do .
The couple ’s four - bedroom house is about four miles from the ocean , in a section of Huntington Beach just off the Beach Boulevard commercial strip .
They bought it in 1964 , using their accumulated savings from three previous houses to make a down payment .
The purchase price : $ 26,500 .

After 30 years , when the loan was paid off , they got a home equity loan to help their four children buy their own properties .
That ’s it for debt .
“ I do n’t know of any bills we have , ” said Bill Brockmann , who spent most of his career in the electrical industry .
“ My pension and Social Security are n’t huge , but between them we do nicely .
We do n’t require a whole lot . ”
As neighbors have come and gone , the couple stayed put .
Late last year , the house next door was listed for $ 595,000 , a high - water mark for the neighborhood .
Everyone said the sellers were never going to get it , and then they did .
But even this couple has felt the lure of being a landlord .
“ We had good luck with a rental in Bellflower for five years , ” Bill Brockmann said .
“ After that couple moved out , the next was there only two or three months and kind of wrecked the place .
I had to keep going back and forth .
The upkeep ! ”

They sold the rental a decade ago .
No regrets .
For their eldest daughter , the more houses the better .
Bandfield was a medical transcriptionist until recently ; her husband Bud , 49 , is an independent electrical contractor .
They bought their home in Boulder Creek , Calif. , near Santa Cruz , for $ 157,000 in 1989 .
Substantially remodeled , it ’s now worth at least four times that .
Last year , the couple began talking about retirement .
“ We do n’t want to work forever , and someone ’s got to pay for this house , ” Bandfield said .
“ We have a nice life , but nothing in savings to speak of .
I saw us relegated to a dinky gray condo in Las Vegas if we did n’t do something . ”
Stocks ?
“ I dabbled .
I think I made $ 26 last year . ” Social Security ?
“ It ’s piddly .
Who wants to live like that ? ”

Real estate seemed the obvious , and only , answer .
The couple attended seminars , began to educate themselves .
They remortgaged their home to buy a three - bedroom in Visalia , then a two - bedroom cabin near Lake Arrowhead .
More recently , they bought two houses in Colorado .
Buying houses to rent them out is a popular strategy .
The National Association of Realtors estimates that as many as a quarter of all homes were purchased last year by investors , drawn by the lure of immediate rental income and long - term appreciation .
Bandfield ’s goal is 10 properties , each yielding $ 1,000 a month above the mortgage and upkeep .
That would nicely fund their retirement .
“ If we do n’t do anything , ” she said , “ we ’re going to have nothing . ”
Computer systems are hackable , from the Department of Homeland Security , to the Pentagon , to local County and City levels .
Franklin County ( OH ) Muncipal Court is another in a long line of government organizations that violate citizens ’ privacy by exposing personal information on their websites .
The Constitutional framers had it right :
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated .
Some counties recognize this .
See County Web Site Helped Thieves Steal Identities of Victims in Five States for details of Franklin County 's disastrous failures .
Some of the article is excerpted below :
Police in Worthington
Ohio say hundreds of people in five states are the latest victims of identity theft that has resulted from county officials publishing sensitive information about citizens over the Internet .
They 've asked the U.S. Secret Service to investigate the link between the county Web site and online identity theft .
The known victims of this latest breach are from Ohio , South Carolina , Kentucky , Texas and Wyoming .
Although no one has been arrested yet , Worthington police seized the records and computers of two people , who implicated four others and the county Web site in the scheme .
Ohio law requires that some court records are made public but does not require officials to publish any of the records online where the information can be used by criminals worldwide .
Now that the county has published your sensitive information online , local officials say they will try to locate anyone affected by the breach , but place the burden on individuals to take steps to protect themselves .
They suggest verifying information in credit reports and keeping constant vigilance over your account .
Better to keep constant vigilance over the Bill of Rights and government officials .
The Help America Vote
Act – pushed thru Congress by convicted felon Bob Ney – requires states to develop and maintain centralized , computerized voter registration databases .
This is one of a series of Congressional Acts since 2001 that strip Americans of their basic rights under the U.S. Constitution .
Under HAVA , $ 3.9 billion was provided to states to deploy hackable computerized voting systems which obscure the vote count from the public .
How convenient for dishonest government officials and hackers .
The Big Brother scheme provides name , address , party affiliation , and vote frequency of every registered voter .
Coupling centralized , computerized voter registration databases with secret vote counting ( via machine ) is a perfect recipe for tyranny .
Stalin must be dancing in his grave over U.S. elections .
Kids of any age love to read fairy tales because the storyline never limits the possibility that anything could happen .
Curses , spells , and handsome princes reign in worlds beyond the reader ’s imagination .
But are the most magical moments from some of our favorite stories actually possible ?
Basic physical principles and recent scientific research suggest that what readers might mistake for fantasies and exaggeration could be rooted in reality .
So suspend your imagination for a moment , and look at the following fairy tales as a hard - core scientist might .
Rapunzel
In the Brothers Grimm story of Rapunzel , a witch holds a beautiful young woman captive in a tower .
Rapunzel is blessed with a lovely singing voice and long , long blond hair .
One day , her voice enchants a prince passing through a nearby forest .
They fall in love , and Rapunzel lets down her hair so that the prince may use it to climb the tower to meet her .
This chain of events begs readers to ask a question .
Can human hair support the weight of another person ?
On average one strand of hair can support about three and one - half ounces , or about the weight of two candy bars .
Each strand of dark hair is generally thicker , and therefore stronger , than blond hair .
But , alas , Rapunzel must make do with blond locks .
Given that blondes generally have about 140,000 hairs on their heads , her hair should easily support the weight of many , many princes .
However , there is more to this story .
If Rapunzel simply let down her hair and the prince started climbing immediately , her hair would not break , but it might rip out .
Also , the rest of her body might not be able to support the weight .
Thankfully , there are strategies that she can use to help reduce the strain on her head and body .
Nathan Harshman , Assistant Professor of Physics at American University in Washington , DC , suggests Rapunzel would be safer and more secure if she tied her hair around something before lowering it .
“ The whole idea is that you can use the friction of the hair against itself in the knot , and whatever it is tied around will support the weight of the prince . ”
That is a much better idea than making Rapunzel ’s scalp the anchor point .
The Little Mermaid
In the Disney version of Hans Christian Andersen ’s The Little Mermaid , Ariel ( the mermaid ) asks a witch to make her human because she has fallen in love with a human prince .
The witch bargains with Ariel and takes her voice in exchange for performing the transformation .
For a considerable part of the story Ariel cannot speak , which is a problem because the prince can only recognize her by her incredibly beautiful singing voice .
Later , she recovers her voice and wins the love of the prince ( sorry to spoil the ending ) .
In the story , Ariel loses her voice because of a curse .
However , a less skilled sorceress could use a different method to silence a singing mermaid .
Scientists have figured out a way to bend sound waves around an object and , can even prevent the escape of all sounds created inside a given area ( important for keeping a transformed , singing mermaid from being heard ) .
Recently , Steve Cummer , Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University announced that it is theoretically possible to create such a sound shield .
Building on research demonstrating how light waves can be bent around an object to make it appear invisible , Cummer and his collaborators used mathematical analysis to show how to do the same thing with sound .
They established that it is possible to create a material that bends sound waves around walls , pillars , or any enclosed area , where the sound waves emerge as if nothing had been in their way .
It would be like someone in the bedroom being able to hear what someone in the living room said , but as if there were no wall between them .
A side effect of this discovery is that sound waves generated inside the enclosed area would never escape .
If the witch had been extremely clever , she could have built this material , and there would have been no need for a curse .
Or maybe she did , and a transparent sound shield based on these principles was what enveloped Ariel until her love for the Prince melted it away , finally releasing her melodious voice for the Prince to hear .
1,001 Arabian Nights
One of the most exciting objects found in fairy tales is the flying carpet .
In tales from a wide variety of cultures , including 1,001 Arabian Nights , these tangled tapestries take flight to carry people vast distances .
Flying carpets are clearly impossible , right ?
Three scientists recently published a paper in the journal Physical Review Letters showing that there are conditions under which a carpet could fly .
They used the basic laws of physics to show that a small , thin carpet could fly if the air were vibrating at the right frequency , much like how a piece of tissue paper floats softly to the ground when it is dropped .
Their calculations showed that small waves of air in repeated fast pulses could steer a carpet at a speed of around one foot per second .
Do n’t expect to see Aladdin flying by anytime soon , but the scientists write that all of their conditions “ are within the realm of possibilities in nature and in technology .
Making a heavy carpet fly would , of course , require a much more powerful engine , and our [ calculations ] suggest it will remain in the magical , mystical , and virtual realm as it has existed for millennia . ”
Perhaps some fairy tales are more grounded in reality than others .
Or maybe these precious stories are exactly what we thought they were .
An idea is fertilized by the imagination and expanded beyond what seems possible .
Or maybe science has come so far over the years that scientists are looking beyond the problems of the physical world and into the imaginations of children for their inspiration .
What could be next ?
Perhaps a scientific debate over the temperature at which porridge is considered “ just right . ”

Hillary Clinton :
No regret on Iraq vote
' How could they have been so poorly prepared for the aftermath ? '
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said she is not sorry she voted for a resolution authorizing President Bush to take military action in Iraq despite the recent problems there but she does regret " the way the president used the authority . "
" How could they have been so poorly prepared for the aftermath of the toppling of Saddam Hussein ? " the New York Democrat asked Tuesday night on CNN's " Larry King Live . "
" I do n't understand how they had such an unrealistic view of what was going to happen . "
April has become the deadliest month for U.S. forces in Iraq since the war began more than a year ago .
The U.S. - led coalition faces insurrections on several fronts , including the Sunni Muslim stronghold of Fallujah , west of Baghdad , and the militia of a Shiite Muslim cleric in Najaf in the south .
To the disappointment of some antiwar liberals in her Democratic base , Clinton , the former first lady , voted in favor of the Iraq war resolution in October 2002 .
" Obviously , I 've thought about that a lot in the months since , " she said .
" No , I do n't regret giving the president authority because at the time it was in the context of weapons of mass destruction , grave threats to the United States , and clearly , Saddam Hussein had been a real problem for the international community for more than a decade . "
But she said the Bush administration 's short - circuiting of the U.N. weapons inspection process did n't permit " the inspectors to finish whatever task they could have accomplished to demonstrate one way or the other what was there . "
She also said the failure to plan properly for the post - war period " is the hardest to understand . "
Since the invasion of Iraq a year ago , no weapons of mass destruction have been found .
The Bush administration has cited evidence that Saddam Hussein 's regime had the capability to produce such weapons .
The lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq contradicts years of intelligence indicating Saddam had such weapons , which also was the conclusion of officials in the Clinton administration .
" The consensus was the same , from the Clinton administration to the Bush administration , " she said .
" It was the same intelligence belief that our allies and friends around the world shared .
" But I think that in the case of the [ Bush ] administration , they really believed it .
They really thought they were right , but they did n't let enough sunlight into their thinking process to really have the kind of debate that needs to take place when a serious decision occurs like that . "
She conceded that making such decisions is " very tough " for the occupant of the Oval Office .
" That 's one of the reasons why I think it 's important to have a president who asks a lot of questions , who is intellectually curious , who seeks out contrary points of view , who does n't just surround himself with people who see the world the same way , " she said .
" You have to have a decision - making process that pushes a lot of information up and asks a lot of hard questions .
You do n't get that sense from this White House . "
Clinton also said her impression of the Bush White House is that " it 's a very close - knit , quite insular team that basically talks to itself and has very strong convictions -- which is admirable -- that are not shaken by evidence or any factual differences in what they intend to do . "
On a different topic , Clinton once again eschewed any interest in the vice presidential slot on the Democratic ticket this year , saying she would turn down Sen .
John Kerry , the presumed nominee , if he asked her to be his running mate .
" I 'm so happy being senator from New York right now .
I love my life .
I love my job .
I want to see it through , " Clinton said .
" The people of New York took a chance on me , and I 'm well aware of that .
" I said I would n't run , and I really mean it .
I 'm not going to run . "
Elected in 2000 , Clinton faces re-election in 2006 .
ON Sept. 17 , Jimmy “ Jimbo ” Wales , the founding father of Wikipedia and the community ’s most celebrated member , created a one - sentence article that read as follows :
“ Mzoli ’s Meats is a butcher shop and restuarant [ sic ] located in Guguletu township near Cape Town , South Africa . ”
Twenty - two minutes later , the article was deleted from the site .
Nineteen - year - old administrator Chad Horohoe , who uses the moniker " ^demon , ” removed the entry , citing Wikipedia guideline CSD A7 ( Criteria for Speedy Deletion : Articles : No. 7 ) , which says that an article can be summarily deleted -- with no discussion or notice to the author -- if it contains “ no assertion of importance / significance . ”
Horohoe ’s unilateral decision to kill the “ Mzoli ’s ” article spawned a vehement weeklong debate in which dozens of users and administrators battled over the importance / significance of a barbecue place none of them had heard of .
Also at issue was whether the initial deletion was a deliberate dig at Wales -- perhaps in a bid for attention , or if the article was in fact pointless “ cruft , ” which , had it been written by anyone else , would ’ve been deleted without a peep , as are thousands every day .
“ Once again , people are trying to give Jimbo some god - like status and put him above the rules , ” wrote Horohoe .
“ Delete with fire , ” recommended another user .
“ If anyone but King James had started this arty it would have been cast into the memory hole within an hour .
Doubt this ?
Then test it by starting an article on a local restaurant you like and see how long it remains alive . ”
( I did test this by posting a three - sentence entry about a quirky pet store in my hometown .
It was deleted after 27 hours -- not instantaneously , as in Wales ’ case , but still pretty quickly . )
His intentions assailed , Wales deigned to enter the Mzoli ’s fray , accusing his detractors of “ shockingly bad faith behavior , ” and suggesting that some of them should “ excuse themselves from the project and find a new hobby . ”
At first blush , the Mzoli ’s debate looks like countless other kerfuffles in the minutia- obsessed Wikipedia community .
Contentious ‘ Wikipedians ’ are famous for focusing NASA - like quantities of brainpower on such marginal issues as the true height of Andre the Giant ( 7 foot 1 ? 7 - 4 ? 6 - 10 ? ) , whether Europe is “ commonly considered ” a continent and if vinegar is a fundamental ingredient of mayonnaise .
To some Wiki pundits , however , the Mzoli ’s debate was not just another pedantic back - and - forth -- it was a symptom of the growing pains now afflicting the 6 - year - old project .
Having just passed the 2 - million article mark last week , Wikipedia is not the virginal expanse it once was .
“ Of course if you start from zero like Wikipedia did in 2001 , ” said media scholar Andrew Lih , author of an upcoming book on the history of the project , “ the growth at the beginning is going to be much more rapid than it is now -- you ’re filling in articles about ‘ dog , ’ ‘ cat , ’ ‘ blanket , ’ ‘ food , ’ ‘ government . ’ ”
But as Wikipedia ’s knowledge base has expanded to cover the highest - profile people , places and things , making an original contribution becomes a lot tougher .
Wales touched on this plateau effect last year when he recommended that Wikipedia community members “ continue to turn our attention away from growth and toward quality . ”
Users may have taken Wales ’ entreaty to heart .
According to Lih , much of the editorial activity has shifted from article creation and expansion to “ deleting , pruning , citing and challenging . ”
Perhaps the granddaddy of all the Wikipedia debates is the question of which information deserves to be included , and which does n’t .
So - called Inclusionists believe that because Wikipedia is not bound by the same physical limits as a paper encyclopedia , it should n’t have the same conceptual limits either .
If there ’s room for an article on unreleased Kylie Minogue singles -- and a group of people who might find it useful -- why not include it ?
Deletionists , meanwhile , believe that because not all articles are created equal , judicious pruning increases the overall quality of Wikipedia ’s information and strengthens its reputation .
An encyclopedia , they say , is not just a dumping ground for facts .
Lih and other veteran Wikipedians , including Geoff Burling , a contributor since 2002 and author of the Wikipedia blog Original Research , see a generation gap among editors as partially responsible for the recent rise of Deletionism .
“ I think this is more of a conflict between the Wikipedians who have been part of the project for some time , ” Burling wrote in an e-mail , “ versus a group that has not been part of the project as long . ”
Most members of the old guard , he explained , had at one point or another helped delete articles that they later realized should have been kept .
“ The newer members have n’t made mistakes like this enough times to understand that caution is a virtue . ”
At the heart of the include - exclude issue is the idea of notability , which a Wikipedia policy page defines as “ worthy of notice . ”
The problem is that deciding what counts as notable -- and who gets to decide it -- is a hopelessly slippery pursuit .
We can probably all agree that the Mona Lisa , the Great Pyramids and the Pacific Ocean are notable .
But what about my pet shop ?
It ’s notable to me and the people in my neighborhood , and everyone who ’s bought a dog or a snake there .
Is n’t that enough ?
Or if you do n’t like that example , how about YouTube ’s Chris Crocker , of “ Leave Britney Alone ” fame .
An article on him was posted in July and deleted within days .
Then a second version was created Sept. 12 .
That version was also nominated for deletion , but this time , a consensus failed to emerge .
Crocker just was n’t non-notable enough anymore .
Wikirage , a new site that lists the most heavily edited recent articles , reads like a What ’s What of popular culture .
The site ’s top article last week was “ Blue Harvest , ” an exhaustively detailed entry on the sixth - season premiere of “ Family Guy . ”
Also receiving a lot of attention were “ Halo 3 " ( No. 2 ) , “ Gimme More ” ( No. 5 ) , and “ Heroes ” ( No. 8 ) .
An article on the nation “ Chad ” came in third , but only because it had been featured on Wikipedia ’s home page .
( A Wikipedia article about “ Wikirage ” has been created twice , and deleted both times , said Craig Wood , the site ’s creator . )
And though “ Blue Harvest ” raised no Deletionist hackles , articles currently on the chopping block are an entry on “ Florizel , ” a character from Shakespeare ’s “ The Winter ’s Tale ” ; an article called “ Charon in popular culture , ” which lists dozens of appearances of the grim ferryman in recent books and movies ; and even a long and thorough entry on “ the Peninsula Outlook , ” an award - winning high - school newspaper out of Gig Harbor , Wash . , that a bunch of kids clearly worked on really hard .
To be fair , Wikipedia administrators do rid the site of truckloads of needless guff .
People are constantly posting articles about their best friends , their quirky theories , their local pet stores , their short films -- most of which stand little chance of being read , except by accident .
But if even a small number of useful articles are being deleted in the name of keeping Wikipedia clean , is n’t that like allowing a few innocent men to hang in favor of a lower crime rate ?
“ Wikipedia ’s community has become so rushed , so immediatist , that it is not willing to allow embryonic articles even a tiny modicum of time to incubate , ” wrote an editor named Kelly Martin of the Mzoli ’s situation .
Ultimately , Mzoli ’s was spared .
But not until a gaggle of editors worked on expanding it from an afterthought to a more substantial portrait .
Though it ’s still just a description of an African barbecue place , it ’s difficult to see how the world would be better off without it .

GOP race in total disarray
DES MOINES , Iowa — Mike Huckabee ’s startling , not - even - close victory over Mitt Romney and the rest of the GOP field in the Iowa caucus means the Republican Party is in for a wildly unpredictable ride in the weeks ahead .
Here ’s what ’s certain : Romney ’s dethroning has created a big opening for a John McCain revival in the New Hampshire primary next Tuesday .

The Iowa results , with a victory for a populist social conservative deeply mistrusted by many people in the Republican establishment , also virtually guarantee that the nomination contest will not simply be a battle over personalities and credentials .
Instead , the race will now be a deep and probably intensely negative fight for the direction of the party in the post - Bush era .
Here ’s what still utterly uncertain :
Who will emerge from this demolition derby ?
Iowa ’s historic role is to winnow the field .
In 2008 , it has the effect of expanding the number of credible top - tier contenders .
There are now five people who can conjure at least somewhat plausible paths to the nomination .
There is Huckabee , who must now try to turn what has been a mostly personality - based campaign into an effective national organization with appeal beyond the religious conservatives who formed the basis of his victory here .
There is Romney , who now must find a new rationale for a candidacy that was based almost entirely on the prospect of scoring early victories in Iowa and New Hampshire and using them to build national momentum .
There is McCain , who has been surging in recent polls in New Hampshire — a state that is only looking more favorable for him after Romney ’s Hawkeye State humiliation .
And there is Rudy Giuliani , who did not compete seriously here and has only modest prospects in New Hampshire but remains atop many national surveys and is hoping that a fluid race will allow him to sprint from behind on the basis of a strong Super Tuesday performance on Feb .
5 .
Fred Thompson had said in recent days that he needed to come out with a second - place finish .
His third place gives him no surge of momentum and compounds his financial problems .
While some of his advisers are recommending that he exit the race , last night they said his plan for the time being is to keep his campaign going and hope for a comeback later this month when the race heads to Dixie in the South Carolina primary .
The next critical moment in this unruly contest is Saturday , when both parties will hold debates in New Hampshire .
If Huckabee ’s victory drives New Hampshire ’s powerful bloc of independent voters to McCain — who won the state in the 2000 Republican primary — McCain will be extremely difficult to beat .
If Romney loses again in New Hampshire , where he had until recently been leading , his candidacy will go on life support .
Some aides suggested that the former Massachusetts governor 's last - stand effort would be later this month in Michigan , where Romney grew up and where his father was governor in the 1960s .
But the Iowa results underscored problems of a candidate who had money , organizational skill , good looks and the support of many establishment politicians and Washington operatives .
Conservatives had questions over his consistency and qualms over his Mormon faith and a personal style that leaves many cold .
These reservations trumped what had been a skilled organization and millions of dollars spent from his own fortune on television ads — many of them unsuccessful attacks on Huckabee as outside the mainstream of conservative thinking .
Huckabee can be sure that there are more attacks ahead .
His support while governor of Arkansas for some tax increases , and other parts of his personal style and ideological positioning , make him anathema to many traditional conservatives .
He has been attacked by such figures as radio host Rush Limbaugh and National Review editor Rich Lowry .
Indeed , the weeks ahead will in some ways be a referendum on the identity of the Republican Party .
Each candidate will focus on different elements of the conservative coalition , and who wins could say much about what issues are paramount to a party in transition .
Romney will press economic and cultural issues , hoping to contrast his views with those of McCain and Huckabee on taxes on immigration and those of Giuliani on immigration and abortion rights .
Despite his moderate past , he 'll argue that to be successful the party needs a candidate who can appeal to social , economic and security conservatives .
McCain will press the importance of nominating a candidate with strong foreign policy credentials and tout his experience as a Navy pilot and senator — a direct contrast with Romney , Huckabee and Giuliani , none of whom have served and who have no experience with foreign affairs .
He 'll also play up the need for reform , making the case that a maverick , somebody who is n't afraid to go his own way and speak out , is n't such a bad thing given the straits of the party and the low view Americans hold of all politicians .
Huckabee 's message will be the most unorthodox , at least as the Bush - era GOP goes .
He 'll use class - based rhetoric to reach out to disaffected members of his party and those " Reagan Democrats " who are socially conservative but economically more populist .
But his lynchpin is social issues —
Huckabee 's success will validate the role of Christian conservatives in the GOP tent .
Giuliani is sure to play up the importance of the GOP remaining the party of strength and security in a post - Sept. 11 world .
" Security moms " are those whom he 'll target — voters who are n't motivated by the party 's conservative social dogma but who want to be kept safe .
Thompson will focus on his consistent conservative background , arguing that he meets all the Reagan criteria — and has for his entire career .
Security and cultural matters will be central in his message .
In addition to the ideological battle , there will be a sharp fight over personalities .
Promising a tough fight against McCain , Romney advisers said they will take aim at the Arizona senator as a figure of the past ( a not - so - subtle way of underscoring his age , which will be 72 by the time of the general election ) and as a creature of Washington .
" It 's change , it 's change , ” said Romney communications director Matt Rhoades .
“ It 's the future versus the past .
That 's going to be the message . "
For all the campaign ’s official brave front , there was no hiding the disappointment .
“ Just horrible , " adviser Vin Weber responded , when asked how he felt at Romney headquarters here .
" The evangelical base came out , and they all voted for [ Huckabee ] , " Weber , a former Minnesota congressman , observed .
There is no question that evangelical support — estimated by network entrance polls as 60 percent of the Republican caucus turnout — was critical to Huckabee 's victory .
But some strategists said that Huckabee has the ability to widen his support .
“ His success was also due to his appeal as an authentic and genuine candidate that connected with middle America , ” veteran conservative strategist Greg Mueller e-mailed .
“ This is an important characteristic of his campaign as it heads to New Hampshire , where [ former ] Gov.
Huckabee now needs to broaden his populist appeal by using the bully pulpit to contrast with McCain on populist themes such as his fair tax plan , immigration and fair trade .
In each of these issue areas , Huckabee can position McCain as a Washington insider that represents special interests . ”
Why Firefox 3 rocks A media heavy post to start the year !
I ’ve been using Firefox 3 beta 2 for some time now and here are my favourite features .
FF3 already rocks my socks and I ’ve a feeling that the final release is going to blow them off .
1. OS - specific UI elements
The UI now uses operating - system - specific icons , allowing it to fit right in with your OS .
This is certainly going to go some way to pacify all the Mac and Linux users out there that are n’t happy with the way FF2 fits in with their system .
Style - less form elements also inherit their look from the OS too , allowing for pages to blend right in .
This is a bit of a controversial topic — at least in my head — because I hate ambiguity ; I want things to look the same wherever they ’re rendered .
I ’ve moaned how IE , FF , Opera and Safari all have different ideas of how a default text - box should look , and each should — at the very least — allow designers to completely override them with CSS .
Thankfully , Firefox 3 does allow for complete overriding , so I ’m very happy with this feature .
2. Informative drag and drop
Now this is almost pure eye - candy but one thing I have found with Firefox in the past is that you do n’t know what you ’re dragging and dropping until you ’ve dropped it .
This was especially apparent when I moved to Linux ; I would always be missing the first letter of the line .
With FF3 , you get to see what you ’re about to drop while you ’re dragging .
It even keeps some styles in the preview — useful if you ’re dropping into rich editors .
I could n’t find a good way to show this with simple images , so the video below is a little demonstration I banged out yesterday ( about 5 megs ) :
3. Multiple improvements to the Add - on Manager
The Add - on Manager has had a plethora of updates applied to it already with more on the way .
Extensions have secure update pathways to patch a theoretical security loophole , there is a plugin tab to allow users to easily switch between plug - in versions and vendors .
One thing I particularly like about it is the constantly active restart button .
Some changes in FF2 would n’t activate the restart button , so It ’s nice to be able to do that .
4. Slimmer address - bar with added functionality
This is the central part of any browser .
Here ’s how it looks in FF3 :
So many little bits have been adjusted to make the address - bar better .
Searches your history as you type ( shown ) , variable width shared between the search bar and the address - bar , improved website identity display , bookmarking from the address - bar and tagging bookmarks .
5. Superior rendering
Cairo has replaced the renderer in FF2 , meaning — for the mostpart — that fonts and graphics are going to be rendered much smoother and faster in some cases .
There are still a few regressions in bugs and performance but the overall impression at this early beta 2 stage is it ’s going to all bells and whistles by the time this hits the release candidates .
Corner image credit : Acts of Volition .
The biggest effect this is going to have on me is the fonts .
FF2 fonts in Linux used to blow .
Jaunty and jagged — like FF2 for Linux never heard of antialiasing but just check out this zoomed comparison between FF2 and FF3b2 :
FF2 renders like a stale cheddar while FF3 resembles a soft and creamy goat ’s cheese .
Much nicer !
And there ’s one more thing …
Well closer to a dozen new things :
The new download manager .
Improved CSS handling ( Acid2 ) .
Performance improvements .
The new bookmark and history manager .
Support for remote bookmarking ( delicious , etc ) add - ons .
Much improved printing .
A new crash - handler .
A new installer for Windows .
Improvement to tabs .
And that ’s not mentioning the things that are on the feature plan not introduced yet : integration with OpenID / Cardspace / al , offline - file handling (! ) allowing you to open your documents with online web - services through Weave , parental controls and , no doubt , a lot more .
Firefox ’s ability to annihilate all the competition relies strongly upon Weave .
The ability to seamlessly interact with your documents online without platform restrictions is going to turn a lot of heads , especially in the enterprise market that stand to save thousands migrating to cheaper online solutions .
But even if Weave does n’t make the final cut , FF3 is going to be a very strong release , forging the way forward all browserkind .
Bonus : about : config protection
about : config is the back door to all of Firefox ’s settings .
It ’s really useful for tweaking some aspects to your needs but as with any all - encompassing configuration screen , you have the very real risk that you could knacker your profile .
Mozilla have put the following screen in to inform users of this :
It ’s not going to bring us world peace , but it might stop enthusiastic amateurs knackering Firefox =)
It ’s easy to believe that social tagging started with del.icio.us and social voting started with digg .
However , Xerox PARC had developed such functions in a system called Tapestry more than 15 years ago .
The system was described in a 1992 Communications of the ACM article .
( Official ACM link here .
A “ publicly ” available pdf version here .
A slide presentation here . )
From the article :
“ The Tapestry system was designed and built to support collaborative filtering .
Collaborative filtering simply means that people collaborate to help one another perform filtering by recording their reactions to documents they read .
Such reactions may be that a document was particularly interesting ( or particularly uninteresting ) .
These reactions , more generally called annotations , can be accessed by others ’ filters . ”
( Emphasis theirs . )
This paper , in fact , was the first to coin the term ‘ collaborative filtering , ’ which over the years had evolved to mean the special case of automated recommendation using implicit feedback ( i.e. Amazon style ) .
Tapestry was architected for the general case .
It assumed that “ some annotations are themselves complex objects , and those annotations are more simply stored as separate records with pointers back to the document they annotate . ”
This design would sound familiar to anyone who had implemented a “ modern ” social tagging and voting system .
See , for example , the design of Askeet .
It ’s interesting to read a paper from 15 years ago and get some historical perspective .
Xerox PARC had gotten the skeleton design of Web 2.0 functions before there was Web 1.0 !
It ’s always amusing to read things like this too :
“ Filtering on incoming documents is a very computationally intensive task .
Imagine a Tapestry system with hundreds of users , each with dozens of filter queries , running on a document stream of tens of documents per minute . ”
Yeah …
We all need to thank the electrical engineers that make Moore ’s law a reality …

A $ 672 electric car , built by two DIYers
What do you get when you cross a Geo Metro with an electric forklift , a golf cart , and a bunch of used batteries ?
You get the “ ForkenSwift ” ( see web site ) , a ridiculously inexpensive , home - built , street - legal electric car .
This battery powered grocery getter was built by Darin Cosgrove and Ivan Limburg , of Brockville , Ontario .
The friends were looking for a project to do in Limburg ’s new workshop , and set their sights on building an EV after reading about a couple of DIY electric car conversions on the web .
Since neither of them had tackled anything quite like this before , they were wary of breaking the bank on what amounted to a rolling science project with a questionable outcome .
So they bought all their parts & supplies second hand , and scrounged a few for free .
They even recovered some of their costs by selling left over parts as they went along …
They sold the Geo ’s engine and its recently replaced gas tank through an online ad – you do n’t need either of those in an EV !
Most of the electric parts came from an old , used forklift they bought for $ 500 .
After removing its four DC motors and control module , they got most of their money back by selling the 16,000 lb chassis to a metal recycler , and one of the extra motors to another EV builder .
They caught a big break when it came time to get the car ’s lead acid batteries .
“ We met another EV owner who liked what we were doing , so he gave us a bunch of used batteries he had just replaced in his own EV , ” says Cosgrove .
But the second hand lead has a downside : they probably could have doubled the distance the car could go on a charge if they had bought new .
The Metro ’s small 48 volt battery pack is a major clue as to how they were able to keep costs so low : Cosgrove and Limburg built the car with ridiculously modest specs .
With just eight 6 volt batteries and a motor controller from a golf cart , it ’s an understatement to say the electric Metro does n’t go very fast or very far .
But they say it does just fine as a neighbourhood runabout on the quiet streets of their small city .
And by aiming low , they were able to avoid the pricier components and extra batteries needed for a more powerful , highway capable EV .
Their forklift motor driven Metro passed inspection and went on the road a few months ago .
Since then it has gone more than 650 kilometers ( 400 miles ) without using a drop of gas … or oil ( hey – it was a 16 year old Geo engine after all ) .
Cosgrove reports a top speed of 65 km/h ( 40 mph ) , a range of 15 to 25 km ( 9 to 15 miles ) on a charge , and says it costs about 3 cents per km ( 4.8 cents per mile ) to run on renewably sourced , clean electricity .
( For comparison , Limburg figures his gasoline powered compact pickup truck costs 12 cents per km to drive . )
While it ’s fair to say the electric Metro ’s performance wo n’t cause any worry over at Tesla Motors , you can also be sure its builders are n’t losing much sleep about car payments either .

Uniquely - decodable codes
Ricardo J.B.
Signes asked me a few days ago if there was a way to decide whether a given set S of strings had the property that any two distinct sequences of strings from S have distinct concatenations .
For example , consider S 1 = { " ab " , " abba " , " b " } .
This set does not have the specified property , because you can take the two sequences [ " ab " , " b " , " ab " ] and [ " abba " , " b " ] , and both concatenate to " abbab " .
But S 2 = { " a " , " ab " , " abb " } does have this property .
Coding theory
In coding theory , the property has the awful name " unique decodability " .
The idea is that you have some input symbols , and each input symbol is represented with one output symbol , which is one of the strings from S .
Then suppose you receive some message like " abbab " .
Can you figure out what the original input was ?
For S 2 , yes : it must have been ZY .
But for S 1 , no : it could have been either YZ or XZX .
In coding theory , the strings are called " code words " and the set of strings is a " code " .
So the question is how to tell whether a code is uniquely - decodable .
One obvious way to take a non-uniquely - decodable code and turn it into a uniquely - decodable code is to append delimiters to the code words .
Consider S 1 again .
If we delimit the code words , it becomes { " ( ab ) " , " ( abba ) " , " ( b ) " } , and the two problem sequences are now distinguishable , since " ( ab ) ( b ) ( ab ) " looks nothing like " ( abba ) ( b ) " .
It should be clear that one does n't need to delimit both ends ; the important part is that the words are separated , so one could use { " ab - " , " abba - " , " b- " } instead , and the problem sequences translate to " ab - b - ab - " and " abba - b - " .
So every non-uniquely - decodable code corresponds to a uniquely - decodable code in at least this trivial way , and often the uniquely - decodable property is not that important in practice because you can guarantee uniquely - decodableness so easily just by sticking delimiters on the code words .
But if you do n't want to transmit the extra delimiters , you can save bandwidth by making your code uniquely - decodable even without delimiters .
The delimiters are a special case of a more general principle , which is that a prefix code is always uniquely - decodable .
A prefix code is one where no code word is a prefix of another .
Or , formally , there are no code words x and y such that x = ys for some nonempty s.
Adding the delimiters to a code turns it into a prefix code .
But not all prefix codes have delimiters .
{ " a " , " ba " , " bba " , " bbba " } is an example , as are { " aa " , " ab " , " ba " , " bb " } and { " a " , " baa " , " bab " , " bb " } .
The proof of this is pretty simple : you have some concatenation of code words , say T .
You can decode it as follows :
Find the unique code word c such that c is a prefix of T ; that is , such that T = cU .
There must be such a c , because T is a concatenation of code words .
And c must be unique , because if there were c' and U ' with both cU = T and c' U ' = T , then cU = c' U ' , and whichever of c or c ' is shorter must be a prefix of the one that is longer , and that can't happen because this is a prefix code .
So c is the first code word in T , and we can pull it off and repeat the process for U , getting a unique sequence of code words , unless U is empty , in which case we are done .
There is a straightforward correspondence between prefix codes and trees ; the code words can be arranged at the leaves of a tree , and then to decode some concatenation T you can scan its symbols one at a time , walking the tree , until you get to a leaf , which tells you which code word you just saw .
This is the basis of Huffman coding .
Prefix codes include , as a special case , codes where all the words are the same length .
For those codes , the tree is balanced , and has all branches the same length .
But uniquely - decodable codes need not be prefix codes .
Most obviously , a suffix code is uniquely - decodable and may not be a prefix code .
For example , { " a " , " aab " , " bab " , " bb " } is uniquely - decodable but is not a prefix code , because " a " is a prefix of " aab " .
The proof of uniquely - decodableness is obvious : this is just the last prefix code example from before , with all the code words reversed .
If there were two sequences of words with the same concatenation , then the reversed sequences of reversed words would also have the same concatenation , and this would show that the code of the previous paragraph was not uniquely - decodable .
But that was a prefix code , and so must be uniquely - decodable .
But codes can be uniquely - decodable without being either prefix or suffix codes .
For example , { " aabb " , " abb " , " bb " , " bbba " } is uniquely - decodable but is neither a prefix nor a suffix code .
Rik wanted a method for deciding .
I told Rik about the prefix code stuff , which at least provides a sufficient condition for uniquely - decodableness , and then started poking around to see what else I could learn .
Ahem , I mean , researching .
I suppose that a book on elementary coding theory would have a discussion of the problem , but I did n't have one at hand , and all I could find online concerned prefix codes , which are of more practical interest because of the handy tree method for speedy decoding .
But after tinkering with it for a couple of days ( and also making an utterly wrong intermediate guess that it was undecidable , based on a surface resemblance to the Post correspondence problem ) I did eventually figure out an algorithm , which I wrote up and released on CPAN , my first CPAN post in about a year and a half .
An example The idea is pretty simple , and I think best illustrated by an example , as so many things are .
We will consider { " ab " , " abba " , " b " } again .
We want to find two sequences of code words whose concatenations are the same .
So say we want pX 1 = qY 1 , where p and q are code words and X 1 and Y 1 are some longer strings .
This can only happen if p and q are different lengths and if one is a prefix of the other , since otherwise the two strings pX 1 and qY 1 do n't begin with the same symbols .
So we consider just the cases where p is a prefix of q , which means that in this example we want to find " ab " X 1 = " abba " Y 1 , or , equivalently , X 1 = " ba " Y 1 .
Now X 1 must begin with " ba " , so we need to either find a code word that begins with " ba " , or we need to find a code word that is a prefix of " ba " .
The only choice is " b " , so we have X 1 = " b " X 2 , and so X 1 = " b " X 2 = " ba " Y 1 , or equivalently , X 2 = " a " Y 1 .
Now X 2 must begin with " a " , so we need to either find a code word that begins with " a " , or we need to find a code word that is a prefix of " a " .
This occurs for " abba " and " ab " .
So we now have two situations to investigate : " ab " X 3 = " a " Y 1 , and " abba " X 4 = " a " Y 1 .
Or , equivalently , " b " X 3 = Y 1 , and " bba " X 4 = Y 1 .
The first of these , " b " X 3 = Y 1 wins immediately , because " b " is a code word : we can take X 3 to be empty , and Y 1 to be " b " , and we have what we want : " ab " X 1 = " abba " Y 1 " ab " " b " X 2 = " abba " Y 1 " ab " " b " " ab " X 3 = " abba " Y 1 " ab " " b " " ab " = " abba " " b " where the last line of the table is exactly the solution we seek .
Following the other one , " bba " X 4 = Y 1 , fails , and in a rather interesting way .
Y 1 must begin with two " b " words , so put " bb " Y 2 = Y 1 , so " bba " X 4 = " bb " Y 2 , then " a " X 4 = Y 2 .
But this last equation is essentially the same as the X 2 = " a " Y 1 situation we were investigating earlier ; we are just trying to make two strings that are the same except that one has an extra " a " on the front .
So this investigation tells us that if we could find two strings with " a " X = Y , we could make longer strings " abba " Y = " b " " b " " a " X .
This may be interesting , but it does not help us find what we really want .
The algorithm Having seen an example , here 's the description of the algorithm .
We will tabulate solutions to Xs = Y , where X and Y are sequences of code words , for various strings s.
If s is empty , we win .
We start the tabulation by looking for pairs of keywords c 1 and c 2 with c 1 a prefix of c 2 , because then we have c 1 s = c 2 for some s.
We maintain a queue of s-values to investigate .
At one point in our example , we had X 1 = " ba " Y 1 ; here s is " ba " .
If s begins with a code word , then s = cs ' , so we can put s' on the queue .
This is what happened when we went from X 1 = " ba " Y 1 to " b " X 2 = " ba " Y 1 to X 2 = " a " Y 1 .
Here s was " ba " and s ' was " a " .
If s is a prefix of some code word , say ss ' = c , then we can also put s' on the queue .
This is what happened when we went from X 2 = " a " Y 1 to " abba " X 4 = " a " Y 1 to " bba " X 4 = Y 1 .
Here s was " a " and s ' was " bba " .
If we encounter some queue item that we have seen before , we can discard it ; this will prevent us from going in circles .
If the next queue item is the empty string , we have proved that the code is not uniquely - decodable .
( Alternatively , we can stop just before queueing the empty string . )
If the queue is empty , we have investigated all possibilities and the code is uniquely - decodable .
Pseudocode
Here 's the summary : Initialization :
For each pair of code words c 1 and c 2 with c 1 s = c 2 , put s in the queue .
Main loop : Repeat the following until termination
If the queue is empty , terminate .
The code is uniquely - decodable .
Otherwise : Take an item s from the queue .
For each code word c :
If c = s , terminate .
The code is not uniquely - decodable .
If cs ' = s , and s ' has not been seen before , queue s' .
If c = ss ' , and s' has not been seen before , queue s' .
To this we can add a little bookkeeping so that the algorithm emits the two ambiguous sequences when the code is not uniquely - decodable .
The implementation I wrote uses a hash to track which strings s have appeared in the queue already .
Associated with each string s in the hash are two sequences of code words , P and Q , such that Ps = Q .
When s begins with a code word , so that s = cs ' , the program adds s' to the hash with the two sequences [ P , c ] and Q .
When s is a prefix of a code word , so that ss ' = c , the program adds s' to the hash with the two sequences Q and [ P , c ] ; the order of the sequences is reversed in order to maintain the Ps = Q property , which has become Qs ' = Pss ' =
Pc in this case .
Notes
As I said , I suspect this is covered in every elementary coding theory text , but I could n't find it online , so perhaps this writeup will help someone in the future .
After solving this problem I meditated a little on my role in the programming community .
The kind of job I did for Rik here is a familiar one to me .
When I was in college , I was the math guy who hung out in the computer lab with the hackers .
Periodically one of them would come to me with some math problem : " Crash , I am writing a ray tracer .
If I have a ray and a triangle in three dimensions , how can I figure out if the ray intersects the triangle ? "
And then I would go off and figure out how to do that and come back with the algorithm , perhaps write some code , or perhaps provide some instruction in matrix computations or whatever was needed .
In physics class , I partnered with Jim Kasprzak , a physics major , and we did all the homework together .
We would read the problem , which would be some physics thing I had no idea how to solve .
But Jim understood physics , and could turn the problem from physics into some mathematics thing that he had no idea how to solve .
Then I would do the mathematics , and Jim would turn my solution back into physics .
I wish I could make a living doing this .
Puzzle : Is { " ab " , " baab " , " babb " , " bbb " , " bbba " } uniquely - decodable ?
If not , find a pair of sequences that concatenate to the same string .
Research question :
What 's the worst - case running time of the algorithm ?
The queue items are all strings that are strictly shorter than the longest code word , so if this has length n , then the main loop of the algorithm runs at most ( an - 1 ) / ( a - 1 ) times , where a is the number of symbols in the alphabet .
But can this worst case really occur , or is the real worst case much faster ?
In practice the algorithm always seems to complete very quickly .
Project to do : Reimplement in Haskell .
Compare with Perl implementation .
Meditate on how they can suck in such completely different ways . [
There is a brief followup to this article . ] [ Addendum 20170318 : Marius Buzea has brought to my attention that this is exactly the Sardinas - Patterson Algorithm .

Judith Regan , the former book publisher , says in a lawsuit filed today protesting her dismissal by the News Corporation , the media conglomerate , that a senior executive there encouraged her to lie to federal investigators about her past affair with Bernard B. Kerik after he had been nominated to become homeland security secretary in late 2004 .
The lawsuit asserts that the News Corporation executive wanted to protect the presidential aspirations of Rudolph W. Giuliani , Mr. Kerik ’s mentor , who had appointed him New York City police commissioner and had recommended him for the federal post .
Ms. Regan makes the charge at the start of a 70 - page filing that seeks $ 100 million in damages for what she says was a campaign to smear and discredit her by her bosses at HarperCollins and its parent company , News Corporation , after her project to publish a book with O.J. Simpson was abandoned amid a storm of protest .
In the civil complaint filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan , Ms. Regan says the company has long sought to promote Mr. Giuliani ’s ambitions .
But the lawsuit does not elaborate on that charge , identify the executive who she says pressured her to mislead investigators , or offer details to support her claim .
Democrats wound down the first half of the 110th Congress this week claiming they had made a " down payment " on the " new direction " they promised America when they took control of the House and Senate this year .
Results this year include the first minimum wage increase in 10 years , the biggest hike in college aid since the GI bill , lobby and ethics reform , and an energy policy overhaul that leverages conservation .
Although the signature issues of the new majority – changing course in the Iraq war and pledging to pay for all new spending and tax cuts – hit major setbacks this week , Democrats are quietly shifting the agenda on Capitol Hill on issues ranging from oversight to domestic priorities .
" Although the way the Democrats are going out is not pretty , the most significant thing that 's happened is the resurgence of oversight , " says Norman Ornstein , a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute .
" That means not just ' gotcha ' stuff , although it does include a very significant amount of investigative work .
It 's also genuine oversight of programs and agencies , and a significant part of it is coming in a bipartisan fashion . "
Congressional probes into the firing of eight US attorneys last year helped force the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales this year .
Oversight of the war in Iraq , including the role of private contractors , ramped up considerably under Democratic control of Congress .
" Republicans did n't do enough oversight of the war .
It did n't take much for Democrats to do better , " says eight - term Rep. Michael Castle ( R ) of Delaware .
In the final standoff with the White House this week over funding for fiscal year 2008 , Democrats backed off their goal of $ 22 billion in additional spending and largely accepted the President Bush 's spending caps .
But they also reworked spending requests to reflect their own domestic priorities .
This included $ 767 million more than the president requested for K - 12 education , $ 1.7 billion more for Pell Grants for college costs , $ 607 million more for medical research , $ 1.2 billion for local law enforcement , and $ 1 billion to make bridges safer .
But these victories were eclipsed by big losses on top priorities of the new majority .
Congress wound down the year with votes to give Mr. Bush $ 70 billion in war funding , without conditions , and to shield at least 22 million taxpayers from the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) , without finding the $ 50 billion to pay for it .
Both decisions were made under the gun of deadlines that Democrats could not control .
Without congressional action on emergency funding , the Pentagon said it would have had to begin sending out furlough notices to some 100,000 civilian employees this week .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had pledged to allow no more votes on war funding this year , after the White House rejected war funding with conditions .
In the end , the Pentagon 's pink slips would have been " too hard for some people to explain in certain parts of the country , " she said in a briefing with reporters on the eve of the vote .
Reluctantly , House Democratic leaders allowed a floor vote on the measure , which the Senate had attached to the $ 555 billion domestic spending bill for fiscal year 2008 .
It passed Wednesday by a vote of 272 to 142 , with more than half of House Democrats , including Speaker Pelosi , voting against it .
But Democrats note that the $ 70 billion measure is still far short of the nearly $ 200 billion that Bush requested last spring .
" Even the Republicans in the Senate , who stick so closely with the president on the issue , have decided to put him on a short leash , " Pelosi said .
" People want to hold him more accountable . "
Similarly , time constraints played a role in forcing Democrats to yield ground to the White House over the AMT fix .
Bush said that he would veto any tax increases to pay for the AMT patch , and Republicans backed him .
Without action on the AMT before Congress recessed for the holidays , some 22 million taxpayers would face an average of $ 2,000 in higher taxes – and at least 50 million taxpayers would face delays in processing 2007 tax returns , the Treasury Department says .
" It 's a sad day , " said Rep. Allen Boyd ( D ) of Florida , a co-chair of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition , commenting on the Senate 's failure to pass offsets for the AMT , forcing the House to go along .
" There are those of us who want to pay the bills and be fiscally responsible , but we can't get it by the Senate .
We can't change course until we get a new president . "
Senate Republicans mounted a record 61 filibusters this year that derailed many of the majority 's priorities .
But Democrats say these losses could help increase their majority in the 2008 elections – and ensure that a Democrat wins the White House .
" I want to assure you that what has happened this year has paved the way for much more dramatic change , because the Republican senators are filibustering themselves out of their seats , " says Sen. Charles Schumer ( D ) of New York , who directs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .

House leaders plan to force a vote as early as Thursday on holding Joshua B. Bolten , White House chief of staff , and Harriet E. Miers , former White House counsel , in contempt of Congress .
Senior Congressional officials said the House leadership had essentially decided to go ahead with the vote , which is expected to spark a fight with Republicans over what they see as a politically inspired inquiry .
The contempt citation , approved in July by the Judiciary Committee on a party - line vote , stems from the refusal of the two to testify before the panel in the investigation into whether several United States attorneys were dismissed for political reasons .

When eBay announced changes to its fee structure and feedback system a couple weeks ago , we expected a modest dip in eBay activity :
We heard from hundreds of emotional sellers who told us they were closing their eBay shops and moving to other sites .
" This is the last straw , " we heard over , and over again .
Well , it appears that even if eBay burned many of its U.S. merchants , the global majority of eBay sellers are willing to stick it out .
Listings for the first quarter thus far are up 12 percent , year - over - year , according to American Technology Research analyst Tim Boyd .
Here 's the catch : Listings in the core U.S. market are down 6 percent , year - over - year , while international listings are up 27 percent , according to Boyd .

Theshow kicked off November sweeps with a titillating two - part series featuring allegations of sexual misconduct and lie detector " tests . "
Titled " Teacher Sex Scandal , " the series aired 1 - 2 November 2007 and centered around the case of Joelle Marie Ogletree , a Glen Rose , Texas high school French teacher who was fired in 2002 and later criminally prosecuted after three students alleged that she had engaged in sexual acts with them .
( A comment by " beinformed " on the Somervell County Salon blog alleges that all three boys passed polygraph tests at the time . )
A mistrial was declared when one of the students recanted his allegations , and charges were dismissed .
In 2006 , the Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings cleared Ogletree of all allegations of sexual misconduct in rejecting a motion by the staff of the Texas Education Agency to revoke her teaching license .
( See attached decision .)
One of Ogletree 's accusers was willing to speak with theshow and submit to a lie detector test on the condition that his name and face not be aired .
However , as reported by the Somervell County Salon blog , the accuser 's name is Chayce Wilson .
Theshow hired retired FBI polygrapher William K. Teigen of Dallas to conduct the polygraph test : Teigen asked Wilson the following relevant questions : Teigen found Chayce Wilson deceptive with regard to all three relevant questions .
Wilson , however , in a recorded telephone conversation with Dr. Phil McGraw , maintained his truthfulness .
On a side note , it also apparent that Teigen , who uses a computerized Axciton polygraph instrument , did not use a sensor pad or strain gauge , devices that are increasingly used in an attempt to detect polygraph countermeasures .
Chayce Wilson agreed to meet with Teigen to discuss the results , perhaps foreshadowing a follow - up episode to come .
Dr. Phil mentions that he had invited Joelle Ogletree to take a polygraph test , but that she had declined .
Ogletree 's lawyer explained her refusal saying that she had already been cleared of the accusations and had previously passed a polygraph test .
In the second part of the two - part series ( which was filmed the same day as the first ) , a second accuser , Matthew Brooks ( whose last name was not mentioned on the show ) , came on the show : Brooks was administered a polygraph examination by retired FBI polygrapher Jack Trimarco , who asked the following relevant questions : Trimarco judged Brooks deceptive with regard to both relevant questions .
Despite Trimarco 's accusation of deception , Brooks continued to maintain his truthfulness .
In an apparent attempt to impeach Brooks ' credibility , Trimarco interrupted to interrogate Brooks about the probable - lie control questions that he used in the polygraph examination .
Control questions are ones to which polygraphers secretly expect all examinees to lie -- even those who answer the relevant questions truthfully .
Polygraphers typically maneuver examinees into a denial and cut off admissions .
( For a fuller explanation , see Chapter 3 ofSo it is intellectually dishonest to use an examinee 's denials in response to control questions to impeach the examinee 's credibility with regard to relevant questions .
In the end , as in previousepisodes , polygraph testing , which in any event has no scientific basis , provided no resolution of the issues involved in the case .
Given the available case documentation , it is not surprising that Teigen and Trimarco would have respectively found Wilson and Brooks to be deceptive .
But if both of the latter ( not to mention the 3rd accuser who recanted ) earlierlie detector tests regarding their accusations , what does this tell us about the reliability of the polygraph ?
Dr. Phil McGraw does the public a disservice by suggesting that lie detector testing is somehow to be relied upon in such matters .
His use of the lie detector -- almost always in connection with unsubstantiated allegations of a sexual nature -- is a transparent ratings gimmick .

Blackwater dropped blinding tear gas on Iraqis , US soldiers in 2005 John Byrne
Published : Thursday January 10 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Blackwater security contractors employed in Iraq dropped a blinding riot - control gas on Iraqi civilians and US military personnel on a busy Baghdad street in May 2005 , according to the reporter who first broke the NSA wiretapping scandal in the New York Times .
" The copter dropped CS gas , a riot - control substance the American military in Iraq can use only under the strictest conditions and with the approval of top military commanders , " James Risen writes .
" An armored vehicle on the ground also released the gas , temporarily blinding drivers , passers - by and at least 10 American soldiers operating the checkpoint . "
CS gas -- 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile -- is among the most common tear gases used by law enforcement and militaries in conflict zones .
Use of CS gas in war is prohibited by the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention ( signed in 1993 ) , as it could trigged retaliation with more toxic substances such as nerve gas .
" A 1975 presidential order allows their use by the United States military in war zones under limited defensive circumstances and only with the approval of the president or a senior officer designated by the president , " the Times notes .
" The chemical reacts with moisture on the skin and in the eyes causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes , " the entry adds .
" Reported effects can include tears streaming from the eyes , running nose full of mucus , burning in the nose and throat areas , disorientation , dizziness and restricted breathing .
In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting . "
The revelation raises new questions about the purview of private security contractors in Iraq and how much authority they have to exercise military - like action without following the rules of engagement or international treaties that the Pentagon requires its troops to follow .
About 10 American troops and several Iraqis on foot and in vehicles were exposed .
" None of the American soldiers exposed to the chemical , which is similar to tear gas , required medical attention , and it is not clear if any Iraqis did , " Risen adds .
 This was decidedly uncool and very , very dangerous ,  Capt .
Kincy Clark of the Army , the senior officer at the scene , wrote later that day , Risen said .
 It s not a good thing to cause soldiers who are standing guard against car bombs , snipers and suicide bombers to cover their faces , choke , cough and otherwise degrade our awareness .
However , a Blackwater spokesman claimed that the releasing of the gas was a mistake , and that the Department of Defense already investigated the incident , even though the paper reported that military officials in Iraq and D.C. could not confirm that .

NEW � YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The collapse in home building continued in October as single - family home starts fell to a 16 - year low and permits for all types of new homes dropped to levels not seen since 1993 , according to the government 's latest reading on the state of the battered home building market released Tuesday .
While overall housing starts edged up to an annual rate of 1.23 million from 1.19 million in September , topping forecasts , that was due to a blip of sorts , a 46 percent spike in the more volatile starts in buildings with five or more housing units .
By comparison , the start of single family homes fell 7.3 percent to an annual rate of 884,000 , the lowest level since October 1991 .
While there were month - to - month gains in single family starts in the Northeast and Midwest , the South , which accounts for nearly half of all new home sales , saw starts fall nearly 20 percent from September ; they are now down 31 percent from year - earlier levels .
" The large declines in single - family starts and permits clearly show that this component of the housing market still is weakening seriously , " said David Seiders , chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders ( NAHB ) .
Permits , a less weather - impacted measure of building strength that is used to gauge builders ' confidence in the market , fell 6.6 percent to an annual pace of 1.18 million from 1.26 million in September .
That fell short of a 1.2 million rate economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast .
Permits for single family homes fell 8 percent from October .
" It 's unreasonable for builders to build with gusto when they 're staring at an 11 - month supply of houses on the market , " said Mike Schenk , senior economist , Credit Union National Association .
" If you like bad news and gloom and doom , keep reading these reports . "
A cutback in the pace of home building in recent months has been a drag on the nation 's overall economy .
But it is seen as a necessary step to work through a record glut of completed new homes available for sale on the market .
" Builders continue to do what they absolutely have to do in this market downturn , " said Brian Catalde , NAHB president and a home builder from El Segundo , Calif .
" They are repositioning themselves for the market 's eventual recovery by cutting back on production and working down their inventories . "
The report comes a day after the NAHB 's survey of members ' confidencematched a record low level .
And it follows a report earlier Tuesday that D.R. Horton , the nation 's No. 3 home builder by revenue , reported a loss in its most recent quarter on a 35 percent drop in sales .
Of the nation 's largest home builders , only luxury home builder Toll Brothers ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , No. 6 in terms of revenue , has yet to report a quarterly loss in the current downturn - and analysts are forecasting a loss for its just completed period after preliminary results showed a sharp drop in the number of homes sold and an even steeper decline in prices .
The five larger builders all reported much larger - than - forecast losses in their most recent financial periods .
Earlier this month Hovnanian Enterprises ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's No. 7 builder by revenue , reported that the sales pace during October " significantly deteriorated " compared with recent months in most of its markets , and its preliminary results also showed a sharp rise in cancellations .
In October , credit rating agency Moody 's downgraded the debt of No. 1 home builder Lennar ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , No. 2 Centex ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and No. 4 Pulte Homes ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) to junk bond status .

It has become a mantra of sorts among the faltering Republican candidates : Victory is at hand in Iraq .
Mitt Romney , in particular , has taken to so openly embracing the “ success ” of the U.S. troop “ surge ” that it has become the centerpiece of his litany of attacks on the Democratic front - runner , Hillary Clinton .
“ Think of what ’s happened this year , ” Romney recently implored a crowd in Iowa .
“ General [ David ]
Petraeus came in to report to Congress and Hillary Clinton said she could n’t believe him .
She said she just could n’t believe General Petraeus .
Now think about that .
He ’s been proven to be right .
He should be on the cover , by the way , of Time magazine , and not Putin . ”
About the Author
Scott Ritter
A former Marine Corps intelligence officer , Scott Ritter was a chief inspector for the United Nations Special Commission in Iraq from 1991 until 1998 .
He is the author of several books ; “ Target Iran , ” with a new afterword by the author , was recently released in paperback by Nation Books .
For more on Scott Ritter , including his previous Truthdig columns , click here .
Clinton , for her part , has stood her ground .
Addressing a crowd of voters in Iowa , she took a swipe back at Romney : “ We all know the Republican candidates are just plain wrong when they declare mission accomplished about the troop surge . ”
She went on to note that U.S. casualty figures in Iraq for 2007 were at an all - time high , and that for all of the positive reports concerning the surge , Iraq remains a nation on the verge of a civil war , no closer today to a political solution than it was before the escalation .
She promised that , if nominated , “ I will not hesitate to go toe to toe with Republicans in the debates to end the war as quickly and responsibly as possible . ”
Therein lies the catch .
How does Clinton explain her commitment to quick and responsible withdrawal in the context of the short - term reduction of violence in Iraq achieved by the surge ?
How does she propose to rectify the admitted internal shortcomings inside Iraq , which she likens to near - civil war conditions , with her pledge for a “ responsible ” withdrawal ?
If one takes at face value the alleged successes of the surge , it is difficult to justify the embrace of an alternative policy option .
Likewise , if one chooses to criticize the surge as all smoke and mirrors , as Clinton has , and yet argues for a quick and responsible end to the war in Iraq without revealing the details of how this would be accomplished , the rhetoric comes across as remarkably shallow .
I ’m not one inclined to speak out in support of Hillary Clinton .
She made her bed with Iraq , and she should now be forced to sleep in it .
However , she is right that nothing the surge has accomplished so far remotely approaches a solution to these enormously destabilizing realities : a largely disaffected Sunni population which finds the current Shiite - dominated government of Iraq fundamentally unacceptable ; a decisively fractured Shiite population torn between an Iranian - dominated government on the one hand ( controlled by the political proxies of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , SCIRI , itself an Iranian proxy ) or an indigenous firebrand , Muqtada al - Sadr ; and a false paradise in Kurdistan , where the dream of an independent Kurdish homeland corrupts a viable Kurdish autonomy and threatens regional instability by provoking Turkish military intervention .
“ Quickly and responsibly ” ?
The problem with Clinton is that when it comes to Iraq , she is as shallow as the next candidate , and once one gets past her flowery rhetoric and protestations of expertise , it becomes crystal clear that she , like almost everyone else in the presidential race from either party , has n’t a clue about what is really happening on the ground in Iraq .
There are , in fact , five Iraqs that must be dealt with by a singular American policy .
The first is the Iraq of the Green Zone , and by that I mean the Iraqi government brought about by the “ purple finger revolution ” of January 2005 .
Those sham elections produced a sham democracy which lacks any viability outside of the never - never land of the U.S. - controlled Green Zone .
This lack of centralized authority has led some , like Sen. Joe Biden and the U.S. Senate , to advocate the division of Iraq into three de facto states , one Sunni , one Shiite and one Kurdish , lumped together in a loose federation overseen by a weak central authority .
Given that the 2005 elections were designed to prevent this very sort of Iraqi breakup to begin with , one can begin to understand the fallacy of any policy that contradicts the very foundation upon which it is built .
But this sort of behavior defines the entire Iraq fiasco , one contradiction built upon another , until there has been woven a web of contradictions from which no clarity can ever be found .
That , in a sentence , is the reality of the current Iraqi government .
It is almost as if by design the Bush administration has cobbled together a wreck incapable of governance .
How does Hillary Clinton propose to deal “ quickly and responsibly ” with such a mess ?
The second Iraq is the one being managed from Tehran .
This Iraq , stretching from Basra in the south up into Baghdad , exists outside of the reach of the compromised disaster that is the current government of Iraq , and is instead dominated by SCIRI and its military wing , the Badr Brigade .
Here one finds the unvarnished reality of the dream of the pro-Iranian Iraqi Shiites , those who reached political maturity festering in the anti-Saddam ideology cooked up in the theocracy of Iran .
Given the roots of this political movement , bred and paid for by the reactionary mullahs of Iran , the politics of revenge that it embraces should come as no surprise .
However , whereas the mullahs in Tehran seek long - term political stability guaranteed by a friendly , compliant government in Baghdad , the Iranian - backed Iraqi Shiites seem more focused on rapidly reversing decades of inequities , real and perceived .
Revenge is not a policy that breeds stability , and yet it is the politics of revenge that dominates the mind - set of SCIRI .
Serving as a major domestic counterweight to SCIRI is the indigenous grass - roots Iraqi Shiite movement controlled by Muqtada al - Sadr , the third Iraq .
Possessing similar geographic reach as SCIRI , the Iraq of the “ Mahdi Army ” is one which rejects the SCIRI proxy government operating out of the Green Zone as but a tool of the American occupation , and the SCIRI movement itself as a tool of Iran .
While maintaining close relations with Tehran , al - Sadr mocks those who would govern in south Iraq as having Farsi , vice Arabic , as their first tongue .
The movement headed by al - Sadr bases its credibility on its pure Iraqi roots , derived as it is from the Shiites of Iraq who actually lived under the rule of Saddam Hussein .
Surprisingly , these Shiites are more inclined to find common cause with their fellow Iraqis , including Sunnis who are disaffected with the current government , than with their SCIRI co-religionists .
While much has been made of the Sunni - Shiite divide , the fact is that one of the most serious threats to stability in Iraq is the emerging Shiite - versus - Shiite conflict between al - Sadr and SCIRI .
The fourth Iraq is the Iraq of the Sunni .
The first three years of the American occupation were dominated by violence emanating from the Sunni heartland as those elements loyal to Saddam , and those opposed to Shiite domination , worked together to make the American occupation , and any affiliated post - Saddam government derived from the occupation , a failure .
To this extent , elements of the Sunni of Iraq , drawn primarily from the intelligence services of the Hussein regime , facilitated the creation and operation of al - Qaida in Iraq .
The work of this Iraqi al - Qaida has been successful in destabilizing the country to the point that the United States has been compelled to fund , equip and train Sunni militias in an effort to confront al - Qaida , as well as to make up for the real shortfalls of the central Iraqi government when it comes to security and stability in the Sunni areas .
The newfound relationship between the Sunni and the United States , especially in Anbar province , is cited as a major factor in the success of the surge .
The fifth Iraq is that of the Kurds .
Long hailed as a poster child of stability and prosperity , the fundamental problems inherent in post - Saddam Kurdistan are coming to a head .
The inherent incompatibility between the “ sanctuary ” created by the United States through the northern “ no - fly zone ” and post - Saddam Iraq is more evident today than ever .
The Kurds , pleased with their status as a “ special case ” in the eyes of the Bush administration , have made no honest effort to assimilate into a centralized system of government .
Furthermore , the false dream of an independent Kurdish homeland has not only poisoned relations with the U.S. - backed government in Baghdad ( witness the conflict over oil deals in Kurdistan and the Iraqi national oil law ) , but also between the U.S. and its NATO ally , Turkey .
The Iraqi Kurds ’ ongoing support of Kurdish nationalist groups in Turkey and Iran has led to increased instability , the most current manifestation of which are the ongoing cross - border attacks into Iraqi territory by the Turkish military .
And , given the high level of emotion attached to matters pertaining to Kurdish nationalism , the likelihood of the situation de-escalating anytime soon is remote .
Five Iraqs , and one Iraq policy ill - suited to the reality of any single situation , yet alone the whole .
The success of the surge is pure fantasy , a fancy bit of illusion that would do David Copperfield proud , but not the people of Iraq or the United States .
The surge addresses events in Iraq based upon short - term objectives ( i.e. , reducing the immediate level of violence ) without resolving any of the deep - seated , long - term issues that promote the violence to begin with .
It is like placing a Band - Aid on a gaping chest wound .
The pink , frothy blood may not be visible on the surface , but the wound remains as grave as ever , and because it is not being directly attended to , it only gets worse .
Eventually the lungs will collapse and the body will die .
This is the reality of Iraq today .
Thanks to the surge , we do not see the horrific wound that is Iraq for what it truly is .
As such , our policies do nothing to cure the problem , and in doing nothing , only make the matter worse .
History will show that this period of relative “ calm ” we attribute to the surge is but the pause before the storm .
Hillary Clinton is correct to label the surge a failed strategy .
But her motivation for doing so rests more with her desire to position herself politically on the domestic front than it is a reflection of a thoughtful Iraq policy .
So long as American politicians , regardless of political affiliation , seek to solve the problem of Iraq from a domestic political perspective , then the problem that is Iraq will never be resolved , either “ quickly ” or “ responsibly . ”
Iraq is an unpopular war .
There are , therefore , no “ popular ” solutions , only realistic ones .
The five - dimensional problem embodied in post - Saddam Iraq cannot be bundled up into a neat package .
America , and its leaders , must do the right thing in Iraq , not for Iraq , but for America , even when doing so requires making some tough decisions .
Narrow the problem set from five dimensions to two , and the problem becomes more manageable .
For my money , I choose working with the Sunnis and al - Sadr to create a viable coalition , and then cutting a deal with Iran that trades off better relations in exchange for encouraging the current failed Iraqi government to step aside in favor of new elections .
And the Kurds ?
Autonomy or nothing .
My loyalty is first and foremost to the United States , and when we look at the situation in Iraq from a genuine national security perspective , there is no threat worthy of the continued sacrifice being asked of our soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines .
As such , the only policy option worthy of consideration is that which brings our troops home as expeditiously as possible .
Politicians who embrace a different policy are simply using the sacrifice of our service members as a shield behind which to hide their ignorance of Iraqi issues , and their personal cowardice , which manifests itself any time brave young men and women are allowed to die in order to preserve someone ’s political viability .
As we in the United States celebrate this holiday season , let us not forget those who serve overseas in uniform , and the sacrifices they make in our name .
And as we approach the coming election season , let us never forget those politicians who would have these sacrifices continue in order to safeguard their individual political fortune .
This applies to all who seek the nomination for the office of the presidency , even those like Hillary Clinton who claim to embrace an anti-war position but whose words and actions strongly suggest something else .
How Proportional Representation Elections Work
We in the United States are used to single - member district , winner - take - all style of elections .
We 've all grown up with a system where we elect members of our legislatures one at a time in small districts , with the winner being the candidate with the most votes .
This system seems so " natural " that proportional representation ( PR ) elections may at first appear strange to us .
Adding to the potential confusion is the fact that there are several different kinds of PR systems in use around the world .
But in reality , the principles underlying proportional representation systems are very straightforward and all of the systems are easy to use .
The Basic Principles of PR
The basic principles underlying proportional representation elections are that all voters deserve representation and that all political groups in society deserve to be represented in our legislatures in proportion to their strength in the electorate .
In other words , everyone should have the right to fair representation .
In order to achieve this fair representation , all PR systems have certain basic characteristics — characteristics that set them apart from our current election system .
First , they all use multi-member districts .
Instead of electing one person in each district , as we do here in the U.S. , several people are elected .
These multi-member districts may be relatively small , with only three or four members , or they may be larger , with ten or more members .
( The figures below illustrate districting maps for a hypothetical 50 - person state senate .
Figure 1 shows 50 single - seat districts , as is common with plurality - majority systems .
Figure 2 depicts 10 five - seat PR districts , and Figure 3 shows 5 ten - seat PR districts . )
Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3
The second characteristic of all PR systems is that they divide up the seats in these multi-member districts according to the proportion of votes received by the various parties or groups running candidates .
Thus if the candidates of a party win 40 % of the vote in a 10 member district , they receive four of the ten seats — or 40 % of the seats .
If another party wins 20 % of the vote , they get two seats , and so on .
That , in a nutshell , is how proportional representation works .
But while all PR systems have the same goals of ensuring that all voters receive some representation and that all groups are represented fairly , various systems do have different ways of achieving these goals .
So it is helpful to see how different kinds of PR systems work in practice .
Types of PR Systems
Party List Voting
Party list voting systems are by far the most common form of proportional representation .
Over 80 % of the PR systems used worldwide are some form of party list voting .
It remains the system used in most European democracies and in many newly democratized countries , including South Africa .
How It Works .
Legislators are elected in large , multi-member districts .
Each party puts up a list or slate of candidates equal to the number of seats in the district .
Independent candidates may also run , and they are listed separately on the ballot as if they were their own party ( see below ) .
On the ballot , voters indicate their preference for a particular party and the parties then receive seats in proportion to their share of the vote .
So in a five - member district , if the Democrats win 40 % of the vote , they would win two of the five seats .
The two winning Democratic candidates would be chosen according to their position on the list .
There are two broad types of list systems : closed list and open list .
In a closed list system -- the original form of party list voting -- the party fixes the order in which the candidates are listed and elected , and the voter simply casts a vote for the party as a whole .
This is shown in the first ballot below , which illustrates an election for the House of Representatives in a five - seat district .
Voters are not able to indicate their preference for any candidates on the list , but must accept the list in the order presented by the party .
Winning candidates are selected in the exact order they appear on the original list .
So in the example here , if the Democrats won two seats , the first two candidates on the pre-ordered list — Foster and Rosen - Amy — would be elected .
Closed Party List Ballot
Most European democracies now use the open list form of party list voting .
This approach allows voters to express a preference for particular candidates , not just parties .
It is designed to give voters some say over the order of the list and thus which candidates get elected .
One version of this is illustrated in the ballot below .
Voters are presented with unordered or random lists of candidates chosen in party primaries .
Voters cannot vote for a party directly , but must cast a vote for an individual candidate .
This vote counts for the specific candidate as well as for the party .
So the order of the final list completely depends on the number of votes won by each candidate on the list .
The most popular candidates rise to the top of the list and have a better chance of being elected .
In our example , if the Democrats won 2 seats , and Volz and Gentzler received the highest and next highest number of individual votes , they would rise to the top of the list and be elected .
This example is similar to the system used in Finland and widely considered to be the most open version of list voting .
Open Party List Ballot
A variety of different formulas exist for accomplishing the actual allocation of seats to the parties .
One of the simplest seat allocation formulas is the called the " largest remainder formula . "
In this approach , the first step is to calculate a quota , which is determined by taking the total number of valid votes in the district and dividing this by the number of seats .
In the example in the table below , 100,000 votes were cast and ten seats are to be filled .
100,000/10 = 10,000 – which is the quota .
The quota is then divided into the vote that each party receives and the party wins one seat for each whole number produced .
So the Republican party received 38,000 votes , which is divided by 10,000 to produce three seats – with a remainder of 8,000 .
After this first allocation of seats is complete than the remainder numbers for the parties are compared and the parties with the largest remainders are allocated the remaining seats .
In our example , two seats remain to be allocated and the Republicans and Moll , the independent candidate , have the largest remainders , so they get the seats .
Ultimately all the parties end up with the number of seats that as closely as possible approximates their percentage of the vote .
Largest Remainder Approach to Seat Allocation
Mixed - Member Proportional Voting
Mixed - member proportional representation goes by a variety of other names , including " the additional member system , " " compensatory PR , " the " two vote system , " and " the German system . "
It is an attempt to combine a single - member district system with a proportional voting system .
Half of the members of the legislature are elected in single - member district plurality contests .
The other half are elected by a party list vote and added on to the district members so that each party has its appropriate share of seats in the legislature .
Proponents claim that mixed - member proportional voting ( MMP ) is the best of both worlds : providing the geographical representation and close constituency ties of single - member plurality voting along with the fairness and diversity of representation that comes with PR voting .
This system was originally invented in West Germany right after World War Two , though since then it has also been adopted in several other countries , including Bolivia and Venezuela .
It is still one of the least used PR systems , but in recent years it has begun to garner a great deal of attention .
In fact , it is now one of the " hottest " systems being considered by those involved in electoral design .
In part this growing attention is a result of MMP ’s unique claim to be a " compromise " between the two main rival systems .
In the 1990s New Zealand abandoned its traditional single - member plurality system for MMP .
Hungary also adopted this approach .
Most recently , the newly formed parliaments of Scotland and Wales used this system for their first elections .
How It Works .
People cast votes on a double ballot -- see the ballot below .
First , on the left part of the ballot , they vote for a district representative .
This part of the ballot is a single - member district plurality contest to see which person will represent the district in the legislature .
The person with the most votes wins .
Typically half of the seats in the legislature are filled in this way .
So in a hypothetical 100 - member state legislature , the winners of these district contests would occupy 50 of the seats .
On the right part of the ballot -- the party list portion -- voters indicate their choice among the parties , and the other half of the seats in the legislature are filled from regional lists of candidates chosen by these parties .
The party lists are closed in the German version .
These party list votes are counted on a national basis to determine the total portion of the 100 - seat legislature that each party deserves .
Candidates from each party ’s lists are then added to its district winners until that party achieves its appropriate share of seats .
The following table illustrates how this process works for our hypothetical election .
The Democrats won 40 % of the party list votes in the 100 - member state legislature , so they would be entitled to a total of 40 of the 100 seats .
Since they already elected 28 of their candidates in district elections , they would then add 12 more from their regional party lists to come up to their quota of 40 seats .
Allocation of Seats in MMP
In the German version two electoral thresholds are used , either of which a party must overcome to be allotted seats in the legislature .
A party must either get 5 % of the nationwide party list vote or win at least three district races in order for it to gain any seats in the legislature .
In our hypothetical case , the New Party did not win any district seats , but they did win over 5 % of the nationwide vote , so they deserve their share of legislative seats -- which in this case would be six seats , all of which would be filled from the regional party lists .
Single Transferable Vote Or Choice Voting
This system of proportional representation is known by several names .
Political scientists call it " the single transferable vote . "
It is called the " Hare - Clark system " in Australia .
In the United States , electoral reform activists have taken to calling it " choice voting . "
Currently this system is used to elect parliaments in Ireland and Malta .
In Australia it is used to elect the federal Senate , as well as the legislatures in several states there .
It is also the PR system that was used in a number of cities in the United States during the twentieth century , including New York , Cincinnati , Cleveland , Toledo , and Boulder .
It continues to be used today in Cambridge , Massachusetts for elections to their city council and school board .
How It Works .
The voting process is illustrated by ballot below .
All candidates are listed in the same place on the ballot .
Instead of voting for one person , voters rank each candidate in their order of choice .
So if you like Campbell best , you would mark the " 1 " after his name .
If you liked Gomez second best , you would mark " 2 " by his name , and so on .
You can rank as few or as many as you want .
This ballot illustrates the use of the AccuVote system used in Cambridge , Massachusetts to elect its city council and school board .
Voters fill in the ranking numbers as they would for standardized tests taken in school , which allows for computerized vote counting and ballot transfers .
Choice Voting Ballot
As the name " single transferable vote " implies , this systems involves a process of transferring votes .
To understand how the transfer process works , it may be best to start out with a simple analogy .
Imagine a school where a class is trying to elect a committee .
Any student who wishes to run stands at the front of the class and the other students vote for their favorite candidates by standing beside them .
Students standing almost alone next to their candidate will soon discover that this person has no chance of being elected and move to another candidate of their choice to help him or her get elected .
Some of the students standing next to a very popular candidate may realize that this person has more than enough support to win , and decide to go stand next to another student that they would also like to see on the committee .
In the end , after all of this shuffling around , most students would be standing next to candidates that will be elected , which is the ultimate point of this process .
In the single transferable vote , votes are transferred around just as the students moved from candidate to candidate in the analogy .
The exact order of the transfer process is illustrated in figure below .
An example of how the votes are actually transferred is shown in the table that follows .
For the sake of simplicity , assume that there is a three - seat district in which six people are running for office .
The first step in the process is to establish the threshold : the minimum number of votes necessary to win a seat .
The threshold usually consists of the total number of valid votes divided by one plus the number of seats to be filled , plus one vote .
The formula looks like this : Threshold = ( valid votes / 1+seats ) +1 vote .
So in our three - seat districts with 10,000 voters , a candidate would need 10,000 / 1+3 ( which is 2,500 ) plus one more vote , for 2,501 .
Diagram of Ballot Transfer Process
The second step is to count all the number one choices to see if any candidates have reached the threshold of 2,501 .
As shown on the table below , the Democrat Gomez has 2,900 voters and he is declared elected .
But Gomez actually has 399 more votes than he needs to win .
These votes are considered wasted if they stay with Gomez , so they are transferred to the second choices on the ballot .
( There are several ways to do this , but we need n’t get into those details here . )
In the second count , we see the effect of this transfer .
The other Democratic candidate , Campbell , gets 300 of those second choice votes , and the independent candidate , Daniels , gets the other 99 .
The vote totals are now recalculated to see if anyone is now over the threshold .
No one is , so the next transfer takes place .
The candidate with the least chance to win is eliminated and his or her votes are transferred to their second choices .
This candidate is Higgins , the Republican , and 500 of his votes are transferred to the other Republican candidate , Dains ; and the other 100 votes are given to Daniels .
Again the votes are recounted to see if anyone has reached the threshold .
Dains has reached it with 2,800 votes and so she is declared elected .
Once again her excess votes are redistributed to their second choices -- 200 to Graybeal , and 99 to Daniels .
But still no one has reached the threshold , so again the lowest candidate is eliminated and those votes transferred .
That candidate is Campbell , the Democrat , and 100 of his votes go to Graybeal , and 600 go to Daniels .
This puts Daniels , the independent candidate , over the threshold with 2,698 votes , and she is the last one elected .
Ballot Count and Transfer Process
This transfer process is a bit complicated , so why does it exist ?
The transfer process was invented primarily to reduce the problem of wasted votes -- votes that are cast but do not actually elect anyone .
Plurality - majority systems routinely waste large numbers of votes and this is why they are prone to such problems as party misrepresentation , and the underrepresentation of political minorities , racial minorities , and women .
The transfer process in STV is designed to ensure that the fewest votes are wasted and that the maximum number of people gets to elect a representative to office .
It acknowledges that there are two kinds of wasted votes : votes for candidates that stand little chance of winning , and votes in excess of what a winning candidate needs .
Transferring these votes to their next ranked choice makes it more likely that they will actually contribute to the election of a candidate .
Simpler Than They Look
Again , to American eyes , these various PR systems often appear at first to be overly - complex and confusing .
And while the mechanics of seat allocation can sometimes be complicated , the actual voting process is not intimidating at all and can be easily utilized by the average citizen .
Voters need not understand all the mathematics of these systems to use them effectively .
To use an analogy : you do n't have to understand how all the electronic components in your car radio work in order to use it to find the kind of music you like .
The party list system , the mixed - member system , and the choice vote have all been used for decades in other Western democracies .
Voters in these countries have had no trouble using these systems , as indicated by the very high voters turnout rates that these PR countries enjoy .
Certainly we could expect that American voters would easily master the use of these systems as well .

The biggest market for oil paintings from China turns out to be in Florida condominiums and other second homes being built as part of the global housing market boom .
Hotels and restaurants also buy large numbers of Chinese paintings .
Many of the paintings depict scenes that Chinese artists have never seen .
" European landscapes , like the Mediterranean or Venice or Paris , are the best sellers for us , " Moses Ben Herut , the president of Oilpaintings.com , said in a telephone interview from Alpharetta , Ga .
Mr. Herut 's
Web site does not publicize the fact that it buys many of its paintings from Xiamen in southeastern coastal China , instead putting " Georgia , U.S.A. " at the top of its home page in red , white and blue to emphasize that it is an extension of a local gallery .
At the Canton Trade Fair in Guangzhou this spring , exporters surrounded by paintings filled an entire row of exhibits .
Adrian Goldberg , the chief executive of the Ziganof Group , a wholesaler in Manchester , England , walked into one of the booths and in less than an hour had placed an order for six 40 - foot shipping containers filled with paintings to be delivered this autumn to ports in Europe and the United States .
Standing outside the booth as crowds of buyers and sellers moved past , Mr. Goldberg explained that he was paying $ 25 to $ 30 for each painting , including the frames , and that it would cost him another $ 1 a painting in shipping charges .
He plans to sell the paintings mainly to furniture stores for $ 35 to $ 40 apiece , and predicted that shoppers would eventually pay $ 100 to $ 125 apiece in Europe for the paintings , and up to $ 160 each in the United States .
The economics of the Chinese oil painting industry -- very few watercolors or pastels are traded internationally -- are striking .
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Ye , who both learned to paint by serving two - year apprenticeships after high school , each earn less than $ 200 a month , plus modest room and board .
Mr. Huang , who earned a four - year art degree from Jiangxi Normal University in east - central China , said he was paid $ 360 a month , but buys his own food and housing .

Past violations by the government have also included continuing a wiretap for days or weeks beyond what was authorized by a court , or seeking records beyond what were authorized .
The 2006 case appears to be a particularly egregious example of what intelligence officials refer to as “ overproduction ”  in which a telecommunications provider gives the government more data than it was ordered to provide .
The problem of overproduction is particularly common , F.B.I. officials said .
In testimony before Congress in March 2007 regarding abuses of national security letters , Valerie E. Caproni , the bureau ’s general counsel , said that in one small sample , 10 out of 20 violations were a result of “ third - party error , ” in which a private company “ provided the F.B.I. information we did not seek . ”
The 2006 episode was disclosed as part of a new batch of internal documents that the F.B.I. turned over to the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a nonprofit group in San Francisco that advocates for greater digital privacy protections , as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit the group has brought .
The group provided the documents on the 2006 episode to The New York Times .
Marcia Hofmann , a lawyer for the privacy foundation , said the episode raised troubling questions about the technical and policy controls that the F.B.I. had in place to guard against civil liberties abuses .
“ How do we know what the F.B.I. does with all these documents when a problem like this comes up ? ” Ms. Hofmann asked .
In the cyber era , the incident is the equivalent of law enforcement officials getting a subpoena to search a single apartment , but instead having the landlord give them the keys to every apartment in the building .
In February 2006 , an F.B.I. technical unit noticed “ a surge in data being collected ” as part of a national security investigation , according to an internal bureau report .
An Internet provider was supposed to be providing access to the e-mail of a single target of that investigation , but the F.B.I. soon realized that the filtering controls used by the company “ were improperly set and appeared to be collecting data on the entire e-mail domain ” used by the individual , according to the report .
The bureau had first gotten authorization from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor the e-mail of the individual target 10 months earlier , in April 2005 , according to the internal F.B.I. document .
But Michael Kortan , an F.B.I. spokesman , said in an interview that the problem with the unfiltered e-mail went on for just a few days before it was discovered and fixed .
“ It was unintentional on their part , ” he said .
Here 's a tricky question for you Law and Order lovers :
Say an astronaut goes crazy and kills another inside the new European Columbus module , due to be delivered to the International Space Station next month .
Is there a trial ?
Where , and under whose laws ?
In fact , there is a reasonably well developed , if not yet well - tested body of space law , stemming from the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 , and roughly based on maritime law .
But there 's a catch , which legal types attending a recent European legal conference have been hashing out .
The law of space is fairly simple :
Anything that happens in a vehicle registered to a particular country takes place under that country 's laws .
Smoke a joint in the space shuttle , and you 're risking prosecution under U.S. federal marijuana laws .
But what about the space station , which is being assembled by modules owned by different countries ?
At the recent conference , organized by the European Science Foundation , the ESA , and the European Space Policy Institute , lawyers rejected the idea that U.S. law should simply apply throughout .
Instead , the old rules of territoriality should be maintained , so that each country 's laws should apply in each of their individual modules .
Which , fine , but what about the European module , which does n't have just a single nationality ?
No problem if , say , an astronaut wanted to manufacture a television , the European Union has plenty of rules for that .
But a European - wide criminal law does n't exist .
For now , the conference lawyers argued , each astronaut in the European section should be treated as falling under the laws of his or her home state , for criminal purposes .
But just to make things complicated , if an astronaut invents something in the European module , it will be patented in Germany or Italy , since they 're the main contributors to
Columbus .
Complicated ?
You better believe it ; but it 's probably better to have some rules than no rules at all .
Just wait ' till we start setting up bases on the
Moon .
A UN Moon Agreement , passed in 1979 , lays out rules for how states should act when exploring the Moon , but it 's been ratified by only 13 states – none of which have the spacegoing ability to get there .
Stay tuned , the lawyers have landed .

BERLIN – The Italian actress and model Isabella Rossellini , who has been starring in big - screen movies for 20 years , is making her directorial debut with a series of short films designed for cellphones and computers .
Rossellini's one - minute shorts are dramatic reenactments of insects copulating called Green Porno , a name designed to draw search engine traffic .
" What do people mostly go online for , but to look at porn ? " explains Canadian filmmaker Jody Shapiro , Rossellini ’s co-director .
" So we put ' Porno ' in , and when people Google it , maybe we 'll get lucky and Green Porno will come up .
We might as well take advantage of the delivery system . "
In each episode , Rossellini assumes the role of the male insect .
" Seeing Isabella Rossellini mount a housefly from behind while smiling at the camera , " Shapiro remarked , " I can't imagine many people would have ever thought they ’d see that . "
Each of the one - minute shorts explains how insects copulate .
Shot on high - definition video , and featuring cartoonish sets and costumes , the simple colorful shorts are designed to hold up well on portable video devices .
For their succinctness and wit , Rossellini 's eight movies resemble a skillfully executed animated cartoon from The New Yorker .
And despite a substantial budget , the films also have a wonderful do - it - yourself quality that should come as an affirmation to every auteur aspirant on YouTube .
Three of the Green Porno shorts premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival last week .
In the Q&A session following Saturday 's premiere , Rossellini said she quickly realized how compressed the product would have to be : " When you 're watching on the small screen , it really needs to be between 2 - 5 minutes . "
Shapiro acknowledges how difficult this is : " It 's very hard to tell a story in a short amount of time .
Advertisers get paid millions of dollars to do something like that . "
In the spring , Sundance Channel has plans to distribute the films on the web and through cellphone downloads .
" The Sundance Channel has an initiative to create green programming , " Shapiro said , referring to films that raise awareness about environmental issues .
" And there 's a real push to commission original content for what they term the third screen . "
That term , favored by Sundance to describe projects like Green Porno , refers to screens and monitors on portable electronic devices .
While the official Green Porno website , currently under construction , promises that all eight episodes will soon be viewable on the site , Shapiro is uncertain as to Sundance Channel 's distribution strategy .
" One of the reasons I love doing this so much is it 's such a new field , " Shapiro says .
" I do n't think anybody knows where it 's going to go yet .
Broadcasters and distributors definitely do n't . "
Zogby Poll : A majority of Americans - 54 % - believe the United States has not lost the war in Iraq .
John Robb : " In 4th generation warfare ( guerrilla warfare ) , the war typically ends when one side , usually the nation - state , suffers moral collapse and loses the will to fight ( ala Vietnam ) -- this is in contrast to a collapse in means due to attrition ( WWI ) or a collapse in ability due to disruption ( WWII ) . "
If you think the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will end with this US presidency , think again .
These wars will likely outlast the next several Presidents .
The old Vietnam era formulas do n't apply anymore .
The reason is that the moral weaknesses that have traditionally limited the state 's ability to fight long guerrilla wars have dissipated , and modern states may now have the ability and the desire to wage this type of war indefinitely .
Here 's what changed :

I will give you the vision of the future next year : about 8 to 11 senators will be voted as Democrats that are now Republicans .
There will be about 30 Republican congressmen that are now Republicans that will also become Democrats .
And the next president will be a Democrat .
My entire Republican party is being destroyed because of this catastrophe that 's happened in Iraq and all these wonderful young soldiers - 27,000 wounded and disabled soldiers , 12 - 15 million [ thousand ? ] with severe mental problems , almost 4,000 dead .
That 's 50,000 young men that ... lives have been either partially destroyed or are dead today and we have accomplished absolutely nothing .
It is very sad and very pathetic and you can put lipstick on this pig any way you want to , but in the final analysis , we have accomplished absolutely nothing and it is very sad to see my party destroyed over this issue .
Microsoft fired the latest salvo in the increasingly antagonistic document standards debate last week when the company accused IBM of orchestrating efforts to block ISO fast - track approval of Office Open XML ( OOXML ) , a document format devised by Microsoft for its office software suite .
IBM is n't taking the accusations sitting down , however , telling Ars that Microsoft is leading a fight against truly open standards .
As governments around the world begin to establish IT procurement policies that favor open standards , the stakes in the document format dispute are rising .
The trend towards mandatory standards adoption in government IT has led some to speculate that government agencies and companies that work closely with the public sector will begin to turn away from Microsoft 's deeply entrenched office offerings , instead adopting alternatives like IBM's Lotus Notes , Sun 's StarOffice , or OpenOffice.org which use the OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) .
Microsoft has been seeking ISO approval for its own OOXML format in order to ensure that its software remains competitive .
Citing technical and intellectual property issues , a growing number of critics believe that Microsoft 's standards are flawed , restrictive , not adequately aligned with existing standards , or not conducive to broad third - party support .
They argue that Microsoft should adopt ODF rather than fragmenting the office document space with its own alternative .
Microsoft disagrees with much of the criticism and contends that OOXML is necessary because ODF lacks support for features that are used in Microsoft Office and cannot be adapted to provide clean backwards - compatibility with documents that are already in Microsoft 's binary formats .
The ISO evaluation process for OOXML has been mired in controversy and has been transformed into a battleground for competing corporate agendas .
Microsoft , IBM , and other participants have been accused of using exploitative political maneuvering to manipulate the standards process to their own advantage .
A ZDNet article published late last month quotes Microsoft officials who claim that IBM is solely responsible for ISO 's recent decision to deny OOXML fast - track approval .
" Let 's be very clear , " Jean Paoli , Microsoft 's senior director of XML technology , told ZDNet .
" It has been fostered by a single company — IBM .
If it was not for IBM , it would have been business as usual for this standard . "
" They have made this a religious and highly political debate , " said Nico Tsilas , Microsoft 's senior director of interoperability and IP policy .
" IBM have asked governments to have an open - source , exclusive purchasing policy .
Our competitors have targeted this one product — mandating one document format over others to harm Microsoft 's profit stream . "
Tsilas makes some dubious arguments that do n't accurately reflect in entirety the reality of the situation .
For instance , there is no legitimate basis for the claim that IBM is lobbying for governments to adopt open - source exclusive procurement policies or that ODF is a single - product standard .
The OpenDocument format can be implemented in proprietary or open software and it can be implemented by anyone , including Microsoft , so government adoption of ODF only has the potential to harm Microsoft 's profit stream if Microsoft keeps refusing to support the format .
IBM should n't be blamed for Microsoft 's reluctance to adopt existing standards .
IBM : Microsoft is engaging in " bad behavior "
We spoke to Bob Sutor , vice president of standards and open source for IBM , who responded to Microsoft 's recent claims regarding IBM 's involvement in the OOXML dispute .
" IBM believes that there is a revolution occurring in the IT industry , and that smart people around the world are demanding truly open standards developed in a collaborative , democratic way for the betterment of all , " Sutor told Ars .
" If ' business as usual ' means trying to foist a rushed , technically inferior and product - specific piece of work like OOXML on the IT industry , we 're proud to stand with the tens of countries and thousands of individuals who are willing to fight against such bad behavior .
" In particular , we congratulate those countries who have already voted against OOXML in the JTC1 ballot , and the many more who we believe are now considering doing the same , " Sutor concluded .
In the past , we have seen plenty of evidence that both Microsoft and IBM have resorted to politicking in the standards debate , but it seems disingenuous for Microsoft to lay the blame for ISO 's decision solely on IBM .
In light of the complexity of Microsoft 's format , even some of Microsoft 's supporters assert that more time is needed for detailed evaluation so that relevant problems in OOXML can be identified and resolved .
Critics of Microsoft 's format of choice continue to raise all sorts of significant technical issues with OOXML , ranging from use of nonstandard locale conventions to the inclusion of inaccurate date computation behavior for the sake of backwards compatibility .
Critics also note that numerous OOXML content examples in the specification itself fail to validate against the XML schema supplied by Microsoft .
These are all issues that can be addressed by ISO now that fast - track approval has been shot down .
Regardless of the outcome of the standards debate , Microsoft 's format will quickly become the de facto standard in private industry as companies adopt Office 2007 .
In the long run , a more rigorous inspection of OOXML is advantageous , because it could potentially bring improvements to the format that would n't have happened otherwise .
As a result of this protracted approval process , organizations that adopt OOXML will be able to do so with greater confidence than would be possible if Microsoft had been permitted to railroad it through fast - track approval without this scrutiny .
If Ron Paul has a handicap , it's that his ideas are complex and difficult for quick consumption .
He does n't resort to the easy - out demagogy that seems to be political par these days .
Instead , he engages the more robust discussions that Americans entertain in coffee shops and academic quarters .
As Glen Greenwald at Salon.com explained , " While Barack Obama toys with the rhetoric of challenging conventional wisdom , Paul 's campaign -- for better or worse -- actually does so , and does so in an extremely serious , thoughtful and coherent way . "
This sort of thinking is ill - suited for the soundbite - oriented mainstream outlets .
It can only be understood in its entirety by doing enough research on the Internet .
Thus , the Internet is where Ron Paul flourishes .
Second , he regularly challenges the conventional wisdom of Washington D.C. Objectively , his points are equally valid ; he pits trade against war , low taxes against corporate welfare , lower grocery prices against agriculture subsidies .
But again , the common assumption that politicians succumb to the whims of Washington can only be overcome by researching the theories that underlie his beliefs .
Why , for instance , was he the only Congressman who opposed casting a posthumous gold medal for Rosa Parks ?
It turns out , he was n't opposed to casting the medal per se , " Rosa Parks is a hero of mine ... I believe in civil disobedience " , he said .
Instead , he offered to help pay for it with his own money and encouraged other Congressmen to do the same .
They would not .
Paul makes an excellent point here :
Why is congress willing to raid your Social Security and tax you for a medal that they 're not willing to pay for themselves ?
Meanwhile , they have a lucrative pension plan in which Ron Paul refuses to partake .
If you use the Internet , you can delineate these points .
But if you get all your information from the major outlets , you 'll hear " Ron Paul hates Rosa Parks " .
This article also evidences this phenomenon .
It says that Paul blamed the attacks on 9/11 on American foreign policy .
That was a demagogic simplification of his statement .
It was first misconstrued by the moderator at the debate , then by Giuliani , and now Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reiley .
Bill Maher corrected Chris Dodd about this , " Excuse me Senator , but that is just what the Republicans at the debate were trying to do , they were trying to say that he blamed America for 9/11 " .
Yet , he was n't talking about a good - and - evil blame - game that informs most of our Bush - era understanding of the world .
He was talking about geopolitical cause - and - effect .
The fact that he is correct according to the 9/11 Commission report , the CIA 's declassified intelligence , and Paul Wolfowitz himself seems to matter little to voters who do n't have the time to do internet research .
The fact is Paul addresses the issues that America faces .
There is no doubt that Social Security is crumbling .
Rogue economists who set out to buy time cannot overwhelm the weight of economic wisdom that a system of IOUs backed by IOUs that the government wrote to itself , simply cannot sustain .
The value of the dollar is deteriorating and inflation will be our next biggest long - term financial crisis . , according to Greenspan .
The cost of our war is increasing with no viable end .
Not to mention the cost of maintaining troops deployed all over the world .
All of these put together are recipe for financial collapse .
Paul 's wisdom hails from the school of foresight .
While conventional politicians go to great efforts to secure legacies by pushing problems down to their successors , Paul stands for the idea that we can address them now , on our terms .
One thing is certain though ; we * will * address them .
Hillary Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani may be in wheelchairs when we do .
But an entire generation of Americans who will be worried about putting farm - subsidized bread on the table and will suffer the real , difficult consequences of government largess ... well , they also use the Internet .
Think the 2008 general election campaign will be marred by the same kind of third - party character attacks that characterized the presidential contest 3 1/2 years ago ?
If so , John Edwards is ready this time .
The former North Carolina senator , who was the vice presidential running mate of John Kerry in 2004 , has spent mountains of time in Iowa since then campaigning for the Iowa Democratic caucus now just 12 days away .
Generally , as The Times ' Seema Mehta has watched and listened closely to him on the campaign trail in these closing days , Edwards has been sticking to his positive populist message :
" What Iowa caucus - goers are looking for is not petty personal fighting between politicians , " he often says .
" They are looking for somebody who 's actually willing to take on the corporate power and corporate greed that 's standing between them and the country they believe in . "
But Friday , Edwards came out with a far steelier , possibly more revealing response to one audience member 's question .
It was toward the end of a standing - room - only speech at a West Des Moines community college campus .
A voter asked Edwards what he would do if he was ever faced with the same Swift Boat - style attacks that dogged , and some feel doomed , the 2004 Democratic ticket headed by Kerry .
" I will fight back with every fiber of my being , " responded Edwards , who reportedly urged Kerry to fire back more urgently and effectively when his military service and Purple Heart were called into question during the 2004 election .
" We will not let these people get away with this again . "
" When they come after us , " he added , " we have to go back harder than they come after us .
We have to make them pay , because there 's just too much at stake and you learn from these experiences . "
" I can tell you from my own experience , " Edwards continued , " if they come after me , they will pay in a way they cannot imagine when I come back . "
So let that be a swift warning .

BRUSSELS , European Parliament , 26th February 2008 .
Mark Dermul ( www.911belgium.be) reporting .
On Tuesday 26th February , Europarlementarian Guilietto Chiesa invited his colleagues and the press to attend the screening and debate of the Italian - produced documentary named ‘ ZERO , an investigation into the events of 9/11 ’.
Object of the screening was to create political awareness of the faulty official investigation into the events by the 9/11 Commission .
Besides Mr Chiesa , the panel consisted of Japanese parlementarian Fujita , Dr David Ray Griffin , film distributor Tim Sparke & the director and producers of the film .
After his opening statements , Mr Chiesa welcomed his guest speakers , including the producers , director and distributor of the documentary .
Mr Chiesa pointed out that he was unable to find any distributor in his native country of Italy and was happy to find a company in the UK , led by Mr Tim Sparke , to handle worldwide distribution of this important film .
‘ It is important to realize , ’ he emphasized ‘ that the movie was made thanks to contribution and donations of hundreds of citizens who feel a new investigation is more than warranted . ’
No less than 450 people worked on this documentary on a voluntary basis .
They never received any kind of payment .
Their reward is the movie itself , which they feel is an instrument to create awareness and a means to provoke a political debate in Europe
Since the movie projector did n’t work , Mr Chiesa invited the public to ask questions until the technical problems were solved and we could start watching the movie
Question : ‘ Why did you make this film ? ’
Chiesa :
‘ It is obvious that we are now cast in an infinite war , based on lies .
And as long as there is no new and independent investigation , we will never have security .
There are too many lies for the official narrative to be true .
Our film is an instrument to request the re-opening of the 9/11 investigation . ’
Question : ‘ How do you propose to reopen the investigation ? ’
Chiesa :
‘ The film is the primary instrument to get the debate going .
It is a collection of discoveries , by many respected researches from around the globe ( the film features , among others , Gore Vidal , Sibel Edmonds , Dario Fo , David Ray Griffin , Dr Steven Jones , Dr Kevin Ryan , Webster Tarpley , Barbara Honegger , FAA - controllers , USAF pilots , military commanders , physicists – ed. note ) .
But they are still questions .
The movie does n’t provide the answers .
It only lays bare the questions that remain , that were left unanswered by the official investigation and need to be answered by the US government . ’
Question : ‘ Mr Fujita , how did you become involved ? ’
Fujita : ‘ I work for several Japanese NGO ’s and one of those people showed me some videos and books .
At first I could n’t believe it .
So I saw Loose Change and read Dr Griffin ’s books .
And last year a good friend of mine who has a very high position at the German national bank told me about the put options that were placed on American Airlines and United Airlines .
I believed him .
And reading Dr Griffin ’s book , looking at his reputation , I have every reason to believe him .
That ’s when I realised that every truth finding effort has to be continued .
So I gave a presentation in the Japanese parliament ( which is extensively covered on YouTube – ed. note ) .
But I feel the truthers find their information mostly by internet .
The truth should not only go by internet .
It should now go political !
Networking is very important .
We must all work together . ’
Question : ‘ But what can we , regular citizens who go about their daily lives , trying to make a living for them and their families , what can we do ? ’
Griffin : ‘ As in any movement , the 9/11 Truth Movement is a minority movement .
We must continue to use our networks to make this minority into a majority .
We have the upper hand to find the truth , for we have the conscience of the people .
And I know that ’s not an easy feat .
I have now written six books on the subject , which is getting good reviews – go check it on Amazon .
I had a good reputation as an author before as well and now I ’ve just written my sixth book on the subject .
But I have yet to get a review in any mainstream publication . ’
Question : ‘ Do you , in your new book , take the same stance , saying that 9/11 was an inside job ? ’
Griffin : ‘ My new book is called 9/11 Contradictions .
In this book I do not take any position , actually .
Reporters have hidden in the past saying either the books were too technical and they ’re not engineers , so they could n’t comment on the book .
In other cases they felt the official story was the only story they could report about , for the risk of being labelled a conspiracy theorist or even worse , getting fired .
But with my new book , reporters will not be able to hide behind these excuses .
These are only contradictions that they can verify and ask questions about . ’
Question : ‘ What kind of contradictions ? ’
Griffin : ‘ Well , one very important one is the alleged Barbara Olsen phone call .
Ted Olsen at the time claimed he had been called by his wife twice on 9/11 , thus establishing the fact that American Airlines 77 was in fact hijacked by men with Middle Eastern looks .
First he claimed it was a cell phone call .
Later he changed his story to seatback phone .
But when a German journalist got Boeing to confirm that on this type of flight there were no seatback phones , Olsen changed his story back to call phone .
Now , you might think ‘ oh , so he got it right the first time ’ , but …
At the Moussaoui trial an FBI - report showed that there was never any connection between Barbara Olsen and her husband .
No cell phone calls were ever made from that flight ( Dr Griffin gave three more examples , contradiction with regards to the whereabouts of General Meyers , the highest ranking military officer on 9/11 , the timeline of Dick Cheney ’s activities and the question about why the Pentagon was not evacuated when the Doomsday plane , shown on CNN , was actually in the air over Washington – ed. note ) Question : ‘ Many people , even today , are still baffled about WTC - 7 .
When can we expect NIST to publish its final report on this collapse ? ’
Griffin : ‘ NIST has delayed the publication time after time .
In 2004 they said it would be released in 2005 , in 2005 they said it would be released in 2006 and so on .
Now we are expecting the report in August 2008 , but I feel we may yet get another delay until at least the end of November , after the current administration has – hopefully – left office . ’
At this point , people start joking about the fact that the US - government has probably sabotaged the screening of the documentary , since the projector cannot be fixed .
We change rooms a few minutes later and the screening of the film begins .
The documentary is probably the most important film made so far on 9/11 as it is very accessible ; it is obviously created for ‘ 9/11 newbies ’ .
If you want to get a crash course into the 9/11 event and the failures of the commission ’s investigation , this is the movie you need to see .
Some of the highlights for me were the interviews with an FAA - air controller who explained how the hijacking procedures were changed on 1st June 2001 , slowing down response , only to be changed back on 12th September 2001 .
And the very important discovery that the CCTV - images that were released by the FBI of Atta and his companion boarding Flight AA11 in Boston were actually taken by a CCTV at the airport in Portland , where they took a plane to arrive in Boston !
It has also a lot of footage that I had never seen before , including videos taken at the Pentagon shortly after the attack .
A must see and clearly a labour of love .
Impressive .
After the film , after the several minute long applause finally died away , Chiesa re-opened the debate .
Question : ‘ Why do we put op with this ?
Surely the United States are not all that powerful ? ’
Chiesa :
‘ But they are .
The fact that this group of about 300 people has only 6 Europarlementarians and 2 journalists among them shows that the US is controlling everything .
They are all powerful .
No politician in the European Parliament can ignore the power – or wrath ! – of the US . ’
( True to form , the Belgian media did n’t publish or broadcast any of this debate on this or the following day , even thought this debate took place inside the European Parliament – ed. note )
Tim Sparke : ‘ But it ’s up to you now , the general public .
You have to help the politicians to by telling people about this film and talking to your local cinema ’s and TV - stations .
Get the word out .
Only then can we create the momentum to get the debate to the political level . ’
Question ( from myself ) :
‘ In the aftermath of 9/11 and in the period leading up to the war in the Middle East , the Bush administration ; President Bush , Condoleezza Rice and particularly Vice President Dick Cheney ; have repeatedly lied to the American people and , by extension , to the world .
The crimes they have committed are much worse than those in the Watergate scandal .
So why are the American people not in an uproar ?
Why are these people still in power and not in jail ?
Is it a lack of political will ?
Griffin : ‘ Many people simply are misinformed and kept misinformed by the government and the mainstream media .
As for political will , we live in a plutocracy , not a democracy . ’
Chiesa :
‘ For many people 9/11 is simply too controversial .
There is a very strong psychological opposition to 9/11 truth .
For most people , considering a conspiracy theory …’ ‘… other than the official theory , which is – obviously – also a conspiracy theory . ’
Chiesa : ‘ Yes , indeed – so considering another conspiracy theory about 9/11 is taboo .
We must overcome this taboo and we must overcome this total lack of information .
We must break this wall of silence .
We must break free from the web and fight the mainstream media .
This film is an instrument to do that .
We need voices of different levels of society .
We need not convince them that we are right .
We need to convince them there is a problem that must be investigated … re-investigated .
But you have to show them what happened .
You can not convince people by telling them about 9/11 .
They need to see it – hence the film .
At this moment , there is one person in the room who gives criticism on the film , claiming that the feels there are incorrect theories in the documentary .
He feels the wing damage in the Pentagon is clearly visible and that Steven Jones ’ claims about the thermite / thermate are not proven .
He also claims that a response by jet fighters during the attack was in fact ordered .
He gave no explanation as to where he got his information .
He said he was a muslim and at the European Parliament as an independent , ready to defend himself against the reaction of the public who had started ‘ boo’ing .
One person ’s behaviour was unbecoming in my opinion when she shouted ‘ Who paid you ? ’
While I do not agree with the person ’s assertions , I do respect his opinion .
The director of the movie went on to explain that in the movie they were not able to show everything in detail ( the movie would become too long ) and that – again – it was an instrument to provoke action on the part of the viewer .
A few more – and rather interesting questions and remarks – came from the audience and were addressed by the panel .
By now it was getting very late ( partly because of the delay of the movie screening ) and Mr Chiesa wanted to wrap up the event by making a closing statement .
Chiesa : ‘ A new American commission is inconceivable .
But a European commission is inconceivable too .
We have no jurisdiction .
The US - government would never allow it .
It would have to be an international group of ‘ Wise Men & Women ’ such as previous heads of state , engineers , artists , scholars , first responders , survivors , witnesses and so forth .
We realize we still have a long road ahead .
But we can create change !’
Griffin : ‘ I ’ve always said that the truth will come out of friendly countries .
If Iran or Korea were to tell us 9/11 was an inside job , we would not believe it .
They ’re just saying that , because they ’re our enemies .
But if Japan , Europe or even an individual European country would say ‘ We have examined the evidence …
The war on terror is a hoax !’ , then the American press would no longer be able to ignore it .
They would have to publish it and then the US - government would be forced to respond . ’
Editor ’s note : the text above is written from extensive notes taken during the debate , but it ’s is inevitable incomplete .
It ’s the gist of the debate .
Otherwise it would become too long .
Also , it is not an exact word - for - word transcript , as the debate was not recorded ( by me ) .
It is the best representation I could give of the event , staying as close to the actual text as I could distill from my notes .
Several videos will be made available soon , so you can see the whole of the debate .
Until such time , I felt it important to share my impressions .
Thank you for understanding 9/11 Belgium 's TM and © 2007 - present Mark Dermul
EPA staff say Cheney had role in quashing California emissions standards RAW STORY
Published : Friday December 21 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Ford , GM wo n't deny claims executives met VP Multiple staffers at the Environmental Protection Agency told the ( registratiton - restricted )
Los Angeles Times for Friday 's editions that Bush Administration appointee Stephen Johnson , who heads the agency , quashed California 's plan to regulate automobile emissions single - handedly , going against the wishes of nearly all of his staff .
The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ignored his staff 's written findings in denying California 's request for a waiver to implement its landmark law to slash greenhouse gases from vehicles , sources inside and outside the agency told the Times ' Janet Wilson on Thursday .
" California met every criteria . . . on the merits .
The same criteria we have used for the last 40 years on all the other waivers , " said an EPA staffer Wilson quoted .
" We told him that .
All the briefings we have given him laid out the facts . "
California had sought a waiver from the federal emissions standards to implement a law which would further restrict emissions .
According to Wilson , " Some staff members believe Johnson made his decision after auto executives met with Vice President Dick Cheney and after a Chrysler executive delivered a letter to the White House outlining why neither California nor the EPA should be allowed to regulate greenhouse gases , among other reasons .
The Detroit News reported Wednesday that chief executives of Ford and Chrysler met with Cheney last month . "
In November , Detroit News reported Cheney met with Chrysler Chairman and CEO Robert Nardelli on Halloween and with Ford Motor Co. president and CEO Alan R. Mulally on October 24 .
" Cheney , who was chairman and CEO of energy services giant Halliburton Corp. , has taken an active interest in energy policy and auto regulations since becoming vice president , " David Shepardson reported .
" He attended President Bush 's meetings with the CEOs of Detroit 's three automakers in November 2006 and in March this year . "
Wilson tells the LA Times , " Clearly the White House said , ' We 're going to get EPA out of the way and get California out of the way , " said a quoted EPA employee .
" If you give us this energy bill , then we 're done , the deal is done . ' "
His staff " worked for months " on the decision and concluded the opposite of what Johnson announced as his reasoning for blocking California 's law , the paper said .
Johnson said there was no need for separate state regulations on fuel economy because Bush had just signed another fuel economy bill -- albeit weaker -- and he did n't want a " patchwork " of state regulations .
" Technical and legal staff also concluded that if the waiver were denied , EPA would very likely lose in court to the state , " Wilson wrote , citing three EPA sources .
" It 's very highly unusual , " another source with close ties to the agency told the paper .
Johnson could not be reached for comment .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said through a spokesman Thursday that he would sue the EPA over its decision .
Neither a Chrysler nor a Ford spokeswoman would comment to the paper as to whether either of the automakers ' executives met Cheney .

Question :
Is the " surge " working as Bush claims or is the sudden lull in the violence due to other factors like demographic changes in Baghdad ?
Nir Rosen : I think that even calling it a surge is misleading .
A surge is fast ; this took months .
It was more like an ooze .
The US barely increased the troop numbers .
It mostly just forced beleaguered American soldiers to stay longer .
At the same time , the US doubled their enemies because , now , they 're not just fighting the Sunni militias but the Shiite Mahdi army also .
No , I do n't think the surge worked .
Objectively speaking , the violence is down in Baghdad , but that 's mainly due to the failure of the US to establish security .
That 's not success .
Sure , less people are being killed but that 's because there are less people to kill .
The violence in Iraq was not senseless or crazy , it was logical and teleological .
Shiite militias were trying to remove Sunnis from Baghdad and other parts of the country , while Sunni militias were trying to remove Shiites , Kurds and Christians from their areas .
This has been a great success .
So you have millions of refugees and millions more internally displaced , not to mention hundreds of thousands dead .
There are just less people to kill .
Moreover , the militias have consolidated their control over some areas .
The US never thought that Muqtada al Sadr would order his Mahdi Army to halt operations ( against Sunnis , rival Shiites and Americans ) so that he could put his house in order and remove unruly militiamen .
And , the US never expected that Sunnis would see that they were losing the civil war so they might as well work with the Americans to prepare for the next battle .
More importantly , violence fluctuates during a civil war , so people try to maintain as much normalcy in their lives as possible .
It 's the same in Sarajevo , Beirut or Baghdad --- people marry , party , go to school when they can --- and hide at home or fight when they must .
The euphoria we see in the American media reminds me of the other so - called milestones that came and went while the overall trend in Iraq stayed the same .
Now Iraq does n't exist anymore .
Thats the most important thing to remember .
there is no Iraq .
There is no Iraqi government and none of the underlying causes for the violence have been addressed , such as the mutually exclusive aspirations of the rival factions and communities in Iraq .
Question :
Are we likely to see a " Phase 2 " in the Iraq war ?
In other words , will we see the Shia eventually turn their guns on US occupation forces once they 're confident that the Ba'athist - led resistance has been defeated and has no chance of regaining power ?
Nir Rosen : Shiite militias have been fighting the Americans on and off since 2004 but there 's been a steady increase in the past couple of years .
That 's not just because the Americans saw the Mahdi army as one of the main obstacles to fulfilling their objectives in Iraq , but also because Iraq 's Shiites --- especially the Mahdi army --- are very skeptical of US motives .
They view the Americans as the main obstacle to achieving their goals in Iraq .
Ever since Zalmay Khalilzad took over as ambassador ; Iraq 's Shiites have worried that the Americans would turn on them and throw their support behind the Sunnis .
That 's easy to understand given that Khalilzad 's mandate was to get the Sunnis on board for the constitutional referendum .
( Khalilzad is also a Sunni himself )
But , yes , to answer your question ; we could see a " Phase 2 " if the Americans try to stay in Iraq longer or , of course , if the US attacks Iran .
Then you 'll see more Shiite attacks on the Americans .
Question : Hundreds of Iraqi scientists , professors , intellectuals and other professionals have been killed during the war .
Also , there seems to have been a plan to target Iraq 's cultural icons --- museums , monuments , mosques , palaces etc .
Do you think that there was a deliberate effort to destroy the symbols of Iraqi identity -- to wipe the slate clean -- so that the society could be rebuilt according to a neoliberal , " free market " model ?
Nir Rosen :
There certainly was no plan on the part of the occupying forces .
In fact , that 's the main reason that things have gone so horribly wrong in Iraq ; there was no plan for anything ; good or bad .
The looting was not " deliberate " American policy .
It was simply incompetence .
The destruction of Iraq 's cultural icons was incompetence , also --- as well as stupidity , ignorance and criminal neglect .
I do n't believe that there was really any deliberate malice in the American policy ; regardless of the malice with which it may have been implemented by the troops on the ground .
The destruction of much of Iraq was the result of Islamic and sectarian militias -- both Sunni and Shiite - - seeking to wipe out hated symbols .
The Americans did n't know enough about Iraq to intentionally execute such a plan even if it did exist .
And , I do n't think it did .
Question :
The media rarely mentions the 4 million refugees created by the Iraq war .
What do you think the long - term effects of this humanitarian crisis will be ?
Nir Rosen :
Well , the smartest Iraqis -- the best educated , the professionals , the middle and upper classes --- have all left or been killed .
So the society is destroyed .
So there is no hope for a non-sectarian Iraq now .
The refugees are getting poorer and more embittered .
Their children cannot get an education and their resources are limited .
Look at the Palestinian refugee crisis .
In 1948 you had about 800,000 Palestinians expelled from their homes and driven into Lebanon , Syria , Jordan and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Over time , they were politicized , mobilized and militarized .
The militias they formed to liberate their homeland were manipulated by the governments in the region and they became embroiled in regional conflicts , internal conflicts and , tragically , conflicts with each other .
They were massacred in Lebanon and Jordan .
And , contributed to instability in those countries .
Now you have camps in Lebanon producing jihadists who go to fight in Iraq or who fight the Lebanese Army .
And this is all from a population of just 800,000 mostly rural , religiously - homogeneous ( Sunni ) refugees .
Now , you have 2 million Iraqi refugees in Syria , a million in Jordan and many more in other parts of the Middle East .
The Sunnis and Shiites already have ties to the militias .
They are often better educated , urban , and have accumulated some material wealth .
These refugees are increasingly sectarian and are presently living in countries with a delicate sectarian balance and very fragile regimes .
Many of the refugees will probably link up with Islamic groups and threaten the regimes of Syria and Jordan .
They 're also likely to exacerbate sectarian tensions in Lebanon .
They 're also bound to face greater persecution as they " wear out their welcome " and put a strain on the country 's resources .
They 'll probably form into militias and either try go home or attempt to overthrow the regimes in the region .
Borders will change and governments will fall .
A new generation of fighters will emerge and there 'll be more attacks on Americans .
Question :
You have compared Iraq to Mogadishu .
Could you elaborate ?
Nir Rosen : Somalia has n't had a government since 1991 .
I 've been to Mogadishu twice .
Its ruled by warlords who control their own fiefdoms .
Those who have money can live reasonably well .
That 's what it 's like in Iraq now --- a bunch of independent city - states ruled by various militias --- including the American militia and British militias .
Of course , Somalia is not very important beyond the Horn of Africa .
It 's bordered by the sea , Kenya and Ethiopia .
There 's no chance of the fighting in Somalia spreading into a regional war .
Iraq is much more dangerous in that respect .
Question :
Is the immediate withdrawal of all US troops really the best option for Iraq ?
Nir Rosen :
It really does n't matter whether the Americans stay or leave .
There are no good options for Iraq ; no solutions .
The best we can hope for is that the conflict wo n't spread .
The best thing we can say about the American occupation is that it may soften the transition for the ultimate break up of Iraq into smaller fragments .
A couple of years ago , I said that the Americans should leave to prevent a civil war and to allow the ( Sunni ) rejectionists to join the government once the occupation ended .
Turns out , I was right ; but , obviously , it 's too late now .
The civil war has already been fought and won in many places , mainly by the Shiite militias .
The Americans are still the occupying force , which means that they must continue to repress people that did n't want them there in the first place .
But , then , if you were to ask a Sunni in Baghdad today what would happen if the Americans picked up and left , he 'd probably tell you that the remaining Sunnis would be massacred .
So , there 's no " right answer " to your question about immediate withdrawal .
Question : November is the 3rd anniversary of the US siege of Falluja .
Could you explain what happened in Falluja and what it means to Iraqis and the people in the Middle East ?
Nir Rosen : Falluja was a poor industrial town known only for its kabob which Iraqis stopped to get on the way to picnic at lake Habbaniya .
There were no attacks on the Americans from Falluja during the combat - phase of the US invasion .
When Saddam 's regime fell , the Fallujans began administering their own affairs until the Americans arrived .
The US military leaders saw the Sunnis as the " bad guys " , so they treated them harshly .
At first , the Fallujans ignored the rough treatment because the tribal leaders leaders wanted to give the Americans a chance .
Then there was a incident , in April 2003 , where US troops fired on a peaceful demonstration and killed over a dozen unarmed civilians .
This , more than anything else , radicalized the people and turned them against the Americans .
In the spring of 2004 , four ( Blackwater ) American security contractors were killed in Falluja .
Their bodies were burned and dismembered by an angry crowd .
It was an insult to America 's pride .
In retaliation , the military launched a massive attack which destroyed much of the city and killed hundreds of civilians .
The US justified the siege by saying that it was an attack on foreign fighters that ( they claimed ) were hiding out in terrorist strongholds .
In truth , the townspeople were just fighting to defend their homes , their city , their country and their religion against a foreign occupier .
Some Shiite militiamen actually fought with the Sunnis as a sign of solidarity .
In late 2004 , the Americans completely destroyed Falluja forcing tens of thousands of Sunnis to seek refuge in western Baghdad .
This is when the sectarian clashes between the Sunnis and Shiites actually began .
The hostilities between the two groups escalated into civil war .
Falluja has now become a symbol throughout the Muslim world of the growing resistance to American oppression .
Question :
The political turmoil in Lebanon continues even though the war with Israel has been over for more than a year .
Tensions are escalating because of the upcoming presidential elections which are being closely monitored by France , Israel and the United States .
Do you see Hezbollah 's role in the political process as basically constructive or destructive ?
Is Hezbollah really a " terrorist organization " as the Bush administration claims or a legitimate resistance militia that is necessary for deterring future Israeli attacks ?
Nir Rosen : Hizballah is not a terrorist organization .
It is a widely popular and legitimate political and resistance movement .
It has protected Lebanon 's sovereignty and resisted American and Israeli plans for a New Middle East .
It 's also among the most democratic of Lebanon 's political movements and one of the few groups with a message of social justice and anti imperialism .
The Bush Administration is telling its proxies in the Lebanese government not to compromise on the selection of the next president .
This is pushing Lebanon towards another civil war , which appears to be the plan .
The US also started civil wars in Iraq , Gaza and Somalia .
Question :
The humanitarian situation in Somalia is steadily worsening .
The UN reports that nearly 500,000 Somalis have fled Mogadishu and are living in makeshift tent cities with little food or water .
The resistance -- backed by the former government -- the Islamic Courts Union -- is gaining strength and fighting has broken out in 70 % of the neighborhoods in Mogadishu .
Why is the US backing the invading Ethiopian army ?
Is Somalia now facing another bloody decades - long war or is there hope that the warring parties can resolve their differences ?
Nir Rosen :
After a decade and a half without a government and the endless fighting of clan - based militias ; clan leaders decided to establish the Islamic Courts ( Somalis are moderate Shaafi Muslims ) to police their own people and to prevent their men provoking new conflicts .
Islam was the only force powerful enough to unite the Somalis ; and it worked .
There have only been a half - dozen or so Al Qaida suspects who have - at one time or another --- entered or exited through Somalia .
But the Islamic Courts is not an al Qaida organization .
Still , US policy in the Muslim world is predicated on the " War on Terror " , so there 's an effort to undermine any successful Islamic model , whether it 's Hamas in Gaza , or Hizballah in Lebanon .
The US backed the brutal Somali warlords and created a counter - terrorism coalition which the Somalis saw as anti-Islamic .
The Islamic Court militias organized a popular uprising that overthrew the warlords and restored peace and stability to much of Somalia for the first time in more than a decade .
The streets were safe again , and exiled Somali businessmen returned home to help rebuild .
I was there during this time .
The Americans and Ethiopians would not tolerate the new arrangement .
The Bush administration sees al Qaeda everywhere .
So , they joined forces with the Ethiopians because Ethiopia 's proxies were overthrown in Mogadishu and because they feel threatened by Somali nationalism .
With the help of the US , the Ethiopian army deposed the Islamic Courts and radicalized the population in the process .
Now Somalia is more violent than ever and jihadi - type groups are beginning to emerge where none had previously existed .
Question : The US - led war in Afghanistan is not going well .
The countryside is controlled by the warlords , the drug trade is flourishing , and America 's man in Kabul , Hamid Karzai , has little power beyond the capital .
The Taliban has regrouped and is methodically capturing city after city in the south .
Their base of support , among disenchanted Pashtuns , continues to grow .
How important is it for the US to succeed in Afghanistan ?
Would failure threaten the future of NATO or the Transatlantic Alliance ?
Nir Rosen : Although the US has lost in Afghanistan ; what really matters is Pakistan .
That 's where the Taliban and al Qaeda are actually located .
No , I 'm NOT saying that the US should take the war into Pakistan .
The US has already done enough damage .
But as long as America oppresses and alienates Muslims ; they will continue to fight back .
Question : The Gaza Strip has been under Israeli sanctions for more than a year .
Despite the harsh treatment --- the lack of food , water and medical supplies
( as well as the soaring unemployment and the random attacks in civilian areas ) --- there have been no retaliatory suicide attacks on Israeli civilians or IDF soldiers .
Is n't this proof that Hamas is serious about abandoning the armed struggle and joining the political process ?
Should Israel negotiate directly with the " democratically elected " Hamas or continue its present strategy of shoring up Mahmoud Abbas and the PA ?
Nir Rosen : Hamas won democratic elections that were widely recognized as free and fair ; that is , as free and as fair as you can expect when Israel and America are backing one side while trying to shackle the other .
Israel and the US never accepted the election results .
That 's because Hamas refuses to capitulate .
Also , Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood which is active in Egypt and Jordan and both those countries fear an example of a Muslim brothers in government , and they fear an example of a movement successfully defying the Americans and Israelis , so they backed Fatah .
Everyone fears that these Islamic groups will become a successful model of resistance to American imperialism and hegemony .
The regional dictators are especially afraid of these groups , so they work with the Americans to keep the pressure on their political rivals .
Mahmoud Abbas ' Fatah collaborates with the US and Israel to undermine Hamas and force the government to collapse .
Although they have failed so far ; the US and Israel continue to support the same Fatah gangs that attempted the coup to oust Hamas .
The plan backfired , and Hamas gunmen managed to drive Fatah out of Gaza after a number of violent skirmishes .
Israel should stop secretly supporting Fatah and adopt the " One State " solution .
It should grant Palestinians and other non-Jews equal rights , abandon Zionism , allow Palestinian refugees to return , compensate them , and dismantle the settlements .
If Israel does n't voluntarily adopt the One State solution and work for a peaceful transition , ( like South Africa ) then eventually it will be face expulsion by the non Jewish majority in Greater Palestine , just like the French colonists in Algeria .
This is not a question of being " pro " or " anti " Israel ; that 's irrelevant when predicting the future , and for any rational observer of the region it 's clear that Israel is not a viable state in the Middle East as long as it is Zionist .
Question :
The US military is seriously over - stretched .
Still , many political analysts believe that Bush will order an aerial assault on Iran .
Do you think the US will carry out a " Lebanon - type " attack on Iran ; bombing roads , bridges , factories , government buildings , oil depots , Army bases , munitions dumps , airports and nuclear sites ?
Will Iran retaliate or simply lend their support to resistance fighters in Afghanistan and Iraq ?
Nir Rosen : I think it 's quite likely that Bush will attack Iran ; not because he has a good reason to , but because Jesus or God told him to and because Iran is part of the front - line resistance ( along with Hizballah , Syria and Hamas ) to American hegemony in the region .
Bush believes nobody will have the balls to go after the Iranians after him .
He believes that history will vindicate him and he 'll be looked up to as a hero , like Reagan .
There is also a racist element in this .
Bush thinks that Iran is a culture based on honor and shame .
He believes that if you humiliate the Iranian regime , then the people will rise up and overthrow it .
Of course , in reality , when you bomb a country the people end up hating you and rally around the regime .
Just look at the reaction of the Serbs after the bombing by NATO , or the Americans after September 11 .
Iran is more stable than Iraq and has a stronger military .
Also , the US is very vulnerable in the region --- both in Iraq and Afghanistan .
America 's allies are even more vulnerable .
An attack on Iran could ignite a regional war that would spiral out of control .
Nothing good would come of it .
The Bush administration needs to negotiate with Iran and pressure Israel to abandon its nuclear weapons .
Question : Bush 's war on terror now extends from the southern border of Somalia to the northern tip of Afghanistan --- from Africa , through the Middle East into Central Asia .
The US has not yet proven --- in any of these conflicts -- that it can enforce its will through military means alone .
In fact , in every case , the military appears to be losing ground .
And it 's not just the military that 's bogged down either .
Back in the United States , the economy is rapidly deteriorating .
The dollar is falling , the housing market is collapsing , consumer spending is shrinking , and the country 's largest investment banks are bogged down with over $ 200 billion in mortgage - backed debt .
Given the current state of the military and the economy , do you see any way that the Bush administration can prevail in the war on terror or is US power in a state of irreversible decline ?
Nir Rosen : Terror is a tactic ; so you can't go to war with it in the first place .
You can only go to war with people or nations .
To many people it seems like the US is at war with Muslims .
This is just radicalizing more people and eroding America 's power and influence in the world .
But , then , maybe that 's not such a bad thing .
Bio : Nir Rosen is a Fellow at the New America Foundation who has written extensively on American policy in Afghanistan and Iraq .

This bit of political hackery brought to you by MSNBC :
3. John Edwards
Former North Carolina senator Last Ranking : 3
Does he really want to be the white guy , playing the white candidate ?
So this passes for political discourse at MSNBC ?
We 've been documenting the horrible treatment Edwards has gotten from the media and polls showing him to be the best candidate against all GOP candidates going unmentioned , but this takes the cake .
I honestly thought this was a joke at first glance , but to my horror , it was not .
Write a letter to MSNBC and tell them what you think .
( h/t Heather )
Our whole team will be bringing you full coverage of tonight ’s debate .
And I will too .
I confess though I find it a funny thing to cover .
Biden is a policy - knowledgable , well - meaning guy who ’s been in elected office most of his adult life .
Trump is a compulsive liar with little interest in or knowledge about any policy question currently working to delegitimize the election itself .
Both will play to form because neither are capable of doing otherwise .
This means that what we are watching , what we are all collectively evaluating are the possibilities of unpredictable events and the general optics and how those impact the very small number of voters who are not strongly committed to either candidate .
It ’s almost impossible that any of these ‘ events ’ will have any substantive bearing on how either man would serve as President .
And yet , as we know they can have a big impact .
Harvard scientists have embarked upon an ambitious program to create a circuit diagram of the human brain , with the help of new machines that automatically turn brain tissue into high - resolution neural maps .
By mapping every synapse in the brain , researchers hope to create a " connectome " – a diagram that would elucidate the brain 's activity at a level of detail far outstripping today 's most advanced brain - monitoring tools like fMRI .
" You 're going to see things you did n't expect , " said Jeff Lichtman , a Harvard professor of molecular and cellular biology .
" It gives us an opportunity to witness this vast complicated universe that has been largely inaccessible until now . "
The effort is part of a new field of scientific research called connectomics .
The field is so new that the first course ever taught on it recently ended at MIT .
It is to neuroscience what genomics is to genetics .
Where genetics looks at individual genes or groups of genes , genomics looks at the entire genetic complement of an organism .
Connectomics makes a similar jump in scale and ambition , from studying individual cells to studying swaths of the brain containing millions of cells .
A full set of images of the human brain at synapse - level resolution would contain hundreds of petabytes of information , or about the total amount of storage in Google 's data centers , Lichtman estimates .
Machine Peels Brain , So Scientists Can Map Synapses
It slices , it dices and it heralds the arrival of a new era of neuroscience that focuses on industrializing the process of mapping the brain .
It 's a neuroscience gadget called the automatic tape - collecting lathe ultramicrotome ( ATLUM ) , and the name says it all .
An ultramicrotome is a piece of laboratory equipment that cuts samples of flesh into very thin slices .
The lathe allows the machine to cut continuously , which makes the process faster .
Already , the prototype has collected more than a hundred half - centimeter - long sections of mouse brain .
Once the slices have been stuck onto a piece of transparent tape , the scientists use a scanning electron microscope to actually image the cells .
Harvard molecular biology professor Jeff Lichtman 's lab partnered with optical equipment company JEOL to automate the process of imaging and ordering those images .
" We will go to each section of tissue that the ATLUM has deposited and identify the region of that section that contains the important information , like the wiring of the neurons , " said Charles Nielsen , a product manager and vice president at JEOL .
" Then we 'll do a series of montage maps on each section . "
Continued on page 2
A map of the mind 's circuitry would allow researchers to see the wiring problems that might underpin disorders like autism and schizophrenia .
" The ' wiring diagram ' of the brain could help us understand how the brain computes , how it wires itself up during development and rewires itself in adulthood , " said Sebastian Seung , a computational - neuroscience professor at MIT .
But with 100 billion neurons in the human brain , mapping them is an impossibly complex task for humans alone .
An early " by hand " connectomics effort by Sydney Brenner of the Salk Institute studied the roundworm and its meager 300 nervous - system cells :
It took a decade to complete .
Michael Huerta , associate director of the National Institute of Mental Health for scientific technology research , said that connectomics will fill a key gap in our understanding of the brain .
" You could conceivably know every chemical and every molecule of every cell in the brain , but unless you understand how those cells are connected to each other , you have no idea how information is being processed , " Huerta said .
" The connectome , in my opinion , is really what it 's all about . "
Lichtman 's lab is creating what could be the equivalent of the genome sequencing machine , which dramatically sped up the race to map the human genome .
It 's an automated brain peeler and imager they call ATLUM ( sidebar , left ) .
ATLUM uses a lathe and specialized knife to create long , thin strips of brain cells that can be imaged by an electron microscope .
Software will eventually montage the images , creating an ultrahigh - resolution 3 - D reconstruction of the mouse brain , allowing scientists to see features only 50 nanometers across .
" It works like an apple peeler , " Lichtman said .
" Our machine takes a brain , peels off a surface layer , and puts it all on tape .
These technologies will allow us to get to the finest resolution , where every single synapse is accounted for . "
Connectomics differs from other efforts to map the brain not just because of its methods , but also the type of information it seeks .
While the Brain Atlas , funded by Paul Allen , maps the genes of a mouse brain , Lichtman 's lab is gathering anatomical detail .
He 's looking at the physical features of cells , like the size of their synaptic vesicles , which store neurotransmitters essential for cell communication .
" My background is in neuroanatomy , and to see ( connectomics ) data is stunning , " Huerta said .
" Like the Human Genome Project , this work is giving us a whole new level of information .
The neuroscience community in general is very excited about it . "
Machine Peels Brain , So Scientists Can Map Synapses
Continued from page 1
The technological hurdles of stitching together thousands of images ( each 5,000 x 4,000 pixels ) into a 3 - D reconstruction of the brain is daunting .
The team wants to complete the mouse - brain reconstruction in four years , but to hit that goal , Nielsen said the team would need up to 10 more electron microscopes to speed image taking .
" In the old days , we 'd make an injection and see a few cells light up , and that was that , " said Michael Huerta , associate director for scientific technology research at the National Institute of Mental Health .
" But as areas in science mature , they get to the point where they are generating huge amounts of data : in this case , data about connectivity in tissues . "
Better image - recognition technology , which turns photographic images into information that computers can use , could also increase the speed at which pictures of the brain are transformed into wiring diagrams .
" If our computers could automatically identify the synapses in the images , and trace axons and dendrites to their parent neurons , then they would be able to generate brain - wiring diagrams , " said Sebastian Seung , a computational neuroscience professor at MIT .
" Although we have made progress , we are still far from making computers ' smart ' enough to do this reliably .
This is a challenge at the frontier of computer science and artificial intelligence . "
Though he 's working on a massive scale , Lichtman 's inspiration comes from the desire to understand individual neurons .
Specifically , he wants to understand how neurons go from having dozens of connections at birth to having just a few .
Each cell pares down many weak connections , keeping just a few strong ones .
" Each baby nerve cell connects to 20 times the amount of nerve cells that it will have as an adult , " said Lichtman .
" We try to understand what the rules of pruning are .
If a nerve cell has 100 connections and needs to prune that down to five , the question is , which five ? "
The neurons fight to stay connected , and each competition affects the outcome for the rest of the cells , Lichtman said .
" So to understand the competition 's impact on one cell , you have to understand all of the competitions , " he said .
The net effect of all that neural " hand - to - hand combat " is what we call brain development , and it's what transforms a baby who can't walk , talk or operate a Blackberry into a modern , adult human being .
While connectomics researchers are very excited , they 're still just getting a handle on mouse - sized brains .
It could be a decade before data - crunching technology will be available to map the complexity of the human brain .
" Some say that the brain is the most complex structure in the universe , " said Seung .
" Right now it would be an incredible achievement just to find the connectome for a tiny animal like a fly . "
But the ATLUM could turn out to be as useful for connectomics researchers as technologies like sequencers turned out to be for genomics researchers .
Then Lichtman and his colleagues would be able to answer some of the most fundamental questions about what happens when you take unprogrammed human beings and release them into the world .
It 's the wiring , after all , that provides us with the flexibility that Lichtman calls " the magic of being human . "
" When a dragonfly is born , it has to know how to catch a mosquito , " Lichtman said .
" But for us , none of this is built in .
Our brains have to go through this profound education period that lasts until our second decade .
What is changing in our brains ? "
the poverty trap is still very much a reality in the U.S.
A woman called me out of the blue last week and told me her self - sufficiency counselor had suggested she get in touch with me .
She had moved from a $ 25,000 a year job to a $ 35,000 a year job , and suddenly she could n’t make ends meet any more .
I told her I did n’t know what I could do for her , but agreed to meet with her .
She showed me all her pay stubs etc .
She really did come out behind by several hundred dollars a month .
She lost free health insurance and instead had to pay $ 230 a month for her employer - provided health insurance .
Her rent associated with her section 8 voucher went up by 30 % of the income gain ( which is the rule ) .
She lost the ( $ 280 a month ) subsidized child care voucher she had for after - school care for her child .
She lost around $ 1600 a year of the EITC .
She paid payroll tax on the additional income .
Finally , the new job was in Boston , and she lived in a suburb .
So now she has $ 300 a month of additional gas and parking charges .
She asked me if she should go back to earning $ 25,000 .
Believe it or not , Microsoft is n't really serious in its bid to buy Yahoo , according to one financial analyst .
Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research has reached the unusual conclusion that Microsoft's $ 44.6 billion merger proposal is really just a ploy to fend off a potential deal between Yahoo and Amazon.com .
Could he possibly be right ?
Probably not .
Chowdhry 's Amazon.com theory is getting a lot of play on the Web right now , largely because the well respected analyst has been covering Yahoo closely for at least the last ten years .
But many analysts and other observers contend that Chowdhry 's argument that the deal is a " fake " just does n't hold water , in light of Microsoft 's well articulated -- and quite reasonable -- perception that it needs Yahoo in order to fend off Google on the Internet .
Advertisement
Beyond that , though , Amazon 's previous acquisition patterns over the past ten years do n't at all fit the pattern of a company likely to go shell out billions for another Internet company .
Also contrary to the view of other financial experts , Chowdhry goes further to suggest that a deal between Microsoft and Yahoo would n't get regulatory approval -- and further , that Microsoft might even know all that already .
" Yahoo 's management should make sure not to fall into the trap of a potentially fake bid , as Microsoft itself probably may be knowing that the chances of the deal going through ( are ) unlikely , " Chowdhry wrote in a research note this week .
Microsoft itself has denied all aspersions cast by Chowdhry on its intentions with Yahoo , issuing a written statement on the matter .
" As to Microsoft intentions , the report is completely incorrect .
As we made clear in our letter to the Yahoo board , our bid offers Yahoo employees and shareholders a significant premium and the opportunity to participate in the upside of the combined company , " it reads .
" We continue to believe that the proposed combination would receive all necessary regulatory approvals and expect that the proposed transaction would be completed in the second half of calendar year 2008 . "
Indeed , Microsoft 's Steve Ballmer did state in his letter to the Yahoo board that Microsoft is convinced a Yahoo buyout would clear all regulatory hurdles .
" We have dedicated considerable time and resources to ana analysis of a potential transaction and are confident that the combination will receive all necessary regulatory approvals , " Ballmer wrote .
Meanwhile , many other financial analysts are predicting that , although a Microsoft / Yahoo deal would face problems , there would also be upsides for both Microsoft and Yahoo .
" While a considerable amount of money , the deal makes strategic sense for Microsoft as it has failed to adequately monetize its band on the Internet , " Citigroup financial analyst Mark S. Mahaney said this week .
" The online advertising business has scale economics , and the addition of Yahoo would help accelerate the path to profitability for its Online Services division that has lost $ 1.25 billion in the last six quarters . "
Chowdhry bases his presumptions of some kind of Amazon deal on industry rumors .
" Contacts tell us that Yahoo has been probably thinking of shutting down its E - Commerce offering and forming a business tie up with Amazon.com , where users could create their own Merchant Stores - similar to what Yahoo did with shutting down its Music store in favor of Real Networks Rhapsody , " he wrote in his report .
" Contacts feel it is likely that these discussions could be taking a form of Amazon.com and Yahoo merger , which Microsoft probably did not like . "
The analyst probably did hear these tales , or he would n't have placed such weight on them .
Maybe these rumors had some basis , or maybe not .
But even if anyone at Yahoo ever has contemplated a merger with Amazon , it 's not very logical to suppose that the prospect of a deal was the only factor -- or even a factor at all -- in driving Microsoft 's bid for Yahoo .
Moreover , even far less than Microsoft , Amazon just does n't fit the profile of a company that would buy Yahoo .
It 's true that Amazon has been moving in the direction of content lately , particularly with its buyout of Audible.com .
But like all of the other acquisitions done by the retailer over the past decade , this was a relatively small merger .
In looking for mentions of Amazon 's buyouts over the past ten years , BetaNews came up with more than 15 deals .
But most of the companies popping up on the list are not major industry players : Internet Movie Database , purchased in 1998 , Chinese e-commerce Web site Joyo.com , in 2004 , and digital photography review Web site dpreview.com in 2007 .
In what might have been Amazon 's two biggest deals of all time , the company spent a total of $ 280 million of PlanetAll and data mining start - up Junglee.com way back in 1998 .
Yet on this entire roster , there 's nothing at all that comes anywhere near the size and scope of the $ 44.6 billion that Microsoft is willing to expend on Yahoo .
The NMA has been contending that red - light cameras ( RLCs ) are a detriment to motorist safety for many years .
People , both in the media and in the general public , often dismiss this claim as opinion , suggest that there is n’t enough data available yet , ask why we support people who run red lights ( we do n’t ) , or write off the organization as being biased .
The only way to combat this is through hard facts and independent research .
Luckily , we have both .
We reiterate our challenge :
If it ’s not about the money , then prove it .
No community has accepted , which should n’t be surprising considering the facts .
Here are five independent studies that demonstrate the failure of red - light cameras as a safety measure :
1 ) A Long Term Study of Red-Light Cameras and Accidents
David Andreassen
Australian Road Research Board
February , 1995
This study examined the long term effect on accident - types of red - light cameras at 41 signalized intersections in Melbourne , Australia .
The cameras were installed in 1984 , and reported accidents for the period 1979 to 1989 were used in the detailed analysis .
Quotes from the study :
“ The results of this study suggest that the installation of the RLC at these sites did not provide any reduction in accidents , rather there has been increases in rear end and adjacent approaches accidents on a before and after basis and also by comparison with the changes in accidents at intersection signals . ”
“ There has been no demonstrated value of the RLC as an effective countermeasure . ”

2 ) The Impact of Red Light Cameras ( Photo - Red Enforcement ) on Crashes in Virginia
Virginia Transportation Research Council
June 2007
The Virginia Transportation Research Council released a report expanding upon earlier research into the safety effects of red light cameras in Virginia .
Despite showing an increase in crashes , this study was instrumental in the return of red - light cameras to the state of Virginia .
With a proven negative safety impact , the clear incentive to bring back the cameras was money .
Quotes from the study :
“ After cameras were installed , rear - end crashes increased for the entire six- jurisdiction study area …
After controlling for time and traffic volume at each intersection , rear - end crash rates increased by an average of 27 % for the entire study area . ”
“ After cameras were installed , total crashes increased . ”
“ The impact of cameras on injury severity is too close to call . ”
“ Based only on the study results presented herein and without referencing other studies , the study did not show a definitive safety benefit associated with camera installation with regard to all crash types , all crash severities , and all crash jurisdictions . ”

3 ) The Red-Light Running Crisis : Is It Intentional ?
Office of the Majority Leader
U.S. House of Representatives
May 2001
This report was prepared by former House Majority Leader Dick Armey ’s staff .
It looks at the problems of red - light cameras and how to really deal with traffic - light violations .
Quoted from the study :
“ And one should ask the question , if there ’s a problem with an intersection , why do n’t safety engineers in the field just go out and fix the timing ?
In fact , before red light cameras arrived in the United States , that ’s exactly what our regulations instructed them to do .
If too many people enter on red at an intersection , engineers were supposed to lengthen its yellow time .
But in the year that red light cameras first started collecting millions in revenue on our shores , those entrusted with developing our traffic safety regulations dropped the requirement to fix signal timing , instructing engineers to “ use enforcement ” instead .
Indeed , according to the Federal Highway Administration , these problem intersections serve as a great location to hold a press conference .
The agency offers a script for local officials to exploit a tragically mistimed intersection to call for the installation of additional red light cameras and tout their safety benefits .
But none of the reports that are supposed to tell us that red light cameras are responsible safety benefits actually say that .
First , they dismiss increases in rear - end collisions associated with red light cameras as “ non-significant , ” despite evidence to the contrary .
Second , they do not actually look at red light intersection accidents .
The latest accident study in Oxnard , California , for example , only documents accident reductions “ associated with ” — not caused by — red light cameras .
Although that statement has little scientific value , it does have great marketing appeal if you do n’t look too closely .
Every study claiming red light cameras increase safety is written by the same man .
Before joining the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( IIHS ) , he was a top transportation official in New York City at the time the city began looking into becoming the first jurisdiction in the country to install red light cameras .
In other words , the father of the red light camera in America is the same individual offering the “ objective ” testimony that they are effective .
A similar conflict of interest affects those entrusted with writing safety regulations for our traffic lights .
The Institute of Transportation Engineers is actively involved in lobbying for , and even drafting legislation to implement , red light cameras .
They are closely tied to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( IIHS ) , which in turn is funded by companies that stand to profit handsomely any time points are assessed to a driver ’s license .
In short , the only documented benefit to red light cameras is to the pocketbook of local governments who use the devices to collect millions in revenue . ”

4 ) Investigation Of Crash Risk Reduction Resulting From Red-Light Cameras In Small Urban Areas
Mark Burkey , Ph.D. & Kofi Obeng , Ph.D .
North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University
July 2004
A study prepared by the North Carolina A&T State University ’s Urban Transit Institute for the United States Department of Transportation .
Quoted from the study :
“ Using a large data set , including 26 months before the introduction of RLCs , we analyze reported accidents occurring near 303 intersections over a 57 - month period , for a total of 17,271 observations .
Employing maximum likelihood estimation of Poisson regression models , we find that :
The results do not support the view that red light cameras reduce crashes .
Instead , we find that RLCs are associated with higher levels of many types and severity categories of crashes . ”

5 ) Evaluation of the Red- Light - Camera - Enforcement Pilot Project
Ontario Ministry of Transportation
December 2003
This report from Ontario , Canada ’s Ministry of Transportation ’s concluded that jurisdictions using photo enforcement experienced an overall increase in property damage and fatal and injury rear - end collisions .
The report also concludes that there was an overall reduction in serious accidents and angle collisions .
However , a closer look at the data found in this government - sponsored report show that intersections monitored by cameras experienced , overall , a 2 percent increase in fatal and injury collisions compared to a decrease of 12.7 percent in the camera - free intersections that were used as a control group ( page 21 ) .
In fact , the non-camera intersections fared better than the camera intersections in every accident category .
Quoted from the study :
“ Exhibit 2 indicates the red light running treatments have : * Contributed to a 4.9 per cent increase in fatal and injury rear - end collisions ; and
* Contributed to a 49.9 per cent increase in property damage only rear - end collisions .
The rear - end collision results are similar to findings in other red light camera studies . ”

WAR Declared Between Sam Lutfi & Adnan Ghalib ( Video )
Last night seemed to be another crazy drama filled night for .
It must have gotten pretty intense because Britney was seen jumping out of a vehicle in order to get away from pal .
Britney continued walking down Muhulland Drive by herself .
Britney was seen walking and frantically calling Adnan on her cellphone .
Her boyfriend told her to meet him at her house .
Upon arrival , Adnan was not able to get in because the code was changed on the security gate and he was informed by the guards that they were given strict instructions from Mr. Lutfi that Ghalib was not allowed on Spears property .
Along with changing the security codes , Sam reportedly changed all of Britney 's cell phone numbers .
Adnan spoke with one of his paparazzi friends last night and said that Lutfi was sending him threatening emails calling him " manic trigger " and saying " If you continue to have any contact with her , you will kill her . "
Luckily for Adnan , Britney is not going to let a little gate keep them apart .
Around 9 pm she was seen speeding down Coldwater Canyon Drive with a boatload of paparazzi in tow .
Spears left her car around 10 pm in San Fernando Valley and jumped into Adnan 's car .
Early this morning Britney was spotted at a drugstore with her mom , Lynne Spears , and Sam Lutfi .
Let 's hope she was picking up a prescription for med's .
TMZ has video of Britney crying after jumping out of Sam 's car .
It really is pretty awesome watching the Republican panic about Mike Huckabee set in , especially as he moves ahead in the polls in several states .
This quote from Sullivan really sums it up :
Every complacent secular Republican who has scorned those of us worried about the fundie right is beginning to squirm in the face of Huckabee ’s surge .
And squirm is putting it lightly .
Also via Sully , Ace :
Not that what one blogger thinks matters that much , but if Huckabee gets the nomination , I ’m voting Democratic .
It ’s not just an idle threat ; I just wo n’t vote for him and in fact wo n’t even vote third party or stay home .
Dan Riehl :
That Presidential “ R ” in 2008 will stand for nothing I believe in .
The guy is slick but does n’t even look competent .
And if Republican primary voters are that stupid , they deserve to lose next Fall .
To pass over McCain , Thompson , Romney and Giuliani ONLY because someone ’s slick and a Jesus Freak , which makes him your average televangelist – forget it .
We will pause for a moment to let it sink in that the Dan Riehl right now views actual social cons as “ Jesus Freaks . ”
Moving right along , Captain Ed ( not freaking out like the others , but seeing the writing on the wall ) :
Huckabee has gained credibility at an amazing rate in this race .
The biggest question is why .
It appears that the evangelicals have begun to make their voice heard in this race .
For months , they complained about the lack of choice for their constituency , even at one point threatening to splinter into a third party .
Instead , they seem to have collected themselves and looked for the most representative candidate in the race — and Huckabee has the strongest record on pro-life and social - conservative causes .
james Joyner has a solid round - up of what the op - ed writers are saying , including Peggy Noonan :
I wonder if our old friend Ronald Reagan could rise in this party , this environment .
Not a regular churchgoer , said he experienced God riding his horse at the ranch , divorced , relaxed about the faiths of his friends and aides , or about its absence .
He was a believing Christian , but he spent his adulthood in relativist Hollywood , and had a father who belonged to what some saw , and even see , as the Catholic cult .
I ’m just not sure he’d be pure enough to make it in this party .
I ’m not sure he’d be considered good enough .
I simply can not tell you how much I am enjoying this .
The GOP has been pandering to these stupid bastards for years , and every time I pointed it out I was called “ anti-Christian ” or something or other .
Those of us who saw what the party was becoming were told to shut up , that it was good politics .
Enjoy your new GOP , folks .
And here is something else to think about - are the evangelicals going to support Romney or Giuliani if you do manage to trash Huckabee enough to secure the nomination for them ?
Will the eye for an eye crowd learn to forgive and forget ?
Have fun !
*** Update ***
Someone else is enjoying this as much as me :
This , to me , is the critical distinction between a Christianist and a mere Christian .
One wants to infuse politics with religion ; the other wants to respect both , separately , and to keep religion private .
I should add I do not want to banish the word “ God ” from the public square .
But I do want that invocation to be as thin and as empty and as formal as the Founders intended .
The current Republican party has reinvented itself as a force on opposite grounds .
The party of Huckabee and Romney , the party of Hewitt and Dobson , the party of Ponnuru and Neuhaus is emphatically not a secular party .
And that is why part of me , I confess , wants Huckabee to win .
So he can lose .
So the GOP can lose – as spectacularly and humiliatingly as possible .
If we are to rid conservatism of this theocratic cancer , we need to start over .
Maybe it has to get worse before it can get better .
But it is certainly too late for fellow - traveling Christianists like Lowry and Krauthammer to start whining now .
This is their party .
And they asked for every last bit of it .
Can schadenfreude be fatal ?

PORTLAND , Ore. ( AP ) – Police used pepper spray on demonstrators protesting the Iraq war in downtown Portland on its fifth anniversary .
The demonstrators later hopped a train and headed for a military recruitment center across town .
Police Bureau spokesman Sgt. Brian Schmautz said Shawn Biggers , 23 , was arrested Wednesday and charged with assaulting an officer , disorderly conduct and interfering with an officer after he allegedly kicked a policeman in the knee .
Schmautz said police used “ a little pepper spray . ”
A group of about 100 demonstrators headed away from the confrontation toward a plaza for a rally , accompanied by police on bicycles , horseback and motorcycles .
They then piled onto a MAX light rail train to a shopping center located near a recruiting station .
A string of police motorcycles and a van of police in riot gear followed the train .
“ Sorry , no room for bikes , ” one of the riders told an officer who looked ready to board .
They marched from the Lloyd Center to the recruiting center , where a diminished group blew horns , beat drums and chanted , “ tear it down ” and “ end the silence , stop the violence . ”
Passing cars honked and waved , some impolitely .
Some protesters wore bandanna masks , carried black flags and identified themselves as anarchists , an established counterculture movement in Oregon , or as members of Students for a Democratic Society , a strident anti-war group that flourished mostly in the 1960s and 1970s on many college campuses .

Whose child is this , really ?
A lesbian couple , who together conceived a child six months ago , is now demanding that the Interior Ministry jointly register them as the child ’s biological parents , rather than having to undergo an adoption process as has been the case with same - sex couples to date .
The Ramat Gan Family Court has set precedent for such a request , by allowing one of the partners to act as a surrogate for the other , and now the couple also wants formal recognition as their son ’s biological parents .
The two women have lived together for over 10 years , and were even married by a Conservative rabbi three years ago , indicating their emotional and fiscal commitment to one another .
They also entered into a life partnership agreement signed by a notary public two years ago , officially anchoring their status as committed , life - long partners .
Further augmenting their relationship , the women then decided to conceive a child together who would be biologically their own to the greatest extent possible .
With the approval of the Ministry of Health , one woman ’s eggs were fertilized using an anonymous sperm donor , and were then implanted into her partner .
In essence , this situation is no different than that of a surrogate mother , which is always formally recognized as her child ’s biological mother .
The couple ’s son was born seven months ago in the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva , but the Ministry of the Interior refused to register both women as his mothers .
Ironically , they were willing to register the “ birth mother ” as the child ’s parent , but not her partner — who is genetically and biologically the child ’s mother .
With help of attorney Na’ama Tzoref ( Halevi ) the two women have now filed suit against the Attorney General demanding to be formally recognized as their son ’s biological parents , so that they do not have to undergo an adoption process as has been the case with same - sex couples hitherto .
' Adoption erroneous course of action in this case '
Attorney Tzoerf told Ynet : “ Petitioning for adoption is not the right course of action in this case .
The Interior Ministry ought to recognize these children of same - sex couples just as they do those of heterosexual couples .
After all , no one examines the genetic link between father and child when it comes to married couples . ”
The two women involved said that the right to parent a child , biologically and legally , is an integral part of life , and is thus their fundamental human right .
This right , they maintained , is especially important in light of the non-conventional family unit that they are trying to establish .
“ Same - sex families suffer from a great deal of discrimination and intolerance .
Not giving legal sanction to such unions further entrenches such prejudice , ” they said in a statement .
The couple also noted that rejecting their petition is “ tantamount to the court stating that people who are not heterosexual are unfit to be biological parents , ” and that it will “ magnify and echo the negative messages that their child will undoubtedly absorb from the public . ”
Here ’s an evolutionist ’s dream : 10,000 planet Earths , starting from the same point at the same time , and left to their own devices for four and a half billion years .
What would happen ?
Could you go on safari from one planet to the next seeing an endless procession of wildly different organisms ?
Or would many of the planets be home to life forms that are broadly similar ?
The conventional answer to this question — the one championed by the late Stephen Jay Gould , for example — is that chance events , from mutations to asteroids , play such a large role in evolution that each of the planets would be totally different .
And probably , after four and a half billion years , they would be .
I wish we could do the experiment , though .
It might hold some surprises .
Looking around the Earth , it ’s striking how often similar traits evolve in similar environments .
So : birds living on remote islands typically lose the power of flight .
Males in species ( be they chimpanzees or yellow dung flies ) where females are promiscuous tend to evolve high sperm counts and large testes .
Animals that live in caves lose their eyes and their color : whether they live in Rwanda or Romania , they ’re a pallid , blind lot , the troglodytes .
Mammals that specialize on eating leaves — be they cows or langurs ( that ’s a monkey ) — have evolved foreguts where bacteria break down the leaves , as well as special enzymes to help with digestion .
Amazingly , the same phenomena are also seen in the hoatzin , a leaf - eating bird from South America .
In short , evolution has a remarkable tendency to repeat itself .
That this happens has been known for decades .
But now we ’re unpicking the genetic basis for the repetitions .
And the startling thing is , evolution often repeats itself at the genetic level , too .
As an example , take three - spine sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ) .
These little fish usually live in the ocean , but like salmon , they come into rivers to spawn .
As the glaciers retreated at the end of the last ice age — a process that went on between ten and twenty thousand years ago — a series of lakes began to form in the northern hemisphere , and the sticklebacks moved into them .
Initially , the lakes would have been linked to the oceans by streams and rivers , but as the glaciers retreated , the land rose up ( ice is heavy ) , and the exits to the lakes closed , leaving the sticklebacks in each lake marooned and isolated .
And so the animals stuck there began evolving to live exclusively in freshwater .
Which is a real - life version of the evolutionist ’s dream : each lake is an evolutionary experiment , a natural laboratory .
Because there are so many lakes , the experiment has been repeated many times ; and because we know the ages of the lakes , we know roughly how long each experiment has been going on .
And sure enough , fish in different lakes have evolved a variety of similar features , repeatedly and independently .
Marine sticklebacks , for example , boast body armor : from head to tail , they are covered in rows of bony plates .
Many freshwater sticklebacks have lost these .
In marine sticklebacks , the pelvis is a complicated affair that comes complete with a pair of long spines .
In some freshwater populations , individuals have a much reduced , lopsided pelvic structure .
In others , they have just a remnant , a small , lopsided bone : the ghost of pelvis past .
Mutations to a gene called Ectodysplasin have been implicated as the major culprit in loss of armor ; another gene , Pitx1 , has been fingered as the main agent of pelvis reduction .
Yet the means by which the two genes have effected their changes are different .
Take Ectodysplasin first .
In this case , a rare version of the gene exists at a low frequency in marine sticklebacks .
Two copies of the rare version ( you inherit one from each of your parents ) , and you have no plates .
Two copies of the regular version , and you have all the plates .
But if you have one of each , the sort of armor you have can vary .
Some individuals will have all their plates .
Others will have a sort of half - armor .
What seems to have happened is that when sticklebacks invaded each lake , some of the invaders carried this rare version with them .
In the ocean , being without body armor is deadly : it makes you vulnerable to predators .
But lakes do n’t have the same dangers as the ocean — and armor is heavy and makes you less agile .
Thus , in these new environments , being without body armor conferred a significant advantage , and so in lake after lake , the rare variant of the gene swept through the population .
Let ’s turn now to the ghostly pelvis .
Pelvic loss is much less common than armor loss .
But if you find sticklebacks that lack a pelvis , you can bet that they came from large , shallow lakes where the water is soft , there are no large fish that might act as predators , and the vegetation is dense .
Soft water has little calcium , and you need calcium to make the pelvic spines .
Shallow lakes that are thick with weeds are home to predators like dragonflies , which enjoy having a stickleback for breakfast .
And whereas the spines are a defense against being eaten by other fish — trout , say , or pike — and can actually induce the predator to spit out the stickleback instead of trying to swallow it , insect predators catch sticklebacks by grabbing the spines .
The difference between having a spiky pelvis or not is influenced by the expression of several genes , but as I said earlier , the main agent seems to be a gene called Pitx1 .
In sticklebacks with a proper pelvis , this gene is turned on at several different places in the developing fish , including the head , the pituitary and the spots on the side of the body where the pelvis should form .
In those without , Pitx1 is switched on everywhere except the pelvic region , and the pelvis does n’t grow .
There are a couple of interesting things about this discovery .
The first is that the molecular basis of the change from pelvis to no pelvis does not involve a mutation to the protein - coding region of the Pitx1 gene itself .
In other words , the protein made from the gene has n’t changed .
What has changed is the way the gene is expressed .
This is in contrast to the sorts of mutations one often reads about as being involved in evolution , which typically involve changes to the protein itself .
A second interesting feature of the stickleback pelvis is that — unlike the armor plates — the loss is probably due to mutations having occurred independently in the different populations .
What ’s more , changes to the use of Pitx1 are also implicated in pelvic loss in nine - spine sticklebacks ( Pungitius pungitius ) — yet nine - spine and three - spine sticklebacks have been going their own evolutionary ways for at least 10 million years .
Mice that have been genetically engineered to lack Pitx1 have a suite of abnormalities , including crushed faces and abnormal pituitaries , that cause them to die young .
Intriguingly , they also have a reduced pelvis and hind limbs , and as with the sticklebacks , the reduction is lopsided and shows a greater loss on the right than on the left .
Which makes you wonder .
Manatees — those charming marine mammals that cavort in the Florida keys and the West Indies — have also lost their hind legs .
All that ’s left of their pelvis is a lopsided bone , smaller on the right than on the left .
Could Pitx1 have been involved here , too ?
So far , no one knows for sure .
But I ’d put money on it .
The idea that the same gene could be involved in mediating evolution of the same trait in creatures as distantly related as mammals and fish is exciting .
And — to give one last example — while the relation between Pitx1 and the manatee ’s missing hind legs is speculative rather than proven , there is much stronger evidence that a gene called Kit ligand is involved in mediating the evolution of light skin color in both sticklebacks and people .
This gene is by no means the only one that affects human skin color ; nonetheless , genetic differences in the regulatory regions of this gene have a significant effect on how light or dark your skin will be , or whether you have blond hair .
In sticklebacks , meanwhile , pale skin often evolves in freshwater — perhaps as a disguise — and the change again maps to Kit ligand , and involves alterations in the way Kit ligand is expressed in particular tissues .
Here , I ’ve focused on one particular version of the evolutionist ’s dream .
But there are many others .
In northeastern Mexico , for instance , a small fish known as Astyanax has , on a number of occasions , taken up residence in caves : populations of the fish have been found in more than 25 caves , some of them hundreds of miles apart .
This system , too , is giving us a glimpse of the genetics of repeated evolution .
And I have n’t even mentioned the hundreds of actual experiments — bacteria or yeasts evolving for generations in the laboratory .
Yet all these systems show the same thing : at the genetic level , evolution is , to a remarkable extent , a repeater .

The United States says it might have to build a special export version of the Raptor fighter plane if the aircraft is sold to Australia .
At alliance talks in Canberra yesterday , the Australian Government expressed interest in buying the United States ' F - 22 , which is described as the top combat plane in the world .
All overseas sales of the jets are currently banned by an Act of Congress .
Yesterday Australian Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon said he would write to the US Government asking for the US to lift the ban .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates says the Pentagon should have looked at the legal ban more closely , because Japan asked to buy the Raptor last year .
Dr Gates says he will consider Australia 's request and whether an export version of the Raptor would have to be created .
" [ We would have to look at ] whether there would have to be design changes and so on , " he said .
" Given the importance that our Australian friends attach to it , it 's an issue I intend to pursue when I get back , first of all in terms of conversations with our own people in the Department of Defence and also with the Secretary of State . "
Mr Fitzgibbon recently launched a review of the controversial $ 6 billion contract to buy F / A - 18 F Super Hornet fighter jets , which was signed off on by his predecessor , Brendan Nelson .
How We Got Here
This is from James Loewen 's book Lies My Teacher Told Me , a survey of what the most widely - used high school textbooks on American history leave out .
It was published in 1994 :
The sole piece of criminal government activity that most textbooks treat is the series of related scandals called Watergate ...
In telling of Watergate , textbooks blame Richard Nixon , as they should .
But they go no deeper .
Faced with this undeniable instance of government wrongdoing , they manage to retain their uniformly rosy view of the government .
In the representative words of The United States — A History of the Republic , " Although the Watergate crisis was a shock to the nation , it demonstrated the strength of the federal system of checks and balances .
Congress and the Supreme Court had successfully check the power of the President when he appeared to be abusing that power . "
As Richard Rubenstein pointed out , " the problem will not go away with the departure of Richard Nixon , " because it is structural , stemming from the vastly increased powers of the federal executive bureaucracy .
Indeed , in some ways the Iran - Contra scandal of the Reagan - Bush administration , a web of secret legal and illegal acts involving the president , vice - president , cabinet members , special operatives such as Oliver North , and government officials in Israel , Iran , Brunei and elsewhere , shows an executive branch more out of control than Nixon's .
Textbooks ' failure to put Watergate into this perspective is part of their authors ' apparent program to whitewash the federal government so that schoolchildren will respect it .
Since the structural problem in the government has not gone away , it is likely that students will again , in their adult lives , face an out - of - control federal executive pursuing criminal foreign and domestic policies .
To the extent that their understanding of the government comes from their American history courses , students will be shocked by these events and unprepared to think about them .
Wow , did he get that wrong .

Whether you loved them or hated them , Bill and Hillary Clinton were always a twofer .
On the campaign trail in 1992 , Bill used to joke about it .
Vote for me and get “ two for the price of one , ” he chuckled .
Plenty of Americans thought this was n’t such a bad idea .
A bumper sticker popular at the time proclaimed : “ I ’m voting for Hillary ’s husband . ”
The Clintons seem to want that bumper sticker resuscitated .
Bill ’s back on the campaign trail , waxing eloquent about his White House days , pummeling Hillary ’s rivals and promising more good times if Hillary becomes the Democratic nominee : You liked Clinton I ?
You ’re gonna love Clinton II !
In contrast to 1992 , though , the Clintons now officially pretend that they ’re not a twofer .
When critics -- Barack Obama among them -- complain that it ’s hard to figure out which Clinton is actually running for president this year , Hillary responds with wide - eyed incomprehension : Goodness , what ’s this fuss about Bill ?
“ This campaign is not about our spouses , it ’s about us , ” she explained demurely to a South Carolina debate audience .
“ Michelle [ Obama ] and Elizabeth [ Edwards ] are strong and staunch advocates for their husbands , and I respect that . ”
Is n’t Hillary allowed to have a supportive spouse too ?
Butter would n’t melt in her mouth .

The problem for Hillary Clinton is that , as usual , she wants it both ways .
She wants to be judged on her own merits and not be treated as Bill ’s Mini - Me .
But she also wants to reap the benefits of Bill ’s popularity , and offers voters the reassuring suggestion that if there ’s a crisis while she ’s in the White House , there will be someone around who really does have executive branch experience -- namely , Bill -- to lend a hand .
But the Clintons are playing a dangerous game .
The more they remind us of what we liked about Act I of the Bill and Hillary Show , the more they also remind us of what we hated .
It ’s true that the Bush administration is enough to make anyone nostalgic for the Clinton era .
Compared with the catastrophes that President Bush unleashed , Bill Clinton ’s misdeeds seem like minor peccadilloes .
Under Clinton , the United States did n’t fall into a potentially devastating economic crisis , did n’t rack up record - breaking debts and budget deficits , did n’t adopt a policy of torturing people , did n’t seek to gut international human rights standards , did n’t get bogged down in any major , pointless and unwinnable wars and did n’t actively alienate huge swathes of the global population .
On the other hand -- and where the Clintons are concerned , it ’s always wise to wonder what the hand you ca n’t see is up to -- once you stop comparing the Clinton presidency with the Bush presidency , it no longer looks so great .
On the whole , the Clinton era was a time of culture war and scandal , “ triangulation ” and botched reforms ( healthcare anyone ? ) , vacillation and paralysis .

On foreign policy in particular , Clinton ’s presidency was an era of missed opportunities .
In Somalia , Bosnia , Haiti , Rwanda and Kosovo , U.S. policy was marred by hesitation and lack of commitment .
Despite impressive rhetoric on the emerging challenges posed by globalization , nuclear proliferation , WMD and the rise of transnational terrorism and nonstate actors , Clinton developed few innovative ways to address these challenges ; his approach to conflict and crisis was piecemeal .
His early defeat on gays in the military left him so scarred that he steered clear of the military for most of his presidency , passively letting uniformed personnel dictate the terms of too many foreign policy decisions and ignoring hard questions about how to reshape the military to face post - Cold War threats .
Today , if Obama ’s mere existence at times seems to make Bill Clinton apoplectic , it ’s not just because Obama ( whose foreign policy judgment has so far been significantly better than Hillary ’s on Iraq , Iran and Pakistan ) is the main Democratic barrier to a third Clinton term .
It ’s also that Obama ’s promise of a politics that ’s not just bipartisan but beyond partisan is an implicit rejection of the Clintons ’ all - politics - all - the - time ethos , of their willingness to let crucial national decisions be driven by petty political considerations , of their lack of interest in dealing with big questions when they could coast along with a compromise here , a favor there and some tinkering over here .
Before 9/11 , tinkering kept us afloat .
But it ’s no longer enough .
Obama offers something transformative and new , and this frightens some voters , who wonder if he can live up to his undeniable potential .
The Clintons , meanwhile , offer something old and familiar .
But will a trip down memory lane with Billary reassure voters or end up frightening them even more ?
Frequent sexual activity improves the genetic quality of sperm and may help some couples conceive , fertility specialists have found .
A study of men attending a fertility clinic revealed that genetic defects in their sperm fell substantially after going on a programme that required them to engage in sexual activity daily for a week .
Fertility doctors commonly advise men trying for a baby to abstain from sexual activity for two to three days , because it boosts the number of sperm they produce .
The latest finding suggests that men who have healthy sperm counts but poor quality sperm can improve the genetic material in the cells by engaging in sex more often .
Genetic damage can reduce the chances of a sperm fertilising an egg , or can lead to the formation of an embryo that fails to implant properly or is miscarried .
David Greening , a fertility doctor at Sydney IVF , studied 42 men whose sperm had high levels of genetic damage .
All of the men were from couples who had a history of recurrent miscarriage or failed IVF treatment .
After three days of sexual abstinence tests revealed 30.8 % genetic damage in the men 's sperm .
The men were tested again after being told to engage in sexual activity daily for a week .
Tests showed that while their sperm counts fell by nearly one third , genetic damage also fell , on average by 12.8 % , in 37 of the men .
Tests on the remaining five men showed their sperm had slightly increased genetic damage .
Around a fifth of men have sperm with significant DNA damage .
Dr Greening , who spoke at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine meeting in Washington yesterday , said : " I 'm convinced that ejaculating more frequently , ie daily , improves sperm DNA damage in most men by a decent amount . "
He believes that the longer sperm are held in the tube that leads from the testicles the more genetic damage they accumulate from free radicals circulating in the body .
Allan Pacey , senior andrologist at Sheffield University and secretary of the British Fertility Society , said : " If you ejaculate every day then you 're preventing the sperm being in the reproductive tract for too long , so it makes sense that they 're less exposed to damage and it's fresher . "
In 2003 another team of Australian fertility researchers reported that men could reduce their risk of developing prostate cancer by masturbating frequently .
The team , at the Cancer Council Victoria in Melbourne , believed that ejaculating prevented the buildup of cancer - causing chemicals in the prostate .
We continue publishing shots from the selected playgrounds in different Russian cities .
Some say that those playgrounds are too creepy , but others say such artwork shows to the children the truth of life right from the first steps they make .
Well , I think that kids are too busy with their own inner world to care about all this “ nice ” or “ not nice ” playgrounds , it ’s more an adults issue to call them “ ugly ” or “ creepy ” , kids usually just use the practical side of the playgrounds and do n’t care on the design , but for grown - ups it can be a shocking experience especially if they encounter on of those from the last photos of this set in some dark night .

Viral and microbial interactions within living tissues are more complex than previously thought .
Melinda Wenner explores whether a periodic table of the infectious could help sort out the mess .
J. DEPCZYK
In 2001 , Paolo Lusso asked his colleague Leonid Margolis for a favour .
Lusso , a virologist at the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan , Italy , had recently discovered that HIV patients are often co-infected with human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV - 6 ) .
Although typically benign , HHV - 6 seemed to hasten HIV progression , and no one knew why .
Lusso was studying HHV - 6's effects on lymphoid cells but wanted to see what the virus did to whole pieces of lymphoid tissue .
So he asked Margolis , a virologist at the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda , Maryland , and an expert on three - dimensional - tissue , to perform some experiments for him .
Margolis agreed .
Human lymph - node tissue was hard to come by , but tonsils , which doctors remove from patients all the time , are also lymphoid tissue — and Margolis had developed an experimental tonsil - tissue system to study HIV pathogenesis .
Because HHV - 6 infection was often found alongside HIV , Margolis and his colleague Jean - Charles Grivel co-infected tonsil tissue with both viruses .
He predicted that the herpesvirus , normally suppressed by the immune system , would be free to replicate in immune - compromised HIV - infected tissue .
But , weeks later , when Grivel analysed the infected tissue , something was wrong .
HIV was n't replicating .
Although excited , the scientists did n't want to jump to conclusions , so Grivel performed the experiments again .
“ There was another three weeks of waiting , which was really very emotional , ” Margolis says .
Nevertheless , they got the same result .
“ We could n't believe our eyes , ” Margolis says .
HHV - 6 , at least in this situation , seemed to protect against HIV1 .
So infectious agents interact with each other and with hosts in unpredictable ways .
An average human body is rife with viruses , and benign and not - so - benign bacteria as well as ' endogenous retroviruses ' , which buried themselves in the human genome eons ago .
This crowded house is a different beast from the sterile cell lines used as models .
Scientists such as Margolis therefore argue for a broader approach to virology — one that involves studying infections in a more true - to - life context , predicting their interactions and sometimes taking the unexpected good with the usual bad that infections bring .
“ If HIV patients had GBV-C , they were three times more likely to be alive at follow - up . ” Jack Stapleton
That microbes can benefit their hosts is by no means new .
For example , bacteria living in the human gut are known to influence immune function , and help our body absorb nutrients .
But only recently have scientists suggested that infectious viruses could provide their hosts with benefits as well .
Viruses influence the host immune system in significant — and occasionally beneficial — ways , a concept that is n't surprising when one considers that they have been interacting with immune systems for millions of years .
Recently , Herbert ' Skip ' Virgin , an immunologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis , Missouri , infected mice with dormant viruses genetically similar to human Epstein–Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus .
These viruses , he found , protected the mice from the bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis .
Virgin and his colleagues suggest that the viruses upregulate the production of immune factors that prevent further infection rather than interacting directly with the microbes2 .
Helping or hindering ?
The endogenous retroviruses that cemented their place in human history by infecting the eggs and sperm of our ancestors account for more than 8 % of our genome , and some report that as much as half of our genome is composed of fragmented viruses .
These viruses seem to influence immune function ; for example , the susceptibility of mice to Friend virus , a strain of murine leukaemia virus , is controlled by two genes derived from endogenous retroviruses3 .
Some have proposed that endogenous retroviruses , long fixed in mammalian genomes , provide the immunosuppression that allows a fetus to develop in its mother 's body , despite the differences between the immune systems .
Viruses also interact with each other directly , as Margolis discovered for himself in 2001 .
Similar viruses sometimes compete with each other , causing one to eventually ' win over ' a cell and literally block infection by others .
Viruses that are different enough from each other can co-infect cells cooperatively ; in a process known as complementation , one virus provides another with a useful protein that it co-opts for its own use .
Occasionally , viruses become dependent on other viruses .
One such example is hepatitis D , which requires the presence of hepatitis B in order to replicate .
Margolis uncovered why HHV - 6 prevents HIV replication under certain conditions .
A subtype of HIV , most often found in early infection , generally gains entry into the cell by binding the receptor CCR5 .
When HHV - 6 infects first , however , it instigates production of an immune chemical that binds to CCR5 receptors , blocking HIV 's access .
HIV can develop resistance to this chemical over time and HHV - 6 co-infection may exert selective pressure on HIV to become immune - resistant , or switch to a different co-receptor — a change accompanied by increased HIV virulence .
This explains the often poor prognosis of patients infected by both viruses .
Other human viruses influence HIV replication .
Margolis found that human herpesvirus 7 ( HHV - 7 ) inhibits HIV replication , albeit via a different mechanism from HHV - 6 ( ref. 4 ) .
In 1998 , two groups independently reported that HIV patients infected with a seemingly innocuous hepatitis - like virus called GBV- C live longer , although neither group knew why .
The studies piqued the interest of Jack Stapleton , director of the University of Iowa 's Helen C. Levitt Center for Viral Pathogenesis and Disease in Iowa City , who was , at the time , running an AIDS clinic while studying hepatitis C–HIV interaction .
“ Any virus that is not causing disease has the potential to cause disease . ”
Robert Gallo
“ We thought it was a statistical fluke and that it would n't hold up in a larger study , ” Stapleton recalls .
With access to hundreds of samples , Stapleton decided to replicate the GBV- C study on a group of 362 HIV patients from his clinic .
What he found surprised him and confirmed the findings : “ If patients had [ GBV- C ] , they were three times more likely to be alive at follow - up , ” he says5 .
Stapleton 's subsequent research , along with work completed by a group in Germany , has shown that a GBV- C peptide interferes with early replication of HIV , and that GBV-C , like HHV - 6 , increases production of an immune chemical that blocks HIV 's entry into the cell .
Always dangerous
No one would suggest purposefully infecting individuals with a persistent infection to ward off HIV .
After all , one of the hallmarks of viruses is that they evolve quickly .
“ Any virus that is not causing disease has the potential to cause disease , ” says Robert Gallo , director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore , and the co-discoverer of HIV .
That said , Gallo , who worked with Lusso on the HHV - 6 discovery , and his team recently tested the immune chemical produced during HHV - 6 infection as a vaginal microbicide in macaque monkeys and found that it significantly lowered risk of contracting a monkey - infecting version of HIV6 .
To make further progress , scientists need to expand which viruses they study , and how they study them , Margolis says .
They need to use tissue systems that preserve immune function and cellular communication , because cells within tissues communicate with one another differently and have a different architecture than do cells that are cultured in vitro .
Moreover , Margolis suggests , scientists should study infections in tissues harbouring the same persistent viruses present in humans .
“ If you study a pathogen such as HIV in a cell - culture model where there is no immune system , there is no effect from other microbes that are in the normal state in an infected human , ” says Stapleton .
“ You 're really missing important factors that will influence the pathogenesis . ”
“ I fantasize about creating a periodic table of microbes . ” Leonid Margolis
What would be ideal , says Margolis , is a table , not unlike Mendeleev 's table of the elements , for infectious agents .
“ I fantasize about creating a periodic table of microbes , ” he says .
Each cell in the table might feature the name of the microbe , the immune factors it affects , the receptors it uses and the signalling systems it incorporates , he says .
Just as the elemental version predicts how two substances react with one another , the periodic table of microbes would predict how two microbes interact in the human body .

“ It 's off the wall , but it could generate enormous insights , ” says Michael Lederman , the director of the Center for AIDS Research at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio .
Other scientists say that although such a table may have some practical value , the concept is potentially more interesting as a catalyst for scientific ideas and approaches .
Philip Murphy , chief of the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda , Maryland , says that scientists can only get so far with existing tissue and animal models .
“ Pathogens are very host - limited , so there is a whole range of human pathogens that you could never do an experiment with in mice models , ” he says .
For example , although Margolis 's lymphoid - tissue model is incredibly useful , he says , there are a number of pathogens that will never infect lymphoid tissue .
Scientists will , in other words , need to get creative .
Expanding the study of virology in these ways is challenging for other reasons , too .
It is difficult , for example , for a scientist with expertise in DNA viruses such as herpesviruses to study their interactions with RNA viruses such as HIV .
But collaboration can help , and although broadening the context of virology might make experiments more complicated , it will also make them more realistic , Margolis says .
“ In a more complicated system , you probably can understand less , ” he admits .
“ But what you understand is really relevant . ”

Jan. 16 , 2008  --
The Swift Boat Veterans ads in 2004 attacking John Kerry 's exploits in Vietnam , the infamous Willie Horton ad in 1988 that portrayed Mike Dukakis as soft on crime , and the notorious 1992 " Read my lips " spot that focused on the then - President George Bush breaking his earlier pledge to not raise taxes .
All three ads may be derided by the pundits as negative advertising , but there is little doubt that they worked :
They helped turn the elections against the targeted candidates .
The ads were products of opposition research , nuggets of damaging information about political candidates uprooted by their opponents to damage their reputation or credibility in the eyes of the voters .
And one of their prime manipulators has finally stepped out from the shadows to reveal his tactics and role in tipping numerous elections around the country over the last decade and a half .
Stephen Marks , an opposition research specialist for more than 12 years , worked on some of the most competitive bare - knuckles elections in recent years , including the 1996 , 2000 and 2004 presidential elections , the second North Carolina Senate race between Jesse Helms and Harvey Gantt in 1996 , and the Georgia Senate race between Max Cleland and Guy Millner .
He also dug up dirt for scandal - plagued lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his partner Mike Scanlon , oil company Koch Industries , and he helped former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay look up negative info on his nemesis , Texas prosecutor Ronnie Earle , who was targeting DeLay for campaign finance violations .
Marks , who recently retired from his career in opposition research , tells all in his new book , " Confessions of a Political Hitman : My Secret Life of Scandal , Corruption , Hypocrisy and Dirty Attacks That Decide Who Gets Elected ( And Who Doesn't ) . "
Although he does n't literally murder people , Marks writes that " I assassinate them with their own words and deeds , digging dirt wherever I can find it . "
And that dirt includes politicians ' own records as public officials and professionals , their financial records and their personal lives .
Marks makes no apologies for his career .
" Whether negative stuff is good or bad , people have a right to know , " Marks tells ABCNEWS.com .
" You have to back up your info with facts , unlike positive ads that tend to focus on promises .
The researchers give the candidates the straight facts , and if they want to take those facts and skew them and take them out of context , that 's on them . "
After years of realizing after an election that he 'd actually been working for " the bad guy " against " the good guy , " Marks grew disillusioned with the Republican Party and what he calls its hypocrisy on " family values " issues .
" A lot of me was going in idealistic , as a true believer , only to find out that a lot of these guys , once they get the trappings of power , it 's very hard for them to give that up , " he explains .
" The Republicans were no different form the Democrats when they were in full control , and I thought they would n't make the same mistakes or have the same arrogance . "
Among his proudest accomplishments was his creation of an anti-Gore ad in 2000 that showed Gore defending the Rev. Al Sharpton followed by footage of Sharpton telling college students to " off the pigs " ( or kill cops ) and Sharpton calling America 's Founding Fathers the " scum of Europe . "
Marks believes that ad , which was paid for by an independent group , helped swing Florida to Bush .
" That ad received so much attention and got a lot of TV airplay , " he says .
" I hope that maybe it did move that many votes in Florida . "
Marks also resurrected the infamous Willie Horton ad when he was working for then - Massachusetts Gov. William Weld in his 1998 race for John Kerry 's Senate seat .
Back in 1992 , Kerry , as a private attorney , had secured the early parole of a career criminal , George Reissfelder , who had pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of a police officer in Florida .
After he was paroled , Reissfelder got involved with a Mafia - controlled drug ring in Boston and was questioned by the police regarding the Gardner Museum heist , the biggest museum robbery in U.S. history .
Marks ' ad featured Reissfelder 's picture morphing into a photo of Willie Horton .
But the episode ended up starting to prick at Marks ' conscience -- he received death threats from Reissfelder 's relatives .
And he got a phone call from Reissfelder 's niece , telling him that she never knew about her uncle 's history of crime .
" Unfortunately , good people are sometimes related to people who do bad things and these good people sometimes get hurt in the process . "
Back in 2001 , Marks worked for Jack Abramoff 's partner , Michael Scanlon .
Among his tasks was to fly to the New Orleans airport , pick up a Fed Ex package full of hundreds of envelopes and mail them from the airport post office .
Marks took a peek into one of the envelopes and found that they contained fliers promoting a preferred candidate , " Poncho , " for the presidency of an Indian tribe , Louisiana 's Couchatta tribe .
The tribe was one of the scandal - tarred lobbyist 's clients , and Marks figured that by interfering in the tribal election and getting their man in control of millions of dollars in casino profits , Abramoff and Scanlon would reap plenty of money in lobbying fees .
Another of Marks ' tasks for Scanlon involved researching Gus Boulis , the owner of SunCruz , a casino boat chain in Florida , who had backed out of a deal to sell his business to the lobbyist duo .
Marks ' assignment was interrupted when he was awakened in the middle of the night and told by his client to " Get the hell out of Dodge . "
Earlier that day , Boulis had been gunned down -- killed by mobsters .
Because his name appeared on countless requests to research court documents involving Boulis , Marks ended up being questioned by Fort Lauderdale police .
Now , Marks realized that " I was merely a pawn helping bad guys break the law . "
Marks relishes telling stories about his wild romantic life as a borderline sex addict ; on a routine trip to the Texas state comptroller 's office to do research in 2002 , he had sex with a young assistant in the meeting room .
" Despite knowing intellectually that using women sexually was morally wrong , I could n't control myself . "
Maybe it was a case of bad karma , but Marks ended getting a taste of his own bitter medicine when one of his numerous lovers went psychotic , obtaining his cell phone records and calling every number on the list , telling everyone that Marks was an ax murderer , pedophile and other " outrageous accusations . "
One of his friends had to get police protection after the ex-lover showed up unannounced and Marks ended up filing an FBI report to stop the harassment .
Some of Marks ' tactics were even considered too dirty for some of the candidates he was helping .
During the Bush - Clinton election in 1992 , Marks uncovered photos of Bill Clinton sharing a podium with " Q Bone " and Leon Gulette , two former gang members , at an event to promote a truce between the Bloods and the Crips .
Marks believed that photos of the event , at which Clinton told " Q Bone , " a convicted killer , " I need your help " was a smoking gun that would have damaged the candidate .
Marks even faxed copies of the photo and its caption to Bush 's top campaign advisers .
But they never used the issue against Clinton , which Marks attributes to a fear of being labeled racist .
When Marks helped unearth information about former House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt 's real estate deals that appeared to violate IRS and federal banking laws , he was shocked that it took over a year for any Congress member to file a complaint against Gephardt with the House Ethics Committee , which eventually dismissed allegations against him .
" I gave the Republicans the goods , and they apparently were either too cowardly or too frightened by the thought of their own unethical behavior coming to light to take any action against Mr. Gephardt . "
During the Cleland - Millner election , Marks was so desperate to get a photo of Cleland posing with Ted Kennedy 's nephew , Michael , at a veterans center that he lied to one of the vets , claiming that his uncle was in the picture so that Marks would be permitted to get a copy of the photo .
The most effective opposition research focuses on revelations that are clear and simple for the public to understand , says Marks .
When George H.W. Bush was trailing Dukakis at the polls , his staff brought in file cabinets full of anti-Dukakis research to legendary campaign manager Lee Atwater .
But Atwater told them to get rid of the file cabinets and bring him one index card with three simple hits to be used against Dukakis : Willie Horton ( while on furlough , the convicted murderer raped a woman and pistol - whipped his fiancée ) , the Pledge of Allegiance ( as governor , Dukakis opposed public school children reciting the pledge ) , Boston Harbor ( Dukakis claimed that he had " cleaned up " the harbor , which was notoriously dirty ) .
Not all his exploits were political .
Marks was also hired by Charles and David Koch , heirs to an oil fortune , during a nasty feud with their brother Bill .
But the gambit backfired because Marks realized that there was more negative information out there about his own clients , including evidence of environmental damage caused by the brothers ' oil company .
" So not only does Oppo Man help elect low - life politicians too incompetent to discuss with a straight face , he also helps guys like Jack Abramoff and companies like Koch Industries , just because they are connected to the Republican Party ? "
Marks writes .
Several of his clients had more skeletons in the closet than their opponents , and no amount of opposition research could repair the damage .
While working for Democrat Shane Guidry , who was trying to unseat Louisiana councilman Butch Ward , it was revealed that Guidry 's father had pleaded guilty to paying former Gov. Edwin Edwards $ 1.4 million in bribes to get a casino license .
Guidry was trounced in the election and was later arrested and charged with battery after getting into a shouting match with Popeye 's Famous Fried Chicken founder Al Copeland during a brawl at a steakhouse .
Another of his clients was Don Goldwater , the nephew of Republican legend Barry Goldwater , who wanted to run for governor of Arizona .
Marks uncovered that Goldwater held some incendiary beliefs , including that all illegal immigrants are criminals who should be forced into labor camps .
In an ironic twist tailor made for an opponent 's campaign ads , Goldwater 's father had been busted for repeatedly hiring illegal aliens and allegedly forcing them to live in unlivable conditions .
Goldwater ended up stiffing Marks until the researcher threatened to leak the damaging info to the press -- he was paid the next day .
Goldwater did not return calls for comment .
Marks became disillusioned by the GOP during the impeachment debacle in which he blames Republicans for dropping the ball due to their own indiscretions and ethical quandaries .
Among the Republicans he blames : current presidential candidate Fred Thompson .
David Schippers , the counsel for the House Judiciary Committee during the Clinton impeachment saga , believed the most egregious alleged offenses by Clinton had nothing to do with Monica Lewinsky but rather the illegal Chinese campaign contributions allegedly made in exchange for military secrets .
But when Schippers reached out for more information from then - Sen .
Thompson , who was heading the Senate investigation into the matter , he was told , " Stop , it 's over . "
" Thompson flunked the test , " writes Marks .
" From the beginning , he went straight into the tank . "
Marks blames
Thompson for arguing that the Independent Counsel statute should not be allowed to exist and for claiming the investigation should be headed by Clinton appointee Janet Reno .
A spokesman for the Thompson campaign responded , " Just like he did during his work in the Watergate hearings , Sen .
Thompson believes the role of the hearings was to determine the truth regardless of political party .
However , the senate committee was given neither the tools nor the time to be successful in the investigation . "
In the current presidential campaign , Marks says that none of the negative ads seem to have worked .
" Both Obama and Huckabee won in Iowa , despite negative ads against them , " he says .
" So far in New Hampshire , McCain won purely positive .
But it 's early in the campaign .
I can assure you that there will be plenty of negative stuff still to come . "
He insists that negative campaigning and opposition research are a " necessary evil which will be needed if the electorate is to cast educated and intelligent votes . "
And that any candidate who does n't research himself and his opponent is a fool who deserves to lose , he says .
Michael Mukasey has been sworn in as U.S. attorney general , a day after 53 senators decided that a man who does n’t know what torture is should have the job .
But the real blame — for anyone who objects to the confirmation , that is — should be reserved for Democrats Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein , who made Bush ’s day when they gave Mukasey the green light .
New York Times :
“ The Department of Justice needs Judge Mukasey at work tomorrow morning , ” said Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee .
“ The Department of Justice has been categorized as dysfunctional and in disarray .
It is in urgent need of an attorney general . ”
But Democrats said Mr. Mukasey ’s refusal to characterize waterboarding , a technique that simulates drowning , as illegal torture disqualified him from taking over as the nation ’s top law enforcement official .
“ I am not going to aid and abet the confirmation contortions of this administration , ” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee .
“ I do not vote to allow torture . ”

Demand Building for Gold and Silver as Currency of Legal Tender for Merchant Services
" Gold & Silver Accepted Here " -
The fact that euros are accepted by many stores in New York City has made the news lately and is well known in gold investor circles .
It is yet another symptom of the ongoing demise of the US dollar .
The good news for these New York City merchants - and for all others nationwide - is that gold and silver will not be far behind and offer far better advantages as dollar - alternatives .
You may think that honest - to - goodness currency demand for gold and silver is non-existent in the US and that this will remain so until the legal tender laws are repealed ( as currently proposed by Representative Ron Paul 's dual HR 42756 and HR 4683 approach ) - but that is not necessarily true .
Such demand will soon begin to build , regardless of Ron Paul 's efforts in Congress - and it will take off very fast .
Here is why :
Until now , merchants or service providers labored under the quite incorrect assumption that offering their goods for gold and silver would be unprofitable , and a waste of time because of a number of factors .
Factors That Used to Limit the Currency - Use of Gold :
A widespread , but incorrect , application of Gresham 's law to the situation at hand ; A lack of public understanding of the advantages of PMCs by the public ; Legal tender laws prohibiting the issuance and the " utterin " or " passing " of non-official precious metals coins ( like 18 USC 486 , the law the Liberty Dollar ran up against ) ;
Tax laws that inhibit the free exchange of gold or silver for goods and services by imposing difficult to satisfy accounting burdens ;
Insufficient numbers of consumers own spendable gold or silver or are aware of their availability ..
Yet , none of these reasons really prevent merchants from profitably offering their wares for gold .
( Whenever the word " gold " is used from here on forward , it should be understood to include silver ) .
The dollar 's rapid decline and the accompanying credit crunch and world economic slowdown are changing the picture for gold - as - currency dramatically .
Gold has always been - and will always be " money " , but its actual widespread use as a circulating medium of exchange has been stifled by the above listed factors .
Let 's go through them , one by one , to see if they really pose such severe obstacles to the use of gold as a viable currency .
1. Gresham's Law - Turned on Its Head
The applicability of Gresham 's law really depends on the inconsistency between the face value and the actual bullion value of a coin ( in the case of a gold coin standard ) , or the overprinting of paper receipts for gold ( under a classical gold standard ) .
Neither condition exists today .
What we have today is a universal " fiat standard " , if you will .
The question to be examined is whether Gresham 's law really dictates that fiat ( bad money ) will always drive out or prevent the widespread circulation of good money ( gold ) .
In truth , when ( not " if " ) gold becomes more widely used , it will have a tendency to drive out bad money in our current set - up .
This will be achieved largely by merchants ' offering significant gold discounts for their goods .
The main reason nobody buys with gold is that it is hard to see why purchasing an item for gold will be a benefit to the buyer .
In a rising gold / declining dollar environment , merchants can easily afford to offer tremendous savings to their customers by deep - discounting their goods for gold - paying customers .
Whatever revenue " loss " may accrue to them at the time of the purchase will be made up in the future by the dollar - price appreciation of the gold earned over time .
Not only that , but the merchant also gets to stock up on valuable gold as a form of currency - hedge without having to make any layout of already earned funds .
It works just like income tax withholding .
If you do n't see your money going out of your wallet or bank account , you just do n't care as much .
( Unlike income tax withholding , earning gold obviously is a benefit , of course . )
Further , by offering his customers such tremendous discounts , he makes them very interested in acquiring gold so they can take advantage of his offers .
That , in turn , drives up demand for gold , which ends up supporting and further boosting its dollar - price increases - all to the benefit of both the merchant and the customer .
In the end , Gresham 's law is turned on its head .
By merchants offering deep discounts , the tendency to hoard the gold is either lessened or eliminated altogether .
2. Public Ignorance of Gold 's Advantages :
This factor is eliminated almost automatically , and passively , by simply offering the discounts to gold - customers in the first place .
People already get excited and start buying loads of stuff during so - called " tax holidays " offered by some states on certain days when certain products are exempted from their sales tax .
Sales taxes are usually under ten percent .
Imagine what a continuous " price holiday " of , say , 25 percent is offered .
Customers will likely fall all over themselves to be able take advantage of that .
This way , without having to try and " educate " your customers about the ins and outs of Austrian economics , you - the merchant - give them a reason to educate themselves , and even if they continue in their completely ignorant bliss , they still understand that a " quarter off " is a good deal .
That 's all they need to know .
If they want to know more , you can point them to an online FAQ page on your company 's website .
3. Section 486 of Title 18 , USC ( one of the Legal Tender Laws ) - Does Not Apply to Non-Coin Forms of Currency
The Liberty Dollar got sacked because it was plainly in violation of 18 USC Section 486 , which reads as follows :
" Whoever , except as authorized by law , makes or utters or passes , or attempts to utter or pass , any coins of gold or silver or other metal , or alloys of metals , intended for use as current money , whether in the resemblance of coins of the United States or of foreign countries , or of original design , shall be fined under this title ( ! 1 ) or imprisoned not more than five years , or both .
( That , of course , also kills the idea of creating a purely bullion - weight denominated physical gold currency for the time being , but using digital gold currencies and American Eagles is just as workable . )
Obviously , American Eagle bullion coins , declared by law to be legal tender , are excepted from the application of this statute .
Only coins of " original design " or those resembling coins of foreign countries , if passed as current money , are covered .
That leaves paper bills ( which we are not addressing here ) and digital gold currencies - so we 're clear of any legal challenges to the use of digital gold or American Eagles coins in day - to - day commerce within the United States .
4. Tax Laws Offer No Real Obstacle
Ordinarily , appreciation in the dollar - price of gold bullion is taxed at applicable capital gains rates .
In the case of certain online digital precious metals currencies , however , this rule may not apply .
It may well be the case that such currencies are given the same tax treatment as other physical , nationally issued currencies of foreign countries , which means in effect that any gains or losses stemmming from fluctuations of the deollar against such currencies are treated as ordinary income gains or losses and are taxed as such .
Goldmoney , Pecunix , and eBullion are examples of digital PM currencies that may fall into this category because their official seats or registered offices are located offshore .
E - gold , on the other hand , would be an example of a currency that would not be treated as ' foreign ' since its registered office is located within the United States .
It is noteworthy here that Title 26 , USC Section 988(e ) ( 2 ) appears to provide for a $ 200 exclusion of gains accruing to individuals from transactions in foreign currencies .
If this reading of the statute is correct , it would mean that any gain from the purchase and subsequent sale of a digital gold currency is not taxed as long as the gain does not exceed $ 200 .
( As always , this is not to be taken as " legal advice " of any kind .
Please consult a competent licensed attorney specializing in tax matters for clarification of the effect , meaning , and proper application of this statute . )
5. Lack of Spendable Gold in Public Possession - Easily Cured
The American public is largely ignorant of the possibility and advantages of not only accumulating , but also spending gold as currency .
Because of that , very few Americans own spendable gold .
That problem is easy to fix , though .
The only real challenge will be to get enough merchants and service providers to get on board and start to accept gold in payment for their products and services .
As already discussed , the mere fact that such huge discounts are offered on some or all products a merchant sells will make customers curious .
Very curious .
A small hand - out brochure that explains just the most important facts about gold and its use as a store of wealth and currency in a falling fiat - dollar environment will go a long way toward educating Americans .
Without people first having a reason to be interested in gold , all efforts at educating the public will be in vain .
To be effective , that reason can't be a purely theoretical one , though .
Do n't even try to convince people that gold keeps inflation at bay , etc .
They just do n't care .
But give them a solid discount , and you 'll be surprised haw fast they will learn the truth about inflation .
The best thing is , this takes very little effort on the merchant 's part .
Once they are curious , just hand 'em a brochure .
That 's all .
What If the Gold Price Drops ?
If gold should drop again for any extended period , customers will still be attracted by the discounts .
As long as they get their discounts , they 'll still like the idea of buying gold and paying with gold .
A falling gold price actually makes the idea of buying gold and paying with it to get the discount even more attractive because your customer now pays less for each additional unit of gold he buys .
The only thing that changes now is the benefit to the merchant .
The discount , expressed in dollar terms , now increases the gold - proceeds he gains from the transaction .
Who wants to complain about that ?
For example :
If the merchant operates an online retail outlet and his product normally costs $ 100 , and he sells it to a gold - paying customer for a 25 % discount applied to the dollar price , the customer has two choices :
A . The customer can go to his online gold account and use new fiat units to buy the gold he needs for the product .
In that case he will exchange $ 75 in FRNs for gold grams .
The customer will incur whatever exchange fee is charged by the digital gold currency ( DGC ) issuer , which will decrease the value of the discount to him .
But because of the declining dollar - gold price , his $ 75 now buy more gold .
You , the merchant , therefore end up with more gold !
B . If the customer decides to use previously exchanged , pre-existing gold - units from his account , he will of course incur no additional exchange fee .
Yet , in a declining gold price environment , his previously acquired gold unit will have cost him more at the time he acquired it , so he loses there .
He 'll therefore need to calculate which “ loss ” is greater and proceed accordingly .
It is important here to remember that any ' loss ' we are talking about here is only a minor reduction in the overall benefit of the discount to the customer , so the discount will still produce a net benefit to him , regardless .
Also , the additional effort and inconvenience of having to make the above calculation is really no greater than maybe shopping with grocery store coupons .
Considering how many people voluntarily undergo the routines associated with shopping with coupons , the price incentive we are talking abou there is obviously greater than any adverse consideration of this sort .
Try getting even anywhere near to an overall 25 % savings out of supermarket coupons .
Good luck !
What Happens During Gold Price Rises ?
During times of gold price increases , the customer 's conversion of new dollars into gold yields him less gold at each successive point in time than it did at the previously lower price .
He can then use previously acquired gold from his gold account , rather than exchange new fiat - units at the now higher price .
That saves him the exchange fees and allows him to avoid the now higher cost of gold .
So he goes to his account , calculates the gold gram value of the 75 dollars as of the time of the purchase , and transfers the gold to the seller 's account .
No problem .
Since seventy five bucks now buy less gold , the merchant ends up with a little less gold than he would in a declining gold price environment .
But he still gets the benefit of having earned stable and reliable , over time rising gold rather than fast declining fiat dollar units .
Overall , no matter what the short to medium term gold price trend is , everybody wins , albeit by varying degrees of gain :
The merchant effortlessly and without out - of pocket cost accumulates a nice base of stable gold currency that he can exchange for either bullion and take delivery or back into fiat units at any time he chooses .
He also ends up with a growing customer base of people who own gold , who can therefore pay him in gold , and who enjoy the resulting financial security and insulation form a total currency collapse that comes with that ownership .
At any time of catastrophic currency collapse , both merchant and customer are protected , and the merchant has the added protection of having developed a customer base made up of people who can still buy things from him , regardless of how badly the dollar " bombs . "
How to Calculate Physical Gold Transactions :
There already is a Silver & Gold Payment Calculator set up by Katherine Austin - Fitts of Solari and Franklin Sanders of The Moneychanger .
It allows anyone to calculate any change to be given a customer who pays with American Eagles or any other country 's gold or silver coins .
How Merchants Can Multiply Their Gold - Profits
On top of all this , merchants can take advantage of referral programs offered by several digital gold currency providers .
That means a merchant could purchase gold by going to the Small Business Goldmine referral link when buying gold for his own account .
( Note : the DGC issuers we deal with do not have a multi- tier referral structure at this time . )
He would lose no money thereby , since the price of gold grams remains the same , regardless of whether he buys directly or through the referral link .
He could then point his customers ( or even his vendors ) to his own referral link for their gold buying and steadily earn commissions , several levels down , completely passively and without any additional effort - apart from his already existing discount pricing for gold - paying customers and the informational material he provides them .
This will vastly multiply the use of gold and silver in day - to - day e-commerce transactions and create a significant additional level of support under gold and silver 's fiat - currency price .
Of course , the same process can be duplicated in other countries , depending on their laws .
That way , the world can go a long way toward transitioning to the use of gold and silver as a full - fledged parallel currency .
This will happen in spite of the IMF and the world 's system of central banks and big financial houses who exercise centralized control over markets and governments alike - and you , the long - time gold investor , will be very well off .
( The Small Business Goldmine was founded for the very purpose of helping to bring this transition about .
Your support , in whatever form , whether financial in the form of a Euro vs Dollar Monitor subscription , or in the form of suggestions for improvements , criticism , introductions to helpful individuals and organizations , or otherwise , will be greatly appreciated . )
If we all work together , great days will be ahead for precious metals investors , free market advocates , friends of liberty , supporters of the rule of law , and business owners of every kind and their customers .

Scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology have released the first known photographs of gorillas performing face - to - face copulation in the wild .
This is the first time that western gorillas have been observed and photographed mating in such a manner .
The photographs were part of a study conducted in a forest clearing in Nouabalé - Ndoki National Park in the Republic of Congo that appeared in a recent issue of The Gorilla Gazette .
“ Understanding the behavior of our cousins the great apes sheds light on the evolution of behavioral traits in our own species and our ancestors , ” said Thomas Breuer , a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and WCS and lead author of the study .
“ It is also interesting that this same adult female has been noted for innovative behaviors before . ”
The western lowland gorilla is listed as Critically Endangered as a result of hunting by humans , habitat destruction , and health threats such as the Ebola virus .
The female gorilla in the photograph , nicknamed “ Leah ” by researchers , made history in 2005 when she was observed using tools – another never - before - seen behavior for her kind in the wild .
Breuer and others witnessed Leah using a stick to test the depth of a pool of water before wading into it in Mbeli Bai , where researchers have been monitoring the gorilla population since 1995 .
Researchers say that few primates mate in a face - to - face position , known technically as ventro- ventral copulation ; most primate species copulate in what ’s known as the dorso- ventral position , with both animals facing in the same direction .
Besides humans , only bonobos have been known to frequently employ ventro- ventral mating positions .
On a few occasions , mountain gorillas have been observed in ventro- ventral positions , but never photographed .
Western gorillas in captivity have been known to mate face - to - face , but not in the wild , which makes this observation a noteworthy first .
“ Our current knowledge of wild western gorillas is very limited , and this report provides information on various aspects of their sexual behavior , ” added Breuer , whose study is funded by the Brevard Zoo , Columbus Zoo and Aquarium , Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden , Max Planck Society , Sea World & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund , Toronto Zoo , Wildlife Conservation Society and Woodland Park Zoo .
“ We ca n’t say how common this manner of mating is , but it has never been observed with western gorillas in the forest .
It is fascinating to see similarities between gorilla and human sexual behavior demonstrated by our observation . ”
Scientists estimate that western gorillas have declined 60 percent in recent years due to habitat loss , illegal hunting , and Ebola hemorrhagic fever .
The Wildlife Conservation Society , which is the only organization working to protect all four gorilla sub-species ( also including the Cross River Gorilla , the mountain gorilla , and the Grauer ’s gorilla ) , has been studying gorillas and other wildlife in the Republic of Congo since the 1980s .
In 1993 , the Congolese Government , working in tandem with technical assistance from WCS , established Nouabalé - Ndoki National Park .
" Maxxed Out " - America 's Debt Crisis Posted by Pile ( 9563 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
In " Maxed Out " , author / director James D. Scurlock takes on America 's debt crisis .
Consequently , he touches on related issues like race , corporate malfeasance , and political subterfuge .
The full movie is here .
Scurlock ’s multi-media approach incorporates statistics , news excerpts , and interviews , but it 's rarely dull ( comedy bits from Louis CK and tunes from Queen and Coldplay do n't hurt ) .
Speakers include economic professors , debt collectors , pawn brokers , investigative reporters , beleaguered consumers , and even Robin Leach ( Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous ) .
Instead of New York and Los Angeles , he concentrates on mid-size cities , like Minneapolis , Oklahoma City , and Seattle .
Plenty of small towns also come into play .
Though he never presses the point himself , Scurlock allows his subjects to note the similarities between the credit industry and the drug trade ( others use such incendiary terms as " rape " ) .
One thing he neglects to mention , however , is pride .
If house payments are ruining your life , selling that property may be the only solution .
In most cases , however , it 's hard not to feel for those individuals who did n't know what they were getting into before they signed their lives away .
For some viewers , this will be a dispiriting documentary -- three subjects recount the suicides of relatives who found their debt too much to bear -- but in explaining exactly how lenders and creditors make money , Maxed Out can help others to avoid some of their most egregious practices .
In other words , debt may be a downer , but knowledge is power .

Our Constitutional Republic has been destroyed .
The foundation of American Liberty has been either distorted , erased or forgotten .
Our entire planet is ruled by an oligarchy of established bankers , oilmen and global corporations .
We the People find ourselves enslaved and intoxicated by an economic system that by design , destroys the prosperity , development and education of the World 's Citizenry .
The Federal Reserve and its fiat monetary policy need to be abolished .
The unconstitutional ( and enslaving ) 16th Amendment needs to be repealed .
Congress needs to listen to the people and convene an Article V Convention so we may work towards restoring the Constitutional Republic that our " elected " officials have stolen from us and sold to the highest bidder within the corporatocracy .
Our government is allowing the corporate elite to successfully merge Canada , Mexico and the United States into a single supra-national entity , the North American Union - complete with its new currency the " Amero " , which will be ushered in just after the fabricated collapse of our economy .
The fascist Tories within our government are working towards another false - flag attack similar to 9/11 to " justify " an attack on Iran and the further erosion of our civil liberties in America .
A Halliburton subsidiary , KBR has already been awarded a $ 385 million contract to construct " detention centers " in the United States .
Any puppet President of the United States now has the power to enact martial law and fully transform America into a police state .
The conditioned - complacent public in this country and all the World 's Citizenry need to act now to save what few liberties we have left .
Rediscover Patriotism .
Resurrect Dissent .

maxxed out , a documentry everyone should see .
Posted by credit avenger on 2008-05 - 17 00:35:13 5/17/08 dear B S alert i have just watched the dm maxed out , it answered alot of questions i had .
i feel bad for the people who lost there family in the movie .
i could never take my life over bad credit card debt.its just like the movie depicts a game , if you know how to play the game you could come out on top .
if you give in to uscrupulas collection agencys you will loose .
so my advice is this dont pay if you cant .
let them threaten you all they want , sell your house before they forclose , disconect your phone get a disposable cell phone sell what you dont need .
then go off the grid for a while then get a new identity .
its easyer than you think .
i do not like any banks or agencys that take advange of hard working people .
what ever you do its not the end of the world .

Volcanically , Antarctica is a fairly quiet place .
But sometime around 325 B.C. , the researchers said , a hidden and still active volcano erupted , puncturing several hundred yards of ice above it .
Ash and shards from the volcano carried through the air and settled onto the surrounding landscape .
That layer is now out of sight , hidden beneath the snows that fell over the subsequent 23 centuries .
Although out of sight , the layer showed up clearly in airborne radar surveys conducted over the region in 2004 and 2005 by American and British scientists .
The reflected radio waves , over an elliptical area about 110 miles wide , were so strong that earlier radar surveys had mistakenly identified it as bedrock .
Better radar techniques now can detect a second echo from the actual bedrock farther down .
The thickness of ice above the ash layer provided an estimate of the date of the eruption : 207 B.C. , give or take 240 years .
For a more precise date , Mr. Corr and Dr. Vaughan turned to previous observations from ice cores , which contained spikes in the concentration of acids , another byproduct of eruptions .
Scientists knew that an eruption occurred around 325 B.C. , plus or minus a few years , but did not know where the eruption occurred .
“ We ’re fairly confident this is the same eruption , ” Dr. Vaughan said .
Now , they know both time and place .
“ It ’s probably within Alexander the Great ’s lifetime , but not more precise than that , ” Dr. Vaughan said .
The under-ice eruption was probably similar to one in Iceland in 2004 .
Although explosive , spewing ash more than seven miles in the air , the Iceland eruption was much less powerful than Mount St. Helens , the volcano in Washington State that blew off its peak in 1980 .
Canon is using Iris watermarking to take photographer ’s copyright protection to the next level .
. . . to provide an imaging apparatus that makes it possible to protect the copyright of photographic images by reliably acquiring biological information of a photographer . . . – US Patent Application No. 2008/0025574
Stories like the recent discovery of Rebekka Guðleifsdóttir ’s stolen Flickr images that surfaced on iStockphoto make all photographers cringe .
Many photographers go to great lengths to protect their images .
Past attempted solutions include watermarks on the front of images .
I can recall this practice from my childhood years with the Olan Mills studio gold embossing in the bottom corner .
More recently , in the digital age of photography , watermarking in Photoshop or other image editing software .
While visible watermarks are common among a variety of photographers , invisible watermarks ( “ electronic or digital watermarks “ ) , which are embedded in the image file , are somewhat less prevalent – but gaining ground and acceptance among photographers .
Companies like Digimarc are pressing the digital watermark cause to protect photographer ’s and other author ’s data .
Camera companies are pushing forward as well .
Stories like that of Rebekka Guðleifsdóttir help increase the desirability and demand for practical copyright solutions in modern digital photography .
Canon ’s Iris Registration Patent
A recent Canon patent application ( Pub. No. : US 2008/0025574 A1 ) reveals the next step in digital watermarking – Iris Registration .
The short and sweet of it ?
Turn the Mode dial to “ REG ” Choose between “ REG 1 ” through “ REG 5 ” ( for up to 5 registered users )
Put eye to viewfinder Look at display of center distance measurement point Press the shutter button Iris image captured Go shoot
Additional embedded info can be added later .
All metadata will be added to images after you ’re finished shooting in a collective manner and not for each image .
The purpose of the collective tagging , if you will , is to refrain from hampering the camera ’s speed ( frames per second ) while shooting .
Admittedly , I have glossed over the claims of this patent .
You can take a look at some of the more specific terms of the patent in the quotes I ’ve pulled from it below :
Summary
Another object of the present invention is to provide an imaging apparatus that makes it possible to protect the copyright of photographic images by reliably acquiring biological information of a photographer for the purpose of personal authentication and writing this photographer information to the image of a subject without affecting processing , and in a manner transparent to operation , at the time of photography .
According to the present invention , the foregoing object is attained by providing an imaging apparatus for taking an image of a subject by an image sensing device , comprising : registration means for allowing a photographer to register his / her own biological information in advance ; storage means for storing the biological information ; and personal - data recording means for recording the biological information in a photographic image .
Iris Registration Mode Setup
In the iris registration mode , a registration number is selected by turning the electronic dial 103 .
When the electronic dial 103 is turned clockwise , the registration number changes as follows in dependence upon the amount of rotation ( number of clicks of the dial ) : “ REG - 1 ″ . fwdarw . ” REG - 2 ″ . fwdarw . ” REG - 3 ″ . fwdarw . ” REG - 4 ″ . fwdarw . ” REG - 5 ” .
The registration number is useful when a number of photographers use the camera .
The number is made to correspond to registered content in such a manner that each photographer can register his / her iris information .
The iris information of the photographer is registered in association with the registration number selected .
The registration number is displayed on the liquid crystal panel 104 for displaying photographic information and on the LCD 214 in the viewfinder .
A photographer can store iris information for any desired one of five registration number .
This registration number is displayed on the liquid crystal panel 104 for displaying photographic information and on the LCD 214 in the viewfinder .
An example of display of registration number is as shown in FIG .
6 . The illustrated example shows the manner in which the display transitions from REG - 1 to REG - 5 in accordance with rotation of the electronic dial 103 .
“ REG - 1 ” , “ REG - 2 ” , “ REG - 3 ” are displayed in ordinary fashion , and REG - 4 , REG - 5 are displayed in a flashing manner .
This indicates that iris information has already been registered for REG - 1 to REG - 3 , which are not flashing , and that nothing has been registered for “ REG - 4 ” , “ REG - 5 ” , which are flashing .
A photographer can newly register iris information corresponding to a registration number that is flashing .
However , if there is a registration number for which iris information has already been registered , this already registered iris information can be erased and new iris information stored in its place .
If the electronic dial 103 is rotated one further click from the REG - 5 indication , the display returns to “ REG - 1 ” .
Registration numbers are displayed cyclically in accordance with rotation of the electronic dial 103 in this fashion .
If the electronic dial 103 is rotated counter - clockwise , then the order in which the registration numbers are displayed is reversed .
Embedding Process
The photographic image ( data ) that has been recorded in the flash memory is written into the DRAM 511 temporarily , and the personal data that has also been read into the DRAM 511 is combined with or attached to the photographic image to thereby be written to the photographic image .
After the personal data is written to the photographic image , a display indicating that removal of the memory card is permissible is presented on the liquid crystal panel 104 for display of photographic information , then the power supply is turned off following elapse of a fixed period of time ( step S206 ) .
More Embedding Details
As a result of the foregoing , biological information indicative of a photographer need not be acquired every time an image is taken and , hence , processing executed by the imaging apparatus is not subjected to a load in terms of the sequence of photography .
Furthermore , biological information can be registered in advance .
In a case where information inappropriate for personal authentication could only be acquired , therefore , it is possible to perform registration again .
This makes it possible to acquire reliable biological information .
Further , registered biological information indicative of a photographer is recorded in a photographic image attendant upon an operation for turning off a power supply or removing a recording medium , or a command operation for transferring a photographic image to another image receiver , or an operation for reselecting other biological information from multiple items of biological information that have been registered .
As a result , processing executed when an image is taken of a subject is not subjected to a load .
In other words , congestion can be prevented by recording biological information at a timing at which an image is not being taken .
Further , by recording biological information as an image , coding means or an authentication unit necessary for personal authentication may be provided externally .
This reduces the processing to be executed by the imaging apparatus .
Alternatively , by processing an acquired biological image into a personal authentication code and recording the code in the image of a subject , the amount of personal data serving as additional information may be reduced .
Alternatively , by embedding personal data which is biological information in the image of a subject as an electronic watermark , falsification can be prevented more robustly .
Alternatively , biological information may be processed into a personal authentication code and the code may be added on as an item of metadata .
In a case where the image of a subject is handled by a third party , therefore , it is easier to deal with a photographer ’s personal data as copyright information .
At the same time , since it is unnecessary to apply processing to the image of a subject per se , there is no decline in image quality .
Further , many digital still cameras are equipped with a liquid crystal display panel in addition to a viewfinder .
With a camera of this kind , the photographer can take an image while observing the display on the liquid crystal panel without looking into viewfinder .
The camera of the illustrated embodiment is capable of combining personal information with captured digital image data even in a case where the camera takes images through this method .

Food prices are skyrocketing – and it ’s enough to make you gag on your milk .
That ’s because milk costs 29 percent more than it did a year ago , and that ’s not all : Eggs are up 36 percent , and tomatoes 31 percent .
The cost of groceries , as compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics , has jumped 5.6 percent in the last year – higher than the inflation rate – with dairy products soaring 13.4 percent .
“ That ’s a huge increase , no question about it , ” says bureau economist Dave Richardson .
Bread rose 10.5 percent ; fruits and veggies went up 5.9 percent ; and meat , poultry , fish and eggs rose 5.4 percent .
Oil prices are the main culprit .
“ Our industry is very gasoline - driven – everything has been shipped by trailers , and fuel costs keep going up , ” said Nelson Eusebio , executive director of the National Supermarkets Association .
Other factors include rising demand for ethanol , which is driving up the price of corn , from which ethanol is made , and changes in Chinese consumption patterns .
“ China is importing milk products where historically they have not , ” says Patrick Jackman , another bureau economist .
“ Meat also was something not purchased by the Chinese in the past , and that they ’re doing to a greater extent today , ” he said .
What all these factors add up to is a price increase in staples like milk , eggs and bread – and that ’s hitting Big Apple families hard .
Elyse Fisher , 39 , who lives on the Upper West Side with her husband and 3 - year - old daughter , said it ’s much more expensive to feed her family .
“ I know I ’ve been spending a lot more , but I ’m not sure on what , ” she said at Whole Foods in the Time Warner Center .
The bill for her weekly groceries came to $ 208.62 – up by nearly $ 10 over last year .
Pam Unger , 31 , who also lives on the Upper West Side with her husband and 3 - month - old daughter , was also at Whole Foods .
“ I do n’t think I ever realized how expensive milk is , ” she said .
Unger got no argument from Doris Centeno , 59 , who lives in Williamsburg , Brooklyn .
“ Milk has gone up a lot .
My budget is a little tighter , ” said Centeno , who was shopping at the C - Town supermarket there .
Frances Ruiz , 28 , a mother who was shopping at the same store , echoed Centeno .
“ Everything is way different – now my paycheck is not enough , ” she said .
“ Cereal and juices went up .
It ’s hard with kids . ”
Another Brooklyn mom agreed .
“ We just ca n’t get what we used to , ” complained Pam Lopez , 38 .
“ This year has been much worse . ”
For Fanny Rodriguez , 45 , the increases hit home when she went shopping for a family favorite .
“ Mac and cheese usually is three boxes for a dollar – now it ’s two for a dollar , ” she grumbled .
The 5.6 percent hike in grocery prices was higher than the rate of inflation , 4.1 percent .
And the bad news is that grocery prices will likely rise another 3 to 4 percent this year .

Racing Ahead At The Speed Of Light
RHICs 2.4 mile ring has six intersection points where its two rings of accelerating magnets cross , allowing the particle beams to collide .
The collisions produce the fleeting signals that , when captured by one of RHICs experimental detectors , provide physicists with information about the most fundamental workings of nature .
by Staff Writers
Upton NY ( SPX ) Feb 11 , 2008
Imagine trying to catch up to something moving close to the speed of light - the fastest anything can move - and sending ahead information in time to make mid-path flight corrections .
Impossible ?
Not quite .
Physicists at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider ( RHIC ) , a particle accelerator at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Brookhaven National Laboratory , have achieved this tricky task - and the results may save the Lab money and time in their quest to understand the inner workings of the early universe .
The physicists have developed a way to measure subtle fluctuations in RHIC 's particle beams as they speed around their 2.4 - mile - circumference high - tech racetrack - and send that information ahead to specialized devices that smooth the fluctuations when the beam arrives .
" These corrections help to keep the beams focused and colliding , recreating thousands of times a second the conditions that existed just after the Big Bang , " said Steven Vigdor , Brookhaven Lab 's Associate Laboratory Director for Nuclear and Particle Physics , who manages the RHIC program .
Already , RHIC scientists have learned that mere microseconds after the Big Bang , the universe was more interesting than imagined - a nearly " perfect " liquid with virtually no viscosity and strong interactions among its constituents .
With the ability to race ahead of RHIC 's beams and keep them focused , the scientists will be able to create many more " mini - Bangs " for study .
The increase in data will help them investigate and measure the detailed properties of this " perfect " liquid , and test certain predictions stimulated by an unanticipated link between RHIC findings and " string theory , " an appealing approach to incorporate gravity into a unified theory that describes all of Nature 's forces .
The beam - correcting technique , called stochastic cooling * , has been implemented at accelerators where the beams are made of a continuous stream of particles - but never before at a facility where the particles travel in discrete bunches , as is necessary for the beam - on - beam collisions that take place at RHIC .
" Its successful demonstration at RHIC provides an alternative path to the goal of increased collision rates , which would be much more costly and take longer to achieve via other proposed means , " Vigdor said .
How it works
RHIC circulates two beams of ions - electrically charged particles - moving in opposite directions in two separate rings at 99.995 percent the speed of light .
Within each beam , the ions travel in discrete groups , or " bunches , " each containing more than a billion ions .
In the highest - energy experiments , the ions are the nuclei of gold atoms , composed of protons and neutrons that slam together where the two beams cross to produce a tiny speck of extremely hot , dense matter that mimics the conditions of the early universe .
But like all charged particle beams , RHIC 's ions tend to spread out ( heat up ) as they circulate .
As the ions spread , the number of protons and neutrons colliding - and the amount of useful data - declines .
So RHIC physicists are taking advantage of RHIC 's circular shape and the ability to send signals as fast as the near - light - speed beam to cool the ions down - that is , keep them tightly bunched .
The technique includes the term stochastic ( derived from statistics , meaning random ) because it relies on measuring the random fluctuations in the beam shape and size .
The measurements are made at one point on the accelerator by devices that generate signals proportional to how far the particles are straying from their ideal positions .
These devices then send the signals via fiberoptic or microwave links to a position ahead of the speeding beam , where electric fields are generated to " kick " the charged particles back toward their ideal positions .
The result : more tightly squeezed , cooler ion bunches .
The signals stay ahead of the beam by taking one of two shortcuts - either traveling from one point to another across the circular accelerator , or by backtracking along the circle to meet the speeding beam about halfway around on its next pass .
So far the RHIC physicists have tested stochastic cooling in the longitudinal direction - along the direction of the beam - in one of RHIC 's two rings .
Longitudinal cooling compensates for the ion bunches ' tendency to lengthen as they circulate .
This improvement has already increased RHIC 's heavy - ion collision rate by 20 percent .
Next , the physicists will test the same cooling system in RHIC 's other ring .
With $ 7 million in additional funding , the physicists will design and build a similar system for correcting the tendency of RHIC 's ion bunches also to become " fatter " as they circulate .
Computer simulations , which have accurately predicted the achievements of the longitudinal cooling system , predict that combining this new transverse cooling system with longitudinal cooling in both rings and some additional equipment could increase collision rates overall by 500 percent .
" This achievement would compare quite favorably with the goals of our original plan for upgrading collision rates based on a system known as electron cooling , which we estimate would have cost $ 95 million , " said Vigdor .
Plus , stochastic cooling can be implemented much more quickly than adding an electron - cooling accelerator because no new construction is required .
" Barring unforeseen budget or technical problems , we hope to implement the full stochastic cooling system by 2011 , " Vigdor said .

Amy Fisher Goes After Mary Jo Buttafuoco Again
just does n't know when to let things rest with .
You would think with the release of her recent sex tape and all the press she has gotten from that , she would be happy for a little while .
Wrong !
Amy says she could care less if Mary Jo Buttafuoco still has that bullet lodged in her brain .
Amy thinks the only reason people do n't like her is because she is now a millionaire .
OH , it gets better .... Amy kept spewing at the mouth and can't figure out what the big deal is because Mary Jo has made more millions over this than Fisher has with her sex tape .
The Long Island Lolita admitted that she recently lied to an attempt to get a reality show gig and get to Mary Jo , by saying that she was back together with super stud Joey Buttafuoco .
But really they were only together for a week because Joey made her want to hurl .
He has not kept up his body and now has man boobs .
Her words were " Ewwww .
It was n't good at all . "
I wish I could say ... and then she woke up .

I ’m not , nor have I ever been , a gamer — I ’m one of those people whose parents refused to buy them an Atari system ( that should tell you how old I am , too ) .
Despite that , I was intrigued when I received an invitation to an “ Exclusive SimCity Societies low carbon power online blogger event . ”
Held by gaming company Electronic Arts and their first ever corporate partner on a game , BP ( yes , BP ) , bloggers had the opportunity to take a sneak peak at the game , and to see how the developers incorporated ideas of sustainable development and clean energy into it .
Now , SimCity Societies is n’t an “ educational game ” : Carol Battershell , VP of BP ’s Alternative Energy division , claimed that , from the outset , the idea was to create “ entertainment with a little bit of education . ”
As in previous versions , players build their own cities , and either succeed or fail based on how their development choices create harmony or chaos within them .
In this version of the game , pollutants created by industry , transportation , and electricity generation play into the equation .
A player has to choose the kind of power sources his / her city will rely upon , and receives information about the CO2 emissions and smog - causing pollutants created by each choice .
Too much of either affects the city ’s environment , and the well - being of its residents : increased instances of smog , for instance , will raise levels of illness among citizens and keep them from work ( which costs the player , or “ mayor , ” money ) .
Increased carbon emissions could result in floods , droughts , powerful storms , etc .
As Rachel Bernstein , the game ’s producer , noted , “ Games are always about managing resources …
Players have to make choices that have end - game results , and they come to recognize the costs and trade - offs of those choices . ”
The game certainly looks entertaining , and I ’m pleased to see these kinds of elements incorporated into it .
My question going in , though , had to do with the partnership between EA and BP : essentially , why is an oil and energy company involved in a venture like this ?
Battershell addressed that upfront , noting that BP had been looking for educational partnerships , and approached EA about creating a game for teaching players about low carbon energy .
EA was working on SC Societies , and brought BP on as a knowledge partner to create a “ more sophisticated and nuanced ” vision of pollution , and how how its effects stem from economic development choices .
Battershell also highlighted BP ’s history in electricity production , noting the company had been involved in the solar energy business for thirty years .
Of course , the question of “ greenwashing ” has to come up in a situation like this , so I went ahead and asked it : was EA worried at all that it would be accused of greenwashing for BP ?
Bernstein noted that the two companies had been working on the game well before the concept had entered the public consciousness , and again noted that BP had approached them about educating consumers on cleaner alternative energy sources .
In short , no , they were n’t concerned about such charges .
Others , of course , will ultimately make that judgment , and with some of BP ’s recent environmental problems , it ’s a fair question to ask .
Still , I think it ’s largely a distraction in this case : any company should be held to account for its environmental sins , but I do n’t think that undermines the potential good that can come out of a product like SimCity Societies .
While I do n’t want to make any blanket characterizations of gamers , I know there will be many who play the game who are otherwise unconcerned about , or unaware of , the potential environmental consequences of economic development choices .
Some gamers may come out of their play with a better understanding of such issues , or perhaps more curiosity about them .
The game goes on sale tomorrow , November 15 .
If you ’d like just a taste , a promotional trailer is available here .

Defense Focus 2007 In Review Part Two
China has decided to build a vast fleet of conventional powered submarines that will impact the balance of power in waters closer to China .
by Martin Sieff
Washington ( UPI ) Jan 7 , 2008
The year 2007 was a year when several major powers served notice that U.S. weapons superiority in every field and class was n't going to remain an uncontested monopoly .
China continued to out - build the United States in submarines by factors of 10 - to - 1 or even 14 - to - 1 per year , largely because good , small and medium - size diesel subs are far cheaper , faster and easier to produce than enormous nuclear - powered ones .
But neither Republicans nor Democrats on Capitol Hill gave any serious thought to pushing for a diesel - sub component to the U.S. undersea fleet to balance it and match China in affordable numbers .
On the contrary , nuclear power advocates with strong allies in the U.S.
Navy launched a new campaign arguing that the entire surface fleet should be nuclear powered , despite the expense and the cramping effect this would have on maintaining large numbers of ships .
Nor was there any politically significant push to argue the case for streamlining the F - 22 and , especially , the F - 35 to produce small , more specialized and affordable per unit fighters and other combat aircraft that future administrations would realistically be able to buy in significant numbers .
On an individual basis , the major U.S. defense contractors from Boeing and Lockheed Martin in combat aircraft and missiles , to General Dynamics Electric Boat in nuclear submarines continued to turn out and maintain state - of - the - art weapons systems that remained without peer in the world .
But there were growing areas where the superiority that U.S. manufacturers and policymakers had been able to take for granted for so long were being challenged or even surpassed .
Russia , after all , could produce supersonic cruise missiles that flew at 2,000 miles per hour only 100 feet above ground level , and the year ended with the Kremlin even expanding its joint manufacturing program to share this technology with India .
The U.S. - built Tomahawk by contrast could still only fly at subsonic speeds , less than 750 miles per hour at ground level , with increasing concerns that the latest Russian air defense systems like the S - 400 deployed around Moscow during the summer or the Tor - M1 sold to Iran could have a significant success rate of interceptions against it .
Nor did U.S. contractors or the U.S. Navy have any capability to build anti-surface ship sea-launched missiles comparable in hitting power to the Russian SS - N - 22 Moskit or the SS - N - 27 Sizzler .
It was a year when U.S. defense contractors lost out to Russian competition in some traditionally U.S. - dominated markets around the world : Saudi Arabia spent $ 1 billion for Russian helicopters and Indonesia bought $ 1 billion worth of Sukhoi combat fighters and Kilo - class diesel submarines .
Even America 's new friend India resolutely refused to buy U.S. combat aircraft and stuck with Russian Sukhois instead .
The year ended with Russian arms executives confident that India would place an enormous order for no less than 300 T - 90S Main Battle Tanks .
From the point of view of the major U.S. defense contractors , it was n't the best of years and it certainly was n't the worst of years either .
It was a reasonably good year in which some negative developments that had been feared certainly did not happen .
The Democratic takeover of Congress did not result in any effort to gut or irresponsibly slash military procurement programs .
On the contrary , the interaction between Democratic notables such as Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan and Rep. Henry Waxman of California with Defense Secretary Robert Gates proved in general fruitful and constructive .
It was a year above all of " business as usual , " with routine but solid progress made and important questions for the future left unanswered .
The biggest news , therefore , was n't what did happen , but what did n't .
Once again , a lot of dogs stayed silent that should have barked in the night .

I hate to burst anyone 's bubble . . . so this article arrives after it popped on its own .
The Austrian School of thought of Mises and Rothbard has probably never had a more diehard person as close to the reins of power as Ron Paul today .
( Nevertheless , he remains forbidden from the green - zone of the reins of power . )
He is not just some celebrity candidate .
He has authored hundreds of articles for years such as on www.lewrockwell.com, and has probably resisted the corruptions of power more so than any politician in American political history .
Move over Thomas Jefferson , et. al , Ron Paul would do better .
But being so " close " to power has brought an odd sense of opportunity , urgency , and near destiny to the Rothbardians .
The number of articles on Ron Paul 's presidential campaign on Rockwell 's site has become overwhelming .
Both long standing regular contributors and new writers pour in articles .
Yet most noticeable for a while were the number of columns that described with confidence how Ron Paul can actually win .
Many articles on steps to a Ron Paul victory began with him doing so well enough in Iowa and New Hampshire that it becomes unavoidably big news .
It did n't happen .
It 's time to warn those spending big money and lots of time supporting a presidential campaign that their energies could be very useful for liberty if applied to something more permanent and long term than a winner - takes - all political election .
Discovering election fraud would not solve the problem even if possible .
Am I alone to think that even if Ron Paul could get 50 % + of the vote , that election fraud would guarantee he lost ?
Or perhaps he would be gunned down by a supposed " lone gunman " ?
The Kennedy clan has been gunned down and they were only a half beat out of step with the power elite .
I began my journey to libertarianism through politics .
While ( do n't laugh ) a Rush Limbaugh fan in high school , in college I discovered and enthusiastically took up Libertarian Party politics by discovering Harry Browne through the internet in 1995 .
I became foolishly convinced that by building momentum , in 8 - 16 years the LP could have a chance .
Although the LP was a conduit , what I appreciated and loved was not politics , but the universality of libertarianism as the absolutely most minimal system which could guarantee or maximize peace and peaceful activities between people .
I was not too unusual in this , as the Barry Goldwater campaign also served similarly for large numbers of new libertarians who eventually gave up on politics while keeping the libertarian philosophy ( with the notable extreme of Karl Hess ) .
This is what I hope the new libertarians who discovered libertarianism through Ron Paul 's campaign can learn .
Are n't there some common sense articles about how to preserve the libertarian movement and its new recruits in the event of a Ron Paul defeat ?
Gary North moves in with a well timed attempt to save the momentum given the certain defeat of Ron Paul 's presidential campaign .
What is his solution ?
Local politics .
I must unfortunately take political pessimism to a further degree .
Even assuming political activity could save us from the dangers of political activity , it is too late for America .
America survives by imports bought with a currency that rests on myth : faith that the dollar will retain its value .
The emperor not only has no clothes , he has little of meaningful value with which to buy real clothes .
Ron Paul cannot save the USA .
I believe that he would even hasten the collapse .
However , that last sentence is not a criticism .
The combined US debt obligations are great enough that the US government should be pushed into a liquidation bankruptcy scenario .
What Ron Paul would do would be to ( contrary to his expectations ) trigger the liquidation sooner as opposed to later .
The mainstream politicians can only postpone this finale by continued ignorance when the debt to asset ratio will be even more askew .
" The Athenians have been waiting 2,300 years for their empire to ' bounce back . '
The Egyptians have been waiting even longer .
And the Seleucids ?
The Mongols ?
The Incas ?
The Romans ?
Rome is a nice city but the Rome of Berlusconi is hardly the Rome of Augustus .
The city never bounced back .
And the list of empires that never bounced back is as long as the list of empires .
Once they are history , they are history . "
- Bill Bonner , The Daily Reckoning 1/21/08 .
Most empires mentioned probably had a softer collapse than will the USA .
Their currency was debased , but it was at least still a metal , so the value the day after the collapse would not be much different than the day before it .
Gary North thinks local political action can be of more use than a presidential campaign .
( He does n't say precisely how , and in his defense , probably much of what he recommends would be non-political . )
What I think is needed is local anti-political organization . . . or perhaps post - political organization .
One of the greatest unmentionable and unthinkable heresies is to consider the collapse of the USA as something unavoidable , caused by our own government , and close enough that preparing for it would be wise .
This is exactly what we should be thinking .
What we need are local organizations that spend time thinking of what agreements and voluntary arrangements would best keep local society from collapsing along with the national collapse .
I would recommend , just as an idea to brainstorm , something like a Post - USA Society , locally and decentrally organized .
Hence , my blog is decentralist.wordpress.com .
The dual purpose would be to inform as many people as possible about the inevitable collapse of the USA , and also to organize and structure intentional communities with which to best survive and thrive in such a situation .
Libertarians have long opposed Historicism , especially in its overly Hegellian versions .
But the writing is on the wall .
Libertarians do n't have to " defeat " the USA .
No one has to .
It has defeated itself , and it may only be a generation or two before it collapses under its own weight .
There will be no John Galt or Osama Bin Laden to blame .
Let us hope that there are none that come demanding revenge once the USA becomes the newest " Third World " country .
I think it 's time to combine the virtues and knowledge of the Amish and the GNU / Linux Open Source organizational methods .
I would n't call the answer local politics .
I 'd call it a global open community knowledge network to establish and promote sustainable micro-culture and intentional communities .
The internet may provide us a few decades with which to combine the best of the relatively self - sustaining rural community and the knowledge resources of urban networks .
Maybe we still have a hundred years , maybe 20 , but how long would it take to learn the skills and create the communities to survive the collapse of the dollar ?
What if I 'm wrong and the US government and its dollar can survive for another thousand years ?
Are the Amish so bad off for avoiding 200 years of technology ?
When one government becomes oppressive , they can and have just moved .
They seem that much freer and often happier than the average non-Amish American because of it .
Now I 'm not recommending that extreme of technology avoidance .
Like the Open Source software movement , I think it should be used far more productively than current slow moving and vendor - locked - in markets prefer .
However , there is a difference between advanced technology use vs. dependence on it :
One is wise and the other is comfortably numb .
The Ron Paul campaign is really a sugar coated version of libertarianism believing in an over - simpified transition period .
What really matters is how many stick around and are not frightened away by libertarianism unshackled from politics , its corruption by design , temporal winner take all coalitions , and such .
True , I and many others became libertarians first through the candy coating .
Now that I value health , I think health foods are better without the coating .
For those who become libertarians through politics and stay for it without politics . . . welcome aboard .
United States forces withdrawing from Baghdad have managed to persuade the new Iraqi government to pay for an expensive extended warranty agreement that provides limited labour and parts cover for the fragile democracy that was set up under the allies .
‘ Although we are confident that the Iraqis will enjoy years of trouble free satisfaction from their new representative form of government , it is always worth insuring against the possibility that something could go wrong , ’ explained Condoleeza Rice .
‘ This extra cover gives them the confidence to enjoy their new Freedom™ with complete peace of mind . ’
For just an extra forty billion dollars , Iraq can rest assured that if their new pro-Western government should go wrong in any way , then one of the after care team can be called out using the exclusive warranty helpline .
‘ Of course we ’re not talking about sending in ground forces all over again , ’ explained Ms Rice .
‘ But bombs will be made available , delivered by air within 24 hours of the first call to a central Baghdad location . ’
However Iraqi ministers complained that on testing the Helpline , a recorded voice offered them a range of unappealing choices and then put them on hold for ages while they were forced to listen to Bolero ; ‘ If you wish to destabilize a neighbour press 1 .
If you wish to be added to the Axis of Evil , Press 2 .
If you wish to order a nuclear air strike , precipitating the outbreak of World War Three press the hash key , now . ’

Juries are to be told how rape victims typically respond in an attempt to dispel " rape myths " which ministers believe are contributing to plummeting conviction rates for the crime .
A panel of judges , doctors and academics will start work next month on the project , which will attempt to put together a package to inform the jury without interfering with the fairness of a trial .
The move is part of reforms announced yesterday by the solicitor general , Vera Baird , aimed at boosting a conviction rate which has dropped from 33 % of reported rapes in 1977 to just 5.4 % in 2005 , rising slightly to 5.7 % last year .
A US study in 1989 found that myths affected the outcome of rape trials more than any evidence .
Jurors are expected to be told that victims may be slow to report the attack and that they may appear unemotional in the witness box , contrary to expectations .
" Juries sometimes find it difficult to understand why a rape has not been reported to police immediately when , in fact , it can take victims some time to decide to make a complaint , " said Baird .
" Juries can think that she [ the victim ] will be upset and very emotionally raw when she relives the episode for the court when , in fact , post - traumatic stress makes people seem unemotional and almost matter - of - fact . "
Ministers initially proposed allowing expert witnesses to give evidence to the jury on how rape victims behave .
But that idea , which circuit judges described as a " minefield " , has been shelved .
The panel is expected to recommend an information booklet , a video or directions from the judge .
A proposal for a statutory definition of " capacity to consent " - to deal with situations where a woman was so drunk it was questionable whether she had the power to say yes or no - has also been scrapped .
Baird said legislation was unnecessary since the court of appeal had set out in a case last March how juries should approach the issue when it quashed the conviction of Benjamin Bree , a 25 - year - old software engineer found guilty of raping a 19 - year - old student after a night of binge drinking .
The reforms include proposals to allow victims to substitute a videotaped interview with police for their initial evidence in court .
Restrictions on the admissibility of " hearsay " evidence - occasions when the woman confided in friends or relatives - about the rape will also be removed .
Katherine Rake , director of the Fawcett Society , welcomed the proposed changes but added : " These changes will not by themselves lead to a significant improvement in the conviction rate as most cases fail long before they get to court .
" Responses to allegations of rape need to improve across the whole criminal justice system and wholesale reform is needed to tackle the failures in the investigation and prosecution of rape cases . "
News Corporation 's ambitions have been thwarted in China by fearful officials and canny businessmen .
But Rupert Murdoch has not quite given up
FAR earlier than many , Rupert Murdoch sensed that China might be a unique financial prize .
Even on his first visit in the mid-1980s , with his then wife , Anna , and their school - age children , the Australian news magnate dined with the leadership .
For much of the next 20 years , Mr Murdoch tried to conquer China .
His initial aim was to create a satellite television network that would absorb a share of the advertising , now estimated at about $ 50 billion a year , that was sold on state - owned news media .
The Chinese encouraged him and then pulled back .
Ultimately they outmanoeuvred him , beating him at his own game .
Mr Murdoch hoped that the more he invested , the sooner satellite dishes would be sprouting from every Chinese rooftop .
But satellite dishes are still regulated , even if not as strictly as they once were .
Bruce Dover , an Australian , was Mr Murdoch 's man in Beijing until 1998 .
He has written a rare insider 's account of how the Chinese got the better of a businessman who usually gets what he wants .
Mr Murdoch felt that if only he could meet President Jiang Zemin all would be fine , Mr Dover writes .
Eventually , Mr Murdoch did get to spend time with the president ; quite a bit of it , in fact .
They got on well .
Mr Murdoch treated the Chinese leader , a film fan , to an exclusive screening of “ Titanic ” , which had been made by Mr Murdoch 's 20th Century Fox .
The Chinese let him invest lavishly in internet and programming companies , thus giving them precious technical know - how .
They particularly admired Mr Murdoch 's management structure because it was like theirs : a Sun King at the centre with acolytes all around .
The Chinese were excellent businessmen , but they wanted China 's profits for China .
Even with investments in groundbreaking television production in China , Mr Murdoch could not win for himself the concessions that usually came with publishing favourable editorials for presidents and prime ministers in the West .
The Murdoch charm had beguiled the highest levels of government in Australia , America and Britain .
In China , it failed .
Mr Murdoch did make some gains .
In 2002 his Star TV was given permission to sell programming for cable systems in Guangdong province .
But when the company tried to expand its distribution by the back door , using the remote Qinghai province as a base and exploiting a regulatory loophole to circumvent a ban on domestic cable - television owners carrying foreign broadcasters , the government reacted swiftly .
The Chinese propaganda department forced Star TV to close down the operation .
The Qinghai fiasco , News Corporation staff estimate , cost Star TV $ 30 m - 60 m .
Then in 2003 Mr Jiang was replaced by the less amenable Hu Jintao .
Two years later a frustrated Mr Murdoch announced he had hit a “ brick wall ” in China .
While courting the Chinese leadership , Mr Murdoch met Wendi Deng , a talented executive with an MBA from Yale University .
Ms Deng was born in mainland China and worked in the business development department at Star TV in Hong Kong .
Mr Dover introduced them at a company cocktail party .
They married in 1999 and Ms Deng became Mr Murdoch 's new connection to China , though she possessed little understanding of the opaque politics of her birthplace .
Ms Deng is now in charge of MySpace.com in China .
Like all dotcom operations there , it is a ward of the Chinese censors .
But it remains one of the most promising of News Corporation 's now limited Chinese operations .
Mr Murdoch has cooled on China .
In recent months he has found a new passion , retooling the Wall Street Journal .
Few News Corporation executives have written about their boss .
Mr Dover does so evenly , without venom , and with a quizzical tone that suggests Mr Murdoch was a little naive about the Chinese .
He tells the reader about Mr Murdoch 's perpetual motion , his mania for phoning his executives at all hours , and how he keeps tabs on his $ 70 billion business by always travelling with a blue folder containing weekly print - outs of the financial status of his companies from New York to Cairns .
No one has staked so much personal prestige on the quest for China , Mr Dover says .
Foreign companies have yet to be allowed into the 380 m Chinese homes that have televisions .
Now nearly 77 , Mr Murdoch is beginning to recognise that this may not happen on his watch .
We are in the middle of a rolling authoritarian and even fascist coup that is working with and through the United States Constitution to no small degree .
To be sure , Trump is doing everything in his considerable power to undermine a “ normal ” bourgeois - constitutional election .
He ’s working to sabotage mail delivery in an election that will depend on mail - in ballots thanks to the pandemic Trump has fanned .
He ’s deploying armed right - wing “ poll watchers ” to intimidate minority and other Biden voters .
He ’s encouraging terrorist street actions and intimidation by white “ tough guys ” ( bikers , militia members , cops , and soldiers ) before , during , and after the election .
His party will mess with voting sites and access in majority Democratic jurisdictions .

Capitol Hill bigwigs boot ABC journalist from beer - lobbyist bash Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 10 , 2007

Print This Email This Lobbying firms across Washington are not letting new ethics rules dampen their spirits as they send holiday party invitations to lawmakers and Congressional staffers this month .
Omitted from the guest lists : nosy reporters trying to document the elbow - rubbing among the powerful elite within the nation 's capital .
ABC
News investigative reporter Brian Ross was booted from " at least one " holiday party last week , where Members of Congress , their aides and outside lobbyists noshed on finger - foods and Guinness draught , reports Roll Call .
The " Taste of the Holidays " party was held Wednesday night in the Rayburn House Office Building cafeteria and was sponsored by the National Beer Wholesalers Association and Brewers Association .
" Ross entered the party with cameras rolling , " according to the paper 's Heard on the Hill gossip column .
" His goal : to show perks lawmakers and staffers receive during the holidays as trade groups and lobby shops throw swanky parties on Capitol Hill .
Unsurprisingly , the newsman was treated like an interloper by the party 's sponsors . "
A witness to the dustup told the column that Ross was booted from the bash as soon as he arrived .
Apparently the beer - pushing sponsors did n't appreciate their uninvited guest , and Ross would have violated House rules that ban video cameras in the cafeterias without prior approval .
After his expulsion , Ross waited outside the doors to catch partygoers on their way out .
This week 's interloping is not Ross 's first foray into party - crashing .
During the 2004 Republican National Convention , Ross sent some stunningly dressed female producers -- who became known as " Brian 's Angles " -- to lobbying - sponsored confabs around New York with hidden cameras .
Perhaps a similar strategy would 've served him better Wednesday .
" We have a lot of women working here who have both brains and beauty .
And they manage to talk their way into these parties , " he told the New York Daily News at the time , " while I - lacking both , I guess - am left outside ...
I can tell you that a few black dresses have been purchased for the summer . "
The party reports are part of ABC 's long - running series tracing the connections between money and politics .
His latest report will air on ABC's World News Tonight Monday .
The sponsors of Wednesday 's party insist their bash complied with new ethics laws and said fuss over Ross 's appearance was overblown , but his network defends the reporting .
" Reporting on how big money is spent in the halls of government is a worthy and important undertaking , " an ABC News spokeswoman told Heard on the Hill .
" Our award - winning series , Money Trail , has done that for years and will continue to do so . "

" For the fourth consecutive day people waited in long lines for a shot at a new Wal - Mart in Dekalb County , pushing the total number of applicants beyond 10,000 .
Beginning Monday , after no advertising or any signs , the throngs of hopeful applicants continued to pour into a church converted into a job processing center - all vying for only 350 available jobs .
The job seeking FRENZY may be a peek into a larger economic picture .
Wal - Mart has long declined to reveal starting salaries at the store , but reports that the average hourly wage for full - time associates is $ 10.65 an hour . "
Note - Wal - Mart hires people on at mostly part - time positions .
Most alarming is that Wal - Mart is our nation 's largest employer .

I see my old pal Bill is spreading dynamic language FUD again .
I ’m the “ dynamic language evangelist colleague ” to whom he sent the email he mentions .
First , I find it funny that he calls me a “ dynamic language evangelist . ”
I ’m really more of a multi-language evangelist , or as Ola Bini recently put it , a polyglot programmer ( in fact much of Ola ’s recent thread on this topic matches up well with what I said on the closing JAOO 2006 panel ) .
This year marks my 20th year of using C++ , for example , and I still use it every day , so that probably automatically disqualifies me from membership in any dynamic language clubs .
But this year also marks my 20th year of using both Perl and emacs - lisp , so maybe there ’s hope for me yet .
Bill gets irrationally upset when I tell him I write in five different languages every day .
They are , in no particular order , Erlang , C++ , Python , Perl , and emacs - lisp .
I really like Ruby but unfortunately do n’t get much chance to use it at the moment .
I even have to delve into SQL every now and again .
Apparently , this notion drives Bill crazy not only because I do n’t use Java ( though I ’ve written my share of it in the past ) , but also because it means I ca n’t use an IDE , since no IDE can handle all of the above .
Apparently , if you ca n’t use an IDE to automatically rename your methods for you every 10 minutes or so , you ’re not a real programmer .
Bill ’s posting , like his original email to me that sparked it , is yet another “ we ’ve got to put these dynamic language folks in their place ” postings ( read to the bottom of that link for the context ) .
He basically says so himself .
His posting is full of the usual misunderstandings , rumors , poor guesses , and misinformation .
Issue 1 : Dynamic Language XXXX did n’t do well against Java in XXXX benchmark
According to Bill , glaring differences between languages in how they perform on benchmarks must be recognized .
Yes , that ’s true — if all languages performed equally for all tasks , then we would n’t need multiple languages .
Unfortunately , monolingual developers like Bill do n’t view it that way ; instead , they view benchmarks as some sort of strange competition where you can try to build up your self - esteem by gloating over the benchmarks for which your one language looks good .
I asked Bill why anyone would choose a language not known for its number crunching capabilities and actually try to use it for real code requiring number - crunching , like calculations involving the Mandelbrot set .
He did n’t answer .
In reality , we need multiple languages because there are so many trade - offs to make .
One way to address the need to make trade - offs is to choose a general - purpose language like Java and hope that it ’s good enough for whatever you have to work on .
Another way , and the way I prefer , is to be adept at multiple languages so that you can use the right tool for the job and handle unforeseen requirements .
When a monolingual developer runs into a task for which their one language is ill - suited , they typically either bend the problem to fit their language , or they just avoid solving it altogether .
Hammer , meet nail .
Either way , they ’re out of luck , or actually , their customer is out of luck .
We polyglots do n’t have that problem .
Issue 2 : Ruby VM cannot support kernel threads
This issue is already addressed in comments in Bill ’s blog , where several people mention all the current work on Ruby internals .
But I would add that someone who ’s writing authoritatively about Ruby should at least do his homework and already know that this “ burning ” issue is actually not an issue .
Bill mentioned both in his email to me and on his blog that even his beloved Java still needs work , citing the need for “ typesafe closures to complement annotations , ” “ a standard , non -code generating way of adding behavior to annotations , ” and “ a structural syntax to make initialization easier . ”
I assume therefore that the fact that Ruby also needs work will not be held against it .
Dynamic languages like Ruby , Python , etc … are not typesafe / statically typed
This is where Bill gets into the IDE religion .
When I told him I use five different languages every day and said that I do n’t need an IDE , he got mad and called me a name .
It was n’t even a particularly imaginative name , so perhaps he could get his IDE to automatically rename that name for him to turn it into a better insult .
I asked if he could recommend a good IDE that could adequately handle all those languages for me , but he did n’t answer .
I use emacs .
I ’ve used it since 1985 .
I used Eclipse over the past few years for my Java work , and I really had strong hopes for it for other languages , but it ’s still too Java - centric , and my current work does n’t involve Java anyway .
I am highly productive with emacs , and I see no reason whatsoever to change .
Bill asks why we can’t have a dynamically statically typed language .
We can ; see for example Haskell , and go look at all of Erik Meijer ’s work .
Lack of type safety does n’t scale well to large teams
Prove it .
This is pure conjecture , nothing more , nothing less .
Scaling development has everything to do with the team members and how they work and work together .
Saying that “ my buddy Jason was on a team that had to put type names in their Python function names ” is certainly not even close to being solid evidence of your claim , Bill .
For that particular example , BTW , why not describe the typing expectations for a function in its docstring , thus making it easily accessible to actual human programmers from their interactive Python prompts ?
That ’s way better than applying some weird brittle Hungarian notation convention .
Lack of static typing does not allow for reliable refactoring in modern IDEs
The contrived Ruby example that Bill uses to “ prove ” this is , well , contrived .
Why would anyone write code like that or suddenly get the urge to rename init to init2 ?
I ’m no Ruby expert , but I ’d probably rename the method and then stick a method_missing in there to catch any call instances I might have missed with my editor .
I ’m sure a stronger Ruby developer can suggest a better way .
Either way , it ’s really not a big deal , Bill .
I ’m sure I could get it done well within the timespan you waste on fantasy football every day . ;-)
In 20 years of writing some pretty large C++ systems , for example , I do n’t really recall ever having to go and rename a whole bunch of functions across a codebase .
I recently had to move some classes from one C++ namespace to another , but a few lines of elisp automatically fixed 3000 + files for me , all without breaking the build ( and yes I ’m aware of namespace aliasing , thanks ) .
I asked him if these magical modern IDEs that raise productivity and eliminate common errors also eliminate defects caused by missing or misunderstood requirements , missed use cases , or just plain ol ’ bad programming .
Again , no answer .
The reason I asked this is that those are the bad bugs ; syntactical errors are really the least of your worries .
Even if the IDE spits out common idiom / pattern skeletons for you , it ’s still quite possible to screw up the code logic , and neither the IDE nor the compiler is going to prevent that .
I asked Bill if he ’s ever considered that Java IDEs are the way they are due to issues with the Java language itself that must be compensated for .
Consider its verbosity , for example , which is why IDEs spit out those skeletons .
I ca n’t remember if he called me a name for asking that , or if he just did n’t answer .
Either way , I got no response .
Bill asks if we ca n’t just learn how to type , but is n’t it the other way around ?
Should n’t he be asking why he needs the IDE to type for him ?
Odd .
Considering how old Java is , it ’s obvious that it ’s taken quite a bit of time to get these IDEs to where they are today .
I asked Bill if everyone should have to wait a long time , on the order of 10 - 15 years , before an IDE truly becomes valuable for a given language .
No answer .
Personally , I ’d rather stick to my emacs and UNIX tools , with their infinite applicability and flexibility that can be used for development in pretty much any language , than wait around for someone else to give me a far less functional IDE that barely addresses only one language .
But then again , if one language is all you got , then I guess you have no choice .
The rest of the myths Bill cites just circle back to the same weak IDE arguments again , so I ’ll skip those , save for this one :
Software Engineers should use the best language for the job
Yes , this is true , unless you ’re an elitist .
Like Bill , I ’ve spent much of my career writing middleware .
However , unlike Bill , I ’m not happy to sit around thinking that C++ or Java is the best we can do .
I wish I would have known about Erlang 10 years ago , for example , so I could have saved myself countless development hours and headaches .
In hindsight , I wasted way too much time trying to build in C++ and Java what Erlang basically gives you for free .
I have only my own ignorance to blame , but now I know better .
Thankfully , I now work in a place that lets me apply the right language for the right job , and our productivity is significantly higher than any place else I ’ve ever worked .
I told Bill that if he wanted to do benchmarking , he should go benchmark the Yaws web server , written in Erlang , against Apache or some Java web server .
Needless to say , that would be far more realistic to a lot of developers than Mandelbrot calculations .
His response was that he did n’t need to , because Apache would win .
That kind of poor assumption is much like the mindset that led me to poorly reinvent half of Erlang in my years of middleware work .
These days , though , if I saw this graph I ’d be highly intrigued — and in fact , I was when I first saw it — so much so that I ’d want to run my own tests to see if those claims were accurate .
My own tests were smaller scale than what that graph shows , but the results were basically the same .
I ’ve rerun my own tests and some others as well , and I get the same results every time .
So Bill , rather than guess and make assumptions , why not try it for yourself ?
Or are you afraid to find out that dynamic languages actually are quite useful ?
The things I write about in this blog are based on significant hands - on experience .
Unlike many developers , I ’ve heavily used approaches and techniques from both sides of the fence , and based on all my experiences , I ’d rather use dynamic languages than static ones .
I have more success with them , and the systems I use them for turn out better .
That ’s not wishful thinking or fabrication , that ’s simply the cold , hard , factual truth .
I wonder , then , why Bill and others like him insist of trying to “ cure ” me and others like me of our successes ?
If you do n’t like dynamic languages , then do n’t use them !
Leave us alone and go back to your monolingual world , and maybe rename your methods again .
You can even have my IDE , since I ’m not using it , which should double your productivity yet again , right ?
Cyndi Lauper at the Beach Wearing SPF 1000
is hanging out at the beach in Hawaii and it looks like she is keeping a tight grip on her sunblock .
Somebody needs to get her a pair of sunglasses so she can open her eyes .
Lauper is on break right now from her True Colors tour , but she will be back on the stage in Australia on February 22nd .
We have added a few more pictures of the singer at the beach on the next page .
Radiohead , like the Beatles , is one of the last high - profile bands to refuse to sell their music on Apple ’s iTunes music store .
They apparently do n’t like Apple ’s practice of selling individual tracks rather than entire albums .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
There are currently only three Radiohead songs available on iTunes , all as part of soundtracks and compilations .
But head over to 7digital , and you ’ll find all of Radiohead ’s albums plus some early singles , available in the 320 Kbps , DRM - free MP3 format .
According to an EMI , Radiohead refuses to distribute via Apple — even through Apple ’s DRM - free iTunes Plus store — entirely because of Apple ’s policy of selling tracks individually :
" iTunes insists that all its albums are soldunbundled , but 7digital does n’t .
Radiohead prefer to have their albumssold complete .
The artist has a choice , and if they feel strongly thenwe respect that . "
Pricesare in UK pounds , but 7digital apparently lets you purchase albums fromRadiohead , EMI ’s other artists , and other bands from anywhere in theworld using a credit card or Paypal .
The site also offers free streamingwidgets of 30 - second samples of the albums it sells , like this one , for Radiohead ’s Hail to the Thief :

As a new parent eight years ago , I swore never to buy a video game system , certain that my child would spend her leisure time reading and playing outside .
I recently remembered this vow while waiting in line for two hours outside the Nintendo store in Manhattan .
Like hundreds of other parents , I was trying to get my hands on the Nintendo Wii , a popular video game system and one of the season ’s hottest toys .
My conversion from video game critic to buyer is due in large part to some recent research showing that so - called active video games , like those played on the Wii , are n’t like the sedentary games played by the Atari generation .
Far from creating couch potatoes , these games compel players to dance , jump and sweat .
While the active video games are clearly an improvement , excessive video game playing by kids is still cause for concern .
Exposure to violent video game content is linked with aggression and antisocial behavior , and game playing has been shown to have a small but still measurable impact on time spent reading and doing homework for certain children .
Instead of building a huge Millennium Falcon out of thousands of LEGO pieces , Tim Goddard decided to use a thousands of LEGO blocks to create 200 Star Wars mini-sets , from Star Destroyers to TIE Interceptors and Snow Speeders .
He then uses these mini-scale make famous movie scenes , including the Battle of Hoth , the Millennium Falcon inside the Death Star and the race through the tunnels of Death Star II .
The level of abstraction while keeping " apparent " detail is amazing at this scale .

Jesús Díaz :
How many of these constructions do you have ?
It looks like a gigantic fleet .
Tim Goddard : I 've got about 200 mini vehicles of varing size .
Most of the stuff I 'm building right now is in a scale of 1 cm : 2 m so it 's mainly starfighters and Imperial walker type stuff .
I 've built 6 dioramas in plastic domes to this scale to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Star Wars last year , one for each film .
Advertisement
I 've also got a fleet of capital ships at a scale of 1 cm : 6 m .
These battle ships have been inspired by ( and to fight against ! ) the official ' Ultimate Collectors ' set made by Lego of the Imperial Star Destroyer .
JD : LEGO has some old Star Wars micro-sets like yours ... do you think they should release more of this micro- scale sets for creating vast squadrons of spaceships , to create " tin-soldier " - like dioramas , like you do ?
I 'm thinking in a massive Death Star trench here ...
TG : That would be great !
Unfortunatley LEGO is n't making any of these sets right now , but there are rumours that we will see the return of this line in the summer .
I think there would be a big market for mini Star Wars LEGO ... who would n't want Darth Vader 's TIE dogfighting with an X - wing on your desk ?
And there are loads of fans who would love to have some dioramas , there are so many classic moments from the films just waiting to be made .
JD : How do you reach to these super - simplified constructions ?
Do you do some planning first or you go straight for it ?
TG : Just go for it !
Well , mostly .
Loads of reference pictures are essential and I often use an architect 's ruler in the scale I 'm working in ; making the dimensions as accurate as possible is key to getting the look ( but you can't help a bit of chunkiness , this is LEGO after all ! )
It can take ages to get the smallest model to look just right , endlessly taking it apart and putting it back together again .
JD : Yeah , I can imagine ... how long have you been doing LEGO ?
TG : Pretty much all my life .
Space Lego was my favorite as a kid , and when they released Star Wars LEGO it was a match made in heaven !
I 've been making my own custom Star Wars stuff for maybe 5 years but I 've always enjoyed building .

In November 2007 , Donald Kennedy , then - editor of the prestigious journal Science , announced that for the next five issues , each of the research articles would include a brief " author 's summary " written in plain language .
This was being done as part of a publishing experiment by the journal because , as Kennedy put it ,
It 's clear that accessibility is a problem , because we 're all laypeople these days :
Each specialty has focused in to a point at which even the occupants of neighboring fields have trouble understanding each others ' papers .
Some of the more general and widely read journals , such as Science and Nature , already had summaries like these written by others ( either experts or science writers ) to make a small number of the " sexiest " papers in each issue more understandable to the readership , but this approach is novel as it applies to more papers and is contributed by the original authors .
In reporting on this , University Affairs has printed a story entitled " Popularize or perish " , in which Jacob Berkowitz makes the broader point that achievment in making one 's research accessible to the public is becoming part of the academic review process .
I know that I certainly provide details about my activities in this sphere during annual reviews .
This includes not just participation in media stories ( e.g. , interviews ) but also blogging .
That is to say , the fact that you are reading blogs like this matters to an increasing proportion of practicing scientists .
As I see it , discovering new details about how the world works is only one part of the role of Science 2.0 .
The other , equally important side is to explain these observations , both in terms of providing mechanistic accountings of them but also in making this information open to nonspecialists .
Presenting new and exciting information to non-scientists in an accessible , interesting , and not least of all accurate way should be among the primary objectives of modern professional scientists .
The earlier tendency of many scientists to look down upon ( or " saganize " ) popularizers is an obsolete attitude .
As Berkowitz argues , it is not an issue of " dumb it down " , but " story it up " .
Blogs , author summaries , interaction with the media , and other means can all be used to substantial effect in this endeavour .
The fact that many academic institutions are beginning to recognize the importance of such activities is a positive sign that the ivory tower of old is at least having more windows installed .
I , for one , will enjoy the added light .

The Other Chapter 11 Everyone 's heard about NAFTA  the North American Free Trade Agreement  and all the talk about jobs .
But almost no one heard about one obscure section of NAFTA  Chapter 11  except for multinational corporations who are using it to challenge democracy .
Chapter 11 is only one provision in the 555 - page North American Free Trade Agreement  negotiated to promote business among the US , Canada and Mexico .
It was supposedly written to protect investors if foreign governments tried to seize their property .
But corporations have stretched NAFTA 's Chapter 11 to undermine environmental decisions  the decisions of local communities  even the verdict of an American jury .
The cases brought so far total almost four billion dollars .
William Greider , THE NATION magazine
WILLIAM GREIDER :
What offends me most is that these lawyers understood that public laws were gonna come under attack in this system , and they just walked right past the question of where 's the American public in this ?
BILL MOYERS : They now have the right to sue governments ?
WILLIAM GREIDER : Right , and sue them directly , without having to get the approval of their own government .
And that 's one of the features of NAFTA which is distinctively different from all previous trade agreements .

Sen. Sheila Kuehl , Chair , California International Trade Policy Committee
SEN .
SHEILA KUEHL : ( Chair , California International Trade Policy Committee ) : First , I was astounded because I really knew nothing about Chapter Eleven .
And you know the kind of reaction that you get from people when you say , did you know that one investor in a foreign company can sue the United States because of an environmental protection law in California ?
People are astounded once they kind of grasp it .
BILL MOYERS : Senator Sheila Kuehl chairs a committee examining the impact of US trade agreements on California laws .
SEN .
SHEILA KUEHL : I think it 's just the tip of the iceberg because , in a way , it opens the idea to foreign investors that wherever they might suffer , as they imagine , under some regulation , under some law , statute passed by a state , all they have to do is file a claim and , you know , it 's taken seriously and the United States has to defend itself and the state has to defend itself .

The California case in point began with a chemical  MTBE  that was added to gasoline to help the state clean up its air .
But MTBE was found to cause cancer in laboratory animals .
And in 1995 , it began to show up in drinking water .

WASHINGTON – Nabila Mango , a therapist and a U.S. citizen who has lived in the country since 1965 , had just flown in from Jordan in December when , she said , she was detained by U.S. Customs officers and her cell phone was taken from her purse .
Her daughter , waiting for her outside San Francisco International Airport , tried repeatedly to call her during the hour and a half she was questioned .
But after her phone was returned , Mango saw that records of her daughters ’ calls had been erased .
A few months earlier in the same airport , a tech engineer returning from a business trip to London objected when a federal agent asked him to type his password into his laptop computer .
“ This laptop does n’t belong to me , ” he said .
“ It belongs to my company . ”
Eventually , he agreed to log on and stood by as the officer copied the Web sites he had visited , said the engineer , a U.S. citizen who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of calling attention to himself .
The seizure of electronics at U.S. borders has prompted protests from travelers who say they now weigh the risk of traveling with sensitive or personal information on their laptops , cameras or cell phones .
In some cases , companies have altered their policies to require employees to safeguard corporate secrets by clearing laptop hard drives prior to international travel .
Today , the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Asian Law Caucus , two civil liberties groups in San Francisco , are filing a lawsuit to force the government to disclose its policies on border searches , including what rules govern the seizing and copying of the contents of electronic devices .
They also want to know the boundaries for asking travelers about their political views , religious practices and other activities potentially protected by the First Amendment .
The question of whether border agents have a right to search electronic devices without suspicion of a crime already is under review in the federal courts .
The lawsuit was inspired by some two dozen cases , 15 of which involved searches of cell phones , laptops , MP3 players and other electronics .
Almost all involved travelers of Muslim , Middle Eastern or South Asian background , many of whom , including Mango and the tech engineer , said they are concerned they were singled out because of racial or religious profiling .
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman , Lynn Hollinger , said customs officers do not engage in racial profiling “ in any way , shape or form . ”
She said a laptop may be seized if it contains information possibly tied to terrorism , narcotics smuggling , child pornography or other criminal activity .
The Association of Corporate Travel Executives , which represents 2,500 business executives in the United States and abroad , said it has tracked complaints from several members whose laptops have been seized and their contents copied before usually being returned days later .
The U.S. government has argued in a pending court case that its authority to protect the country ’s border extends to looking at information stored inside electronic devices .
In border searches , it regards a laptop as no different from a suitcase .
As more and more people travel with laptops and BlackBerrys and cell phones , the government ’s laptop - equals - suitcase position is raising red flags .
“ It ’s one thing to say it ’s reasonable for government agents to open your luggage , ” said David Cole , a law professor at Georgetown University .
“ It ’s another thing to say it ’s reasonable for them to read your mind and everything you have thought over the last year . ”
Chinese terrorists are streaming across the border .
Barack Obama is a violent socialist .
Mexico has been launching military attacks against America .
God has endorsed Mike Huckabee .
Spend a week with Republicans in South Carolina and you will hear the most incredible things .
That a small minority in any group might say crazy things is not surprising ; it is when the majority do n't dismiss them as crazy that you start to worry .
At first it sounds as though most of them are living in a state of suspended reality .
But with time you realise that they have simply been marinating in the bellicose polemics of talk radio and rightwing news anchors for far too long .
Their reality is specific and bespoke .
Having warped their understanding of how the world works to suit their ideology , they now have the terrible burden of having to live in it .
On the whole , these are personally affable and politically angry people .
The targets of their rage are clear : Hillary Clinton , the liberal media , illegal immigrants , Muslims , taxes , the government and nationalised healthcare all take their turns in the crosshairs .
But the source of their rage is a mystery .
In George Bush , Conservatives have had almost everything they wanted .
Tax cuts , war and conservative supreme court justices have all been forthcoming .
For much of the time he has been in the White House the Republicans have controlled both houses of Congress too .
To the faithful , that the economy is nosediving , the war has been judged a failure and the president 's approval ratings scrape historic lows are tiresome details .
Since they only have themselves to blame , they simply change the subject and hope no one will notice .
When Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney declares " Washington is broken " before a cheering crowd in Bluffton , you have to wonder who they think broke it .
Romney went on to say , with a straight face , that he drew his inspiration from " Ronald Reagan , George Herbert Walker Bush , Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush " .
When a leading presidential contender says he is enthused by the president 's mother but wo n't mention the president himself , it becomes clear to what extent those who wish to be head of state must first occupy a state of denial .
The fact that the Republicans would rather pretend the last seven years did n't happen than deal with their consequences lies at the root of the agonising slugfest that is their primary race .
Six elections into the nominating process , not one of their candidates can claim the consistent support of more than 25 % of their voters .
At present , their primary battle remains a four - horse race .
The trouble is the horses keep changing and one of them is n't even out of the gate yet .
Romney , John McCain and Huckabee have all had their moment in the sun over the past few weeks only to be eclipsed by defeat .
Huckabee has won one race ; McCain two and Romney three ( although two of those were barely contested ) .
Meanwhile , Rudy Giuliani , once a national favourite , has yet to hit double digits and is waiting to kick off his campaign in Florida , which votes next week .
Each candidate has proven his ability to appeal to a specific segment of the Republican base or a particular state , but has largely struggled to gain traction beyond those local constituencies .
Take Romney .
On Saturday , he won Nevada with a barnstorming 51 % in the afternoon only to finish the evening fourth in South Carolina ( where until recently he had spent a lot of time and energy ) with just 15 % .
The two results were linked .
He owed his huge margin of victory in Nevada in no small part to Mormons , who comprise just 7 % of the state 's population but made up 26 % of the Republican caucus vote .
According to exit polls , 95 % of them voted for Romney , who is also a Mormon .
In South Carolina , on the other hand , many would n't vote for him because he was a Mormon - white evangelicals make up more than half the Republican base there and only 11 % backed him .
If they want someone who can take Ohio , Nevada , Florida and Pennsylvania - key swing states - in the presidential election in November , Republicans will need a candidate with a far broader and consistent national appeal than that .
McCain 's victory in South Carolina on Saturday suggests that might be him .
He has now won in the libertarian north - east of New Hampshire and the socially conservative south .
The trouble is that the Republicans do n't really like him - he is , among other things , insufficiently pious and xenophobic .
" If either of these two guys get the nomination , it 's going to destroy the Republican party , " said the conservative talk - show host Rush Limbaugh referring to McCain and Huckabee .
" It 's going to change it forever , be the end of it .
A lot of people are n't going to vote . "
What we are witnessing is the unravelling of the alliance of evangelicals , southerners , white men , neocons , corporations and the wealthy that elected Bush .
In truth , it was only ever a coalition of the convenient - and not a particularly brilliant one at that .
Bush was a crude majoritarian .
His aim was only ever to win 51 % of the vote .
Unlike Reagan , who managed to remould the electoral landscape by expanding the appeal of his party , there is no such thing as a Bush Democrat .
Indeed , the Bush coalition was not big enough to win the first election without the help of the supreme court and would not have scraped through the second election without a war .
Now , in the absence of a candidate they can agree on and extenuating circumstances to push them over the edge , the various factions that helped him to power are at loggerheads .
Bush has bequeathed the same legacy to his party as he has to the nation - division .
The Democrats ' propensity to gloat at this cruel irony is understandable .
It is also a mistake .
True , while Republicans bemoan their paltry choice , turnout for Democratic primaries and caucuses has set new records and revealed rarely seen levels of enthusiasm .
Judging by those taking part , the Democratic base is expanding and rejuvenating itself .
But it is no less true that the Democratic primaries have raised little in the way of political debate .
Where a vigorous discussion about how to end the war , rebuild the economy or extend healthcare should be , they have instead indulged themselves in a beauty contest that is simultaneously entertaining , engaging and empty .
It has been a battle of nouns - " experience " versus " change " - but not verbs .
Quite what they would actually do with this experience or what they would change is not entirely clear .
The mayhem in the Republican party primaries is being driven by differences in policy ; the order among Democrats has been created by an obsession with personality .
Whoever wins the Republican nomination will have been tested ; whoever becomes the Democratic candidate will have been crowned .
The Republicans may be in desperate need of consensus ; but the Democrats are in dire need of content .

Welcome to the world of A Scanner Darkly — made real .
In March , a group of students at the University of Washington will put RFID tags ( small radio - frequency emitting computer chips ) all over their clothes and belongings .
RFID readers that scan and track the tags will be installed throughout the campus ' 6 - story Paul Allen Building for computer science ( pictured here ) .
Every move the students make , and many objects they interact with , will be monitored and logged .
Plus , students will test a " friend finding " application called RFIDer that will allow them to monitor their friends ' whereabouts at all times .
Participants are eager to volunteer , and call the experience a glimpse into the future .
What could possibly be motivating them ?

According to the University of Washington news service :
To see what this future world would be like , a pilot project involving dozens of volunteers in the University of Washington 's computer science building provides the next step in social networking , wirelessly monitoring people and things in a closed environment .
Beginning in March , volunteer students , engineers and staff will wear electronic tags on their clothing and belongings to sense their location every five seconds throughout much of the six - story building .
The information will be saved to a database , published to Web pages and used in various custom tools .
The project is one of the largest experiments looking at wireless tags in a social setting .
The RFID Ecosystem project aims to create a world that many technology experts predict is just on the horizon , said project leader Magda Balazinska , a UW assistant professor of computer science and engineering .
The project explores the use of radio - frequency identification , or RFID , tags in a social environment .
The team has installed some 200 antennas in the Paul Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering .
Early next month researchers will begin recruiting 50 volunteers from about 400 people who regularly use the building .
" Our goal is to ask what benefits can we get out of this technology and how can we protect people 's privacy at the same time , " Balazinska said .
" We want to get a handle on the issues that would crop up if these systems become a reality . " . . .
The pilot study will incorporate two new student - developed features that aim to exploit the system 's potential benefits .
One invention is a tool that records a person 's movements in Google Calendar .
Study participants can set the system to instantaneously publish activities on their Web calendar , such as arrival at work , meetings or lunch breaks .
" It 's a perfect memory system that records all your personal interactions throughout the day , " Welbourne said .
" You can go back a day later , a month later , and see , ' What did I do that day ? ' or , ' Who have I spent my time with lately ? ' "
Another tool is a friend finder , named RFIDder ( pronounced " fritter " ) .
This sends instant alerts to participants ' e-mail addresses or cell phones telling them when friends are in certain places .
With RFIDder , each user can specify who is allowed to see their data .
They can change the settings at any time , and can easily turn it off whenever they do n't want to be found .
The system will link to Twitter , an online blog that lets people post their whereabouts online .
" We want to observe how a group of people uses these tools , whether they find them useful , how they adapt them , " Balazinska said .

I 'm glad the group is studying the privacy implications of all this , because holy crap .
Do you really want your colleagues to see when you 've left the building or gone to the bathroom on your Google Calendar ?
Or for your Facebook friends to know exactly where you are at all times ?
I 'm having a hard time understanding why an RFID Ecosystem future is one that I would want to embrace or plan for in any way other than lobbying to make it illegal .
Future of Social Networking [ U of Washington News ]
WASHINGTON 
After weeks of tough talk , Democrats appear resigned to back down again on providing money for the Iraq war .
What happened ?
" Republicans , Republicans , Republicans , " said Jim Manley , spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev .
" The real problem here is the president and his Republican backers " who have " staked out an increasingly hard - lined position . "
Indeed , with Democrats holding a razor - thin majority in the Senate and with 60 votes needed to overcome procedural hurdles , Senate Republicans were in a plum negotiating spot this month .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , insisted that if Democrats want legislation paying for government operations this year , they will have to include money for the Iraq war .
" Do Republicans have a tough stance on funding the troops in the field ?
Yes , " said McConnell 's spokesman , Don Stewart .
" Because we made a commitment to the troops overseas to give them the training and equipment and support that they need . "
Democrats now are expected to allow Senate Republicans to attach tens of billions of dollars for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to a $ 500 billion - plus government - wide spending bill .
That move would be in exchange for GOP support on the huge spending measure .
The war money would not be tied to troop withdrawals , as Democrats want .
But it would let Democrats wrap up their long - unfinished budget work and go on vacation before Christmas .
It also would spare them from criticism during the holiday recess by President Bush for leaving work without providing money for the troops .
Without the money , the Defense Department said it would start delivering pink slips to thousands of contractors this month .
The plan caps off a disappointing year for Democrats on Iraq .
The party had taken control of Congress for the first time since 1994 , seizing on the public 's frustration with the war .
Even with their election victory , the slim margins in the Senate have rendered Democrats powerless in trying to bring troops home .
" We 've tried maybe a dozen times " to bring troops home , said Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
" And when we do try and we do n't succeed , we still provide funding for the troops . "
Such talk runs contrary to the rhetoric just three weeks ago by other Democratic leaders .
Senate Republicans were blocking a $ 50 billion bill that would have paid for combat operations and set a goal of bringing troops home by December 2008 .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , told reporters the House would not respond by sending Bush the bill he wanted , without conditions on withdrawal .
If efforts fail in the Senate , " we 're not going to be taking it up anymore over here , " she said at a Nov. 15 news conference .
The measure fell by a 53 - 45 vote in the Senate , seven short of the 60 needed .
Afterward , Reid said the House " has made their position clear " and suggested the Senate would not revisit the issue .
" We 're going to continue to do the right thing for the American people by having limited accountability for the president and not a blank check , " he said .
Because the Army has enough money through mid-February , he said , " everyone should rest with a good conscience . "
Other Democrats stuck to that line .
" The days of a free lunch are over , " said Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. Rep. David Obey , D - Wis. , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , said : " If the president wants that $ 50 billion released , all he has to do is to call the Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell , and ask him to stop blocking it . "
But facing an uphill battle , the House is now expected to vote as early as Tuesday on the catchall spending measure and an estimated $ 30 billion for Afghanistan and some domestic military requirements .
The bill would not initially include money for Iraq , until it makes its way to the Senate and faces the threat of a GOP filibuster .
That is when Reid is expected to allow a vote on a Republican amendment to add the Iraq money .
The House is expected to accept the deal .
" Certainly the Senate remains an obstacle , " said Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami .
" We hope the Senate takes up and passes the bill as approved by the House . " Copyright 2007 The Associated Press .

Click to viewHD DVD is dead .
Officially .
That may mean a whole bunch for the early - adopter tech geek crowd that 's been wading in the kiddie pool of technological bickering and backhandedness for years , but what does it mean for the average consumer with only a cursory interest in high - def DVDs ?
Here 's our cheat sheet Q&A for you to whip out if you ever have to explain the high - def format wars to your parents .

Toshiba Kills HD DVD , Official
We have been saying it for ages , but now it 's official .
HD DVD has been pronounced dead on Tuesday , Read more
Q : I chose sides early in the HD DVD / Blu-ray shenanigans and unfortunately , made the right decision and supported HD DVD .
What do I do now ?
A : Try and sell your HD DVD player or Xbox 360 HD DVD add - on as fast as you can .
Go list it on craigslist or eBay already .
The mainstream has n't heard about HD DVD 's demise just yet , which means you can find some chump to buy your player and movies on the cheap .
How soundly you sleep at night is up to you .

Q : Really ?
You mean my player is useless ?
Wo n't there be any more movies released on HD DVD ?
A : A few more releases that are already in the pipeline might trickle out in the next couple months , but just watch as all the studios abandon the format and go exclusively Blu-ray .
You 're better off just selling off all your stuff unless you want to keep it around to win our retro Gizmodo tech contest of 2028 .
Q : But what if I already have a gigantic HD DVD library ?
A : It depends on how gigantic it is .
If it 's not too big , you can re-buy your library on Blu-ray .
If it 's huge , you might want to buy a combo player , like the one from LG , in order to ease your transition .
Either way , you 're going to be out a bit of money .
You might want to just shoot yourself in the face now and be done with it .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Q : I chose sides early in the HD DVD / Blu-ray shenanigans and chose Blu-ray .
What do I do now ?
A : Besides calling up your grandmother to rub it in her face , there 's not much you need to do .
Just sit and wait for your favorite movies to come out on Blu-ray .
Advertisement
Q : Right , but how long do I have to wait , exactly , before I can watch Batman Begins on my PlayStation 3 ?
A : Beats me .
Now that Blu-ray is the de-facto format , the studios should be falling over themselves trying to remaster their already released HD DVD movies onto Blu-ray .
If we had to guess , it'd be within the year .
Q : OK , now that the war is " officially over , " is it time for me to buy a Blu-ray player ?
A : Maybe .
It 's still relatively early in the technology 's lifespan , which means prices for Blu-ray players are still quite high when you compare it to the sub -$ 100 upscaling DVD players you can find at Wal - Mart .
Plus , the BD library is incredibly thin when compared to DVD , so you might not be getting much use out of the player in your day - to - day movie watching .
But if you really do want to get into the HD game ( and have an HDTV to back it up ) , it 's finally safe to buy a player .

Q : So you 're saying that I 'm going to be paying more for these movies on Blu-ray ?
When will the prices drop to DVD levels ?
A : That 's tough to say .
For example , Superman Returns is only $ 14.98 for the DVD version but $ 23.95 for the Blu-ray version .
It 's going to take a few years yet for that 23 to drop to 14 .
If you had to force us to guess , we 're going to say about three years .
That 's 2011 .
Q : I do n't buy movies , I rent them .
When are Netflix and Blockbuster going to get in gear and stock a bunch of Blu-ray movies ?
A : As soon as the major studios start releasing Blu-ray movies in bulk .
If you recall the VHS to DVD transition , it took quite a while for VHS tapes to phase out , and this transition will be quite similar .
Again , if you forced us to guess , we 'd have to say 2010 .

Q : Screw it , I 'm convinced .
I 'm going to go out and buy a player today .
Which player should I buy ?
A : Unless you 're morally opposed to gaming or having a gaming device in your living room , you should go with the PlayStation 3 .
It 's software - upgradeable , plus it 's relatively cheap even when compared to standalone Blu-ray players .
You even get a gaming system thrown in .
Q : Speaking of gaming , what if I already purchased an Xbox 360 and want to be able to watch Blu-ray movies ?
Will I have to buy a PS3 ?
A : Maybe not .
Even though Microsoft backed HD DVD and released an HD DVD add - on , they were n't staking their entire console on the format ( hence , the add - on ) .
This means that Microsoft has a big minus in their column when comparing the 360 to the PS3 in terms of high - def DVD playback .
It 's a hole they 're going to want to patch up right away , so do n't be surprised if you see a Blu-ray add - on for the 360 some time in the near future .

Q : Can you sum up what I , the average consumer , should do at this point in one sentence ?
A : Wait one more year for the Blu-ray format to mature , for more titles to be released , and player prices to drop before jumping in .

Business reporter , BBC World Service
Next - generation consoles have wowed gamers with breathtaking graphics , surround sound and stunning gameplay since coming on to the market in the past year .
Halo 3 has been a massive success for Microsoft
Cutting - edge video games might be a dream come true for consumers around the world , but for many companies developing them , it 's been a nightmare .
The movie - like productions on Sony 's Playstation 3 and Microsoft 's Xbox 360 games have meant that the cost of producing them has risen sharply .
Halo 3 , an extremely popular game produced by Microsoft , is estimated to have cost $ 30 m ( £ 15 m ) .
However , the American software giant was able to recoup that , and the millions more spent on marketing , straight away .
On its first day of sales , it brought in $ 170 m , setting the record for the most money earned in a day by an entertainment product .
It far outstripped the money made in a day by Spiderman 3 , the biggest - grossing Hollywood film .
Survival game
Back in 1982 , the Japanese company Namco produced Pacman for $ 100,000 .
Now , the average Playstation 3 title is estimated to cost $ 15 m .
Even after adjusting for inflation , that is still a significant rise .
It is not unlikely that after Christmas , we may find there are some casualties
Fred Hasson , European Games Developer Federation
While production costs have tripled in recent years with the introduction of next - gen consoles , sales and revenue have hardly changed .
This means that for many of the smaller games companies , staying profitable is a serious issue .
One such company is Blitz Games , based in Leamington Spa in the UK .
Its founder and chief executive , Philip Oliver , says it 's a battle to control spiralling costs .
" These costs have risen so sharply because of the complexity of the devices which we are writing the games for , " Mr Oliver says .
" The costs have risen most sharply on the graphics side .
We have entered a new era of high - definition video gaming .
" This has led to team sizes having to increase in this area , for new tools to be created for this and generally the costs are rocketing .
This is actually having a severe hit on the industry . "
Company bosses such as Mr Oliver have needed to find novel ways of funding games development .
Increasingly , this means outsourcing some of the work abroad .
Game over
This is the biggest source for concern for the industry body , the European Games Developer Federation ( EGDF ) .
With profit margins so tight , the line between survival and failure can rest on the sales from just one Christmas .
The fear is that many companies will simply not survive the festive period .
Pacman was a blockbuster game for Namco in the 1980s
" It is not unlikely that after Christmas , we may find there are some casualties , " says EGDF chairman Fred Hasson .
" Companies would have banked on a lot of their expenditure coming good during the Christmas period , when a good quarter or more of games are sold in the UK and in Europe .
" Lack of success could mean downward share prices and some companies getting into difficulty . "
Sink or swim
Not everyone is sympathetic to the woes of the smaller players in the games industry .
Sony 's Playstation 3 and rival consoles give a stunning game experience
Professor Danny Quah , head of economics at the London School of Economics , is one of them .
He believes that we are now living in a digital economy , where almost all of the costs in starting up a new succesful product are in research and development .
" The key feature in all of these digital goods is that they are expensive to create in the first instance , hence the heavy research and development outlay , " Professor Quah says .
" But subsequently they are practically costless to reproduce in billions and billions of copies . "
This gives the major players like Microsoft and Sony an advantage .
They can afford to invest huge sums in research and development of new computer games , to make the most of the even bigger profits .
He says that this new digital economy is one of high risk and high reward .
" Because of these very high upfront fixed costs , the risks that these entrepreneurs have to undertake are likely expanded from before , " he says .
" That 's not necessarily a bad thing , though .
The fact is that with risk comes reward and the two go hand in hand .
" What we see is that the economy becomes much more in - your - face , much livelier , much more real for the people who are engaged with it . "
Long term winners
Many companies are counting on the sales to expand quickly in the coming years as these next - generation consoles become widely established in households .
There is a big market for game developers to nurture in the future
" There 's long - term rewards in this , " says independent games consultant Nick Parker .
" These products will last five or six or seven years and will increase the number of consoles out there , driving software sales .
" Obviously at the moment , it 's high - risk , because there are n't so many consoles being sold .
In the long term , there 's the opportunity to get the money back .
That 's why we are in the business . "
So , there might be money to be made at the end of it all , but for many companies now , that seems a long way away .
A bit late for that .
The office of Vice President Dick Cheney is seeking to block the release of videotaped depositions given by two aides who witnessed a physical encounter between an Iraq war opponent and Cheney .
In a motion filed Saturday , Cheney ’s office contended that the videotapes could be used to invade the privacy and embarrass two aides called to testify about the encounter in a civil lawsuit .
The motion for a protective order expressed particular concern that both aides ’ faces could wind up on YouTube.com .
“ As courts have recognized , using digital technology , a video recording can easily be ‘ cut and spliced , ’ so as to embarrass and even humiliate a witness , ” Cheney ’s lawyers wrote in a U.S. District Court filing .
“ That much can readily be seen from a visit to YouTube . . . .
A simple query using the search term ‘ deposition ’ yields over 400 video clips , in which many of the deponents are made to look boorish , mendacious , or unintelligent . ”
Programming language decisions often come down to personal preference and experience .
Most modern languages are capable of performing the majority of programming tasks and include the necessary libraries to be useful day to day .
Sometimes , interoperability concerns can dictate a particular platform , but nowadays , interoperability is commonly best achieved through XML interchange , shared SQL databases or Web services .
Therefore , when choosing a language for a particular purpose , it is often more important to look at how a language is designed , what it makes particularly easy , and what it makes more difficult .
If features or performance do not detract , intangibles such as " feel , " " elegance " and a sense of programmer productivity should be given serious weight .
Python is a powerful , opinionated and idiosyncratic scripting language , loved ( and hated ) by programmers the world over for its style , syntax and attention to whitespace .
It excels as a " glue " language for putting together applications quickly , and many Python developers feel more productive in Python than in other languages .
This article shows you why , and also points out situations when Python is perhaps not such a good choice .
First , let 's take a quick look at the way Python works : a very short technical overview ( suitable even for nontechnical managers ) .
To give you a feel for how Python looks , here is a short code snippet :
def say_hello( name ) : " " " Issue a familiar greeting " " " print " Hello %s " % name say_hello ( " Guido " )
You may not know much about Python , but you can probably guess what 's going on .
This is Python 's single best feature :
Things generally work the way you expect .
This obviousness in syntax makes the language relatively easy to learn for new programmers and easy to remember for occasional ones .
However , the fact that it differs substantially from most other languages can be a barrier .
Programming the Way Guido Indented It
Python was created by Guido van Rossum , its " Benevolent Dictator for Life . "
The language and its standard library are developed by a thriving open - source community , but under Guido 's watchful eye , Python 's consistency and spirit remain intact .
First released in the 1990s , Python is still evolving today .
Python is fully object oriented and includes a few functional programming constructs .
It also has built - in support for commonly used data structures such as lists , dictionaries and sets .
Its creators emphasize readability , consistency and simplicity ; they believe that programming languages should be concise , but not too clever for their own good .
The main implementation of Python is written in C and runs on virtually any modern platform .
There are also implementations that run inside a Java Virtual Machine ( Jython , JPype ) , on the .
Net platform ( IronPython ) and even one written in Python itself , called PyPy .
The C implementation is highly optimized , and is usually more than fast enough for normal programming tasks .
However , if raw speed is your primary priority , look to a compiled language such as C .
For embedded systems with limited memory , Python 's runtime overhead may also be a problem .
Python as a General - Purpose Language
Python is the default choice of scripting language for many developers .
In the words of one Pythonista , it is rare to start a project with Python and discover that it was an entirely inappropriate choice as it grows , because Python scales both in project size and performance .
That said , the degree of freedom that the language grants developers means they sometimes have to be a little more disciplined in how they structure their code .
It takes almost no effort to get started with Python .
At its simplest , you can just launch the python interpreter and type away in interactive mode .
The results of your statements are printed to the console immediately :
$ python >>> price = 30.0 >>> quantity = 2 >>> print " Total : %f " % round ( price * quantity )
The total cost is 60.0
Of course , this is useful only for very simple tasks , but save those statements to a file with a .py file , run that file through the interpreter and the script is executed .
As programs grow more complex , developers may define functions and classes and split code across multiple modules , or source files that make up the same program .
Modules can be organized into packages , which can be turned into distributable , self - contained bundles ( known as eggs ) .
You can find thousands of free Python packages at the Python Package Index .
For day - to - day tasks , Python 's standard library includes everything from shell interaction to file management , XML and CSV manipulation , and much more .
Python has a strong role in business computing , particularly in Web and enterprise development .
Let 's take a look at when it's the best ( and not - so - best ) choice .
Python on the Desktop
You can write desktop applications in Python using frameworks such as WxPython or PyGTK .
However , most desktop applications are still written in compiled languages such as C , C++ or C# .
The frameworks for these languages tend to have more sophisticated development tools and the resulting programs are often easier to distribute , as they do not require the user to have Python installed .
Python has good graphical development tools , including Wing IDE and the Eclipse PyDev extensions .
However , most Python developers work " Unix style " with standalone text editors and terminals .
On platforms like Java or .
Net , environments such as Microsoft 's Visual Studio will always offer tighter integration with the programming language .
Whether this is a blessing or a curse depends on what type of developer you speak to .
Python for the Web
Much has been made recently of an alleged exodus of Java programmers , who , fed up with Java 's overhead and its enterprise frameworks , are making the leap to Ruby on Rails and " lightweight " rapid Web development .
The Rails proponents are very good at marketing , but most of the same benefits can be found in the Python world .
In fact , several successful rapid Web application frameworks are available for Python , each with its own slant .
Many also share components .
The most popular include Django , Pylons , TurboGears , CherryPy , Zope and Grok ( which is based on Zope ) .
These frameworks are all suitable for serious applications .
Zope , for example , was a pioneering open - source application server that helped prove Python 's viability in the enterprise ( although many Python developers these days feel it is a little " unPythonic " ) .
Plone , a popular open - source content management system — to which the author is a contributor — runs on Zope and has been implemented in organizations such as Novell and Oxfam .
The high - traffic Reddit.com runs Pylons .
The Revver.com video sharing site uses Django .
Deploying a Python Web application is usually straightforward , although not quite as easy as deploying a PHP application in Apache .
Database connectivity is very well catered to by object / relational mappers such as SQLAlchemy .
However , most Python Web frameworks have yet to catch up to enterprise - grade application servers for Java or .
Net in terms of support for high - availability clustering , failover and server management .
Python in the Enterprise
Many large organizations have standardized their development on one of the two main " enterprise " platforms , Java or .
Net , believing that doing so will improve interoperability and lower maintenance costs .
Although Python does not quite operate with the same ubiquity or scale , it is a very useful complement , and Python is a solid alternative when such platforms are inappropriate .
The traditional enterprise platforms are by necessity large and complex .
They depend on elaborate tools to manage code , builds and deployments .
For many purposes , this is overkill .
Any programmer should be able to reach for her favorite language when inspiration hits her , and Python 's immediacy makes it well suited for simple automation tasks and quick prototyping .
Developers usually also feel that Python gives them the headroom to move beyond a prototype without throwing away their previous work .
Indeed , Python can be used for large and complex software systems .
YouTube , for instance , runs mainly on Python , and it is an oft - preferred language at organizations including Google , NASA and Industrial Light and Magic .
Specialized Python libraries and frameworks exist for scientific programming , data manipulation , Web services , XML interchange and many other things .
The main disadvantage of using Python in an enterprise setting is that Python programmers can be harder to find than , say , Java developers .
Python is easy to pick up for an experienced programmer , but the plethora of books , training courses and certifications in the Java world cannot be matched by Python .
Furthermore , the power and expressivity that Python offers means that it may require more skilled developers .
Java or C# are more restrictive by design , forcing programmers to adhere to stricter rules around type safety and interface compliance .
For some , that hinders productivity .
For others , it reduces mistakes or accidents of design .
Finally , application integration concerns may dictate a certain language or platform .
However , in today 's service - oriented , heterogeneous systems landscape , it is entirely possible to — for example — write a Web service in Python that plugs into a Java service bus and is ultimately consumed by a Visual Basic program .
The Flying Circus
Python has a long history , but a program written for Python 1.0 still runs under the latest version , Python 2.5 .
New features and improvements continue to be added , following a structured proposal and review process .
In 2006 , van Rossum began an effort he coyly dubbed " Python 3000 . "
This aimed to look at how the language could be improved if absolute backwards compatibility was dropped .
This effort is now coming to fruition , producing the first alpha releases of Python 3.0 .
Naturally , the premise of a backwards - incompatible version of the language has caused some concern .
It remains to be seen how larger Python projects manage a transition to Python 3.0 , and how the rate of adoption of Python 3.0 impacts the pool of third - party libraries and frameworks .
However , Python core developers are committed to supporting existing language users .
A 2.6 version of Python is due imminently , and the 2.x line is likely to continue with a 2.7 and maybe a 2.8 .
Conversion tools are also being made available that can analyze a Python 2.x code base and transform it for 3.0 compatibility , often without manual intervention .
In the author 's opinion , the Python community is large and vibrant enough to withstand some pressure , when in the long run the changes are likely to benefit everyone .
When to Consider Python
In this article , we discussed Python 's strengths and weaknesses - particularly for enterprise environments .
Briefly , you should consider Python when you ( or your programmers ) :
Need a general - purpose , proven and reliable scripting language that comes with a rich standard library
Want a language that is useful across a range of programming tasks , from shell automation to Web applications
Like Python 's philosophy and syntax
Find the language fun and productive .
Python may not be an appropriate choice if you :
Are building embedded or massively parallel systems for which a scripting language would be an inappropriate choice ( due to concerns about execution speed )
Build primarily desktop applications , especially for Windows .
Platforms like .
Net usually offer more sophisticated tools and easier distribution of the final software .
Rely on teams of less - experienced programmers .
These developers may benefit from the wider availability of training for languages like Java and are less likely to make mistakes with a compile - time , type - checked language .
Have specialized needs better served by other languages that you already know .
For example , if you want to do a lot of text processing and you have a basement full of Perl programmers , there 's no compelling reason to switch .

Sibel Edmonds , the FBI whistle - blower who has been gagged for years by the Bush administration over intercepts she translated while at the bureau , was willing to go to prison to get her story told .
She spent years trying to get her day in court , but the State Secrets gag against her prohibited her from telling her story even to a FISA judge .
After years of trying to fight her way to through the maze of the US court system , Sibel Edmonds finally decided to tell her story no matter the consequences and offered to do so to any interested US media outlets .
Today , part of that story runs , but not in the United States , where not a single corporate outlet was willing to displease the White House and give Edmonds a platform .
The Sunday Times Online , however , proved up to the task - somewhat .
Here are the snips from that article :
" A WHISTLEBLOWER has made a series of extraordinary claims about how corrupt government officials allowed Pakistan and other states to steal nuclear weapons secrets .
Sibel Edmonds , a 37 - year - old former Turkish language translator for the FBI , listened into hundreds of sensitive intercepted conversations while based at the agency 's Washington field office .
She approached The Sunday Times last month after reading about an Al - Qaeda terrorist who had revealed his role in training some of the 9/11 hijackers while he was in Turkey .
Edmonds described how foreign intelligence agents had enlisted the support of US officials to acquire a network of moles in sensitive military and nuclear institutions .
Among the hours of covert tape recordings , she says she heard evidence that one well - known senior official in the US State Department was being paid by Turkish agents in Washington who were selling the information on to black market buyers , including Pakistan .
The name of the official - who has held a series of top government posts - is known to The Sunday Times .
He strongly denies the claims .
However , Edmonds said : " He was aiding foreign operatives against US interests by passing them highly classified information , not only from the State Department but also from the Pentagon , in exchange for money , position and political objectives . "
Let me help the Times here .
The person against whom these allegations are being made is Marc Grossman .
The Times could have published the name and also provided the denial from Grossman 's camp .
I find it incredibly disturbing that they would not name the official .
" She claims that the FBI was also gathering evidence against senior Pentagon officials - including household names - who were aiding foreign agents .
" If you made public all the information that the FBI have on this case , you will see very high - level people going through criminal trials , " she said .
Her story shows just how much the West was infiltrated by foreign states seeking nuclear secrets .
It illustrates how western government officials turned a blind eye to , or were even helping , countries such as Pakistan acquire bomb technology . "
Those senior DOD officials who are not mentioned in the Times article , all but one are no longer in government .
They are alleged to be Doug Feith , Richard Perle , among others .
There is also one person who is part of these allegations , still serving in a high level position at the DOD .
His last name begins with an E .
I have tried getting someone in broadcast and print media to run this story .
My sources did not include Edmonds , but because of the sensitive nature of the information , I was concerned that she would go to jail anyway , unless I proved she was not a source - which would require me to reveal my sources .
I thought if I approached a big enough news outlet , the pressure generated by the public response would spare Edmonds jail time and I would not be pressured to reveal sources - something I would not have done anyway .
Even a former high ranking CIA officer offered to byline the article with me if that would help sell a broadcaster / publication on running the story .
No one was interested .
That the Times ran these allegations ( she is under a state secrets gag folks , so it is not like she is gagged for lying ) is encouraging .
But that they omitted all names from the allegations is unethical .
The point of a free press is not to protect the powerful against the weak , but to protect the public from the powerful .
The Times was willing to stick a toe in , but was not willing to risk upsetting a foreign government ( This is , after all , a British paper ) .
There are more names , including members of Congress and people serving in the FBI .
This is what happens when basic government services as well as the most sensitive government functions are outsourced to the global marketplace .
Back to the Times article , which toward the end illustrates that someone in the editorial offices located a backbone , even if temporarily :
" She has given evidence to closed sessions of Congress and the 9/11 commission , but many of the key points of her testimony have remained secret .
She has now decided to divulge some of that information after becoming disillusioned with the US authorities ' failure to act .
One of Edmonds 's main roles in the FBI was to translate thousands of hours of conversations by Turkish diplomatic and political targets that had been covertly recorded by the agency .
The Turks and Israelis had planted " moles " in military and academic institutions which handled nuclear technology .
Edmonds says there were several transactions of nuclear material every month , with the Pakistanis being among the eventual buyers .
" The network appeared to be obtaining information from every nuclear agency in the United States , " she said .
They were helped , she says , by the high - ranking State Department official who provided some of their moles - mainly PhD students - with security clearance to work in sensitive nuclear research facilities .
These included the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory in New Mexico , which is responsible for the security of the US nuclear deterrent .
In one conversation Edmonds heard the official arranging to pick up a $ 15,000 cash bribe .
The package was to be dropped off at an agreed location by someone in the Turkish diplomatic community who was working for the network .
Let me again offer help to the good folks at the Times .
The person in question is a Turkish military official who at that time also happened to sit on the board of a particular defense contracting firm .
" The Turks , she says , often acted as a conduit for the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , Pakistan 's spy agency , because they were less likely to attract suspicion .
Venues such as the American Turkish Council in Washington were used to drop off the cash , which was picked up by the official .
Edmonds said : " I heard at least three transactions like this over a period of 2 Â ½ years .
There are almost certainly more . "
The Pakistani operation was led by General Mahmoud Ahmad , then the ISI chief . "
Now , who is General Mahmoud Ahmad ?
" Intelligence analysts say that members of the ISI were close to Al - Qaeda before and after 9/11 .
Indeed , Ahmad was accused of sanctioning a $ 100,000 wire payment to Mohammed Atta , one of the 9/11 hijackers , immediately before the attacks . "
You can see why Edmonds had to be silenced for " diplomatic reasons . "
As though diplomatic ( read : business ) relationships are more important than national security .
Let me give you one more snip from this incredible article ( minus the censorship ) :
" Khan was close to Ahmad and the ISI .
While running Pakistan 's nuclear programme , he became a millionaire by selling atomic secrets to Libya , Iran and North Korea .
He also used a network of companies in America and Britain to obtain components for a nuclear programme .
Khan caused an alert among western intelligence agencies when his aides met Osama Bin Laden .
" We were aware of contact between A Q Khan 's people and Al - Qaeda , " a former CIA officer said last week .
" There was absolute panic when we initially discovered this , but it kind of panned out in the end . "
It is likely that the nuclear secrets stolen from the United States would have been sold to a number of rogue states by Khan .
Edmonds was later to see the scope of the Pakistani connections when it was revealed that one of her fellow translators at the FBI was the daughter of a Pakistani embassy official who worked for Ahmad .
The translator was given top secret clearance despite protests from FBI investigators .
Edmonds says packages containing nuclear secrets were delivered by Turkish operatives , using their cover as members of the diplomatic and military community , to contacts at the Pakistani embassy in Washington .
Following 9/11 , a number of the foreign operatives were taken in for questioning by the FBI on suspicion that they knew about or somehow aided the attacks .
Edmonds said the State Department official once again proved useful .
" A primary target would call the official and point to names on the list and say , ' We need to get them out of the US because we can't afford for them to spill the beans ' , " she said .
" The official said that he would ' take care of it ' . "
Read the whole thing .
I urge you to print it , email it , share it with everyone you know .
Edmonds has said enough now that she may very likely go to prison , but she is a true patriot and she must have our support , in the media and also in the public sphere .
