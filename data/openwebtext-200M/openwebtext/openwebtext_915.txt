MONEY launderers are moved by greed , unlike Jason Sharman , a political scientist at Australia 's Griffith University .
Yet with a budget of $ 10,000 and little more than Google ( and the ads at the back of this paper ) , he showed how easy it was to circumvent prohibitions on banking secrecy , forming anonymous shell companies and secret bank accounts across the world .
In doing so he has uncovered an uncomfortable truth for many of the leaders of Group of 20 nations meeting on April 2nd to discuss , among other things , sanctions against offshore tax havens .
The most egregious examples of banking secrecy , money laundering and tax fraud are found not in remote alpine valleys or on sunny tropical isles but in the backyards of the world 's biggest economies .

At issue is not banking secrecy as the Swiss once knew it , where discreet men in plush offices promised to take the names of their clients to the grave .
This is a more insidious form of secrecy , in which authorities and bankers do not bother to ask for names , something long outlawed in offshore tax centres such as Jersey and Switzerland but which has persisted in America .
For shady clients , this is a far better proposition : what their bankers do not know , they can never be forced to reveal .
And their method is disarmingly simple .
Instead of opening bank accounts in their own names , fraudsters and money launderers form anonymous companies , with which they can then open bank accounts and move assets .
Nowhere is this more prevalent than in America .
Take Nevada , for example .
Its official website touts its “ limited reporting and disclosure requirements ” and a speedy one - hour incorporation service .
Nevada does not ask for the names of company shareholders , nor does it routinely share the little information it has with the federal government .
There is demand for this ask - no - questions approach .
The state , with a population of only 2.6 m , incorporates about 80,000 new firms a year and now has more than 400,000 , roughly one for every six people .
A study by the Internal Revenue Service found that 50 - 90 % of those registering companies were already in breach of federal tax laws elsewhere .
A money - laundering threat assessment in 2005 by the federal government found that corporate anonymity offered by Delaware , Nevada and Wyoming rivalled that of familiar offshore financial centres .
For foreigners , America is a particularly attractive place to stash cash , because it does not tax the interest income they earn .
Thus with both anonymity and no taxation , America offers them all the elements of a tax haven .
Change may be coming in America , but slowly .
In March Senator Carl Levin proposed a law forcing states to identify the beneficial owners of corporations .
“ For too long , criminals have misused US corporations to hide illicit activity , including money laundering and tax fraud , ” said Mr Levin .
“ It does n't make sense that less information is required to form a US corporation than to obtain a driver 's licence . ”
Yet a similar bill introduced last year died a quiet death in committee .
America is not the only rich nation Mr Sharman tested .
He tried to open anonymous shell companies and bank accounts 45 times across the world .
These were successful in 17 cases , of which 13 were in OECD countries .
One example was Britain , where in 45 minutes on the internet he formed a company without providing identification , was issued with bearer shares ( which have been almost universally outlawed because they confer completely anonymous ownership ) as well as nominee directors and a secretary .
All was achieved at a cost of £ 515.95 ( $ 753 ) .
In other cases Mr Sharman formed companies by providing no more than a scanned copy of his driving licence .
In contrast , when trying to open accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland , he was asked for documentation such as notarised copies of his birth certificate .
“ In practice OECD countries have much laxer regulation on shell corporations than classic tax havens , ” Mr Sharman concludes .
“ And the US is the worst on this score , worse than Liechtenstein and worse than Somalia . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Republican congressional leaders tore into President Obama 's proposed 2010 budget Thursday , arguing that his spending cuts will do little to stem a rising tide of red ink .
Republicans on Capitol Hill decried President Obama 's proposed budget cuts Thursday .
The White House released details earlier in the day outlining $ 17 billion in cuts from 121 federal programs .
The total savings amounts to roughly 0.5 percent of the more than $ 3.5 trillion in spending approved for next year , or 1.2 percent of next year 's projected $ 1.4 trillion deficit if the president 's overall budget is adopted .
" With Democrats in Congress adding to the national debt at the rate of more than $ 100 billion every month already this year , and with a budget that triples the already unsustainable public debt over the next decade , it is clear that there is not much more that we can do to protect our children and grandchildren from the unprecedented trillions in additional debt proposed by this administration , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , said on the Senate floor .
Sen . Judd Gregg , R - New Hampshire , who withdrew as Obama 's commerce secretary - designate earlier this year , also criticized the cuts as minuscule in the face of current spending and deficit projections .
" It 's as if this were the Gobi Desert or the Sahara Desert and you came along and you took a few pieces of sand , " Gregg said .
Watch more of Gregg 's comments »
It " will have virtually no impact on the deficit and the debt as we move forward ... because of the fact that while ( they ) are taking these few dollars out ... they are adding back in massive amounts of spending . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , argued that Obama 's proposed cuts are identical to cuts previously proposed by former President George W. Bush and rejected by the Democratic - controlled Congress .
He also said House Republicans are arguing that Obama 's spending cuts will do little to stem deficit spending .
" Over the next couple of weeks , you 'll have a chance to see what real budget cuts look like , " he said at a Capitol Hill news conference .
Boehner refused to indicate exactly how much money House Republicans want to cut , but his spokesman said the House GOP leadership would release its list of recommendations for cuts before Memorial Day .
Democratic congressional leaders replied by noting that Obama 's proposed cuts were only the start of a long budget review process .
They also noted that Obama had inherited a poor financial situation from his predecessor .
" I have asked House committee chairs to search out areas of possible savings in the departments , agencies , and program under their jurisdiction , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a written statement .
" House committees have already conducted 163 hearings , which will help inform our efforts as we review the president 's proposed budget cuts and work with the administration to achieve additional savings . "
Pelosi added that " the legacy of fiscal recklessness inherited by President Obama and the Congress will make our task more difficult , but we are prepared to make the difficult choices that are required to restore fiscal responsibility and strengthen our economy for the long - term . "
House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt , D - South Carolina , said that " while the Congress is unlikely to agree with all the changes proposed by the administration , the process and the resulting proposals are a step in the right direction , and a sign of fiscal discipline . "
Roughly $ 11.5 billion of Obama 's proposed savings would come from the discretionary side of the fiscal 2010 budget -- that is , for programs whose funding is not automatic .
Watch Obama discuss the budgetary cuts »
And roughly half of the savings would come from nondefense programs , a senior administration official said in a briefing call with reporters on Wednesday .
CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux and Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report .

Ubuntu has Gnome as the default desktop manager but there are others also available .
A desktop manager provides icons , windows , toolbars , folders , wallpapers and abilities like drag and drop .
The X Windows Systems ( Unix - like systems ) are more flexible and typically consist of a window manager such as Metacity or KKWin , a file manager ( Konqueror or Nautilius ) , a set of themes and programs as well as libraries for managing the desktop .
Other desktop environments that can be installed on an Ubuntu system include KDE , which is far more configurable and complex than Gnome , XFCE , which is a lightweight desktop environment more suitable for old PCs and others .
Before installing one or more alternative desktop environments , you have to add the universe repository to Ubuntu .
You may skip this step if you have already done it .
- Go to System / Administration / Software Sources .
When launched , the tool will present you with a dialog which allows you to easily check the boxes or even change your download location .
You might want to check every box that is checked , so you wo n't have to do this again .
Installing KDE
The KDE desktop seems to be a little more familiar to windows users so using it will be a little easier for new users that just switched to Linux from Windows .
To install KDE , open a terminal and type :
code $ sudo apt - get install Kubuntu - desktop
Reboot the computer and at the login prompt , select Options / Sessions and pick KDE from the list .
The rest is up to you .
Enjoy !
Installing Xfce
Xfce is a very lightweight desktop environment , based on the Xfwm file manager .
To install type the following command in a terminal :
code $ sudo apt - get install Xubuntu - desktop
Installing Enlightenment
Installing it is just as easy as installing KDE or Xfce on an Ubuntu system as its packages are available in the universe repositories .
To install Enlightenment , open a terminal and type :
code $ sudo apt - get install enlightenment
Several mouse +key combinations are available for various actions .
For instance , middle click on the desktop will open the Enlightenment menu , middle click +
Alt will open the task list menu , middle click +
Ctrl will open the desktop menu and so on .
Installing Fluxbox
Fluxbox is a highly customizable , very fast and quite pretty window manager .
However , Fluxbox is all about minimalism and is definitely not for everybody , but it 's as lightweight as it can get , so it 's probably very useful for low systems .
To install it , first make sure you have the universe repository enabled , then open a terminal and type :
code $ sudo apt - get install fluxbox
Installing Sun Looking Glass
Project Looking Glass is based on Java technology and it contributed to the open source community by Sun Microsystems .
The project brings innovative 3D features to the desktop environment .
The desktop interface offers an intuitive , new 3D environment to interact with desktop applications featuring window transparency , rotation , zoom and so on .
There are 3 LG3D repositories : stable , testing and nightly builds .
You can use any one of them but it 's highly recommended you use the stable one so you wo n't get into any troubles .
Open the /etc/apt/sources.list file with your favorite editor and add the following line at the end of the file :
code deb
http://javadesktop.org/lg3d/debian stable contrib
Install LG3D using the commands :
code $ sudo apt - get update
$ sudo apt - get install lg3d- core
After the installation is complete , log out from your current session , click on the Options button , select Project Looking Glass and login as normal .
A small alpine King of the Hill map
NOW ON VERSION 2 http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/108422
Koth_loader_v1
A custom map by Swizzle *************
ABOUT THE MAP *************
Loader is a small King of the Hill map centered around the loading dock just outside a mine .
The goal is simple :
Hold the point for a total of three minutes .
When your team owns the point , the enemy 's timer is paused and your timer will count down until it reaches zero and you win the game .
If the other team owns the point , your timer is paused and the other team 's timer counts down .
The team to hold the point longest wins .
Loader is about the same size as most Arena maps and favors both horizontal and vertical attack / defense .
The team who controls the ground floor of the center building controls the map , but secondary spawns that exit onto the building 's roof ensure that no team holds any single position for too long .
The action is fast and frenetic , encouraging swift tactical thinking and good spatial awareness as an attack can come from almost any angle .
******************
INSTALLING THE MAP ******************
Extract koth_loader_v1.bsp to this directory on your hard drive and you 're ready to go : C : \Program Files\Steam\steamapps\YOUR
USERNAME GOES HERE \team fortress 2\tf \maps **************
COMING CHANGES
**************
This map , while hopefully quite playable in its present form , is still far from finished and is currently in public beta .
It still has some issues I 'm trying to iron out , and some other little details I need to address .
Among these : - Dual onscreen timers
These are coming in the next release .
Once I get the dual onscreen timers working , I 'll make an updated version of ncyphe 's KotH prefab I used and release it on various websites such as FPSBanana and TF2 Maps.net .
- Spawn room and center building detail
The spawns and center building interiors still need more detailing done to be on par with the rest of the map .
They are not finished .
- Optimization
While this will likely come much later than any other fixes , I have several things in mind for optimizing the map to get the best framerates possible .
These things should only affect performance , not the actual look or layout of the level .
*******************************
THANK - YOUS AND OTHER MISCELLANY
*******************************
A huge thank you goes out to all the TF2 - playing folks at CGTalk for playtesting the map and giving continued feedback .
- Thanks to TheNeverman for pointing out ncyphe 's King of the Hill prefab over at FPSBanana .
You can download that prefab here : http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/1717
- Thanks to Wyatt and Kirt for graciously hosting the server and taking care of the admin crap .
- Thanks to Meelo for putting up with nagging questions about Hammer .
- Thanks to Burningman for being a cheerful meat shield and all - around good guy .
I swear I 'm going to put a bucket in this one too .
- And thanks to all the rest of the people who 've helped test it to this point :
You know who you are .
In making this map , I referenced many others and borrowed , stole and got inspired by several more .
Lighthouse , Garbage Day and Harvest were big inspirations , so hats off to the creators of those maps .
Finally , a big thank you to all the great folks at Valve .
Without all your hard work , community content like this would n't be possible .

Every once in a long while you come across a tool that just gives you goose bumps , you are instantly infatuated .
The Search Based Keyword Tool ( SbKT ) was that for me .
The data it brings together and the transparency it brings is just so .
. . sexy .
Let 's see if you feel that by the time you are done with this post .
I can tell you know that you 'll never think of Paid Search the same way !
[ UPDATE : Recently Google has folded the Search Based Keyword Tool into the core AdWords Interface .
You can now access the keyword tool from within AdWords by clicking the " Keyword Tool " link from the Opprotunities tab .
You can also access the Keyword Tool outside of AdWords by clicking here . ]
One of the most common phenomenon is the long tail of search .
Yet precious few people understand this and even fewer actually are able to use it to their advantage .
A quick recap : The Search Long Tail .
If you have not had a chance please give my long tail of search post a quick review .
The essence of the phenomenon is that your website most likely has a “ short head ” ( say ten or fifteen keywords that drive massive number of Visits ) and usually a “ long tail ” ( hundreds of thousands of key words and key phrases that drive five , ten , fifteen – few – Visits ) .
The really cool thing about the tail is that the thousands of queries in the tail are generic ( " category " ) queries which tend to bring " impression virgins " to your site .
People who are new to your franchise , people who have not made up their mind .
Find them first and you get first dibs on convincing them .
My Long Tail : The Story in Numbers .
Here 's a real example , data for this blog :
87,861 : # of Visits in the month of March .
40,662 : # of Visits from Search ( !! ) .
26,137 : # of distinct keywords and key phrases that drove those 41 k Visits !
Astonishing is that not ?
For a single topic blog !
So what of the head and the tail ?
13 : # of search key words that brought 100 or more visits ( the head ) .
26,124 : # of search key words that brought 2 or 5 or 10 or a small number of visits each ( the tail ) .
If you are not yet confused by all the numbers , please stick with me , here is another way to think about it .
13 head keywords brought 5,128 Visits to the site .
26,124 tail keywords brought 35,534 Visits to the site !
[ This is the prime reason I tell Analysts , Marketers , CEO's , my children not to just obsess about the head ! ]
Clearly even a one topic ( Analytics ) blog can have a verrrrry long tail .
I can only imagine how long your tail is .
You have a real business .
You have thousands of pages .
You have tons of products you sell , a diverse set of services and so on and so forth .
The Problem ?
Despite the massively yummy opportunity , most people have a hard time monetizing the long tail because :
* All they know is their brand terms , so they take the easy way out .
I hate to say this but there is laziness involved , we rarely bother to look beyond the top 10 keywords .
*
They think broad matching on their key terms will take care of the tail .
The reality is the best broad matches will pick up 500 or a 1000 queries , the tail has hundreds of thousands .
*
You can't possibly take every word in the text on your site and dump it into AdWords ( or AdCenter or YSM ) .
Finding relevant long tail search queries is tough , and doing that intelligently is even harder .
The Solution ?
The Search - based Keyword Tool ( SbKT ) from Google .
It uses two sources of data that Google has ( both anonymous , non -PII ) to help you identify long tail keywords that are being searched on www.google.com that are relevant to your business .
The first source of the data are the logs that store the queries that are done by users on google .com ( logs that have this data in aggregate , not by individual histories – you 'll see the latter is not necessary ) .
The second source of data are the logs from googlebot that indexes the world wide web and all the pages ( and your site ) .
These logs understand what your site is , what content is on it , what you sell , service , do on those pages .
SbKT simply brings these two sources together .
When combined it provides you with :
A list of keywords and phrases in the search long tail that are relevant to your website ( where relevance is defined by the content on your site ) .
It is a very simple idea , yet it is powerful because now you do n't have to guess what the opportunity is for the long tail on google.com .
Google SbKT Reports & Analysis .
SbKT is a fairly easy to use tool , there really is not much to it .
This screen is what you 'll see when you login .
. . .
You have several options but first thing you can try is to simply type the name of your website and hit enter .
In two seconds . . . .
Bam !
Ok so the color boxes wo n't be there . : )
Let me walk you through what you 'll see .
The area inside the Red Box shows all the key results you need : key words and other data .
The Violet Box shows how many relevant keyword suggestions were returned , 65,863 for this site .
The data in the Blue Box allows you to filter the results by various product categories .
Example , here , Apparel , Beauty & Personal Care , Sports & Fitness , Finance etc etc .
The Orange Box is the other way to filter the data , by specific product categories .
Sony , Microsoft , HP , Samsung , Nokia etc in this case ( so you can easily move away from the 66 k results and focus just on results for Nokia , which in this case were 890 ) .
Finally the Purple Box , at the very top , contains other filters ( cost , competition , keywords etc etc ) .
Let 's walk through the report itself .
Keywords , Monthly Searches , Competition .
The first column shows the specific keyword / key phrase that the tool recommends for your site .
These are the long tail keywords identified after the analysis of Google 's search query logs and the Googlebot log data .
The second column shows you how many searches were done for that keyword in the last month (+ or – 10 % ) .
It is important to know these are not match typed in any way , these are actual search queries of google .com users .
Finally the third piece of data is how much competition there is for an ad for that term ( in your country typically , so you can change and choose to get data just for a specific country ) .
Suggested Bids , Ad / Search Share , Your Webpage .
Sugg .
bid is the price you can expect to pay for showing your ad in the top three position on the Google search results page .
Ad share is % of time an ad from your website shows up for the query ( due to broad - match ) .
Search Share ( the second percentage ) is the % of time your site shows up in the first page of the organic results !
Think of both numbers , for Paid and Organic , as akin to impression share ( or to those of you in the Retail Industry : " Share of Shelf " )
Finally column three shows which page on your website is relevant for that keyword .
This last part is very important because you do n't want to buy keywords willy nilly , you do n't want irrelevant ads or , worse , irrelevant landing pages .
SbKT solves this problem by telling you exactly which page on your site is the optimal landing page for a given long tail keyword .
You can click on the Export button and save the resulting Excel file .
There will be two bonus items in there : 1 ) SbKT will attempt to classify your keywords into logical Campaigns and 2 ) into logical Ad Groups , thus saving you some time .
Net , Net .
You know :
exactly which keywords to buy to grab all the impression virgins how much share you have today of that traffic how much you can expect to pay for a top 3 paid search listing and exactly where to send this traffic so they have a relevant experience ( which translates to a higher conversion rate )
Delightful .
Data driven paid search campaigns !
SbKT Bonus Features / Analysis .
There are several deeper and cooler things you can do with SbKT .
Question : I want to have a post spring break sale on my GPS related inventory , how can I find the most relevant keywords and key phrases to purchase ?
From the left navigation , in this example , click Consumer Electronics , then click GPS and do a merry dance .
. . .
What you are looking at are the keywords related to the GPS category only and only the ones that are relevant to your business .
At the far left , not in the image above , you 'll see the unique landing page on your site where you should send this traffic ( in case you buy these keywords ) .
Question : I just saw a tweet that Olympus is going to out of business .
How can I identify search keywords to unload all my Olympus inventory ?
From the Categories choose Consumer Electronics , then Photo & Video and then Digital Cameras .
From the Brands ( bottom left ) choose the brands Google has identified relevant to content on your site ( Olympus ) .
There you go , a relevant list of keywords for you to consider .
Question : Budgets are really tight right now , can you help me find long tail keywords relevant for my business but that cost less than 30 cents ?
In the top bar click on the plus sign next to Advanced Search . . .
You 'll see a bunch of lovely options , in this case you 'll choose Suggested Bid and type in the amount that you are interested in .
. . .
When you hit enter SbKT will take the 222,720 long tail key phrases it had identified for you and show you the 75,464 that are relevant for your business – all of whom have a Suggested Bid of under 30 cents for a top three search listing .
As you see above , you can control the amount of competition you want .
If I choose Medium and High ( " bring it on ! " :) )
I get a list of 35,486 .
You can also use other filters productively .
Win – Win for Organic and Paid Search Marketers .
If you are a Paid Search Marketer ( PPC ) then use SbKT to identify relevant long tail keywords and their corresponding landing page .
Use Suggested Bid to focus on maximizing your budget and give your CFO estimates of cost ( rather than guesses that you probably do today ) .
If you are a Organic Search Marketer ( SEO ) then Google has just provided you with a list of landing pages on your site and the keywords that are relevant to those pages .
If you are not getting enough Organic share ( ps2 above ) then you have your work cut out for you .
For either individual there is data now to work more efficiently to improve search share .
Who Can See What ?
Before you get too excited let me rush to add that you can only see data for your company using SbKT , i.e. the adwords accounts you have access to .
For other sites your view will be limited to only the top 100 long tail terms .
You can see 100 in All Categories or in any Sub Category .
Tips for Maximizing The Long Tail Value .
[ Image Credit : Hugh MacLeod ]
# 1 : Do n't get hung up one or two or ten keywords .
Remember you are dealing with thousands of keywords .
Focus on the criteria that is important to you ( low cost , high competition , particular categories or brands , a cluster of products ) , then put 'em in ad groups and experiment .
# 2 : Do n't spend time torturing every single keyword .
You can't .
Or you 'll never go home .
You are aiming to capture two , ten , fifty visits .
Maximize for the portfolio .
# 3 : Remember all rules of measuring success for Search campaigns apply to the long tail ( it must produce bottom line impacting results ) .
But you have a chance to think in a more sophisticated way about measuring the long tail .
Please see this post : Measuring Value of “ Upper Funnel ” ( Long Tail ) Keywords
#4 : SbKT works most optimally for mid and large sized websites ( lots of pages , lots of products , lots of lots ) .
Notice the irony in that ? :)
Closing Thought .
The data you get through the Search Based Keyword Tool are actual search queries that are actually being typed by people using www.google.com.
The information from the tool should be used to create effective Organic and Paid search strategies to ensure you get your share of the relevant traffic .
Just because you do n't show up does not mean that your competition wo n't .
Good luck !
Oh and in case you did not realize it , this is Web Analtyics baby !!
Ok your turn now .
Have you used Google 's SbKT ?
What 's your experience like ?
If you have not used it , do you think you 'll find it to be of value ?
Got any tips on monetizing the long tail ?
Got horror stories ?
Please share your critique , feedback , cheers and boos .
Thanks .

BBC News , DR Congo
The Democratic Republic of Congo - a country with the trappings of sovereignty but not much modern government or control outside the main cities - is waking up to its limitations .
DR Congo has invited in foreign armies to help deal with its lawless regions .
It is a joint military operation that is highly unusual in Africa .
The militaries of three foreign countries - Uganda , Rwanda and South Sudan - are now operating in or around the edges of DR Congo .
But unlike in previous times , the foreign armies have not invaded against the will of the authorities in the capital Kinshasa .
They were invited in by the Congolese government to deal with rebel movements that Kinshasa admits it - and the largest UN peacekeeping force in the world , in DR Congo - cannot handle .
To be accurate , the word " invited " is not quite right .
In pictures : Rwanda leaves Congo Kinshasa was persuaded by United States pressure to accept the foreigners .
The US is allied to Uganda , Rwanda and South Sudan - all of which , in various ways , are opposed to the US bogeyman in the region , the Islamist regime based in the Sudanese capital , Khartoum .
( South Sudan is de facto quasi - independent from Khartoum after winning control of the south after a long war . )
The activities of the three African armies in DR Congo can be painted as " African solutions to African problems " .
The continent is tired of the UN failing to fix DR Congo .
But of course these are also self - interested actions .
The foreign armies are dealing with their enemies who have been sucked into the virtual power vacuum in parts of DR Congo - and which therefore threaten stability .
The key visiting teams are : RWANDA
The Rwandan army went into Congo's North and South Kivu Provinces a few months ago to deal with Rwandan ethnic Hutu rebels , the FDLR , who were chased into Congo after perpetrating the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 .
The Congolese army flies the flag but cannot protect the population ( In fact , some of them were certainly involved in the genocide - while a majority of the current fighters are probably new opportunists plundering Congo 's gold and other minerals . )
The FDLR used to be wartime allies of the Congolese government during the long conflict of the 1990s .
That war was so widespread and sucked in so many countries it was dubbed " Africa 's First World War " .
But Kinshasa has now let the Tutsi - dominated Rwandan army in to deal with the Hutus - despite that army having invaded DR Congo twice in recent years .
The quid pro quo for Kinshasa 's volte face is that Rwanda should arrest Congolese Tutsi rebel Laurent Nkunda ( long considered by many to be a Rwandan puppet ) and then " turn " his CNDP militia into Congolese army allies .
Rwanda arrested Gen Nkunda and is now twisting arms to make his former fighters less hostile to Kinshasa ( but of course not hostile to Rwanda either ) .
The arrest was the easy part .
UGANDA
The Ugandan army went into the north - eastern DR Congo ( Orientale Province ) to smash the rebel Ugandan Lord 's Resistance Army .
The LRA is an armed group whose leader Joseph Kony also claims mystical powers .
He was chased out of Uganda and has taken refuge in DR Congo and South Sudan .
Rebel attacks on civilians prompted villagers to raise self - defence forces The LRA has been causing widespread terror among Congolese and Sudanese civilians .
It exercises control through mass murder , rape and abductions - but it says its basic motivation is the defence of the marginalised northern Ugandan ethnic Acholi population .
The United States is widely believed to have helped plan and pay for the Ugandan anti-LRA operation in DR Congo .
The LRA is on US proscribed terrorist lists .
An early part of the anti-LRA operation , planned for December 14 2008 , was to to bomb the main LRA base in north - eastern DR Congo .
The plan failed to have its full effect , Ugandan officers say privately .
Bad weather closed in that day , the officers say , when , it was believed , Joseph Kony and his senior aides were at the base .
One version says cloud cover and a botched air transport plan meant noisy helicopters were used for the bombing runs , not high - flying Migs which could have had the element of surprise .
Joseph Kony may have heard the choppers coming .
Anyway , he seems to have got away from the base just a few minutes before the bombs dropped .
SOUTH SUDAN
The South Sudanese army ( the victorious ex-rebels , not the Khartoum government ) is also trying to deal with the LRA .
The LRA , despite claiming to want to rule Uganda by the Christian Ten Commandments , was nurtured by the Islamist regime in Khartoum to try to stop the southern Sudanese rebels ( Sudan People 's Liberation Army - SPLA ) from winning the on - off 50 year north - south war .
But those southern Sudanese rebels did win against Khartoum .
After they had done so they tried negotiating with the LRA for a while to make it go away .
The deal was that Mr Kony would be shielded from the indictment against him issued by the International Criminal Court in exchange for peace .
Mr Kony opted to stay in the bush .
And now the South Sudanese have mostly given up talking and are going for a military solution against him .
The results so far The Rwandans have pushed the Hutu rebels westward , deeper into the Congolese forests , and have also arrested a few middle - ranking rebels .
They have persuaded some Hutu camp followers to go home to Rwanda .
Rwanda will be quite pleased with this so far .
The Congolese are not so keen ; the Hutus can still live off Congo - mining illegally , mounting roadblocks for taxes etc .
But Kinshasa will at least be satisfied that Mr Nkunda has been neutralised , for now .
DR Congo 's rich gold reserves has attracted foreign armies in the past The Ugandans , meanwhile , are continuing their 20 - year hunt for Mr Kony , this time inside DR Congo 's north - eastern Orientale Province .
The Congolese army is supposed to hold the southern parts of Orientale and the Sudanese are supposed to block the possible escape of Mr Kony 's men through their border to the north .
The Ugandan army and air force do their business in between the two .
No great results here so far .
In fact , some negative ones .
Hundreds of Congolese were massacred by the LRA over the Christmas period in reprisal for the hunt against the rebels .
But even the UN humanitarian supremo John Holmes , decrying the massacres as a " catastrophic " result of the offensive , said the military operations have to be pressed home .
In the long run this sort of inter-African cooperation will certainly be necessary to counter cross border rebels .
The governments of Rwanda , Uganda , South Sudan and DR Congo all have some legitimacy ( and are all backed by , for example , the US and the UK ) .
Both of the rebel groups concerned are reviled by most of the governments in the region and most of the rest of the world .
For this reason , any talk of all these operations being " over by the end of February " - as Kinshasa has said publically - should be taken with a large pinch of salt .
Everyone in the region knows that DR Congo can't cope with these lawless regions .
Much of the Congolese army is dysfunctional .
Everyone also knows that , for all the decent things it may have done in DR Congo , the UN has failed to pacify the eastern part of the country .
Kinshasa has to say it wants the operations over because it is politically embarrassing for President Joseph Kabila to be seen to allow countries which once invaded DR Congo to stomp all over eastern regions .
But President Kabila is politically weak .
Rwanda and Uganda , by contrast , are relatively are strong .
The fighting will continue .
There may be some positive results in the long - term .
Or it could all go horribly wrong .

LIAM Lawrence 's 75th minute strike dealt a blow to Blackburn Rovers ' Premier League survival hopes as they crashed 1 - 0 to Stoke City .
Rovers battled bravely throughout but were undone by some sloppy play in midfield and rare indecisiveness at the back as Stoke 's pressure finally told .
After a heated start to the second half , Stoke had the first effort of the second half when Liam Lawrence 's drive shot from the right was well tipped over by Paul Robinson on 55 minutes .
A minute later Matthew Etherington headed Lawrence 's cross wide at the far post as Stoke started to pile the pressure on the visitors .
Carlos Villanueva replaced Benni McCarthy in attack on 69 minutes and the Chilean playmaker immediately started to run at the hosts ' defence .
Stoke made a vital breakthrough on 75 minutes though after Keith Andrews had needlessly given the ball away in midfield .
Danny Higginbotham 's right wing cross was flicked on by James Beattie and Lawrence cut inside Givet before squeezing his shot past Paul Robinson in at the near post .
In a last throw of the dice Sam Allardyce pushed Chris Samba up front for the final 10 minutes and brought on David Dunn in search of some much needed creativity .
Rory Delap 's long throw was Stoke 's only real weapon of attack in a goalless first half , as Rovers dealt well with the aerial bombardment .
Ricardo Fuller and James Beattie thought they should have been awarded penalties but referee Howard Webb was right to wave play on both times .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke believes the US will start to recover in 2009 .
Notes from the last meeting of US Federal Reserve policy makers show just how downbeat they had become on the state of the US economy .
It was this pessimism that led them to agree to spend more than $ 1tn ( £ 680 bn ) to revive its fortunes .
" Most participants viewed the downside risks as predominating in the near term , " the minutes said .
But the committee did expect a recovery to start in 2009 , despite unemployment rising sharply into next year .
' Job losses '
Projections for economic activity in 2009 and 2010 were also revised down .
The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) on 17 - 18 March of this year listed a catalogue of concerns but also stressed the members ' determination to " employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability " .
They revealed how the US economy had deteriorated more than policymakers had expected since the turn of the year .
" Job losses , declining equity and housing wealth , and tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending , " a statement from the FOMC said .
" Weaker sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment .
" US exports have slumped as a number of major trading partners have also fallen into recession , " it continued .
However , despite the depth of the recession , the committee said that it expected recovery to begin in 2009 .
' Steep rises ' GDP is " expected to flatten out gradually over the second half of this year and then to expand slowly next year as the stresses of the financial markets ease , the effects of fiscal stimulus take hold , inventory adjustments are worked through and the correction in housing activity comes to an end " , it said .
The prognosis for unemployment was more downbeat , however .
The jobless rate , which currently stands at 8.5 % , " would rise more steeply into early next year before flattening out at a high level over the rest of the year " , the notes said .
As a result of the pessimism surrounding the short - term outlook for the US economy , all members of the committee agreed to spend an additional $ 750bn of mortgage - backed securities and a further $ 300 bn to buy long - term government bonds .
This policy of so - called quantitative easing , where the central bank spends money in order to stimulate economic growth , has also been adopted by the Bank of England in the UK .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - People who are bullied as children have twice the risk of having delusions , hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms as pre-teens as those who have not been bullied , British researchers said on Monday .
They said bullying -- especially when it is severe or chronic -- can have serious consequences for some children , and may even act as a trigger for people who are genetically predisposed to schizophrenia .
“ Chronic or severe peer victimization has nontrivial , adverse , long - term consequences , ” Andrea Schreier of the University of Warwick in Coventry , England , and colleagues wrote in the Archives of General Psychiatry .
Several studies have shown that traumatic events in childhood such as physical or sexual abuse are linked with the development of psychosis in adulthood .
And people who display psychotic symptoms in childhood are more prone to develop schizophrenia as adults .
Schreier and colleagues wanted to see if bullying might bring about some of these symptoms in adolescents .
They studied 6,437 12 - year - olds who underwent yearly physical and psychological assessments from age 7 and whose parents regularly filled out surveys .
At each visit , trained interviewers rated the children on whether they had experienced psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations , delusions or thought disorders during the prior six months .
Children , parents and teachers reported on whether the child had been bullied -- as defined by negative actions by one or more other students with the intention to hurt .
A total of 46.2 percent of participants were considered victims of bullying when they were 8 or 10 .
They found that the appearance of psychotic symptoms was twice as high among the victims of bullying , regardless of whether they had any psychiatric illness , family trouble or their level of intelligence .
This link was stronger when the bullying was chronic or severe .
It is not yet clear how bullying raises the risks for psychotic behaviors in adolescents , but it may be that bullying brings out such behaviors in people who are already genetically predisposed to schizophrenia , they said .
Or it may be that repeated bullying alters a person ’s ability to respond to stress .
That needs more study , but intervention programs aimed at reducing bullying may help prevent some psychiatric problems later on , they said .
If you aim to move onto a salaried job after your service term ends , you may be facing some big logistical challenges — when do you start actively looking for your next job ?
If you do n’t have something lined up when your term ends , how do you support yourself till you land that job ?
When to Start Your Active Job Search
Regardless of your service corps , your term probably has a definite end date .
If that is the case , lining up a job can pose tricky questions , such as when do you start applying for jobs ?
And when , during the application process , do you let the hiring team know your availability limitations ?
When to start your active job search — sending in applications — is a little fuzzy .
The typical job search takes about six months , according to my colleague Steve Pascal - Joiner , author of the Idealist Guide to Nonprofit Careers for Sector Switchers .
But if you were to start applying for jobs too soon , and you got a job offer months before the end of your term , you may put yourself and the hiring organization in a pickle .
Do they wait for you ?
Do you sever ties with your service corps , host organization , and constituents by ending your term early ?
( I vote no on the latter question , read more … )
That said , if you wait too long to apply for jobs , you may still be looking for a job months after your term ends , raising logistical problems like how you can support yourself .
As for when to start applying , a safe bet seems to be within four to eight weeks of your final day with your service corps .
That way if you are offered a position , the hiring organization wo n’t have to wait too long for you to start — and you wo n’t have to wait too long post - term to collect a new paycheck .
When do you tell the hiring team when you are available to start ?
You could mention it in your cover letter or during the ( first ) interview .
Mentioning it too early in the process may come off as presumptuous ; but mentioning it later is n’t leveling with the hiring team .
How to Support Yourself When Your Term Ends
Normally , you could save money to finance an impending career transition .
( If you are in Peace Corps , you will be fortunate to receive a readjustment allowance to smooth your transition . )
However , if you ’re in a program like AmeriCorps or AmeriCorps VISTA , building up a cash reserve is unlikely .
And because most service corps experiences are n’t considered “ employment , ” you should n’t plan on collecting unemployment benefits when your term is through .
To make ends meet during your transition , then , you must be proactive .
Find a way to earn some money in the short - term — and that ’s flexible enough to give you time to go to job interviews as you ’re invited .
If you are in a corps that allows you to work part - time ( on the weekends , for example ) , you might try to take on a part - time job now ( a paid internship or a retail position with flexible hours ) that you can keep during your transition .
( a paid internship or a retail position with flexible hours ) that you can keep during your transition .
If you happen to be exiting your corps during a time of year when there ’s a demand for seasonal employees , you can try to take advantage of those short - term seasonal jobs to see you through the next few months .

You can also search Idealist for “ temporary ” employment — it ’s a check box on the main search page for jobs .

If you ’ve gotten some teaching experience during your service term , you may be able to work as a substitute teacher .
Some school districts do n’t require a teaching license for subs , so if you do n’t have a license , ask what the policies are .

Sign up with a temp agency as soon as your service term ends .
Temporary employment agencies help connect you to short - term jobs in offices or factories .
Richard Melo , who also blogs at The New Service , recommends finding out which temp agency your favorite local nonprofit uses , and sign up to work through them .
( Larger nonprofits use temp agencies to fill staffing gaps — call the main number of the nonprofit to confirm , and to find out details . )
Finally , if you choose to stay temporarily with friends or relatives while you are transitioning to a job , please communicate with them clearly about their expectations — do they want you to pay rent ?
How much ?
Do they want you to contribute to utilities ?
How much ?
Do they want you to move on by a certain date ?
What date ?
If your service does n’t end for several months yet , check out other things you can do right now to set yourself up for success .
You can also consider committing to a second term of service .

Advertisement A policeman has been interviewed under caution on suspicion of manslaughter after new tests overturned the cause of a newspaper - seller 's death .
Ian Tomlinson , 47 , was struck and pushed over by a police officer during G20 protests on 1 April in the City .
Now a fresh post - mortem examination has found he died of abdominal bleeding , not a heart attack , as first thought .
Lawyers for the family said the new post - mortem test raised the likelihood of a manslaughter charge .
In its statement , the Coroner 's Court said the inquest had looked at the first post - mortem examination carried out after Mr Tomlinson collapsed and died on the evening of 1 April .
That examination , carried out by Dr Freddy Patel , concluded Mr Tomlinson had diseased heart and liver and a substantial amount of blood in the abdominal cavity .
ABDOMINAL HAEMORRHAGE
An internal bleed in the abdomen Caused by injury , by disease or by some medications Blood can put pressure on nearby organs Loss of blood may also cause shock " His provisional interpretation of his findings was that the cause of death was coronary artery disease , " said the statement .
" A subsequent post - mortem examination was conducted by another consultant forensic pathologist , Dr Nat Cary , instructed by the IPCC and by solicitors acting for the family of the late Mr Tomlinson .
" Dr Cary 's opinion is that the cause of death was abdominal haemorrhage .
The cause of the haemorrhage remains to be ascertained .
" Dr Cary accepts that there is evidence of coronary atherosclerosis but states that in his opinion its nature and extent is unlikely to have contributed to the cause of death . "
The statement concluded that both the opinions remained provisional and subject to further investigations and tests .
In a response , the Independent Police Complaints Commission said : " Following the initial results of the second post mortem , a Metropolitan police officer has been interviewed under caution for the offence of manslaughter as part of an ongoing inquiry into the death of Ian Tomlinson . "
Family reaction Paul King , Mr Tomlinson 's step - son , said " First we were told that there had been no contact with the police , then we were told that he died of a heart attack .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Now we know that he was violently assaulted by a police officer and died from internal bleeding .
As time goes on we hope that the full truth about how Ian died will be made known . "
Jules Carey of Tuckers , the family 's solicitor , said the family had known about the results of the second post - mortem for the past week - but had reluctantly agreed to remain silent while the IPCC continued its investigations .
" The findings of Dr Nat Cary significantly increase the likelihood that the officer will now face the more serious charge of manslaughter , " said Mr Carey .
" The IPCC opposed the disclosure of Dr Cary 's findings until they satisfied themselves that it would not prejudice their investigation of the officer .
" It is of some comfort to the family that the record is now being put straight , but they hope that the IPCC investigation will be expedited and thorough , and that there will be a prompt referral to the CPS for charge , " he added .
" Sincere regret " The Mayor of London , Boris Johnson , said his first thoughts were with Mr Tomlinson 's family .
He added : " No one can doubt that the Metropolitan Police faced a huge challenge in securing the G20 summit .
" But there must now be a fast and transparent conclusion to the IPCC investigation , with the full and urgent co-operation of all involved . "
But his predecessor as mayor , Ken Livingstone , said both Scotland Yard and Mr Johnson should have done more to counter the " hyping - up " of disorder .
He added : " The Met and the mayor 's office should have been toning this down as we 've done in the past , reduce the tensions , not having a lot of demonstrators and police turning up expecting violence . "
The IPCC launched their investigation into Mr Tomlinson 's death after video footage revealed the officer 's contact with Mr Tomlinson , despite earlier reports to the contrary .
The officer involved has been suspended from duty .
The news came as attention remained focussed on the tactics used by Metropolitan Police officers who handled the G20 protests on April 1 and 2 .
Another officer from the force 's Territorial Support Group has also been suspended after a woman alleged she was struck during a protest held to mark Mr Tomlinson 's death .
Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson has called in the Inspectorate of Constabularies to look at policing tactics on the day and how to handle future large protests .
In a statement , the Metropolitan Police said it wished to reiterate its " sincere regret " over Mr Tomlinson 's death but would not comment on the post - mortem while the IPCC continued its investigations .

Planets orbiting near their stars may not last for very long ( Illustration : Mark Garlick / HELAS )
Exoplanets that venture near their host stars are doomed to premature deaths – even before they get close enough to be ripped apart by the stars ’ gravity , two new studies suggest .
A star ’s gravity can put a nearby planet on a ‘ fast track ’ to spiralling into the star and may also cause the planet to lose much of its atmosphere , the studies say .
The research may help explain why few exoplanets have been found right next to their host stars .
More than 300 exoplanets have been catalogued to date .
Many are situated close to their host stars , where it is thought to be too hot for gas and dust to collapse into planets in the first place .
That implies that the planets came from farther away and migrated inwards .
But strangely , the closest - in ones are commonly found some 0.05 astronomical units ( AU ) from their host stars ( 1 AU is the distance from the Earth to the sun ) .
This distance , which corresponds to a three - day orbit around a star as heavy as the sun , is sometimes called the “ three - day pile - up ” .
Advertisement
No one is sure why the planets seem to pile up there .
Very close to a star , at a boundary called the Roche limit , planets are dismembered by the star ’s gravity .
But the migration of planets seems to stop well outside this limit .
Dragged inwards
So why do planets seem to stop there ?
Some models suggest gas and dust in the disc around a star could drag the planets inward .
If the star managed to clear away the debris close to it , that could stop planet migration .
But Brian Jackson of the University of Arizona in Tucson and colleagues offer an alternative explanation .
There may be planets that orbit closer in , but they will not do so for very long before they get dragged inwards by their host star ’s gravity .
The tugging is caused by tidal forces between the planet and its star – differences in the pull of gravity on the objects ’ near and far sides .
Fast planets
Counter - intuitively , the same force is causing the moon to slowly widen its orbit around Earth .
But in that case , the moon orbits the Earth more slowly than the Earth spins , and that causes the moon ’s distance to increase .
Close - in planets , on the other hand , seem to orbit their stars faster than the stars themselves rotate , so this tidal friction will have the opposite effect .
It causes the stars to deform – their gaseous atmospheres are stretched towards the close - in planets – and causes the planets to migrate inwards .
Planets may only last in close - in orbits for perhaps tens of millions to a few billion years before spiralling into their stars .
“ Once a planet gets that close , the tide raised on the star by the planet causes the planet to migrate in so quickly they ’re hard to catch , ” Jackson told New Scientist .
Moribund world
The study suggests the closest - in planet known , Corot - 7b , may not have that much longer to live .
Tidal forces may cause the planet , which orbits just 0.017 AU from its host star , to be dragged to the star ’s deadly Roche limit in as few as 25 million years .
Future studies could detect evidence of this type of violence by looking for the chemical signatures of gobbled - up planets in starlight .
Stars that are spinning abnormally fast for their age could also be a sign that they have absorbed a planet and “ spun up ” as a result , Jackson told New Scientist .
Stellar outbursts
Intense tidal forces are not the only factor that can take a toll on vagabond planets .
Outbursts of activity early on in a star ’s life can also strip a planet of much of its mass , according to a study led by Helmut Lammer of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Graz .
As ultraviolet radiation from a star heats a nearby planet ’s upper atmosphere , the atmosphere expands out to a distance where it feels a stronger gravitational tug from the host star than the planet and is pulled off the planet .
The star - hugging planet WASP - 12 b , which orbits its host star just once a day , seems to have been a particularly dramatic victim of stellar activity .
The planet seems to have lost roughly 24 % of its mass over the course of its estimated 2 - billion - year lifetime , the new work suggests .
It now weighs about 1.4 times the mass of Jupiter .

This is a column about Republicans  and I ’m not sure I should even be writing it .
Today ’s G.O.P. is , after all , very much a minority party .
It retains some limited ability to obstruct the Democrats , but has no ability to make or even significantly shape policy .
Beyond that , Republicans have become embarrassing to watch .
And it does n’t feel right to make fun of crazy people .
Better , perhaps , to focus on the real policy debates , which are all among Democrats .
But here ’s the thing : the G.O.P. looked as crazy 10 or 15 years ago as it does now .
That did n’t stop Republicans from taking control of both Congress and the White House .
And they could return to power if the Democrats stumble .
So it behooves us to look closely at the state of what is , after all , one of our nation ’s two great political parties .
One way to get a good sense of the current state of the G.O.P. , and also to see how little has really changed , is to look at the “ tea parties ” that have been held in a number of places already , and will be held across the country on Wednesday .
These parties  antitaxation demonstrations that are supposed to evoke the memory of the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution  have been the subject of considerable mockery , and rightly so .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Comprehensive lifestyle changes including a better diet and more exercise can lead not only to a better physique , but also to swift and dramatic changes at the genetic level , U.S. researchers said on Monday .

In a small study , the researchers tracked 30 men with low - risk prostate cancer who decided against conventional medical treatment such as surgery and radiation or hormone therapy .
The men underwent three months of major lifestyle changes , including eating a diet rich in fruits , vegetables , whole grains , legumes and soy products , moderate exercise such as walking for half an hour a day , and an hour of daily stress management methods such as meditation .
As expected , they lost weight , lowered their blood pressure and saw other health improvements .
But the researchers found more profound changes when they compared prostate biopsies taken before and after the lifestyle changes .
After the three months , the men had changes in activity in about 500 genes -- including 48 that were turned on and 453 genes that were turned off .
The activity of disease - preventing genes increased while a number of disease - promoting genes , including those involved in prostate cancer and breast cancer , shut down , according to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The research was led by Dr. Dean Ornish , head of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito , California , and a well - known author advocating lifestyle changes to improve health .
“ It ’s an exciting finding because so often people say , ‘ Oh , it ’s all in my genes , what can I do ? ’
Well , it turns out you may be able to do a lot , ” Ornish , who is also affiliated with the University of California , San Francisco , said in a telephone interview .
“ ‘ In just three months , I can change hundreds of my genes simply by changing what I eat and how I live ? ’
That ’s pretty exciting , ” Ornish said .
“ The implications of our study are not limited to men with prostate cancer . ”
Ornish said the men avoided conventional medical treatment for prostate cancer for reasons separate from the study .
But in making that decision , they allowed the researchers to look at biopsies in people with cancer before and after lifestyle changes .
“ It gave us the opportunity to have an ethical reason for doing repeat biopsies in just a three - month period because they needed that anyway to look at their clinical changes ( in their prostate cancer ) , ” Ornish said .
A man faces a hefty fine and a driving ban after being caught having sex with his girlfriend while speeding on a motorway in Norway , police have said .
Officers initially trailed the couple 's car after noticing it was swerving from side to side and travelling at 33 km / h ( 20 mph ) over the road 's speed limit .
But they soon realised the erratic driving was due to the woman " sitting on the man 's lap " , a spokesman said .
After filming the exploit for evidence , they pulled them over at a rest area .
The 28 - year - old man 's punishment will be decided within the next week , but police said he was likely to face a fine of several thousand Norwegian kroner and a lengthy driving ban .
" Why they did it on a highway with such a high risk we do n't know , " Tor Stein Hagen , a superintendent with Soendre Buskerud Police District , told the AFP news agency .
" [ The vehicle ] was veering from one side to the other because the woman was sitting on the man 's lap while he was driving and doing the act , shall we say , " he added .
" He could n't see much because her back was in the way . "
Despite her prominent role in the incident , the 21 - year - old woman was permitted by police to drive her lover home .
A new tax year has begun which provides a great opportunity to do a little financial spring cleaning .
Even in a tough economy , it is possible to spend less without making major sacrifices .

Get Organized
First things first — gather all of your monthly bills and take stock of your situation .
Ask yourself questions like : " Do I need this ? " , " Is this the best service provider ? " and " How long has it been since I made changes ? "
How About that Landline ?
If you are really honest with yourself , there are probably several services that you are paying for that do n't produce a good return on their investment .
One of the top issues on my list is a landline phone .
Obviously there are extenuating circumstances , but fax machines and security systems are often among the excuses people use to hang on to these relics .

For most faxing situations , a scanner and some kind of email or e-fax service will work just fine — we recommend emailing PDFs with embedded signature images where possible .
And , of course , you always have the option of going with VOIP .
Vonage offers unlimited local and long distance for $ 25 a month while unlimited US and Canada Skype accounts start at $ 3 per month ( plus it is also available on cellphones for extra savings ) .
Keep in mind that this price is on top of your current internet connection , so it may be advantageous to investigate bundles .

Take Advantage of Bundles
If you insist on keeping a landline , now is a great time to take advantage of bundled services .
As a recent article in the New York Times pointed out , companies like AT&T offer several options for bundling services .
Another example is Verizon Fios .
If you are fortunate enough to have this option where you live , you can get double and triple freedom bundle packages — the latter combining landline , Fios internet and TV for $ 95 a month ( a $ 38 savings ) .
While we are talking about bundles , keep an eye out for upsells .
For instance , when I moved recently , I decided to try Road Runner Turbo over their standard service .
I found that in my situation , the speed upgrade was barely noticeable and therefore not worth an extra $ 10 a month — so I dropped it .
It 's as simple as that .

Fight For Your Rights
The NYT article also made clear that the tried - and - true art of bitching can sometimes make a world of difference .
If you feel you are paying too much , let your voice be heard .
And do n't be afraid to threaten a switch to another provider .
Often the representatives you are speaking to are empowered to make a deal .

Security Without the Monthly Fee
A lot of people keep landlines just for security systems , and that 's not a bad idea .
E911 services from traditional telecoms and VOIP networks automatically tell cops and ambulance services where you live , and where you want to continue to live .
But a lot of security systems can be ripoffs .
For one thing , the equipment installation can be riddled with extras .
And second , what 's the monthly monitoring fee for ?
In reality , the monitoring service is just a middleman .
So in addition to paying a huge installation fee — a new ADT system can easily cost over $ 1000 ( depending on the deal ) — and you pay at least $ 25 per month on top of what you pay for the landline ( GSM add - ons can cost even more ) .

One way to eliminate the cost of a monitoring service and possibly save some money on installation without compromising security in the house is a home security kit .
One suggestion is SecureLinc .
It does n't require in - home wiring , and it calls up to four numbers when tripped .
You still have to keep the landline , but you would n't be paying for monitoring and you still have the option of a GSM modem .
Instead of dialing out to a landline , the modem uses a SIM from your wireless carrier .
There would be a monthly fee associated with that of course , but it will most likely be cheaper than a monitoring service and maintaining a landline — and you do n't have to worry about the line being cut during a break - in .
If all else fails , dogs and guns ( maybe even dogs with guns ) is always an option .

Going on a TV Diet
Looking at my own bills , it 's pretty obvious that I spend a great deal of money on my DirecTV service .
At the moment I 'm taking advantage of a 12 - month deal at around $ 50 , but after the year is up the price will shoot up to $ 75 to $ 80 .
To be honest , I really only watch a handful of networks and shows consistently .
So would it be traumatic if I gave up that service completely ?
Probably not .
With Bittorrent and the growing availability of my favorite shows streaming legally online , it is conceivable that I could get by without making a huge sacrifice .
Engadget contributing editor Ben Drawbaugh has found success in ditching cable for over - the - air TV and Netflix , along with internet - based extras .
Four months and counting .

Obviously , this solution is n't going to work for a total TV addict , but it makes sense for most of us to re-examine our situations to see what might be excessive .
I mean , there are often great shows on HBO , but sometimes even HBO can be dry for months at a time , and you can find a lot of their shows online or catch them on DVD / Blu-ray .
With all the money you save , you can pay an extra couple of bucks for the Blu-ray bump at Netflix .

Speaking of Netflix , how many movies do you really watch ?
Is three out at a time too many ?
If you are not churning and burning these discs , you might be able to get away with a cheaper plan .
Even the $ 9 plan gives you unlimited Watch Instantly , which you should try to take advantage of when possible .
( If you are on the $ 5 plan , for two DVDs per month and up to two hours of Watch Instantly , you may want to drop Netflix altogether , because maybe you need that $ 5 more than Netflix does . )

Dust Off Your Service Plans
Like most of us , you have probably been sitting on a cellphone or TV plan for years now .
If you think your provider will alert you when there is a money - saving change you could benefit from , think again .
Many years ago I was on a Sprint plan where night minutes started at 9 pm .
Sometime later , the plan changed to 7 pm .
Since I make most of my calls in the evening hours , that change had a big effect on my minutes usage .
If I had not done a check at the end of the year , I would have never known .
Make sure to check the offerings of your provider and the offerings of competitors to make sure you are getting the deal that fits your needs best .

Go Green
Last but certainly not least we arrive at the energy bill .
There is no doubt that energy bills can be one of the biggest monthly expenses .
Obviously , elaborate solar arrays are out of the reach for many individuals , but there are plenty of simple , affordable eco-upgrades that will pay for themselves sooner rather than later :
• Ditch the incandescent bulbs .
You already know that you should change out those energy sucking incandescent lights for CFLs or LEDs .
Seriously , a 60W CFL that only uses 13W of power is a no-brainer .
Over the life of that single bulb you might save $ 40 or $ 50 in energy costs .
It is more expensive up front , but you can bounce into any Walmart and get a decent deal .
Besides , how many incandescents will you buy over the course of a CFLs seven year life span ?

• Buy Energy Star appliances .
Again , there is a premium for Energy star devices up front , but these devices use 10 % to 50 % less energy or water than their traditional counterparts .
You will more than make up for that in energy cost savings in a short amount of time .
• Kill the electricity vampires .
You may not know it , but many of your gadgets constantly suck standby power even when they are " off . "
On the lower end , power strips like the Ecostrip and the Visible Energy UFO help to control this problem .
If you are looking for a more elaborate solution , a company like Greenswitch can quickly re-wire the outlets in your home — designating each one as green or standard as needed .
If you want to turn off all of the gadgets in your home using standby power , it is as easy as flicking a single switch .
A solution like this could potentially save 8 - 10 % of your energy costs and pay for itself in a year or two .

• Get an efficient water heater .
There are several options here , but spending the extra cash on something like a tankless water heater could result in a savings of up to 50 % on your hot water bills ( depending on your usage ) because it does n't store and heat water when it 's not needed .
It costs significantly more than a traditional heater , but there are usually tax credits that help to subsidize the cost .
This goes for other green upgrades as well .
Green incentives in your state can be found at DSIRE .

• Go low - flow : Replacing your current shower heads with low - flow versions can reduce your water consumption in the shower by as much as 50 % .
They cost about as much as regular shower heads , and despite consumption rates between .5 and 2.5 gallons per minute , they can still deliver great water pressure .
You can also go low - flow with your toilets and use about half as much water per flush for a price that is comparable to a standard version .
• Get or make a rain barrel .
Seriously , we waste far too much water irrigating our lawns .
Even if you 're not a greenie , there 's money to be saved .
At the very least you can make a simple rain barrel for less than $ 40 or buy one for $ 50 - $ 100 ( depending on capacity ) .
Advertisement
In the end , saving money on your bills is about being proactive and taking action when necessary .
Ideally , going through your monthly expenses should be part of a yearly self - audit .
It also pays to investigate the financial viability of eco-friendly options because many basic upgrades will start paying off right away .

Yesterday , Mannion wrote a post about how his dreams are boring , and about one specific boring dream in which he spent a little time with Robert Redford .
Mannion and I have spoken about dreams before , because I have crazy ones .
Vivid , elaborate , uncanny , crazy dreams .
Not at all like his potato peeling dreams .
As it happens , I had a rather strange one last night …
I dreamt I had started a new " religion " as a joke .
There was a whole background sequence in which it was developed as a facetious competitor to Scientology , but that 's neither here nor there .
All you really need to know is that it was called Fucktology , and its adherents worshipped Keanu Reeves .
Then a long time passed , during which I completely lost interest in Fucktology , because the joke wasover , but then I realized people had started taking it seriously , and they 'd forgotten that it had been started as a joke .
was now considered a good movie , full of hidden meaning .
The Fucktologists were fighting over interpretations of various scenes intrilogy .
It was totally out of control , and I did n't know what to do .
Then Jesus appeared and he said , " You think you 've got it bad ?
Check out the shit I have to deal with .
" I said , " Totally , I know . "
We watched a bunch of Fucktologists screaming at each other for a minute , and then I said , " Hey , so , are you like really the son of God and stuff ?
" Jesus said , " Dude , I was just a guy trying to tell people to be groovy and shit , you know ?
God does n't even .
There 's no afterlife , no heaven — I 'm just a figment of your subconscious now . " " Oh , " I said .
Jesus nodded and then clapped me on the shoulder .
" Right , I 'm outta here .
Good luck with your Fucktologists , " he said .
" Thanks , " I said .
" Seeya . " " Later .
" That was the end of the dream .
Oh , and Jesus looked like Naveen Andrews .
I loved how he called me " dude . "
Asarco is America 's third largest copper producer
Mining giant Vedanta is to buy struggling US copper producer Asarco for $ 1.7bn ( £ 1.2bn ) , 35 % less than £ 2.6 bn figure first agreed last year .
Vedanta had offered that amount back in June 2008 , but the deal subsequently unravelled as global commodity prices slumped in the second half of the year .
Based in the UK , but with most of its operations in India , Vedanta said the deal would boost its US presence .
Asarco has been in US bankruptcy protection since 2005 .
Under this US rule , called Chapter 11 , a struggling American firm is allowed to continue trading while protected from its creditors .
' Strategic fit '
Despite its troubles , Asarco is the third largest copper producer in the US .
Vedanta said the takeover had been secured through its Sterlite Industries subsidiary .
" This acquisition is in line with our strategy of leveraging our existing skills to become a diversified global copper producer , " said Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal , who also heads Sterlite .
He added that the deal was a " strategic fit " .

Suzanne Goldenberg returns
I attach various points concerning the media coverage of the ongoing war between Israel and the Islamic “ Party of God ” militia , Hizbullah .
OLMERT AS “ NAZI COMMANDER IN SCHINDLER’S LIST ”
One of Norway ’s largest newspapers has compared Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to the infamous Nazi commander SS Major Amon Goeth who was depicted by Ralph Fiennes in Steven Spielberg ’s film Schindler ’s List .
Finn Graf , the cartoonist for the Oslo daily Dagbladet , drew Olmert as Goeth .
As the commandant of the Plaszow death camp in Poland , Goeth indiscriminately murdered Jews by firing at them from his balcony .
He was convicted of mass murder in 1946 and hanged .
In response to Dagbladet , a joint Norwegian Jewish - Christian organization has appealed to the Oslo government to speak out against hatred of Jews “ before anti-Semitism in Norway becomes dangerous . ”
( With thanks to Michael Freund of the Jerusalem Post for the above information . )
Dagbladet is the third largest newspaper in Norway .
In July 2006 the newspaper published a story which questioned whether Muslims were really responsible for the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington .
The article , “ The Third Tower , ” came a few weeks after the French magazine Le Monde Diplomatique ’s Norway edition ran a similar front page story .
NOBEL PRIZE FOR WHAT ?
This is what the Nobel Peace Prize laureate , Betty Williams , has to say for herself :
“ I have a very hard time with this word ‘ non- violence ’ , because I do n’t believe that I am non-violent .
Right now , I would love to kill George Bush . ”
Ms Williams , 64 , an Irishwoman who won the peace prize in 1970s , was speaking to an audience of schoolchildren at the Earth Dialogues forum in Brisbane , Australia .
“ Her young audience at the Brisbane City Hall clapped and cheered , ” according to a report in The Australian , one of Australia ’s leading newspapers .
No doubt her fellow Nobel peace laureate , Yasser Arafat , would have agreed .
IS KOFI ANNAN LISTENING ?
Retired Canadian Major - General Lewis MacKenzie has said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that the Canadian soldier killed at a UN post in Lebanon on Tuesday had complained in e-mails that Hizbullah fighters were all over his position .
“ They use the UN as shields knowing that they ca n’t be punished for it . ”
Without even checking the facts , UN Secretary - General Annan had immediately accused Israel of deliberately attacking a UN position without reason .
The deceased UN observer wrote to me saying that Israel was responding to Hizbullah gunmen firing rockets , and not aiming at the United Nations observers , said MacKenzie .
MacKenzie is the former commander of UN troops in Bosnia .
“ DISPROPORTIONATE ”
Perhaps the most frequently used word to criticize Israel in recent days has been “ disproportionate . ”
Richard Cohen writing Tuesday in the Washington Post notes that “ If by chance you have the search engine LexisNexis and you punch in the words ‘ Israel ’ and ‘ disproportionate , ’ you run the risk of blowing up your computer or darkening your entire neighborhood .
Just limiting the search to newspapers and magazines of the past week will turn up ‘ more than 1,000 documents . ’
Israel may or may not be the land of milk and honey , but it certainly seems to be the land of disproportionate military response . ”
Cohen goes on to criticize “ a whole bunch of European newspapers whose editorial pages call for Israel to respond , it seems , with only one missile for every one tossed its way .
Such neat proportion is a recipe for doom After the Holocaust , after 1,000 years of murder [ of Jews ] , the only proportionality that counts is zero for zero .
If Israel ’s enemies want that , they can have it in a moment . ”
In fact only in the Israeli press have details been reported about the “ proportion ” taken by the Israeli air force to spare civilian lives .
Anshel Pfeffer , of The Jerusalem Post , writes : “ Maj . E , a reservist who is the CFO of an avionics company in his civilian life , explained that ‘ each pilot has the permission to abort a mission if he feels that there is a danger to too many civilians .
I personally took part in a mission to bomb a bridge , but when we were over the target I saw that there was too much traffic of people leaving Beirut on it , so I decided to abort .
We returned at 3 a.m. to finish the job . ’”
Whilst “ disproportionate ” is being used frequently by media throughout the world and by UN representatives , the word “ occupation ” is now being used less often .
Moshe Yaalon , the former chief of staff of the Israeli army writes : “ For years , we were told that the ‘ root cause ’ of the Middle East ’s problems was the Israeli occupation of Arab lands  the Sinai Peninsula , the Gaza Strip , the West Bank , the Golan Heights , and southern Lebanon .
The ‘ root cause ’ theory always had plenty of holes .
But never has it looked quite so naive and simplistic as it does this week . ”
Over 150 rockets were fired into Israel yesterday , an increased number , wounding dozens of civilians .
CNN ’S NIC ROBERTSON NOW ADMITS : HIZBULLAH “ HAD CONTROL ” OF HIS ANTI - ISRAEL FOOTAGE
“ CNN Senior international correspondent ” Nic Robertson , who is presently reporting from Beirut , has admitted his anti-Israel report on civilian casualties in Lebanon was stage - managed from start to finish by Hizbullah .
He said the story he filed on July 18 was heavily influenced by Hizbullah ’s “ press officer ” and that Hizbullah have “ very , very sophisticated and slick media operations . ”
Speaking on the CNN program “ Reliable Sources , ” Robertson said that the Hizbullah press officer also instructed the CNN camera team on what to film .
Robertson said Hizbullah “ had control of the situation .
They designated the places that we went to , and we certainly did n’t have time to go into the houses or lift up the rubble to see what was underneath . ”
Robertson also said that Hizbullah has “ very , very good control over its areas in the south of Beirut .
They deny journalists access into those areas .
They can turn on and off access to hospitals in those areas .
They have a lot of power and influence .
You do n’t get in there without their permission . ”
Robertson is not the only foreign journalist to have misled viewers with selected footage from Beirut .
NBC ’s Richard Engel and CBS ’s Elizabeth Palmer were also taken around the damaged areas by Hizbullah minders .
Palmer commented on her report that “ Hizbullah is also determined that outsiders will only see what it wants them to see . ”
Hussain Nabulsi , a Hizbullah spokesman has become a virtual media celebrity during the conflict appearing on Sky News ( at least twice ) as well as on CNN and has been quoted in articles for both the Times of London and Bloomberg .
On CNN , Nabulsi , standing in the rubble of flattened Beirut buildings , tells Robertson to “ Just look .
Shoot .
Look at this building .
Is it a military base ?
Is it a military base , or just civilians living in this building ? ” Nabulsi continued , “ Shoot me .
Shoot .
This is here where they said Sheikh Nasrallah , the secretary - general of Hizbullah , is living .
This is wrong ! ”
For more , see this conversation between Robertson and Washington Post media writer Howard Kurtz .
The influential Australian paper , The Age , published in Melbourne , today has an editorial by Ali Fayyad , a senior member of Hizbullah ’s executive committee .
ET TU , TELEGRAPH ?
The Daily Telegraph used to be one of the only quality newspapers in Europe that gave Israel a fair hearing .
Now its news pages have turned against Israel .
For example , the second largest banner headline on its home page yesterday , read in black type : “ UK harbours Israeli bombs : U.S. - made bunker busters stored outside Glasgow . ”
Its story then suggested that it was a scandal that “ Britain has been used as a staging post for major shipments from America to Israel . ”
With dozens of conflicts raging throughout the world , including in Afghanistan , where almost every day British troops are killing Afghans , without any real reporting of this in the British press , this was virtually a non-story from a news point of view .
Its only real purpose was to editorialize against America and Israel , something the Conservative - leaning Daily Telegraph would not have done a few years ago .
Elsewhere in the Daily Telegraph , the foreign news pages have included some of the most slanted coverage of the present mideast crisis , routinely referring to “ hell ” that the Lebanese ( not of course the Israeli ) civilians have endured .
NO RESPECT
Meanwhile on the British left , this is the cartoon flyer that the “ Respect ” political party , which has elected representation in the Britain House of Commons , has been distributing .
Of course , anti-Semitism is now raging not just on the British hard left , but among some on the right too .
For example , Conservative MP Sir Peter Tapsell said on Tuesday that British Prime Minister Tony Blair was “ colluding ” with U.S. President George W. Bush in giving Israel the okay to wage a war crime “ gravely reminiscent of the Nazi atrocity on the Jewish quarter of Warsaw . ”
Of course , there was no “ Jewish quarter ” of Warsaw .
The ghetto in the Polish capital , established in October 1940 , constituted less than three square miles .
Over 400,000
Jews were then crammed into it , about 30 % of the population of Warsaw .
300,000 of these Jews were transferred to Treblinka where they were exterminated .
Most of the rest were murdered in other ways .
The ghetto was completely cleared of Jews by the end of May 1943 .
People who are interested in correcting Sir Peter might want to read the second reader comment here : www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/742707.html.
( It should be pointed out that many other British and European politicians on both left and right , some of whom are subscribers to this email list , are supportive of Israel and not in any way anti-Semitic . )
THE BBC : A HAMMER TO WHACK ISRAEL
Stephen Pollard , writing in the Times of London on Monday , has described the BBC ’s coverage of the conflict as “ overwhelmingly one - sided , with presenters and reporters editorialising against what they universally refer to as ‘ Israeli attacks on Lebanon . ’ ”
Pollard , who is a subscriber to this list , cites the “ Andrew Marr programme on BBC1 ” which interviewed four guests , of whom “ not one had anything but bile to pour over Israel . ”
He added : “ To judge from its contents , the programme was the first to have been edited by the leader of Hizbullah , Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah . ”
Following the article , Pollard received a sympathetic letter from a BBC News staffer , who must remain anonymous in order to preserve his or her job at the BBC .
That person wrote :
“ Note how Sky does much of its work from Haifa and the BBC does it all from Beirut .
Note how every piece done by the BBC ’s Middle East editor , Jeremy Bowen , questions whether or not Israel has carried out war crimes
The BBC have sent out Fergal Keane and Jeremy Bowen whose clear agenda is to tell us Israel is a bastard state
There is no intelligence here , no in - depth questioning of why this conflict has erupted .
No discussion of Syria , Iran and Middle East geopolitics .
It ’s a hammer with which to whack Israel . ”
BBC NEWS SUPPORTING ANTI -ISRAEL PROTESTS
Last Saturday , the BBC ’s website helpfully carried full details of the assembly points for that day ’s anti-Israel march in London .
Nowhere did it give the same detail for Sunday ’s rally in London in support of Israel .
The BBC , the world ’s largest television news network , is funded by the British taxpayer to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds per year , and is under a legal obligation to be impartial , which of course it is not when it comes to Jews and Americans .
SUZANNE GOLDENBERG RETURNS
Suzanne Goldenberg , the former chief Jerusalem correspondent for The ( London ) Guardian , has been rushed to south Lebanon from Washington , where she has been Guardian correspondent for the last three years .
Goldenberg is renowned for her anti-Israeli writing .
( See New Prejudices for Old : The European press and the Intifada . )
For example , in Monday ’s Guardian ( July 24 ) , there was a large photo of Goldenberg , complete with her name in large bold type at the top of the newspaper ’s front page , under the headline “ Family ordered to flee were targeted because they were driving a minivan . ”
In the same edition of the paper , following page after page of completely one - sided news coverage of the mideast crisis , The Guardian carried a piece by the decidedly left - wing Israeli writer Gideon Levy .
Some media analysts have suggested that The Guardian brought back Goldenberg and published Levy 's article to counteract allegations by increasing numbers of critics that its newspaper coverage of the Middle East has now spilled over into anti-Semitism .
For example , last week ( on July 19 ) The Guardian ’s cartoonist Martin Rowson depicted a fist with Stars of David as knuckle dusters : www.guardian.co.uk/cartoons/martinrowson/0,,1823933,00.html
[ All notes above by Tom Gross ]
A colleague of mine recently pointed me to SAIC ’s IKE 504 , a GIS - integrated encrypted GPS targeting and data capture device .
IKE captures the GPS coordinates and other geospatial data for any target from a safe distance ( up to 1,000 meters ) and provides a verifiable digital image of the target .
To this end , IKE can be used for specialized mapping .

Reactors
Two pressurised water reactors , model KN - 3 ( OK - 900 ) with a VM - 16 type reactor core generating 171 MWt .
The reactors are used in tandem with an oil turbine and together generate 66 500 hp .
Originally designed as Project 1153 - a new nuclear powered full - deck aircraft carrier - construction was suspended in 1983 when 50 % completed and put aside for 5 years when when it was decided the hull was too small to launch aircraft and the catapult system designed for the ship failed .
The hull was then used for the Ural Project # 1941 " Titan " ( Nato Codename " Kapusta " ) .
Officially designated ' Sudno Suyazyy ' ( Communications Vessel ) .
She has since been laid up and is in used as a powerplant on the Pacific coast .
French Nuclear Powered Surface Combatants
FS Charles De Gaulle ( R91 ) The FS Charles De Gaulle ( R91 ) is the largest and only nuclear powered aircraft carrier in Europe .
It is also the only aircraft carrier with conventional take off and landing capabilities .
The Charles De Gaulle is perhaps the ugliest nuclear powered ship ever built , although a face lift before entering service makes it a slightly less obnoxious eyesore .
Originally named the Richelieu , the ship was renamed Charles De Gaulle during construction .
The Charles De Gaulle took more than 12 years to complete and enter service , largely due to engineering difficulties and budgetary constraints .
The ship suffered difficulties during its sea trials including a propulsion failure and abnormal vibration in the main engines .
In 1998 , engineering spaces were retrofitting to reduce excessive radiation doses during normal operation .
The French Government initially ordered a second nuclear aircraft carrier ( also named the Richelieu ) which was later canceled .
The French Navy attempted to have the programme revived but the Richelieu remains unbuilt .

In the last post , we developed a very basic blog application using Happstack .
Now that we have a simple application without an authentication mechanism , let 's see how much effort it takes to add authentication using the Happstack - Auth module mentioned here .
First let 's make an outline of what needs to be done .
We need the following pieces of functionality :
The first thing we have to do is import the auth module .
Let 's start by looking at the first three bullets of functionaliy mentioned above .
I 'll implement the login / registration pages in pretty much the same way they were implemented in my old posts .
A single login.html file will have a form for both registration and login .
This suggests the following code block :
These server parts get added to the list we already started in the impl function .
The newuser line introduces newUserHandler from our auth library .
It returns the first parameter if the user already exists or the username is invalid , the second parameter if the two passwords did not match , and the third parameter if the registration was good and the user was created .
In this case , the user is also automatically logged in .
newUserHandler requires three form fields with the names " username " , " password " , and " password2 " .
It even takes care of sanitizing the username field to make sure this does n't happen to you .
If you need more fine - grained control over your user registration process , the auth library provides other functions to facilitate this .
I wo n't describe them in detail here .
Read the code .
The login lines introduce two functions provided by the auth library .
They are withSession and loginHandler .
Here is the type signature for withSession :
The first parameter is a function that takes a SessionData and returns a ServerPartT .
withSession takes care of the details involved in getting the session data , so all you have to do is supply a function that uses it .
The second parameter is a ServerPartT that gets returned if the user is not currently logged in .
This allows you to specify custom guest functionality .
It could be a " 401 unauthorized " response , or something else entirely .
If the user is already logged in , we simply skip the login page and redircect to root .
If the user is not logged in , then we have two server parts to handle GET and POST .
On a GET we just return the contents of login.html .
On a POST , we need to handle the form data .
loginHandler is provided to take care of all these details .
Its first two arguments are ServerPartTs that will be returned on good login and bad login respectively .
loginHandler requires that your form contain fields named " username " and " password " .
The logout line calls upon the logoutHandler function to take care of the details of logging out .
All you have to do is pass it something to return afterwards .
In this case we just redirect the user to the root page .
Now we need to define the functions we just used .
If the user successfully logged in , we assume that they are logging in so they can create a new blog post and redirect them to " / new " .
Otherwise we return an invalid login page .
We define a couple generic error message pages for the previously mentioned registration errors , and if their registration is good , we redirect to " / new " just like on a good login .
Everything we 've done so far has been new functionality .
We might have been able to have the auth framework abstract it a little more and require us to write less code , but for the most part the functionality we have written is unique to the layout and design choices made by our site .
Now we need to go back and modify our existing functionality to give it an awareness of users .
First , we add an item to our Post data type to store the author of the post .
We want to use the Username type defined by the auth library since that 's how it will be available to us .
Since we 're changing the Post data constructor , we will have to make a corresponding change in addPostHandler .
But addPostHandler does n't know what username to use .
This is an ideal place to call upon the withSession function that we 've already seen .
We just add one parameter to addPostHandler representing the current session .
Here is the new function ( only the first and third lines changed ) :
We need to modify the part of impl that handles new pages by adding withSession and an action to take when the user is not logged in .
If you 're going to " / new " and you 're not logged in , we 'll just assume you want to log in and redirect you to " / login " .
This is complemented by the code we already wrote which redirects you to " / new " after login .
Since our website is simple , this will provide a seamless flow when the user goes to " / new " without them needing to know about " / login " .
This means that newPostHandlers has to accept the session data as a parameter and pass it to addPostHandler according to our above modifications .
Finally , we have to tell Happstack that our application 's state includes the state Component defined in another Happstack .
Auth .
All we have to do is add " AuthState :+ : " to the BlogState dependencies .
And that 's all there is to it .
You still have to integrate your login pages with the rest of your site just like you normally would , but all the details of session management are nicely hidden away .
You do n't have to know about browser cookies or worry about generating session IDs .
You do n't have to worry about storing your user database or keeping track of open sessions .
You do n't have to understand how to build a secure password storage scheme .
The library 's password storage has n't been vetted enough for me to call it secure , but it 's already more secure than reddit 's database once was .
All this at the bargain price of 13 additional lines of code with simple modifications to 6 others .
This auth library is a work in progress .
It still needs a mechanism for cleaning up expired sessions , and could probably benefit from improved defense against session hijacking .
I 'm sure there are many other problems I have n't thought of .
If you find this library useful , or have suggestions or any other comments , I 'd love to hear them .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - May
Day protesters clashed with riot police in Germany , Turkey and Greece on Friday while thousands angry at the governments ’ responses to the global financial crisis took to the streets in France and Spain .
Rising unemployment across Europe and beyond has added intensity to May Day marches as last year ’s market crash and banking meltdown roll into the real economy .
There were fierce clashes in Berlin on Friday evening and protests in Istanbul swiftly turned violent .
Greek police clashed with anarchists .
Demonstrations in France and Spain appeared largely peaceful .
In the German capital , left - wing militants pelted riot police with stones , bottles and firecrackers in the most severe May Day violence to hit the city in four years .
The attacks by about 400 militants on police accompanying a protest of about 5,000 leftists in the central district of Kreuzberg , a traditional hotbed of anarchist violence on Labor Day , was unusually fierce and began before darkness fell .
“ There are people out in the streets protesting peacefully against the economic crisis and there is nothing wrong with that , ” said police spokesman Frank Miller .
“ But when people burn cars and trash containers and commit other criminal acts -- that has nothing to do with political protests . ”
One group of protesters in central Berlin pelted the Finance Ministry building with brightly colored paint bombs .
Earlier , there were clashes in Hamburg and outbreaks of violence in Ulm , Dortmund , Mainz and Verden .
In the southern city of Ulm , left - wing militants threw bottles and stones at a march of about 1,000 neo -Nazis after police were unable to keep them apart .
Ulm officials said 29 riot police were injured , one seriously , and 21 demonstrators were hurt .
Turkish riot police fired water cannon and tear gas , firing shots and pepper spray to disperse masked protesters .
Young men hurled stones and Molotov cocktails , smashing bank and shop windows in side streets .
An Istanbul police spokesman said 68 demonstrators were detained and 11 police wounded .
Leftists and Kurdish separatists regularly clash with police at demonstrations in Turkey and the May Day protest last year also turned violent .
Turkey ’s government had declared May Day , traditionally marked by rallies by labor unions , a public holiday this year under pressure from the unions .

“ Those who are here are unemployed and need work , ” said Mehmet Guleryuz , a film director .
“ These are students who can not pay tuition fees .
Things are bad everywhere but it hits Turkey hard . ”
Almost one in three young people in Turkey is without a job and the government fears social unrest and increased ethnic tension because of the downturn .
Labor unions , traditionally weak , have become increasingly vocal .

FRENCH MARCHES
French unions organized nearly 300 marches against President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s social policies and crisis management , with the opposition Socialists calling on members to join the protests for the first time since 2002 .
They said turnout at regional protests was lower than on March 19 when up to 3 million attended the largest demonstrations since Sarkozy ’s election in 2007 .
In a sign of how far disillusion had spread , even staff in management positions joined the marches .
The number of jobseekers under 25 increased 36 percent year - on - year in March .
“ It is absolutely not in our tradition to protest on May 1 , but given the economic context in France and crisis we decided to join in , ” said Carole Couvert , a leader of the CFE - CGC union for executives .
Spanish unions held about 70 demonstrations and threatened strikes if the Socialist government followed demands from business groups to reform labor laws .
Greek police said they fired tear gas in a clash with 300 people at Athens Polytechnic .
Elsewhere in Athens , nearly 6,000 protesters , mostly members of a communist trade union , gathered under the watchful eyes of 4,000 police .
Many were angry at bank bailouts .
“ We wo n’t pay for their crisis , ” read banners from the country ’s main trade union GSEE .
A selling spree in Treasurys pushed rates higher , taking the yield curve to its steepest on record as spreads between the 2 - year and 10 - year widened by over a dozen basis points on Wednesday alone .
The 10 - year saw its yield move above 3.70 percent , after trading at 3.55 percent the previous day .
The selling wave hit bonds shortly after 1 p.m. , even after the auction of $ 35 billion in 5 - year notes was well received .
" It was a great auction .
It was just the follow through that was a problem , " said Brian Edmonds , head of interest rate trading at Cantor Fitzgerald .
Traders are bracing for more of the same Thursday .
The Treasury is auctioning another $ 26 billion in notes , this time 7 - years .
The heavy issuance - more than $ 100 billion this week alone - has been pressuring the market .
Some key data will also get the market 's attention Thursday , including weekly jobless claims , durable goods and new home sales .
More From CNBC.com
" Now we 're going to be glued to Treasury auction results , " said Art Hogan of Jefferies .
Hogan said the lull in the earnings period has left the stock market " catalyst light , " making the Treasury action even more important for stocks .
He said rising yields hurt stocks both because they create an attractive alternative investment and because they could potentially hurt the outlook for an economic recovery , which stocks have been trading on .
The Dow Wednesday fell 173 or 2 percent to 8300 , while the S&P 500 was off 17 , or 1.9 percent at 893 .
Traders said selling in Treasurys this week was exaggerated by " convexity " selling , or mortgage related hedging , which causes traders to sell Treasurys as a hedge as mortgage prices move lower and rates go higher .
The Fed , meanwhile , has been an active buyer of mortgages in an effort to keep rates lower , and until the last couple of days , selling in Treasurys did not ripple into the mortgage market .
5 hours after the 9/11 attacks , Donald Rumsfeld said " my interest is to hit Saddam " .
He also said " Go massive . . .
Sweep it all up .
Things related and not . "
And at 2:40 p.m. on September 11th , in a memorandum of discussions between top administration officials , several lines below the statement " judge whether good enough [ to ] hit S.H. [ that is , Saddam Hussein ] at same time " , is the statement " Hard to get a good case . "
In other words , top officials knew that there was n't a good case that Hussein was behind 9/11 , but they wanted to use the 9/11 attacks as an excuse to justify war with Iraq anyway .
Moreover , " Ten days after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , President Bush was told in a highly classified briefing that the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein to the [ 9/11 ] attacks and that there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda " .
And a Defense Intelligence Terrorism Summary issued in February 2002 by the United States Defense Intelligence Agency cast significant doubt on the possibility of a Saddam Hussein - al - Qaeda conspiracy .
And yet Bush , Cheney and other top administration officials claimed repeatedly for years that Saddam was behind 9/11 .
See this analysis .
Indeed , Bush administration officials apparently swore in a lawsuit that Saddam was behind 9/11 .

GAROOWE , Somalia — Abshir Boyah , a towering , notorious Somali pirate boss who admits to hijacking more than 25 ships and to being a member of a secretive pirate council called “ The Corporation , ” says he ’s ready to cut a deal .
Facing intensifying naval pressure on the seas and now a rising backlash on land , Mr. Boyah has been shuttling between elders and religious sheiks fed up with pirates and their vices , promising to quit the buccaneering business if certain demands are met .
“ Man , these Islamic guys want to cut my hands off , ” he grumbled over a plate of camel meat and spaghetti .
The sheiks seemed to have rattled him more than the armada of foreign warships patrolling offshore .
“ Maybe it ’s time for a change . ”
For the first time in this pirate - infested region of northern Somalia , some of the very communities that had been flourishing with pirate dollars — supplying these well - known criminals with sanctuary , support , brides , respect and even government help — are now trying to push them out .
A state lawmaker from San Francisco has introduced legislation to decriminalize marijuana and regulate it like alcohol .
It has been endorsed by a retired Orange County judge who used to be a federal prosecutor .
Jim Gray is a Vietnam combat veteran who spent 25 years on Orange County 's ' bench ' .
He 's riled a lot of anti-drug crusaders with his critiques of America 's war on narcotics .
In his view , it 's ' high time ' -- so to speak -- for another approach to marijuana .
" We would make marijuana less available for our children than it is today , " Gray said .
" Why is that ?
Because alcohol is controlled by the government , and illegal drugs are controlled by drug dealers , and they do n't ask for ID .
So what 's not to like ? "
His critics can rattle off any number of reasons , but in Judge Jim Gray 's book , the cost - benefit ratio of enforcing marijuana laws in California is not in society 's favor .
$ 1 billion a year , without really curbing demand , he says , when $ 1 billion could be reaped by taxing a regulated pot business .
" We glamorize it by making it illegal .
We fund an awful lot of juvenile gangs because they want to be a part of the action selling this stuff , " Gray said .
Gray is lobbying face - to - face and on the talk - show circuit , arguing that health - care intervention trumps law enforcement interdiction .
" Drug treatment works .
What else works ?
Honest education , ” Gray said .
“ Education is working today with regard to a real killer -- a mind - altering , sometimes addictive drug -- namely , tobacco . "
While countries such as Holland and Switzerland have decriminalized marijuana , mental health experts say Americans are going to need a lot more convincing for public opinion to shift in that direction .
" The idea that the government is involved in even regulating the distribution just turns people 's stomachs that we would be promoting it somehow , " forensic psychiatrist Clark Smith , M.D. said .
The Assembly bill in Sacramento faces major obstacles in the Legislature and even if passed and signed by the Governor , it would n't take effect unless there 's an enabling act of Congress signed by the President .
Florida to Build First Solar Powered City in U.S .
April 10th , 2009 by Derek Markham
The first 100 % solar powered city in the U.S. is in the works , and will be powered by the world ’s largest photovoltaic plant .
The eco-city , called Babcock Ranch , is a joint venture between a real estate developer , Kitson & Partners , and Florida Power & Light , and will be located near Fort Myers , Florida .
Babcock Ranch will include almost 20,000 houses and 6 million square feet of mixed retail , office , and light industrial space , and have city - wide wireless internet and electric car charging stations throughout .
The city will be fully powered by solar during the day , and produce an excess of electricity that will be exported to the grid .
The CEO of Kitson said the project will serve as a model to other communities and be a “ living laboratory for companies , workers and families ready to reap the rewards of innovation . ”
Florida Power & Light expects to break ground on the $ 400 million solar PV plant this year , pending regulatory approval .
Construction of Babcock Ranch is slated for the summer of 2010 .
The project ’s cost is estimated at $ 2 billion , and is expected to create 20,000 jobs .

C. P. Snow at the Pen Club , London , in 1949 ( Image : Popperfoto / Getty )
In his 1959 essay , the novelist C. P .
Snow argued that science and the humanities were dangerously divided – but is it still true in 2009 ?
Stefan Collini
C. P. Snow intended to call his lecture “ The Rich and the Poor ” – and regretted not doing so .
This title points to what remains valuable about the essay now .
Helping the world ’s impoverished majority meet their basic needs remains an obligation of richer societies , and applied science is a vital tool .
In other ways , though , Snow ’s lecture is superficial and misleading . …
Sin is in , said the Tax Foundation ’s Patrick Fleenor in The Christian Science Monitor , or at least sin taxes are .
Money - hungry “ nanny - staters ” in Congress are considering a proposal to add a tax to soft - drink sales , as a way to pay for health - care reform .
That ’s what these “ busybodies ” always do : sell their ruler - on - knuckle taxes as a way for a minority of sinners to compensate society for the cost of their sins .
Instead , it ’s an affront to freedom of choice .
The “ sin tax ” on health - damaging sugary drinks will probably die in Congress , said Dan Mitchell in Slate ’s The Big Money , killing some $ 24 billion in revenue over four years , at 3 cents a pop .
But when the beverage industry says the “ food police ” want to tell you what to eat and drink , remember , this group makes a fortune persuading “ Americans to consume a lot of crap . ”
That $ 24 billion is chump change , said Nick Gillespie in The New York Times .
Why not tax all vices , including all gambling and drugs , and prostitution ?
If we legalize , and tax , these activities , we can go a long way toward paying for health care and green energy .
“ There ’s a lot to be said for treating consenting adults like , well , adults ” — and a lot to gain , too .
Time Warner Cable ( TWC ) is putting aside unpopular plans to test metered Internet service .
The company says it is " shelving " the trials while it educates consumers and rolls out tools to help its subscribers measure how much bandwidth they consume per month .
Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Officer Glenn Britt said , “ It is clear from the public response over the last two weeks that there is a great deal of misunderstanding about our plans to roll out additional tests on consumption based billing .
As a result , we will not proceed with implementation of additional tests until further consultation with our customers and other interested parties , ensuring that community needs are being met .
While we continue to believe that consumption based billing may be the best pricing plan for consumers , we want to do everything we can to inform our customers of our plans and have the benefit of their views as part of our testing process . ”
Will U.S. ISPs ever be able to charge for Internet based on consumption ?
Perhaps -- it could be a nice revenue booster , even if consumer - unfriendly .
But probably not soon .
Consumers are far too used to paying for an " all - you - can -eat " subscription and not worrying about overage charges .
As long as these trials stay off the ground , this is good news for the online video industry , which has the most to lose if Internet companies start charging on a metered basis .
Beyond using a lot of bandwidth , online video competes directly with TWC 's highly profitable cable business .
( That 's one easy reason the company might be trying to make Web video more expensive to watch . )
Since Time Warner Cable detailed its plans to expand testing earlier this month , consumers and lawmakers have lined up against it .
The biggest risk to TWC is that consumers might flee for rivals like Verizon ( VZ ) .
Or that the government might decide Time Warner 's proposed overage rates -- $ 1 / GB -- are a rip off .
JERUSALEM —
The right - wing coalition of the new Israeli prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , does not bode well for Palestinians in Israel .
With the appointment of Avigdor Lieberman as foreign minister , the extremists are going after the indigenous population and threatening us with loyalty tests and the possibility of “ transfer ” into an area nominally controlled by the Palestinian Authority .
Netanyahu ’s intransigence vis-à - vis Palestinians in the occupied territories is certainly cause for concern .
No less concerning is what the Netanyahu - Lieberman combination may mean to Palestinian citizens of Israel .
This government , particularly with Lieberman as foreign minister , should be boycotted by the international community , just as it once boycotted Jörg Haider , the late Austrian far - right politician who won global notoriety for his anti-immigrant views .
Lieberman , in one of many outrageous comments , declared in May 2004 that 90 percent of Israel ’s Palestinian citizens “ have no place here .
They can take their bundles and get lost . ”
The letters of our thoughts are the ideas present in our mind before they come to realization . . .
Thoughts that are , yet not felt . . .
The words of the subconscious . . . of the soul . . .
These are the LETTERS OF MY THOUGHTS .
In this feature - length article Grunge Type is looked at a little more thoroughly than most who employ such fonts would think to do .
While there is n’t anything wrong with type that has been beaten and broken , there is definitely an issue with most of the fonts that are put under this category .
Let ’s have a look at how to do it well and how to give your headings real world grunge character .
In theory , grunge fonts are lovely things , are n’t they ?
They can be used to help give a feeling of tangibility — this piece of text , these words and their message have gone through hell to meet us .
Through their beaten but still standing shapes they give a sense of longevity , all while having an air of the modern to them .
The real charm of these cracked letters is a result of our ever refined culture — the computer affords the designer the ability to make all the lines straight , all the circles perfect .
Yet here are these forms that are n’t clean and neat and shiny .
They serve as a break from our gloss screens and polished metal .
They ’re almost organic in a sense .
Or at least that ’s their goal – to look as if they exist outside of the realm of pixels and vectors .
If the computer makes things perfect , the real world gives it character .
And this is what grunge fonts try to achieve – a sense of character and charm .
Too bad that this is almost never truly the case .
It ’s all theory and principal , is n’t it ?
The reality is that these fonts have two major failings :
If there is the same letter twice in the text of which they ’re setting , it looks dreadful
They ’re almost never applied properly
And that ’s the good grunge fonts , which are few and far between .
Fool me twice , shame on you .
Two letters in the same piece of text is the sturdiest nail in the coffin of the grunge font .
And the charm spoke of earlier ?
It ’s lost when the type is what is looked at rather than the letters .
It means people are n’t reading .
When a good font is used to set headings , body , captions or whatever , you do n’t notice it — you read the words and get a feeling of what they ’re saying through the type , but it happens subconsciously .
When you see a text set in Bembo , you do n’t consciously think ‘ classic font , must be classic text , ’ you think ‘ classic text ’ .
Our minds love repetition .
It ’s why we love the grid in our designs .
A repetitive pattern makes something easier to remember .
It makes the odd stand out .
When your eyes fall upon a heading set in a grunge font with the letter e found twice , and both have a chunk removed from the same spot that makes the counter a funny shape and twice the size it should be , you ’ll stare and inspect .
You wo n’t read ‘ medicine ’ , you ’ll think ‘ oh , look at the two e’s in medicine ’ .
It might happen in less than a second , but this observation will set your mind into overdrive as you read the text , searching out the same odd shapes over and over .
Stop Sitting On Me .
The second issue I often have with these fonts is that they are used in the wrong context .
A well chosen font will set your message within the design .
Not on top of it , not below it .
The font needs to match the mood of the text and the layout must n’t get in the way of it .
By design , grunge fonts are noticeable .
They stand out because they ’re different .
If you ’re design does n’t accommodate this , or if it ignores it completely , the contrast between the mood of your design and the type will be so strong that they will push each other apart .
The type and layout must be sewn together , with texture and seemingly dystopian design as the thread .
Following on from a point of a previous thought on good fonts not being noticeable , the same should be said of the layout .
I ’m not talking about the design as a whole being unnoticeable , that ’s just madness .
What needs to remain invisible until inspection is the relationship between the type , image and illustration within the design .
A super - bright and bubbly photo is n’t going to work well with a grunged up font .
The best photos are the gritty ones , the noisy ones .
The ones that compliment the emotion and tone of the font .
The biggest misinterpretation that many designers , especially the inexperienced , have is that because these fonts are rough , the layout and execution should also be rough .
An example of bad topic and misguided
ideals on grunge design
How often have you seen this kind of foolishness ?
While this is an extreme example more likely to be seen done by someone who just wants to put up a poster rather than a graphic designer , there are many , many , many graphic designers ( hi 95 % DeviantArt ! ) that seem to not go many levels above the quality of this awfulness above .
A silly mistake .
If anything , these kinds of layouts deserve as much attention , if not more , as the extremely corporate .
If special care is n’t taken , if the grasp of the designer on the attention needed is n’t tight , noticeable and ugly repetition and poor decisions will sneak in .
The principals and elements of design always work strongly , regardless of medium , message or voice .
No more tech .
As a general rule , do n’t use grungey , distressed fonts .
You ca n’t crash the car if you do n’t drive it .
Alright , so that ’s a little over the top , but most of these fonts are horrible concoctions .
I say concoction because they ’re made from well crafted fonts that are abused and slashed and beaten haphazardly .
The font from which they came deserve more care than that .
A good font takes years to finish .
A couple hours of warping each letter to grunge it up then packaging it as a font is a little disrespectful , is n’t it ?
Duplicate letters of grunge suck and are to be avoided , we ’ve gone over that .
So what to do about it then ?
With the dependence many of us have on technology , this might come as bit of a surprise , but here we go – get off the computer .
Forget the Photoshop tutorials that give no craft and are too polished with their flavor - of - the - month style .
Use your hands , get them dirty and allow them to lust for the grit and the grime .
Of course this is n’t the only way to develop this look , it can obviously be replicated to a beautiful extent on the computer .
But my typography classes taught me to work with my hands first , then get onto the computer – so for the sake of this article , that ’s what we ’re going to do .
We ’re going to focus on a heading we ’ll use in a design later on .
Remember , this is to give a real world grunge look to a text that ’s going to serve as a header for content that deserves such a typographic feel .
What better than a surf graphic ?
Type and kern your text in a strong typeface that works well for your message and print it out .
Print a few copies , you ’ll need them .
I ’m not a massive fan of tutorials in general , so instead of giving you step by step guides on how to gritify your type , I ’m going to give you a few examples and some ideas to get you started instead .
I only have access to last printers at the moment , so that ’s what I ’ll focus on .
Photocopier
Oooh , do I love a bad photocopier !
The older the machine , the higher the contrast and dirtier the print , the better .
Here are a few tricks I ’ve picked up on how to add a little grit and grunge and grime to headers .
Copy and scan .
Starting off easy , but it ’s a lovely effect .
The real beauty of this one can be seen when you look at the larger image .
The photocopier I used was n’t a very good one , which is how I got the beautiful texture around the second m and e .
Copy with a high contrast .
This might seem a little extreme , but it can be used to great effect once you get it into Photoshop and adjust the levels .
You might not use this as it is for the heading alone , but if you layered it over the top of a cleaner copy and explore the blending modes , a little magic might happen .
Copy of a copy .
Exactly what it sounds like , this is a copy of a copy .
The effect is a lot more subtle than a straight copy as a lot of the midtones are ripped from the image but the solids start to get a little textured .
Run the same sheet through twice .
Crave the bad alignment , enjoy the fact that it ’s out of your hands for a moment .
In the first one , the alignment is almost perfect – we ’re left with only a slight halo , which if printed at a decent size , looks quite nice .
The second is clearly way off ( was a mistake actually ) but is interesting and could work well .
However , you would n’t want to do much more to it as the doubling up of the heading is probably enough working with the text as you ’d want to do – too much texture on this one would make it start to look tacky and overdone .
Blow the type up to 400 %
Ohhhhh yeah , 400 % increase .
Clearly the photocopier did n’t like this one , but look at the edges of the letters !
The roughness is fantastic , is n’t it ?
Shrink down to 20 % and scan at a high resolution .
The point in making it smaller is that a lot of the finer details are lost and the natural grit of the photocopier will be more pronounced .
Shrink it down to 20 % , then back up to 200 % of original .
That natural grit and finer lost detail mentioned before ?
It all becomes a lot more obvious when you blow it back up to 200 % .
Reverse with high - contrast
This is a fun one .
Turn the paper over so the back is against the glass of the copier , pump up the contrast and let her rip .
You ’ll get a very faint backwards copy , but it ’s gritty to hell and has a great texture to it , good for overlaying with a bad alignment .
Sticky tape
The thing about toner is that it does n’t sink into the paper — it stays on top , making it removable , which can be an awful lot of fun .
Get some weak masking tape , apply it to your type ( holding one end ) and pull it back from the paper — rip , rip , rip !
Pull up that toner and expose your letters to a little bit of character in a daze of creative energy .
Really , just go nuts .
If you can find a weak sticky tape that is transparent it ’s worth using that .
It allows you to put the tape back onto the paper and scan in the grit that it ’s pulled off , meaning the marks available will be uniform — what ’s missing from the letters is present in the background elsewhere .
Scrunch Up
Take your pieces of paper and scrunch it up into a small ball .
Unfold and photocopy with high - contrast .
The photocopying gets rid of the middle grays and makes breaks in the text look stronger .
Plus the photocopier will add and remove a little bit of its own texture too .
Or scrunch it up to a small ball , with the toner — your type — on the outside .
Now rub the corners and folds with exposed type on some concrete or use some sandpaper .
Any fine , gritty surface will do as long as it can scratch away the toner .
The top shot here is a scan of it folded out again and flattened , the second image is a photocopy and the third is a photocopy with the contrast pumped up .
Scratch
For this one , I rubbed the print up against the corner of some brick and scratched away the toner .
It ’s generally a good idea to go in the same reading direction as the text for most of it , but adding one or two vertical strokes can also create a bit of interest , just do n’t go overboard .
The first is a scan of that piece of paper and the others are photocopies of it , with varying degrees of contrast .
Harsh Fold
Fold the paper and make the creases very strong and firm by running your fingers over them tightly repeatedly .
Go for crazy angles and overlapping folds as they ’re not going to be very obvious .
The first image above is a straight copy of a fold and the other three are photocopies of various types .
I wo n’t go on and on , but you start to see my point , do n’t you ?
If you want beaten type , then beat the type .
The two major benefits of the above are ;
Not every instance of each letter looks the same .
And more importantly , each letter ’s crack and scratch follows onto the next naturally — the whole word is given character , not just each letter .
My favorite thing about all this is that you lose control — it is n’t wholly up to you what parts of what letter gets scratched or how much toner the tape will rip up .
The more you stay out of the way , the more unique the letters and character - rich your text will be .
Of course , the issue with all of the above is that you ’re type is n’t editable .
A bit of a problem .
So you ’ll need to be sure of your kerning and spelling before you start , or you can cheat .
( And how to cheat ?
Get a texture , place over / under your text and go nuts with the blending modes .
And that ’s all I ’ll say about that at the moment . )
Making it work with your layout .
Now that you have your type , you need it to work with your layout .
They key is to have it appear within the design .
An easy way to of doing this is to use the background grit and scratch and noise from the whole page your type is on , as well as your other attempts using the same method .
Photocopies are the best example .
If you ’ll look at the image below , you ’ll notice a fair bit of random marks on the sheet .
These are what you ’ll use to stitch it together .
Use these as your canvas .
Make up a Photoshop document with several layers of these , all on multiply / darken .
And again , losing control a little , do n’t move every little mark around .
Let it lie where it lands when you place / resize the layer to fit the canvas .
Use whatever little bits and pieces of texture you can find .
The reason it ’s a good idea to use the same textures made in the same way as your type was changed , is because of the similarities .
What your adding to the canvas and what was taken away from your type will reflect well upon one another — it helps marry the type to the page .
The above is three layers of our heading merged together , bring and removing elements from each .
Where ever you can , craft the text together when using more than one letter .
Do n’t just put them ontop of one another and make the blending mode multiply .
Look at each layer and figure out what it is about each you like .
Mask some bits off and make others more pronounced .
As you bring in photos and illustrations , ask yourself if the character of these new elements work with the character of your page and your text .
As mentioned earlier ; noisy , slightly desaturated or highly contrasted photos generally work best – you may need to gently manipulate a photo to work , but make sure that all the elements look good and work well with the overall design , not by themselves .
To be broken .
The is a guide , at best .
All of my suggestions can be broken to great effect .
But as it goes , to break the rules , you must know them .
If you really understand that and know where I ’m going from with all of this , then take what I say with a grain of salt .
If you do n’t , take it as gospel for the time being .
The real trick to using grunge fonts well is to have them be a part of the design .
Not an add on .
Nor a superficial underlying lust you have for whatever is stylistic at the time , but a true reason to have your whole design reflect the character of the copy — the goal and purpose of the project — which would be served well to use this grit .
If the copy , the images , and the reason behind the job reflect a gritty and grungey nature , then you ’re half way there .
A broken series of letters will work well .
It 's been quite awhile since I 've seen a right - wing meme as gobsmackingly stupid as the one John Stossel was promoting last week on Fox , notably on Glenn Beck 's Friday show .
At ABC , the headline read :
Now , if you go read the text , it is a somewhat thought - provoking piece suggesting that the way to save certain endangered species -- such as the tiger , which is a victim of poaching for its prized body parts -- is to begin farming them .
It 's worked with a handful of other species , such as the bison and the rhino .
But the headline -- and the meme that Stossel pushed on Fox -- was that the way to save endangered species is to farm and consume them .
Which is , perhaps , one of the most monumentally stupid ideas anyone 's ever proposed .
The logical outcome of Stossel 's argument is that ultimately we need to begin farming all the planet 's wild animals .
Of course , the vast majority of endangered species are inedible and not particularly desired by humans to begin with , so that leaves them out of the farming equation .
Moreover , human consumption of a number of species -- most notably sharks -- is primarily responsible for their endangerment in the first place .
Finally , what we know actually does work with endangered species is this :
We protect them from human predation and endangerment .
And we protect their required habitat .
In certain specialized cases , doing that may mean creating commercially protected spaces for them , such as with the bison and the rhino , in addition to their normal wild habitat .
But feeding a market for their body parts is always a bad idea .
This is hardly Stossel 's first venture into cockamamie science :
He 's a veteran global - warming denier too .
My friends the endangered killer whales , I think -- who of course no one wants to eat , much less farm -- might have an appropriate response to Stossel 's proposal to farm them too :

US President Barack Obama has said the US is a " full partner " with Mexico in its fight against the drug cartels .
Speaking in Mexico City , he said the US must stem the flow of guns across the border that is fuelling the bloodshed .
Following talks with his Mexican counterpart , Felipe Calderon , Mr Obama said he would push the US Senate to ratify a small arms trafficking treaty .
The two leaders also agreed on a new partnership to fight climate change and promote green energy production .
Hours before Mr Obama arrived , 15 gunmen and one soldier were killed in a shoot - out in southern Mexico , officials said .
Mexico 's defence department said soldiers on a drug patrol came under fire from gunmen in a vehicle in the remote , mountainous state of Guerrero .
Mr Obama again acknowledged America 's shared responsibility for the violence which has killed more than 6,000 people over the last year .
' New era '
Speaking at his welcoming ceremony , Mr Obama said the US needed to do more to help .
High hopes for Obama visit " At a time when the Mexican government has so courageously taken on the drug cartels that have plagued both sides of the borders , it is absolutely critical that the United States joins as a full partner in dealing with this issue , " Mr Obama said .
He said he preferred to focus on enforcing existing laws to keep US assault weapons out of Mexico , rather than trying to renew a US ban which expired in 1994 .
Backtracking on a campaign pledge to reinstate the ban , Mr Obama said that doing so would be politically difficult .
The Mexican leader hailed a " new era " where Mexico and the US faced challenges together .
Aside from combating the drug menace , Mr Calderon said the two leaders had agreed on a new framework on clean energy and climate change that set out a legal framework and bilateral market mechanisms for carbon emissions .
He said proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would also be discussed .
Regional summit Mexico is Mr Obama 's only stop on the way to the Summit of the Americas , being held in Trinidad and Tobago .
For most Mexicans , the main concern is reviving the economy , says the BBC's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City .
Mexico sends 80 % of its exports to the US and millions of Mexican families rely on remittances from relatives working north of the border , our correspondent says .
Relations between the US and Mexico hit a low point earlier this year when a US military report said drugs - related violence was in danger of turning Mexico into a failed state .
Over the past two years , some 8,000 people have been killed as gangs battle for control of the lucrative drug trafficking routes into the US .
But President Obama 's administration has since expressed solidarity with Mr Calderon who has sent hundreds of troops to regain control of the worst - affected areas .
During a visit to Mexico City in March , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the US shared responsibility for the drugs problem .
She said America's " insatiable demand " for illegal drugs fuelled the trade and that the US had an " inability " to stop weapons from being smuggled south .
Mr Obama has sent hundreds of federal agents along with high - tech surveillance equipment and drug - sniffer dogs to help Mexico fight the cartels .
On Wednesday , the US placed three Mexican organisations on its list of suspected drug syndicates and Mr Obama also charged a senior official with stopping drugs - related violence crossing from Mexico into the US .

Our social calendar at OTB is positively brimming .
We have all sorts of cultural and religious events that we like to pay tribute to , in our own special way ( fans of our Valentine ’s Day , Paddy ’s Day and Easter Tributes will know what I mean ) .
Today , we honour the humble bee - keeper on National Honey Week .
We know that , after years of harvesting , being forced to wear those hideous suits and getting pricked more times than a pin cushion ( steady on , we mean by the bees ! ) these are the “ real men of genius ” that those Yankee Budweiser ad ’s harped on about .
And in similar honour of ‘ Tenuous Link ’ month , we ’ve decided to celebrate their hard work by rewarding them ( and you ) with our own shortlist of Honeys .
Smokin’ Hot Honeys , that is .
So , without further ado here are OTB ’s Top Ten Sexiest Movie Strippers …
10 . ELIZABETH BERKLEY – SHOWGIRLS
From Saved By The Bell toI bet poor , pube - headed , Elizabeth Berkley did n’t see that one coming .
Still for epic , gratuitous , full - frontal nudity Showgirls is every fifteen - year - old boy ’s dream .
After getting universally obliterated by the critics in 1995 , receiving the “ turkey ” status that has since been matched only by J. Lo and Ben Affleck ’s Gigli ; cult fans ( including Quentin Tarantino and the aforementioned fifteen - year - old boys ) have championed Showgirls as a lesson in irony .
Entertainment Weekly rating it at number 36 in their Top 50 Cult Movies and post - feminist types regularly indulge in Showgirls parties where they mock the film for it ’s diabolical acting and script that might have been better off as toilet paper .
For us at OTB , that scene with Kyle Maclachlan ( Charlotte ’s impotent first hubby in Sex and The City ) will forever hold a special place in our hearts , though probably for all the wrong reasons .
9. PAMELA ANDERSON – BARB WIRE
You can only imagine the advert that went out for the runner on this movie .
WANTED :
Sturdy male needed to help film crew with odd jobs ( Eunuch preferred due to the high risk of occupational hazards / severe , repetitive trouser damage ) .
Duties include : spraying a famous blonde Baywatch bombshell with water ( and only water ) , ducking when the aforementioned bombshell throws her razor sharp stiletto , avoiding use of the word “ babe ” .
The Pamela Anderson / Love Swing package should come with one of those warnings that they have at Thorpe Park .
“ YOU WILL GET WET ! …. and may possibly get poked in the eye with a nipple …
ENJOY ! ”
8.LINDSAY LOHAN – I KNOW WHO KILLED ME
7. DEMI MOORE – STRIPTEASE
Li-Lo has come a long way since bounding into our lives as the cute , freckly , ginger paragon of innocence in the Parent Trap .
Since then she ’s been through a lot , what with fending off rumours surrounding her weight , her dad and her relationships .
So what better way to cast aside all the ups and downs of the past than with a bloody good strip scene ?
Sadly , it seems that the Holy Stripper Gods were not on her side .
In a scene so dark you could be forgiven for thinking she might be scraping away at a coal face , she crawls to the front of the stage , plucks a cigarette from some unlucky punters fingers and , although I could n’t make out what she did with it , when he gets it back he sniffs it like a hound on a fox hunt .
There ’s no denying it , Demi Moore is so stunning she makes Madonna look like a mutant cyborg .
I bet Ashton Kutcher wakes up every morning thinking he ’s died and gone to heaven .
Then again , he does have to host Punk ’d ; so it ’s swings and roundabouts .
That said , Striptease was not Demi ’s finest hour .
Despite aptly displaying her stunning figure , I have several issues with this movie .
First off , the strip club that Moore ’s character , Erin , works at is called the “ Eager Beaver ” .
Now , maybe I ’m jumping to conclusions , but stereotypes dictate that a club so - named is sure to be full of toothless hags with boobs that scrape dust from the floor better than your average mop and muffs like molehills .
The phrase “ fur burger ” also springs to mind .
Secondly , where the hell do they even sell feather boa ’s that long ?
Still ten out of ten for effort .
6.JAMIE LEE CURTIS – TRUE LIES
In Halloween Jamie Lee Curtis ’ character Laurie Strode harnesses her innate virgin power to fend off Michael Myers ’ psychotic advances , finally triumphing in a victory for purity and goodness of evil .
A few years later and a bit more worldly wise , 35 - year - old Lee Curtis is not so fortunate when having to deal with a perving , sweaty Arnie who clearly ‘ just likes to watch ’ .
Arnie ’s Harry Tasker is an agent so secret that even his wife does n’t know .
What he does n’t know , however , is that he ’s been missing out on some really good lap dances all these years from his secretly smokin’ wife .
5. KIM BASINGER – 9 ½ WEEKS
4.JESSICA ALBA – SIN CITY
Modern day try - too - hard starlets could learn a thing or two from Old Lady Basinger .
It ’s hard to believe it ’s been over twenty years since Mickey Rourke , yet she still looks the model of effervescent beauty .
And therein lies her charm ; at first glance Basinger looks like butter would n’t melt on her midriff , yet one flick of her tousled blonde locks and it ’s Hello Sex Kitty .
3.MARISA TOMEI – THE WRESTLER
Walking in to Kadie ’s bar , Willis ’ character Hartigan muses , “ A dead end ; Nancy would n’t have anything to do with a pack of drunks and losers like this . ”
Guess again sonny - Jim .
Not only has skinny little Nancy Callaghan , grown up and filled out , but she ’s gyrating on the stage like a thrupenny ho .
Alba won over 90 per cent of the male population with this dance routine involving a lasso and a pair of leather chaps –
Surely the profile of the best stripper reads as follows : -
– Huge fan of Eighties hair metal
– Eclectic wardrobe choices ( Note Cassidy ’s top / string vest that gives ample all - angles viewing of both nipple rings .
Cha-ching !)
– Olympic - standard gymnastic abilities ( Putting both legs behind your head may look weird , but flexibility comes at a premium )
– Hard - on - inducing stage name
Lady Gaga , Diablo Cody and Marisa Tomei all comply with the above list .
Coincidence ?
I think not .
2.NATALIE PORTMAN – CLOSER
Ahh Natalie , the thinking person ’s piece of ass .
Not only is she a gorgeous and talented actress , but she also has a Psychology degree from Harvard , and boasts a short - lived , yet hardcore rap career courtesy of Saturday Night Live As Alice / Jane in Closer , Portman ’s spot - on , aloof mystery is entrancing .
She ridiculesto the point of tears , which only serves to make me love her even more .
With her baby pink wig and beaded tassle - top Portman is the definition of the word “ siren ” , not to mention the references to the ambrosia - like tasty treat in her pants .
Even weepy Clive Owen can’t ruin this clip for me .
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-eat .
1.SALMA HAYEK – FROM DUSK TIL DAWN
Not since the Garden of Eden has a snake seemed so seductive , than when draped around Salma Hayek ’s neck during a dance routine that brings the normally boisterous Titty Twister to a complete standstill in Tarantino ’s From Dusk Till Dawn .
Displaying , Hayek charms her prey before the slaughter begins .
Could it be mere coincidence that Hayek ’s character heads straight for writer Tarantino ’s character and enacts every man ’s fantasy : a lap dance involving beer ?
Surely he could n’t have abused his privileges as writer and included that scene for his own gratification ?
Surely he ’s more professional … of course he did .

Before Pluto was discovered , the world ’s astronomers were captivated by the possibility of finding another massive planet beyond the orbit of Neptune .
In 1930 , Pluto was discovered lurking in what was considered to be the edge of the Solar System .
However , it quickly became apparent that Pluto was tiny ; it was n’t the Planet X we were looking for .
For the last 80 years , astronomers have been looking for a large planet that might go to some way of explaining interplanetary features such as the “ Kuiper Cliff ” , but Planet X has not been found .
Unfortunately , the word “ Planet X ” has now become synonymous with conspiracy theories and doomsday , almost as notorious as the word “ Nemesis ” .
Nemesis is another unanswered question hanging over Solar System evolution : does the Sun have a binary twin ?
Is there a second , dim , hidden “ sun ” stalking it ’s brighter counterpart from over a light year away ?
Some scientists have come forward to suggest that the existence of a hypothetical second sun — embodied as a brown dwarf or red dwarf — could explain some cyclical effects here on Earth ( i.e. mass extinctions occurring with a strange regularity ) .
Naturally , the discussion about Nemesis ( like the discussion about the possibility of a massive Planet X ) is purely academic , and only based on indirect observations and anecdotal evidence .
Just because they might exist , does n’t mean they do .
In a publication recently published to the arXiv database , one Italian researcher has dusted off this topic and asked a very basic question :
Can we constrain the possible locations of Nemesis and / or Planet X if they did exist ?
His results are fascinating …
It ’s nice to find a scientific publication about the possible existence of an unaccounted - for planet in the Solar System .
The majority of articles I ’ve written in the past 12 months have been examining the pseudo - science , fear , lies and nonsense surrounding the year 2012 , of which “ Planet X ” seems to have a huge role to play .
For some strange reason , certain unscrupulous authors have pinned every conceivable global doomsday event on a mythical planet that will be arriving at the inner Solar System on December 21st , 2012 .
Of course , this is total bunkum and the fear surrounding the name “ Planet X ” is completely unfounded .
In fact , Planet X was originally the search for a massive planet beyond the orbit of Neptune , in the pre-Pluto era ( some might say that we are now living in a “ post - Pluto era ” after the dwarf planet ’s demotion … just a thought ) .
Planet X is in fact the exciting astronomical journey the world took in the early 20th Century , culminating in the discovery of Pluto .
Searching for Planet X
Since Percival Lowell ’s suggestion that there might be another planet out there perturbing the orbit of Neptune , the hunt for another planet was intense .
The discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell ’s theory .
However , by the 1970 ’s , it was found that Pluto was too small to account for any perturbations in any planet ’s orbit , let alone the gas giant Neptune .
However , as time went on and techniques became more advanced , the possible perturbations in Neptune ’s orbit were put down to observational error .
There was no longer any need for a Planet X , a hypothetical planetary body was no longer required to account for orbital perturbations .
However , observations of the Kuiper Belt have reinvigorated the hunt for a Planet X ( the “ X ” literally means “ unknown ” ) .
The Kuiper Belt is a region of space ( in Pluto ’s neighbourhood ) where lots of icy , rocky bodies have been observed .
As we have become rather good at observing small objects on our own doorstep ( we ’ve actually become rather good at observing objects in other star systems too ) , we have been able to plot the distribution of Kuiper Belt Objects ( KBOs ) .
It is in this distribution that a feature has been observed .
At approximately 50 AU there is a sudden drop in KBO population .
This has become known as the Kuiper Cliff and it possibly reveals that there is some significantly - sized planetary body ( bigger than Pluto , but smaller than Earth ) orbiting at a distance of 100 AU from the Sun .
We have yet to discover anything that big shepherding the Kuiper Belt , but the Cliff is real , beyond 55 AU .
Other researchers have indicated that there may be a small planet orbiting at 60 AU ( possibly explaining the behaviour of trans - Neptunian Objects , TNOs ) , or a massive planet ( 50 % larger than Jupiter ) patrolling a region of space over 1000 AU distant .
However , there is still no strong evidence to support these theories , and there are certainly no observations of these possibilities .
The Sun ’s Evil Twin ?
So , we have some possible indirect observations of a Planet X out there , but what about the hypothetical Nemesis , the much feared “ evil sun ” that stalks our Solar System from afar ?
In fact , it seems surprising that not more attention has been paid to Nemesis by conspiracy theorists and doomsayers .
Planet X ( a.k.a. Nibiru from the misunderstood Sumerian text ) , in comparison , seems like a petty concern when we are talking about a “ second sun ” that could be responsible for extinguishing life on Earth with alarming frequency .
Although there is no direct evidence for the existence of Nemesis , some scientists have investigated this possibility .
For a start , most stars observed in the galaxy are not single stars , they have a binary partner ( often more ) .
The Sun , as far as we know , is alone , there has never been any observation that our star has a binary partner .
However , there are some indications that might point to the possibility of a faint , lightweight stellar companion that has remained secret till now .
Key to this argument is the statistical regularity of mass extinctions on Earth , and its relationship with Oort Cloud objects .
Every 25 million years or so ( over the last 250 million years ) , there appears to be some kind of extinction event on Earth .
Could it be that a stellar partner , called Nemesis , passes closer to the Sun during its orbit , disturbing objects in the Oort cloud ?
If this is the case , there may be a mechanism for the regularity of comet impacts on Earth , thus causing the statistical regularity of extinctions .
Once again , this is a hypothetical argument , but it is based on good science and historical evidence .
If these extinction events are related to comet impacts after the comets have been kicked out of the Oort cloud by a binary brown dwarf or red dwarf , this suggests a binary orbital period of approximately 25 million years .
Where Are They ?
For argument ’s sake , let ’s say Planet X and Nemesis could be out there .
If so , how far away from the Sun could they orbit ?
Lorenzo Iorio from the National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Pisa , Italy , has investigated this question , using data derived from the dynamics of inner Solar System planets .
In particular , Iorio has computed the Newtonian / Einsteinian perihelion precession of planets within 1.5 AU of the Sun that could be caused by a massive , unknown , distant body .
From his computations , it is assumed that no matter where the inner planets are located in their orbits , the gravitational force felt by the planets will be constant .
Therefore , if there is a massive body out there ( either Planet X or Nemesis ) , what is the minimum possible orbital distance allowed by the computed precession of the inner Solar System planets ?
Iorio concludes that the minimum possible distances at which a Mars- mass , Earth - mass , Jupiter - mass and Sun-mass object can orbit around the Sun are 62 AU , 430 AU , 886 AU and 8995 AU respectively .
To put these distances in perspective , the minimum possible distance a Mars - mass Planet X could orbit is over two times further away from the Sun than Pluto ’s 39 AU ( average ) distance from the Sun .
If we consider the minimum possible orbit for a brown dwarf - mass object ( often cited as a possible “ failed star ” candidate for Nemesis ) , with a mass of 75 - 80 Jupiters , its minimum orbital distance would be approximately 0.06 light years away ( or 3,736-3,817 AU ) .
A red dwarf ( 0.075 -0.5 solar masses ) would have a minimum orbital distance of 0.06 - 0.11 light years away ( 3,793 - 7,139 AU ) .
In Conclusion
Iorio has basically set the constraints on the closest possible orbital radii for unknown planets and small stellar objects as yet to be discovered in our Solar System .
If they were any closer , their gravitational presence would be felt , and we ’d easily be able to detect perturbations in the dynamics of the inner planets .
If Nemesis ( the Sun ’s binary partner ) is out there , it is n’t any closer than ~ 3,800 AU ( if it ’s a large brown dwarf , or a small red dwarf ) .
Therefore , it seems unlikely that Nemesis will have a very stable orbit as it would be affected by the gravity of other stars in different systems .
From this evidence alone , Nemesis will remain a myth .
In light of the updated paper , the minimum distance for a Nemesis candidate has reduced , and could therefore have a stable binary orbit with the Sun .
However , something this large will have been observed by now .
According to a paper by David Jewitt , at the Institute for Astronomy , University of Hawaii , a Jupiter - sized planet could be detected up to a distance of 2140 AU ( the minimum distance that a Jupiter - mass planet could exist is ~ 886 AU according to Iorio ) .
To put this into perspective , a Pluto - sized planetary body can be detected up to a distance of 320 AU according to Jewitt , so it would appear there is nothing of significant mass out there up to 320 AU away ( if you can call Pluto ’s mass “ significant ” that is ! ) .
( A special thank you to Ricardo De Castro for providing this additional information . )
Therefore , there is little chance that Planet X does exist , Iorio ’s data suggests that the minimum distance a Mars - mass object can orbit is 62 AU ( twice the distance of Pluto ’s orbit ) , but Jewitt ’s data suggests that if something the size of Mars was orbiting the Sun at a distance of 62 AU , it would have been discovered by now .
According to Jewitt , a Pluto - sized object is detectable up to a distance of 320 AU .
Mars is far bigger than Pluto , meaning anything the size of Mars would have made its presence very obvious by now .
A tiny Planet X within 320 AU is very hard to imagine , and anything bigger could be seen coming from a vast distance ( a couple of thousand AU ) .
If Planet X is improbable , the larger Nemesis seems even more so .
To cut a long story short , it looks like we have discovered all the large planets ( of Mars mass and above ) and anything else probably will have very little influence on inner Solar System dynamics for millennia for millions of years to come .

標準Cライブラリがフォーク!?
Debianがglibcの派生版「eglibc」を採用へ
Debian GNU / Linuxで、C言語の標準ライブラリである「 GNU C Library」（glibc）が、その派生版である「 Embedded GLIBC 」（eglibc）に置き換わる可能性が出てきた。現在はまだDebianの開発版に入る前という段階だが、もし実現すれば、Debian系のディストリビューションであるUbuntuやKnoppix、Xandrosでも置き換わる可能性が高い。本家ともいえるFree Software FoundationのGNU版のライブラリをさしおいて、派生版がDebianに入る可能性が高まったことで、ちょっとした波紋が広がっている。eglibcプロジェクトではglibcとの高い互換性を目標に掲げているものの、glibcは、Linux上のサーバソフトウェアを含む多くのアプリケーションが依存しているライブラリだけに、今後の影響範囲が見えづらい。
Debianプロジェクトの開発メンバーで、Debian Franceのボードメンバーでもあるオレリアン・ジャルノ（Aurelien
JARNO）氏が5月5日のブログエントリで明らかにした。
eglibcはglibcを置き換える意図で始められたプロジェクトではなく、公式サイトのFAQでも「フォークするつもりはないと」述べられている。eglibcはglibcと最大限のAPI、ABI互換性を保ちながらリリースされる補完的なソフトウェアパッケージで、glibcの対応が後手に回りがちな組み込み向けのニーズに対応したライブラリだという。ジャルノ氏は、eglibcの特徴として、
ARM など組み込み向けのサポート強化
bash以外のシェルのサポート。glibcはbashしかサポートせず、組み込みで使われるBusyBoxで問題が起こっても対応してくれない
バイナリサイズを小さくすることを優先した「- Os」オプションを使ったビルドをサポート
ビルド時に不要なコンポーネントを指定可能
などを挙げている 。ARM向けに最適なアセンブリコードを生成したり、ARMプラットフォーム固有のバグを修正するといったことをglibcでは熱心に進めてこなかったことから、そうしたパッチをニーズに応じて適用したのがeglibcと言えそうだ。
なぜ、パッチを本家のglibcに適用しないのか？ これは、特定のglibc開発メンバーのコミュニケーション作法を巡る問題のようだ。
ジャルノ氏は、glibcプロジェクトの開発コミュニティに対して批判的で、ブログエントリの中で実例として過去にリジェクトされたバグ修正要求をいくつかリンクしている。例えば、ARM9上で発現したバグ報告に対して、glibc開発者の1人で米レッドハットに勤務するウルリッヒ・ドレッパー（Ulrich Drepper）氏は、「このクソなアーキテクチャ以外ではちゃんと動いてるよ。ARMのためだけにパフォーマンスを犠牲にするなんてことはしない」と、組み込み系の開発者にとっては信じられないような、にべもない反応をしている。ドレッパー氏は口さがないことでは知られた人のようで、文字列の中身をランダムに入れ替えるというマイナーな関数に関するバグ報告に対しては、「この関数はジョークなんだよ。何かほかにマシなことやれば？」と、これもまた信じられないような冷たい切り返しで切り捨てている。
最も議論を呼んだホストネームとIPアドレスの名前解決をする関数についてのバグ報告では、2007年の夏から現在にいたるまで延々と2年近くにわたってコメントツリーが伸びている。この間、同じバグ報告が繰り返され、そのたびにドレッパー氏は「バグなんてない」、「このバグ報告を再オープンするのはやめろ」と反論。説明を求めた人に対しては、自分に給料を払ってるわけでもないのに命令するなと言い放っている。
こうしたドレッパー氏の不遜な応対に対して賛否両論が聞こえてくる（Slashdotのスレッド、OSNewsのコメントスレッド、LWN.netのコメントスレッド）。目を引くのは、ドレッパー氏は口は悪いが技術力はきわめて高いとする意見が多いこと。また、glibcがサポートする多くのプラットフォームのバランスを考えると、ドレッパー氏が技術的に正論を述べていることが多いとする意見などだ。
また、パッチの受け入れ方として、文句を言いながらもとにかく適用だけはすることがあるという指摘もある。jordanbを名乗るユーザーは、LWN.netのコメント欄で、GNU/Emacsの開発者だったリチャード・M・ストールマン氏との過去のやり取りを披露。Emacsで動くテトリスにあった、ズルができるバグのパッチを送ったところ、ストールマン氏は「ソリティアでズルをするって、いったい誰に対してのズルなんだ？」と返信しつつ、ともかくパッチは適用したという。ドレッパー氏も悪態をつきながらもパッチ適用や修正は必要ならやることがあるという。
結局のところ、プロジェクト名の違いが示すようにglibcからeglibcが派生して今後フォークしていく可能性すら出てきているのは、ARMプラットフォーム対応への取り組みに不満を持っていた人々の活動が認められ、より広く使われるDebian GNU / Linuxでの採用という話が持ち上がってきたということだろう。また、glibcのコア開発メンバーのコミュニケーション作法には問題があったのだという意見は強く、eglibcは技術的な派生物であるばかりでなく、プロジェクト運営という面からも、glibc開発コミュニティに対するアンチテーゼという側面も含んでいるといえそうだ。eglibcのミッション定義には、開発者の間で協力やコミュニケーション、礼儀正しさ、敬意といったものを促すようにと書かれている。これは、当てこすりとまでは言わないまでも、glibc開発コミュニティに対するメッセージでもあるかもしれない。

More weasel words from Home Secretary Jacqui Smith about the harassment of innocent photographers :
20 Apr 2009 : Column 27
Andrew Miller ( Ellesmere Port and Neston ) ( Lab ) : Can I seek an assurance from my right hon .
Friend that the circumstances that led to the photographs being taken in Downing street do not lead to further pressures on the rights of photographers , both professionals and amateurs , to take photographs in this country , especially as this event coincided with an incident in the past few days where somebody was allegedly challenged by a police officer for taking photographs of a bus garage ?
We need to learn lessons from the event and draw together the common - sense work being led by my hon .
Friend the Minister for Security , Counter - Terrorism , Crime and Policing to come up with the right code of practice to ensure that photographers can do their jobs and amateurs can take photographs with freedom .
Jacqui Smith : I strongly agree with my hon .
Friend , who has met the Minister for Security , Counter - Terrorism , Crime and Policing to discuss his concerns .
I see no reason why the unfortunate events on 8 April should limit the ability of photographers to take photographs , and neither do I believe , as he knows , that some of the
20 Apr 2009 : Column 28
limits result from recent legislative changes that we have made , as has been suggested .
There is more work that we can do to ensure that photographers are clear that their right to take photographs is protected in all cases where it is not causing a specific risk .
That is certainly a right that my hon .
Friend and I would uphold .
Burger King has assaulted our brains with creepy - weird ads for years now , but this is the weirdest .
A woman dressed as a BK - themed " Kingon " does a " dance of seduction " to steal your Star Trek glass .

I actually do n't know where to begin with these weird Burger King ads .
Apparently there are creatures called " Kingons , " not to be confused with " Klingons , " and Burger King 's infamously scary - looking mascot is one of them .
And because Burger King 's Star Trek glasses contain dilithium crystals ( is that safe for drinking ? ) the " Kingons " are determined to steal them from you .
But apart from the " dance of seduction , " the Kingons mostly use weird playground bullying tactics to steal your glass , such as wedgies and nipple attacks .
Yes , really .
A " Kingon " is going to attack your nipples .
There 's a whole website , the Kingon Defense Academy , devoted to protecting you from these insidious attacks .
Actually , though , the Trek glasses are pretty nice .
Here are some images of them .

A New Zip For Nanoribbons
New methods peel open carbon nanotubes lengthwise to give strips of graphene
TWO TEAMS of researchers working independently report in Nature a new strategy for forming graphene nanoribbons : by longitudinally " unzipping " carbon nanotubes ( 2009 , 458 , 872 and 877 ) .
Compared with other procedures for preparing graphene nanoribbons , which are narrow and elongated one - atom - thick strips of carbon , the new routes are simpler , less expensive , and potentially better suited to making bulk quantities of the material .
James Tour / Rice U BROKEN ZIPPER
Graphene nanoribbons can be formed by a new chemical method that effectively unzips carbon nanotubes lengthwise .
Hongjie Dai / Stanford U A-PEELING METHOD
Graphene layers that make up multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( from outer layer , red , yellow , and blue ) can be unzipped and peeled away successively by controlling the time the tubes are exposed to an argon plasma .
A host of recent studies have shown that sheets of graphene are endowed with properties that may make the material useful for future nanoscale electronic devices ( C&EN , March 2 , page 14 ) .
Graphene nanoribbons may be especially useful because in ribbon form , the material 's electronic classification — metallic or semiconductor — is tied to its width and the smoothness of its edges .
For that reason , researchers are developing simple ways of producing large quantities of graphene nanoribbons with controlled properties .
In the present studies , both teams unzip or cut the nanotubes along their axes to convert the elongated cylinders into flat strips .
But the groups differ in the way they unzip the tubes .
Rice University chemists Dmitry V. Kosynkin , Amanda L. Higginbotham , James M. Tour , and coworkers treat the nanotubes with sulfuric acid and potassium permanganate .
The process unzips multiwalled and single - walled tubes chemically and forms ribbons measuring up to a few micrometers in length and a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers in width .
The researchers follow the oxidizing procedure with chemical reduction to restore the material 's electrical conductivity .
The other team , which includes Stanford University chemists Liying Jiao , Li Zhang , Hongjie Dai , and coworkers , partially embeds the nanotubes in a polymer film to hold them in place and then etches them with an argon plasma .
They remove the film with solvent vapor and heat .
This process also unzips multiwalled and single - walled nanotubes and yields graphene ribbons 10 – 20 nm wide .
At this early stage in the methods ' development , the Rice group notes that their technique works well when applied to multiwalled nanotubes and tubes with multiple surface defects , as produced , for example , by chemical vapor deposition .
Unzipping single - walled tubes , however , leads to narrow but entangled ribbons , they say .
The group is now finding ways to untangle the products .
The Stanford technique is especially useful for unzipping narrow and highly crystalline tubes .
In an accompanying commentary in Nature , Mauricio Terrones of the Institute for Scientific & Technological Research , in San Luis Potosi , Mexico , remarks that the studies " break new ground in bulk fabrication of nanoribbons . "
He adds , however , that more work is still needed to learn how to control the widths and edge patterns — and hence the electronic properties — of these flattened and unzipped tubes .
A Story of Engagement
I usually wake up with fiction stories in my head .
I ’ve kept writing fiction in the last month , but the stories in my head lately have mostly been blogs .
Here ’s the futurist take on it :
Earth has become a computer connected world .
I ’m a science fiction writer – so a bigger percentage of my readers are online than some other genres might be .
The raw population of the world is bigger than it ever has been ( and has grown by around 30 % in the last twenty years ) .
The broadband connected population is growing .
Younger generations know how to use the web to market and to decide what to buy ; they were born with keyboards and monitors and ipods and cell phones .
Marketing of everything from underwear to toothpaste to cars has gone viral and online .
Physical means of delivering information ( newspapers and bookstores ) are dying .
I do n’t like it , but I ca n’t change it .
I had foolishly hoped the old ways might support me anyway .
You know , that past world where writers write , agents sell , publishers publish and market .
Yes , everyone still does do their job .
I still depend on my capable agent and editor and publisher .
But I have to do more than write , since there are a lot of equally capable writers ( and better and further along writers ) out there who are also marketing effectively .
John Scalzi .
Jay Lake .
Cory Doctorow .
Neil Gaiman .
Tobias Buckell .
Mary Robinette - Kowal .
Elizabeth Bear .
If I want to sell my fiction , I have to do more than just write it .
I have to market myself and my work .
I ’ll admit I do like attention , but I ’m not the natural self - promoter that , for example , Jay Lake is .
On a personal level , I got a shock that made this into a mission for me – an expected easy sale did n’t materialize .
I sat back and had a little cry ( well , all right , maybe a big one ) and went WTF ?
and thought about it over a cup of coffee .
Then I emailed some friends , including Jay Lake , and went “ Help ! ” Jay connected me to the able Jeremy Tolbert , who I hired for some advice ( and he did a very nice job ) .
I contacted Shaun Farrell , and he agreed to let me do some guest blogs ( and by the way , if you comment there , you may win a free book .
I ’ve already given one away ) .
I was going to do a video for my public speaking career anyway , and paid extra for an interview about my books .
I ’m working with the fellow who did the video , Tim Reha , to plan more videos ( and get better at them .
I learned a LOT from video number 1 – video number 2 will be better .
I know how to talk – even on camera – so that was fine , but I came off looking a bit like a middle - aged business person instead of a cool writer , and spent way too much time head - nodding ) .
So what exactly am I doing ?
I use my Twitter account a lot .
A lot more than I thought I would , actually .
I use Facebook
I ’m trying to get more guest blogs set up .
For example , my writer ’s group is all pro writers and we ’re going to guest each other ’s blogs .
I ’ve had the videos made through my work at Futurist.com ( three – two futurist videos , one of which mentions my books , and one just about the books )
I ’m getting better at categorizing and tagging posts
I ’m learning these tools .
That ’s not as small a job as it sounds like .
I ’m spending a lot of time talking to people ( on line and face to face )
I improved my website from a social networking viewpoint
I ’m blogging about twice as often
We have a loosely linked personal interest site shared by me , Toni , and three dogs called threedogsblog .
I ’m part of a shared futurist twitter feed .
My goals ?
Make that sale materialize .
Other sales , too .
Do n’t worry , I wo n’t leave all my eggs in one basket .
But I ’m stubborn and I want the one that want .
Get good ( and efficient ) at this – I ’m still spending way too much time .
I do n’t have time .
Become an expert .
This will be useful in my day job anyway .
Stay authentic – some suggestions have been too “ markety ” and feel about as friendly as the new Facebook design .
I do n’t want to do that .
I want to actually connect .
So here is a set of random comments about what I ’ve learned and done so far .
This is complex .
Link things as much as you can .
For example , if I Twitter , it shows up on FaceBook .
Friends helped me with that , too .
I have lost writing time .
I have to be careful with that balance .
Writer ’s write .
The sound of valuable time draining away is the most insidious part of social networking .
Some of this is free .
Some of it is n’t .
I ’ve spent money to save research time – that ’s a good trade for me .
But if I had more time than money , I could learn this stuff .
People are helpful .
If you ask someone how they did something , they ’ll probably share .
I have had some new people comment .
I ’ve had more comments .
Nothing like the major blogs .
Drop by and look at Scalzi ’s Whatever to see a real following .
But mine ’s growing , and just like your books do n’t start out on the lists unless you ’ve been there before , electronic readership builds .
I ’m still seeing more comments from my friends in the writer community than the reader community , but that ’s okay .
I like my friends , and the other circle is growing , too .
Since I ’ve asked for advice and gained help along the way ( free and fee - based ) I feel like I have a cheering team in this effort .
That actually matters .
I have no idea yet if what I ’m doing translates to the physical book sales I want .
The two industries – internet word - of - mouth marketing and social conversations , and the New - York based book industry – are at opposite side of the time continuum .
One changes moment by moment , the other is slow and often misleading ( because of the returns - based book model , and because authors , and I suspect others , ca n’t seem to get information in a timely way )
New York is learning , too .
Torforgeauthors and I follow each other .
There is also a torbooks out there .
I suspect the difference is the editing and publicity arms of the house , but I actually do n’t know .
Maybe it ’s
Tor ’s official tweets and all of our authorial wisdon in tweet form .
Good for them , anyway .
And drop by Tor.com for some of the best online fiction .
What about you ?
What web 2.0 stories are you waking up with ?
What ideas do you have ?
April 28 , 2009 A German mechanical engineer has designed a tree harvester that weighs just over a tenth of conventional vehicles used to fell trees , which causes less damage to forest floor .
Industrial tree harvesting vehicles can weigh up to 55 tons .
In comparison , the “ Striding Harvester ” weighs only 7.5 tons .
The concept harvester by mechanical engineer and industrial designer Christian Knobloch works by using a small footprint selectively pushing down on the soil as it moves .
Through this approach the soil is allowed to recover much faster than if conventional heavy forest equipment was employed .
The Striding Harvester can take 8 - meter steps and functions on marshy ground and on inclines of up to 36 percent .
It can also step over ditches and other obstacles up to 4.5 meters in width .
According to the designer the harvester offers a far more forest - friendly solution than conventional tree harvesting and a faster , greener solution to forest regeneration .
As part of his diploma thesis , Knobloch chose to look at a radical change in the way tree harvesters moved rather than try to improve on the existing techniques of conventional harvesters .
He used " constructional - geometrical optimization methods " to come up with the large stepping movement motion of the harvester .
He argued that his harvester could reach trees up to 10 meters away and create a working area of 480 square meters .
And even though the machine is relatively light , the large base created by the widely spread cantilevered feet enables the crane arm to lift weights far heavier than it .
The telescopic crane arm and cabin of the harvester sit on a bridge with three cantilevered feet on each end that allows the harvester to adapt to the ground surface , says Knobloch .
Once a step is taken , a new direction can be chosen and the bridge moves accordingly .
As the weight bears down on one of the two legs or bases , the unloaded base can pivot and move .
Knobloch , in collaboration with Professor Jörn Erler , has also developed a simple , inexpensive way to transport felled trees , without damaging the soil .
Christian Knobloch was presented with the Rudi Högner Advancement Award for Industrial Design for his diploma thesis at the third Industrial Design symposium earlier this month .

Noriko Calderon and her parents fought - and lost - a long legal battle
A teenager in Japan whose parents are being deported to the Philippines has decided to stay in Tokyo with her aunt .
After the family lost a three - year battle to remain in Japan , Noriko Calderon , 13 , had to choose whether to stay in Japan or go with her parents .
She said an emotional goodbye to them at Tokyo's main airport .
Filipinos Arlan and Sarah Calderon used fake passports to enter Japan in the early 1990s , and their daughter was born and raised in the country .
Immigration officials arrested Mrs Calderon in 2006 , and since then the family has been fighting to stay together .
Emotional decision
The Calderons fought a three - year legal battle to remain in Japan , saying that Arlan had a stable job there and their daughter only spoke Japanese .
But the family lost their case in the High Court in February , and Noriko was then faced with a difficult choice .
" Japan is my homeland , " Noriko told CNN when asked why she decided to stay behind when her parents were deported .
Her parents say her life will be better in Japan than the poor farming community where they will be living in the Philippines .
But Arlan Calderon told CNN : " We wo n't be there when she needs us the most ...
She has to protect herself on her own .
I 'm sorry about that . "
Activists claim that Japan 's rigid immigration laws violate human rights .
Under Japanese law , the Calderons will not be allowed back into the country for five years .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Alan Mulally is in my face - again .
In fact , he has barely left it for the past two hours .
He has taken me through the thick loose - leaf binder he assembled for my interview and shown me another five binders filled with interviews he did upon taking the CEO job at Ford , along with research material and personal notes .
He has given me his opinion on all the stories I 've written about Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) since he took over and , for good measure , the stories I wrote about Boeing back when he worked there .
The man is relentless and demands all my attention .
He wo n't let up until he has turned all my " nos " and " maybes " into " yeses . "
Call it the Mulally method : this good - natured but relentless insistence on following what he has determined to be the correct course of action .
My immersion is taking place around a conference table in his office on the 12th floor of Ford Motor Co. 's world headquarters in Dearborn , Mich .
Mulally is sitting so close , he could be in my lap .
The office decoration is sparse , but Mulally likes the 180 - degree view ; Ford 's historic River Rouge complex is visible on the horizon , and he says he can keep an eye on General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler from here too .
Not that Mulally has much time for window gazing .
He 's on a crusade to save Ford Motor .
Now he 's showing me the corporate mission statement he wrote and had printed on plastic cards and distributed to employees .
And here is the hand - drawn diagram he 's created just for me ( with my name in a cloudburst ! ) to explain what it all means .
In case I had n't noticed , Mulally says , " I went to a lot of work for this . "
Trust me , Alan , I noticed .
All this attention is wearing me out - but not Mulally .
In the midst of history 's second - worst auto depression , Mulally seems to be ... enjoying himself ?
This is a man who lives less than three miles from his office , arrives there each morning at 5:15 a.m. for a 12 - hour workday , and does so with smile .
At 63 , he still gets enthusiastic about tackling big jobs .
" I 've always wanted to do something important , and it had to be in a big organization , " says Mulally .
You would think once in a lifetime would be enough for the aeronautical engineer in charge of developing the 777 airliner at Boeing ( BA , Fortune 500 ) .
But here he is , doing it all over again : " What gets me really excited is a big thing where a lot of talented , smart people are involved , " he says .
Mulally once asked his mother , now 90 , " Why am I this way ? "
She replied , " You 've always been this way . "
Mulally 's being " this way " has , at least for now , kept Ford ahead of GM and Chrysler in the fight for survival .
Unlike its traditional rivals , Mulally 's Ford insists it has enough cash to ride out the economic downturn and does not want the government loans that the other two companies have accepted .
Ford 's financial independence is largely due to a new operational discipline that Mulally has installed , as well as some timely strategic moves he initiated .
So while GM suffered the ignominy of seeing the Treasury Department 's auto task force depose chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner , and Chrysler has declared bankruptcy , Ford stands alone as an independent company and , potentially , a Detroit survivor .
" Alan was the right choice [ to be CEO ] , and it gets more right every day , " says executive chairman Bill Ford , the man who hired him .
Ford Motor is still losing money , like nearly every other automaker , but it shows signs of recovery .
In the U.S. its market share of retail sales to individuals ( as opposed to wholesale sales to fleet customers ) has gone up in six of the past seven months .
It has negotiated four new agreements with the United Auto Workers , bringing its hourly labor cost down from $ 76 an hour to $ 55 an hour and , Ford says , promising to make it competitive with Toyota ( TM ) .
While GM and Chrysler are hoarding cash , Ford actually laid out $ 2.4 billion in March to pay down $ 10.1 billion in long - term debt .
Its share price has increased nearly fivefold since hitting a low in November .
' Pretty relentless '
Mulally , who was hired as CEO in September 2006 , has n't engineered , designed , or built any cars .
But he has devised a plan that identifies specific goals for the company , created a process that moves it toward those goals , and installed a system to make sure it gets there .
Mulally watches all this with intensity - and demands weekly , sometimes daily , updates .
" Alan 's style is pretty relentless , " says chief financial officer Lewis Booth , a 31 - year Ford veteran .
" He says , ' If this is the reality , what are we going to do about it ? ' not ' We 're going to work our way through it . ' "
The Mulally method has pointed Ford to some smart strategic moves .
Sensing a recession in 2006 , Mulally decided to borrow $ 23.6 billion against Ford 's assets .
Piling on more debt was n't an easy call , but the extra cash meant that Ford could say no to government loans when sales fell apart last year .
Mulally is moving to integrate the company globally , despite several failed attempts in the past .
In 2010 , Ford will be selling small cars in the U.S. that were developed in Europe .
Mulally persuaded Bill Ford to dispose of Jaguar and Land Rover and focus its resources on the Ford brand , and by moving quickly he managed to sell them to India 's Tata in 2007 when there was still a market for makers of luxury vehicles .
He took longer to untangle Volvo from the rest of the company , but he has now put that up for sale too .
Those moves have helped Ford separate from GM and Chrysler , and Mulally is pumped .
" As we come through this , we 're going to be a turbo machine on the other side , " he says .
He has promised that Ford 's core North American operations , as well as the entire company , will turn profitable by 2011 .
It had better , because it can't keep losing money indefinitely .
Ford recorded a loss of $ 14.7 billion last year and another $ 1.4 billion in 2009 's first quarter .
If the U.S. and the rest of the global economy continue to slump , Ford 's survival could be endangered .
" The test of Ford 's liquidity will be how low vehicle sales go this year , when they recover , and what levels they recover to in 2010 and 2011 , " writes analyst Shelly Lombard of Gimme Credit .
Besides ,
Ford has n't always handled prosperity well .
It boomed in the mid-1980s on the strength of the Taurus , pickup trucks , and Lincolns , only to be laid low by the recession of 1990 - 91 .
Then it squeezed record profits out of Expeditions , Lincoln Navigators , and pickups - all built on the same platform - in the middle to late 1990s .
But a binge of overseas acquisitions , combined with laxity in operations , brought it limping into the 21st century .
When Mulally arrived in September 2006 , Ford was known mainly for its pickup trucks and the Mustang , and the company was on the verge of collapse .
It lost $ 12.6 billion in 2006 and another $ 2.7 billion in 2007 .
Now , if the economy recovers on schedule , Ford is in a position to thrive .
To meet stricter government fuel - economy standards , it is introducing a line of more efficient , smaller - displacement engines with turbocharging , and it will start rolling out electric vehicles in 2010 .
A healthier Ford will be able to scoop up business from GM and Chrysler as those companies shed brands and models .
Goldman Sachs 's Patrick Archambault sees Ford picking up 25 % of the sales the two companies lose , equivalent to 1.35 points of market share .
So how does an industry outsider like Mulally come into a company as large as Ford - with its 205,000 employees , multiple product lines , and international operations - and straighten it out ?
To people like me who follow the industry and find its inner workings infinitely complex , the success of a non -auto person is surprising and , frankly , a little discomfiting .
Mulally , after all , was so removed from Detroit ways when Ford hired him that his personal car was a Lexus .
Although there are similarities between building airplanes and making cars - heavy R&D , complex manufacturing , supplier relations , a unionized workforce - there are crucial differences too .
Mulally had no experience in mass marketing or dealer relations .
Although he has weighed in on model names , brand streamlining ( he is allowing Mercury to wither away ) , and product complexity ( he was flabbergasted to hear that engineers had created 132 different center consoles for the Navigator ) , he leaves product decisions to the professionals .
The story of how Mulally revived Ford 's best - known sedan is a quintessential demonstration of the Mulally method - analyzing a situation using accepted facts and then winning over support through persistence .
Here 's the story , told by Mulally :
" I arrive here , and the first day I say , ' Let 's go look at the product lineup . '
And they lay it out , and I said , ' Where 's the Taurus ? '
They said , ' Well , we killed it . '
I said , ' What do you mean , you killed it ? '
' Well , we made a couple that looked like a football .
They did n't sell very well , so we stopped it . '
' You stopped the Taurus ? ' I said .
' How many billions of dollars does it cost to build brand loyalty around a name ? '
' Well , we thought it was so damaged that we named it the Five Hundred . '
I said , ' Well , you 've got until tomorrow to find a vehicle to put the Taurus name on because that 's why I 'm here .
Then you have two years to make the coolest vehicle that you can possibly make . '? "
The 2010 Taurus is arriving on the market this spring , and while it is not as startling as the original 1986 Taurus , it is still pretty cool .
A new corporate culture
It 's difficult to imagine the reaction of hard - bitten Ford executives to Mulally 's arrival .
Sharp elbows , fierce loyalties , and frequent turf battles were hallmarks of Ford 's management culture :
The tough guys won .
Despite nearly 40 years in the commercial airplane business - one of the most international of industries - Mulally looks as if he had just left his home state of Kansas .
He dresses like a Boy Scout leader - blue blazer , button - down shirt , kiltie loafers - and his open - mouth smile makes him appear bemused or even a bit puzzled by what goes on around him .
That corn-fed sincerity , however , masks confidence , discipline , and a fierce desire to win .
" Communicate , communicate , communicate , " Mulally explained in one of his notes to me .
" Everyone has to know the plan , its status , and areas that need special attention . "
For instance , Mulally is determined that Ford reduce its dependence on light trucks as gas becomes more expensive , and he has let the entire organization know it in the bluntest possible language .
" Everybody says you can't make money off small cars , " he says .
" Well , you 'd better damn well figure out how to make money , because that 's where the world is going . "
Mulally 's openness seems to have won him support throughout the organization .
Says manufacturing boss Joe Hinrichs : " Alan brings infectious energy .
This is a person people want to follow . "
Sometimes Mulally verges on guilelessness .
In preparation for our interview , he provided me with a one - page summary of his managerial abilities .
Titled " Alan 's Leadership , " it includes some boilerplate - " proven successful leader ... business acumen and judgment ... steady ... true North " - but leavens it with less quantifiable traits : " expects the very best of himself and others , seeks to understand rather than to be understood . "
I can't imagine another CEO making such a list public .
Bill Ford sums
Mulally up this way : " Alan is not a very complicated person .
He is very driven . "
Arriving at Ford , Mulally boned up on the company like a student cramming for an exam , interviewing dozens of employees , analysts , and consultants , and filling those five binders with his typed notes .
The research allowed him to develop a point of view about the auto business that now frames all his decisions .
Its pillars draw heavily from his experience at Boeing : Focus on the Ford brand ( " nobody buys a house of brands " ) ; compete in every market segment with carefully defined products ( small , medium , and large ; cars , utilities , and trucks ) ; market fewer nameplates ( 40 worldwide by 2013 , down from 97 worldwide in 2006 ) ; and become best in class in quality , fuel efficiency , safety , and value .
Are corporate mission statements so 1990s ?
Not to Mulally .
To let everyone know what he had in mind , Mulally created those plastic cards with four goals on one side ( " Expected Behaviors " ) and a revised definition of the company ( " One Ford " ) on the other .
To Mulally , it is like sacred text : " This is me .
I wrote it .
It 's what I believe in .
You can't make this shit up . "
" I am here to save an American and global icon , " Mulally declares .
He drives performance the way he did at Boeing , with the Business Plan Review , a meeting with his direct reports , held early every Thursday .
" I live for Thursday morning at 8 a.m. , " he says .
First up are Ford 's four profit centers : the Americas , Europe , Asia Pacific , and Ford Credit .
Then come presentations from 12 functional areas ( from product development and manufacturing to human resources and government relations ) .
" When I arrived there were six or seven people reporting to Bill Ford , and the IT person was n't there , the human resources person was n't there , " says Mulally .
" So I moved up and included every functional discipline on my team because everybody in this place had to be involved and had to know everything . "
The Thursday meetings are held in what 's known as the Thunderbird Room , one floor below Mulally 's office , around a circular dark - wood table fitted with three pairs of videoscreens in the center .
Eight clocks , one for each
Ford time zone , are mounted on the wall .
There are seats for 18 executives around the table , with additional ones on the perimeter ( " Here 's where I sit , " says Mulally , indicating a chair : " Pilot 's seat " ) .
There are no pre-meetings or briefing books .
" They do n't bring their big books anymore because I 'm not going to grind them with as many questions as I can to humiliate them , " Mulally says .
" We 'll see them next week .
We do n't take action - I 'm going to see you next week . "
No BlackBerrys are allowed , and no side conversations either - Mulally is insistent about that .
" If somebody starts to talk or they do n't respect each other , the meeting just stops .
They know I 've removed vice presidents because they could n't stop talking because they thought they were so damn important . "
Mulally instituted color coding for reports : green for good , yellow for caution , red for problems .
Managers coded their operations green at the first couple of meetings to show how well they were doing , but Mulally called them on it .
" You guys , you know we lost a few billion dollars last year , " he told the group .
" Is there anything that 's not going well ? "
After that the process loosened up .
Americas boss Mark Fields went first .
He admitted that the Ford Edge , due to arrive at dealers , had some technical problems with the rear lift gate and was n't ready for the start of production .
" The whole place was deathly silent , " says Mulally .
" Then I clapped , and I said , ' Mark , I really appreciate that clear visibility . '
And the next week the entire set of charts were all rainbows . "
" If something is off - track , we are much better at identifying it and resolving it , " says CFO Booth .
" Not everything turns to green .
If it does n't , we have to modify the plan . "
To monitor operations during the week , Mulally can visit two adjacent rooms whose walls are lined with 280 performance charts , arranged by area of responsibility , with a big picture of the executive in charge in case there are any doubts .
Everyone at the Thursday meeting gets wall space .
Mulally spends 30 minutes explaining the charts to me , making sure I stand 20 feet away so that I can't see any of the data .
The message , though , comes through clearly : Mulally has his finger on every piece of this large and complex company .
So does his board of directors ; they see a subset of the same data .
There are no secrets at Ford anymore .
" This is a huge enterprise , and the magic is , everybody knows the plan , " says Mulally .
And everyone seems to be onboard .
Chief financial officer Don Leclair became a company hero for arranging the $ 23.6 billion loan in 2006 .
But other executives found him hard to work with , and Leclair decided to retire .
Mulally does n't want to have to settle arguments between executives , either .
" They can either work together or they can come see me , " he says .
He demonstrates how infrequently that happens by springing up from his chair , dashing into his outer office , and then racing back and sitting down .
He reports that nobody is waiting to see him .
" They 're not here .
There 's nobody here .
There 's nobody outside .
So they must be working together . "
I am speechless , but I get the point .
Will it work ?
So far , Mulally has been mostly managing the hand dealt him when he arrived .
The first new model to bear his fingerprints will be the restyled 2010 Taurus that goes on sale in June .
His plan for " One Ford " wo n't get a real test until next year when two small , fuel - efficient cars , the Fiesta and the Focus , make their way from Europe to the U.S.
It remains an open question whether Americans will be willing to pay more for the smaller , higher - content vehicles .
They will have to if Mulally is to succeed in reducing Ford 's dependence on pickup truck profits .
The biggest unanswered questions about Mulally are how long he will stay at Ford and who will succeed him .
Bill Ford has been saying that he hopes Mulally never leaves , but having spent nearly four decades in Seattle , he is n't likely to settle in Dearborn , and in fact , the company spent $ 344,109 in 2008 flying Mulally and his family between the two cities and elsewhere .
Now that Ford is running more smoothly , there should n't be a need to look outside again for his successor .
If Mulally leaves when he turns 65 , the betting is that he will be succeeded by Booth , who is 60 .
If Mulally stays longer , then 48 - year - old Fields would likely be the choice .
Mulally talks as if he has found a home and is doing the work he was always intended to do .
" Something about just being mature , being almost 64 , is that I 've been there .
I 've been through a lot of cycles .
I 'm not up and down .
I 'm rock - solid , no matter where the bad news comes from .
I 'm steady .
And everybody knows why I 'm here .
It 's not a career move .
I 'm not trying to get ahead .
I am not looking for more awards . "
At one of his early meetings with employees upon joining Ford in 2006 , Mulally was asked whether Ford would be able to remain in business : " Was Ford going to make it ? "
" I do n't know , " Mulally replied .
" But we have a plan , and the plan says we are going to make it . "
It was a moment Mulally 's mother would have appreciated .

According to the New York Post , Best Buy is thinking about selling vinyl records again in their stores .
I had to read that twice too .
I would find " Nixon Returns From Grave " easier to believe .

The reason : Vinyl albums ' sales are growing .
As much as 15 percent up in 2007 and a whooping 89 % more in 2008 .
The 2009 forecast is better .
The numbers are so good that Best Buy started a pilot program in 100 stores .
The results were so good that the third largest music seller after iTunes and Wal - Mart is thinking about using as much as eight square feet in each of its 1,020 stores to sell vinyl records .
While sales of vinyl discs are not as big as CDs , the latter numbers have dropped 20 % .
Apparently , vinyl are becoming a cult object , with an audience seeking the appeal of the physical format and the special sound of analog ( which in the case of the classics , could be more attractive than the digital productions ) .
The interest , although minimal considering the rest of the industry , is big enough that big labels are re-releasing old records in vinyl .
One example :
In September 2008 EMI started to a new line called " From the Capitol Vaults , " which included The Beach Boys ' " Pet Sounds , " Jimi Hendrix 's " Band of Gypsies , " and Radiohead 's " OK Computer . " [ New York Post ]

But better yet , just do n’t play with fire .

Unfair and Deceptive Data Trade Practices
Do you know what your data did last night ?
Almost none of the more than 27 million people who took the RealAge quiz realized that their personal health data was being used by drug companies to develop targeted e-mail marketing campaigns .
There ’s a basic consumer protection principle at work here , and it ’s the concept of “ unfair and deceptive ” trade practices .
Basically , a company should n’t be able to say one thing and do another : sell used goods as new , lie on ingredients lists , advertise prices that are n’t generally available , claim features that do n’t exist , and so on .
Buried in RealAge ’s 2,400 - word privacy policy is this disclosure : “ If you elect to say yes to becoming a free RealAge Member , we will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site (s ) or the purchase of our products or services and may contain , in whole or in part , advertisements for third parties which relate to marketed products of selected RealAge partners . ”
They maintain that when you join the website , you consent to receiving pharmaceutical company spam .
But since that is n’t spelled out , it ’s not really informed consent .
That ’s deceptive .
Cloud computing is another technology where users entrust their data to service providers .
Salesforce.com , Gmail , and Google Docs are examples ; your data is n’t on your computer — it ’s out in the “ cloud ” somewhere — and you access it from your web browser .
Cloud computing has significant benefits for customers and huge profit potential for providers .
It ’s one of the fastest growing IT market segments — 69 % of Americans now use some sort of cloud computing services — but the business is rife with shady , if not outright deceptive , advertising .
Take Google , for example .
Last month , the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( I ’m on its board of directors ) filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission concerning Google ’s cloud computing services .
On its website , Google repeatedly assures customers that their data is secure and private , while published vulnerabilities demonstrate that it is not .
Google ’s not foolish , though ; its Terms of Service explicitly disavow any warranty or any liability for harm that might result from Google ’s negligence , recklessness , malevolent intent , or even purposeful disregard of existing legal obligations to protect the privacy and security of user data .
EPIC claims that ’s deceptive .
Facebook is n’t much better .
Its plainly written ( and not legally binding ) Statement of Principles contains an admirable set of goals , but its denser and more legalistic Statement of Rights and Responsibilities undermines a lot of it .
One research group who studies these documents called it “ democracy theater “ : Facebook wants the appearance of involving users in governance , without the messiness of actually having to do so .
Deceptive .
These issues are not identical .
RealAge is hiding what it does with your data .
Google is trying to both assure you that your data is safe and duck any responsibility when it ’s not .
Facebook wants to market a democracy but run a dictatorship .
But they all involve trying to deceive the customer .
Cloud computing services like Google Docs , and social networking sites like RealAge and Facebook , bring with them significant privacy and security risks over and above traditional computing models .
Unlike data on my own computer , which I can protect to whatever level I believe prudent , I have no control over any of these sites , nor any real knowledge of how these companies protect my privacy and security .
I have to trust them .
This may be fine — the advantages might very well outweigh the risks — but users often can’t weigh the trade - offs because these companies are going out of their way to hide the risks .
Of course , companies do n’t want people to make informed decisions about where to leave their personal data .
RealAge would n’t get 27 million members if its webpage clearly stated “ you are signing up to receive e-mails containing advertising from pharmaceutical companies , ” and Google Docs would n’t get five million users if its webpage said “ We ’ll take some steps to protect your privacy , but you ca n’t blame us if something goes wrong . ”
And of course , trust is n’t black and white .
If , for example , Amazon tried to use customer credit card info to buy itself office supplies , we ’d all agree that that was wrong .
If it used customer names to solicit new business from their friends , most of us would consider this wrong .
When it uses buying history to try to sell customers new books , many of us appreciate the targeted marketing .
Similarly , no one expects Google ’s security to be perfect .
But if it did n’t fix known vulnerabilities , most of us would consider that a problem .
This is why understanding is so important .
For markets to work , consumers need to be able to make informed buying decisions .
They need to understand both the costs and benefits of the products and services they buy .
Allowing sellers to manipulate the market by outright lying , or even by hiding vital information , about their products breaks capitalism — and that ’s why the government has to step in to ensure markets work smoothly .
Last month , Mary K. Engle , Acting Deputy Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection said : “ a company ’s marketing materials must be consistent with the nature of the product being offered .
It ’s not enough to disclose the information only in a fine print of a lengthy online user agreement . ”
She was speaking about Digital Rights Management and , specifically , an incident where Sony used a music copy protection scheme without disclosing that it secretly installed software on customers ’ computers .
DRM is different from cloud computing or even online surveys and quizzes , but the principle is the same .
Engle again : “ if your advertising giveth and your EULA [ license agreement ] taketh away do n’t be surprised if the FTC comes calling . ”
That ’s the right response from government .

DAKAR , 27 February 2009 ( IRIN ) - UN flights that help aid workers and supplies get to hundreds of thousands of people in west and central Africa will stop in March 2009 unless funding is found , UN humanitarian officials say .
Four air operations - for Central African Republic , Chad , Niger and the coastal countries Côte d'Ivoire , Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone - transport humanitarian workers and often emergency aid supplies in areas where roads are poor or non-existent and commercial flights are unavailable .
The air operation connecting the coastal countries recently cut one of two aircraft and the entire operation could be suspended mid-March unless funding is found , according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) in Guinea .
" The humanitarian air services are essential to the support provided to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people in several West African countries , " said Thomas Yanga , World Food Programme regional director for West Africa .
WFP manages the air services .
" They are currently seriously jeopardised and will have to shut down in March if no additional funds are received . "
Yanga said the flights are " crucial not only to transport aid workers and implement numerous life - saving operations in the region but also for medical and security evacuations . "
At least US $ 24 million is required to keep all four air operations running , according to WFP .
One - third of the some 1,000 monthly users of the coastal air operation are linked to aid operations in Guinea , according to Philippe Verstraeten , head of OCHA in the country .
The operation currently covers Conakry , Kankan , Nzérékoré , Kissidougou , Freetown , Monrovia and Zwedru ; flights to Abidjan , Côte d'Ivoire have been suspended .
" These operations are vital for Guinea at a time when the situation is extremely volatile in the country following the change of government , " he told IRIN .
http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=82134
Humanitarian operations are hampered in the region by a lack of access and often by insecurity , according to OCHA .
The largest of the air services is in Chad , where aid agencies are assisting a quarter - million refugees in the east and some 60,000 in the south , along with 160,000 displaced Chadians and some local communities .
Aside from the UN peacekeeping mission and an International Committee of the Red Cross mission in Chad , the UN humanitarian air service provides the only safe and reliable mode of transportation for aid workers in the country , according to WFP .
An average of 3,644 people used the flights monthly in 2008 .

The Tesla Model S is a stylish futuristic 4 - door pure electric sedan slated to go into production in late 2011 .
The vehicle debuted with a splash in late March receiving acclaim for its sleek and refined design , up to 300 miles of range ( with optional pack ) , and its hopeful price - tag of under $ 50,000 after government tax credits .
On Tuesday Tesla announced that they have so far received 1000 reservations for the car .
" To reserve a standard Model S , you put down a $ 5,000 reservation fee .
You put down a $ 40,000 reservation fee for a Signature Edition Model S , " says Tesla spokesperson Rachel Konrad .
" We do not break down the number of standard vs. Sig Editions . "
“ The Model S is a better value than much cheaper conventional cars , ” said Tesla CEO , Chairman and Product Architect Elon Musk .
“ Despite the enormous environmental benefits , lower total cost of ownership will soon become the primary motivation for consumers to evolve from gas guzzlers to EVs . ”
At this point Tesla has already delivered over 400 of its 2 - seat $ 109,000 electric Roadsters .
Tesla 's ability to produce the Model S will depend on whether it receives $ 350 million in government loans it has applied for .
The money would be used to build an assembly plant .
Tesla expects to sell 20,000 vehicles per year .

Sony's PSP Go ! will be lighter , less expensive , and less power hungry , says a " mole " dropping hints to tech - talk site Ars Technica .
That , and Sony 's rumored PS3 Slim is real , it 's coming in August or September , and it 'll only be spotted behind closed doors at next week 's E3 .
For the UMD - no - more PSP Go ! , see " Sony PSP Go! Reportedly Scooped , But What 's Missing ? " and our own little scoop , " Exclusive : Sony PSP Go! Storage Tech Revealed . "
Aside from the more or less predictable bits about weight , price , and power in the latest scuttlebutt , the only thing new is that Ars is saying its debut at E3 next week is virtually certain .
Actually scratch that :
We knew it was certain when our own source said as much weeks ago .
Regarding the PS3 Slim , that rumor broke last week , sounded like bunk , but culminated in a " leaked " picture takedown request .
That , as you 'd expect , simply fired the breathless speculation , lent a trifle more credibility by this latest claim to the model 's autumnal existence .
Why no PS3 Slim announcement at E3 ?
Product Sales 101 .
Sony needs to clear the channel of its existing big - fat - anvil - sized PS3 stock .
Also the same reasons Sony's PSP and PS2 " slim " iterations took time to appear after rumors of their existence percolated .
The PSP Go !'s ( or whatever it 's actually called ) rumored lack of a second analog nub pretty much curbed my enthusiasm for the part , to be honest .
So what can Sony do to regain its " gotcha ! " momentum next week ?
Focus on the stuff no one 's guessed at in any meaningful detail , e.g. its media ( including games ) download services and PS3 interoperability angle .
Also :
If there 's a price drop , say from $ 170 down to a DS - competitive $ 130 , that could very be highlight of the show , given how much more penetrative handheld unit sales have been in recent years .
Microsoft 's Xbox 360 just broke 30 million units worldwide , but Sony 's PSP is nearing 50 million .
You 're talking a piece of portable tech that debuted just a few months prior to the Xbox 360 , and which for the last year or so has only been a couple hundred bucks cheaper .
The 360's sales are impressive .
The PSP 's sales are that much more so .
My pricing bet ?
$ 150 ( or in stupid market - speak , $ 149.99 ) .
Why ?
Because it 's a nice round number , quite possibly round enough to make Nintendo extremely nervous .

Not Another Umbrella / Rim Light
pulled out of my
Soft / Hard Combo
When the Ambient is Not Your Friend
__________I say that because I went to this well way too often in my early days .
Not only that , the umbrella always seemed to come from the right front , and the rim from the back left .
Why ?
I have absolutely no idea .
I was like a little " lighting function key " or something .
Press me , and you 'd get a camera right umbrella portrait with a back left rim .
Go figure .
Nothing if not consistent , I suppose .
Perfectly acceptable -- certainly compared to on - camera or bounced flash .
But ... Not to dis .
If done subtly and with regard for the ambient , that technique can look elegant .
But if you have two lights you can create a look without the need for any contributory ambient , which is a term I justmade up .
Usually , my workflow when setting up a two - light , flash - only shot is to build the fill first .
Choose the quality of fill light , expose for it , then knock the aperture down to build whatever lighting ratio you want .
Then add the key , salt to taste , and simmer for two minutes until the sauce thickens .
But this time we were already working with a gridded key , which by itself looked like the photo at left .
Not bad , if you are into floating heads .
Bringing in the fill from just below on - axis ( see photo up top ) gave a cool up - light to Riaz 's arms .
It also wrapped an atypical , 3D - ish light when combined with the key .
And the slight specular you can see on the wall down low is also from the fill .
That specular erases much of the shadow on the wall created by the fill , which makes the light a little hard to reverse at first blush .
That 's because the missing shadow does n't seem to play by the rules .
The top of the fill light ( shoot - thru umbrella ) was just below the lens , which meant that the center point for the fill was a foot and a half or so below the lens axis .
The ratio was about two stops down -- atwo stops , as Miracle Max would say in The Princess Bride .
I like the look for a few reasons -- it is controlled , I can produce it just about anywhere with two flashes and it is a little bit atypical .
That last one is always a plus in my book .
Having some two - light , flash - only solutions in your pocket is a good fallback when you ambient is crappy and your only backdrop is a wall .
This wood - paneled wall is actually pretty cool .
But later in this series we will be up against the more garden - variety white version .
A tipster passed along something we did n't know : Noted Scientologist Greta van Susteren 's sister is a psychiatrist .
Or , as Greta 's religion would have it , a practitioner of the " industry of death , " a " fraud , " a drug - peddler , and a " rapist . "
We asked her what she thought of her sister 's curious views .
Lise van Susteren lives in Bethesda , Md. That 's her , with Greta , in 2005 .
She is an assistant professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University and completed her residency at St. Elizabeth 's Hospital , a mental institution in Washington , D.C.
She 's a board - certified forensic psychiatrist and has served on the staff of mental health centers in Alexandria and Fairfax , Va .
She was a consultant to the CIA , where she developed psychological profiles of world leaders .
In 2006 , she launched a failed Senate bid in Maryland .
Lise is no dabbler :
She has a deep and varied career in psychiatry .
Last month , she wrote in the Huffington Post that mental health professionals must do more to assess and redress the psychiatric effects of dislocation due to climate change .
Her sister Greta , on the other hand , is a member and underwriter of an organization whose leader David Miscavige lauds its " campaign for the global obliteration of psychiatry " and uses terms like " lethal assault , " " plague , " and " virus of abberation " when discussing his aim of " breaking the dark spell cast across earth " by people like Lise van Susteren .
As of 1998 , Greta had given at least $ 100,000 to Scientology ; Miscavige 's mother was the accountant at the law firm Greta ran with her husband John Coale .
She and Coale own a home in Clearwater , Fla. , Scientology 's spiritual headquarters .
We called Lise to ask her about Greta 's views .
" These are private matters , " she said .
" I do n't ever discuss them .
The reality is , I do n't know anything about Scientology 's current campaigns .
I know that in the past there were a few people who were very vocal about psychiatry , but I do n't know enough to reasonably comment . "
A few very vocal people is a vast understatement .
We recommend Lise watch this video , of Miscavige at Scientology 's New Year 's celebration in 2006 , to get a refresher .
She could also go to Scientology 's web site to learn about how her sister 's religion regards psychiatry and psychology as " the stepchildren of ... Hitler and the Nazis , " and formed " the philosophical basis for the wholesale slaughter of human beings in ... World War II . "
She might take special interest in that last bit , seeing as how her Jewish mother - in - law survived a German labor camp during the Holocaust by passing as a Catholic .
Greta and Lise do n't seem to be estranged ; Greta lent her support to Lise 's Senate campaign and gave $ 2,100 .
We wonder what Miscavige thinks of one of his premier celebrity ambassadors palling around with a " psych . "

Behold , the most serious challenge to the Royal Society in that august body 's 350 - year history - the medical musings of Madonna , Gwyneth Paltrow and Stella McCartney .
These women are not just singers , or actresses , or fashion designers .
They are distinguished professors at the University of Celebrity , and are coating your understanding of science like a totally amazing organic body oil .
On top of this , they are best friends , so we can say their pronouncements are peer - reviewed in the best sense of that term .
Can you imagine their gatherings ?
It must be as if Isaac Newton were taking antioxidant tea with Robert Koch and Marie Curie .
We shall come to her latest discoveries shortly , but by way of background , do recall that Gwyneth has formerly claimed that eating " biological foods " can prevent cancer , reminding us that starring in Iron Man and maintaining a glittering career in clinical research are not mutually exclusive .
Then we have Madonna , who has cited the extraordinary healing powers of Kabbalah water , which costs $ 4 a bottle , is said to have had energy injected into it , and may or may not have been blessed by the former insurance salesman who dreamed up her religion .
Other fields of specialism ?
Alas , Lost in Showbiz has n't the space today , but Madonna has previously championed a soi-disant scientist who claims to have reversed the second law of thermodynamics .
And then there 's Stella , who launched her organic skincare range with the warning that " lots of skin products use the same petrochemicals as the antifreeze in your car ! " , and is one of those celebrities who thinks they eat " chemical - free " food and use " chemical - free " products .
I beg you not to tell her that water and trees are made of chemicals .
The shock could finish her off .
So then to Gwyneth 's latest thesis , published not in the British Medical Journal , surprisingly , but in Goop , the newsletter she sends out to her flock every week .
According to Gwyneth , she bowed to crushing demand for this service from friends who were always asking her for restaurant recommendations and low - fat recipes and where to find reproduction art - deco taps .
It is now Earth 's most invaluable resource for all those unable to locate the perfect £ 650 cashmere egg cosy ( remember : never eat the yolk , it gives you Aids or calories or something ) .
Entertainers being what they are , it was only a matter of time before Gwyneth branched out into bacteriology , and in her most recent communique she is good enough to explain her fears that household products are causing autism and cancer in children .
" A couple of years ago , " she writes , " I was asked to give a quote for a book concerning environmental toxins and their effects on our children . "
But how preposterous .
I assume she replied : " I am an actor .
My job is pretending to be other people .
This does not qualify me to discourse on paediatric medicine " ?
Alas not .
" While reading up on the subject , I was seized with fear , " Gwyneth continues .
Lost in Showbiz has n't the strength to bore you with it in full , but it 's something about foetuses and young children being unable to " metabolise toxins " - toxins that come from all the " chemicals " we fill our environment with .
" The research is troubling ; the incidence of diseases in children such as asthma , cancer and autism have shot up exponentially ... "
No matter that there has been very little change in the rate of childhood cancers detected in recent years , and no matter that various leading experts have exploded in exasperation at Gwyneth 's general hokum .
Like her coterie of fellow scientists , she is indifferent to the critics , whom the form book suggests she would dismiss as " haters " .
So if you hear anyone disparaging our three brainiacs , you tell them this : if we understand more than we did five years ago about how holy water can cure verrucas and how shampoo causes cancer , then it is because we are standing on the shoulders of these giants .

Rick Sanchez brings on Tom Tancredo and Media Matters ' Eric Boehlert to discuss the right 's accusations that Sonia Sotomayor is a racist and should be disqualified from serving on the Supreme Court .
Today Tancredo decided his dose of the crazy on The Ed Schultz Show just was n't enough and takes it a step further .
h/t Think Progress for the transcript
TANCREDO :
If you belong to an organization called La Raza , in this case , which is , from my point of view anyway , nothing more than a Latino — it ’s a counterpart — a Latino KKK without the hoods or the nooses .
If you belong to something like that in a way that ’s going to convince me and a lot of other people that it ’s got nothing to do with race .
Even though the logo of La Raza is “ All for the race .
Nothing for the rest . ”
What does that tell you ?
SANCHEZ : Alright .
We ’re not talking about — we ’re not talking about La Raza – TANCREDO :
She ’s a member !
She ’s a member of La Raza !
Thankfully Media Matters '
Boehlert was there for a dose of sanity and called out Rick Sanchez who was still quoting Sotomayor out of context and corrects him for his error .
Boehlert , the author of the great book " Bloggers on the Bus , " called the attacks on Sotomayor a " rush to the gutter by the right " .

Good week for :
Visualizing world peace , after Miss Universe paid a visit to the Guantánamo Bay military base and declared it “ a loooot of fun ! ”
After seeing the detainee camps and recreation areas , Dayana Mendoza of Venezuela said , “ I did n’t want to leave , it was such a relaxing place , so calm and beautiful . ”
Quick thinking , after a woman caught driving 103 mph on an Oregon road with her 10 - year - old grandson in the car explained to police that she was only trying to teach the boy never to drive that fast .
Parochialism , after American reporters traveling to Europe with President Obama were given a briefing book informing them that Germany is “ about the size of Montana , ” the Czech Republic is “ about the size of Virginia , ” and the U.K. is “ slightly smaller than Oregon . ”
Bad week for :
Having God as your co-pilot , after a Tunisian pilot was sentenced to 10 years in prison because he paused to pray instead of taking emergency measures before crash - landing his plane , killing 16 people .
Life imitating art , after an Iowa 13 - year - old was arrested for biting 11 kids at his school .
His father said he meant no harm , but was obsessed with the vampire movie Twilight .
Realism , after an Ontario woman became terrified by a cardboard cutout of a coyote that had been set up in a park to scare away geese .
The coyote , she said , “ barked ” at her as she jogged by , and she fled in panic and called 911 to report a wild animal on the prowl .
Police surrounded the coyote before realizing it was n’t real .
Brouwer ’s Fixed Point Theorem is Unstable
Games and economic problems are often unstable
Luitzen Brouwer is famous for his seminal fixed point theorem and also for a philosophy that seems at variance with his own theorem .
One of the great things about people is we can hold inconsistent ideas in our heads , and not be too troubled by them .
Sometimes I ’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast .
Lewis Carroll
Brouwer created the mathematical philosophy of intuitionism .
This philosophy insists on a very constructive approach to mathematics , which is interesting since his proof of his famous theorem is non-constructive .
Intuitionism can be viewed as a refinement of classic logic , in that finer distinctions can be made .
For example , in Brouwer ’s view the statements
and
are distinct .
The first says that holds for all , while the latter says that we cannot find a counter - example to .
Classically , these are the same , but in intuitionistic logic they are different .
In passing I should mention that Kurt Gödel made important contributions to the relationship between classic and intuitionistic logic : I will discuss that another day .
Back to Brouwer ’s Theorem , Vijaya Ramachandran was a PhD student of mine years ago .
She used the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem ( BFT ) in her thesis , which I always envied .
I have never gotten to use this great theorem in any of my papers .
Perhaps one day .
At the time we were studying the theory of VLSI design .
Often the first design of a chip would run too slow .
The reason usually was that there were wires that were too “ long ” , and therefore the signal took too long to move from one place on the chip to another .
The method that was popular at the time , was to re-size the driver for the wire .
If a driver was made larger , the signal would propagate faster down the wire .
Thus , there were algorithms that computed how much larger the drivers should be and changed the chip design accordingly .
Vijaya noticed a logical problem , that the new re-sized chip might still be too slow : the issue is that re-sizing the drivers made other wires longer and this may slow them down .
So re-apply the algorithm .
But wait .
Will this ever converge ?
Or could the process diverge ?
Or yield a chip that was too large to be practical ?
Enter BFT .
The theorem states that any continuous map of the closed ball to itself has a fixed point .
This was exactly what she needed to prove that the re-sizing process always eventually converges .
While I have never used BFT , there is a theorem that may not be as well known to our community that I have used .
Why I used it is another story , for another day .
It is called Smith ’s Fixed Point Theorem :
Theorem :
If is a continuous map so that for some prime , and all , , then has a fixed point .
Note , and and so on .
The Stability Issue
Today , I want to point out an issue regarding proofs based on BFT and related theorems .
In general , the fixed points of a map are not stable under perturbations of the map itself .
This is a problem that seems to often be missed .
I once looked through an entire monograph on fixed point theorems of all kinds and could find no discussion on the inherent instability of BFT .
This already happens in one dimension ; a simple example is the following :
In the Figure above we show a continuous function from to itself , and have circled its two fixed points .
On the right we have drawn a map which is a slight perturbation of .
Observe that one fixed point of has disappeared in : simply because that fixed point of was at a point where and just touched each other but did not cross .
Game and Economic Theory
Classical game theory and economics rely heavily on fixed point theorems to prove the existence of various solution concepts .
The celebrated result of Nash proving the existence of equilibrium strategies in non-zero sum games is a classic example for which the only proofs of existence known are via Brouwer ’s or Kakutani ’s fixed point theorems .
Most extensions of Nash equilibria also depend crucially on these theorems .
To take another example , the existence of the Arrow - Debreu equilibrium prices in a market model was first proved via fixed point theorems , and only later were proofs via convex programming formulations provided in some special cases .
Even the most basic solution concept in game theory , the min-max solution of a zero- sum game , was initially proved to exist by von-Neumann via Kakutani ’s fixed point theorem , and the connection to linear programming ( LP ) became evident only later .
This lead me with Vangelis Markakis and Aranyak Mehta to examine results in game theory and in economic theory with an eye toward stability .
The bottom line is that some results in game and economic theory are stable and others are not .
I think this distinction is interesting .
If , for example , a problem is unstable , then one must be careful in discussing what it means to have a solution .
Even more , what good is an approximate solution if the “ real ” solution can be very far away ?
Zero Sum Games
Consider a - player zero -sum game .
As is usual , I will refer to the players as the row player and the column player respectively .
A zero -sum game is determined by a payoff matrix , which determines for every choice of strategies , the payment that the column player makes to the row player .
Let ’s start by looking at the famous min-max solution introduced by von Neumann .
The payoff of the row player in a min-max solution is known as the value of the game .
Theorem :
Let and be two zero - sum games with payoffs bounded between and , i.e. .
Let .
Let be the value of game and be the value of game .
Then
Proof :
By writing the min-max solution as an LP in the standard manner we get that is the optimum value of the following LP ( 1 ) :
Similarly is the optimum value of the LP ( 2 ) :
Let be a value of which yields a value of for in LP ( 1 ) .
Let .
Then
Since and , we have that .
Hence
Hence is a feasible solution for LP ( 2 ) .
Hence , the value of game , is at least .
But symmetrically , we get that .
Hence we get .
The above theorem shows that for any , perturbing the entries of a payoff matrix by at most , results in a game in which the value is - close to the original value .
That is , zero - sum games are stable in - norm with respect to the value of the game .
Note , that although LP is known to be equivalent to solving a zero- sum game , linear programs are in general not stable with respect to their optimal value .
It is easy to construct examples in which slight perturbations result in an LP becoming infeasible .
Thus , the fact that zero - sum games are stable is a special property .
Non-Zero Sum Games
In general noncooperative games , there is a payoff matrix for the row player and a matrix for the column player .
The dominant solution concept is the notion of a Nash equilibrium , which is a pair of strategies such that no player has an incentive to deviate unilaterally .
This next theorem , which is really a family of examples , was found initially by Aranyak :
Theorem :
There exists a game and an - perturbation of its payoff matrices , ( ) , such that the payoffs of the Nash equilibria in the resulting game are arbitrarily far away from the payoffs of the Nash equilibria of the original game .
Proof : Consider the following game the payoff matrix for the row player is , , , .
For the column player , , , .
This refers to the above Figure .
Since the first row of is dominating , it follows that the only Nash equilibrium of the game is achieved when the row player chooses the first row and the column player chooses the first column .
This results in a payoff tuple of .
Suppose we modify to , and to 0 ( right side of Figure ) .
The second row is now dominating and the payoffs in the ( unique ) Nash equilibrium of the game are for the row player and for the column player .
To get “ arbitrarily ” away , we need only re-scale the game .
Another Example
For another example consider a special case of the Leontief utility model in which each agent comes with an initial endowment of unit of a distinct good and the utility of an agent for a bundle is the minimum of the linear functions
where is the coefficient of good with respect to agent .
Hence the input to the problem is the matrix .
Theorem :
The problem of computing a market equilibrium in a Leontief economy is not stable .
This follows directly from the paper “ The complexity of equilibria : Hardness results for economies via a correspondence with games ” by Bruno Codenotti , Amin Saberi , Kasturi Varadarajan , and Yinyu Ye .
Open Problems
The min-max value of a zero - sum game is stable , while the Nash equilibria and other problems are not stable under perturbations of the matrix entries .
It seems important to carry out a stability analysis for other economic solution concepts .
In particular :
Are market equilibrium prices in the Arrow - Debreu model of markets stable ?
Is the Shapley value stable ?
Pick your favorite other economic problem is that stable ?
One approach to the first question is based on the beautiful result of by Nikhil Devanur , Christos Papadimitriou , Amin Saberi , and Vijay Vazirani in the important case of linear utilities .
Is their algorithm stable ?
Another approach would be to use the explicit convex programs that have been discovered for this problem .
Another important question is to investigate if there is any connections between stability and efficient computation ?
In our original manuscript ( with Vangelis and Aranyak ) we also thought about reductions between economic problems .
We had an idea that , perhaps , there could be no reduction from an unstable problem to a stable one , under some reasonable notion of reduction .
This seems like an interesting direction also to follow .
Accenture , the outsourcing giant , is switching its accounting base from Bermuda to Ireland , amid growing policial hostility towards tax havens and tax avoidance .
Announcing the move on Tuesday , Accenture said it does not expect any impact on its financial results or tax treatment .
Accenture chairman William Green said : " A member of the European Union , Ireland offers a sophisticated , well - developed corporate , legal and regulatory environment .
" It also has a long history of international investment and long - established commercial relationships , trade agreements and tax treaties with European Union member states , the United States and other countries around the world where Accenture does business . "
The Obama administration is set to bring in laws to clamp down on avoidance , which is prompting many large firms to look to sympathetic tax regimes in Europe .
In its regulatory filing , Accenture said the new laws had in part motivated its flight from Bermuda .
Unlike Bermuda , Ireland has tax treaties with the US , which Accenture believes will bring it " economic benefits " as the new rules bite .
Ireland , which has long sought to attract technology firms with tax breaks , is expected to benefit from the US clampdown , along with Switzerland . ®

ESA PR 10-2009
Two of the most ambitious missions ever attempted to unveil the secrets of the darkest , coldest and oldest parts of the Universe got off to a successful start this afternoon with the dual launch of ESA ’s far infrared space telescope Herschel and cosmic background mapper Planck on an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe 's Spaceport in French Guiana .
Herschel , equipped with the largest mirror ever launched into space , will observe a mostly uncharted part of the electromagnetic spectrum so as to study the birth of stars and galaxies as well as dust clouds and planet - forming discs around stars .
In addition , it will be the most effective tool ever devised to look for the presence of water in remote parts of the Universe .
Planck is designed to map tiny irregularities in fossil radiation left over from the very first light in the Universe , emitted shortly after the Big Bang .
Planck will have enough sensitivity to reach the experimental limits of what can be observed , thus peering into the early Universe and studying its constituents such as the elusive dark matter and dark energy that continue to be a puzzle to the science community worldwide .
A Journey to L2 Both of these highly sophisticated spacecraft were lofted into space atop an Ariane 5 ECA vehicle from Europe ’s spaceport in Kourou , French Guiana , at 13:12 UTC ( 15:12 CEST ) today , Thursday 14 May 2009 .
Almost 26 minutes later , and about two minutes from each other , they were released separately on an escape trajectory toward a virtual point in space , called L2 , some 1.5 million kilometres from Earth in the opposite direction to the Sun.
Herschel and Planck are currently on a highly elongated orbit that will eventually bring them to an average distance of about 1.5 million km from the Earth .
Since the acquisition of the first radio signals from the two satellites at 15:49 today , they have now come under the control of ESA ’s European Space Operations Centre ( ESOC ) in Darmstadt , Germany .
Both appear to be in nominal condition on their way towards their final orbit around L2 .
Their first trajectory correction manoeuvres are scheduled for tomorrow .
After about two months , the two satellites will begin their scientific observations from two separate orbits around L2 , where the combined pull of the Earth and Sun creates a gravitational stability point .
Once there , undisturbed by thermal and radiation interference caused by the Sun , the Earth or the Moon , Herschel will observe pre-selected celestial targets , while Planck will perform a continuous survey of the overall sky .
Herschel separates from upper stage “ With Herschel we can resume the pioneering work undertaken with ISO , ESA ’s first infrared space observatory operating in the second half of the 90s , and we are building upon the experience gained to date by the world wide scientific community in the field of infrared astronomy , ” said David Southwood , ESA Director of Science and Robotic Exploration .
“ We now have much more advanced technology at our disposal .
Together with our partners across the world and with the scientific community , which have been waiting for this unique moment for a long time , we will work hard to fulfil Herschel ’s ambitious promise , confident that we will achieve a revolutionary breakthrough in the urgent quests of today ’s space science . ”
“ Planck is ESA ’s first mission dedicated to the study of relic radiation from the Big Bang , designed to continue the marvellous work undertaken over the last 20 years by Russia ’s Relikt , and NASA ’s COBE and WMAP satellites , ” Professor Southwood continued .
“ With Planck , we are pushing the boundaries of our knowledge to the very limits of what can be observed according to theory .
It is a tremendous technical challenge but helping to bring about a great leap forward in our understanding of the origin and perhaps the fate of our Universe will be a tremendous reward too ! ”
“ This dual launch is the crowning of some 20 years of hard work for the scientists who imagined these missions , the engineers who designed these satellites , the firms that built them and the ESA staff who coordinated all these efforts , ” said ESA ’s Director General , Jean - Jacques Dordain .
“ This marvellous work could never have been accomplished without the commitment of all of ESA 's Member States , which have consistently ensured that Space Science remains the backbone of our activities .
An outstanding Space Science programme shaped by scientific communities across Europe , driving innovation , and embedding new technologies for the benefit of all citizens . ”
Planck separates from upper stage “ Herschel and Planck are the most complex science satellites ever built in Europe .
They were developed by an industrial team led by Thales Alenia Space France and comprising more than 100 contractors from 15 countries in Europe and the United States .
The instruments on both satellites , and the Planck telescope , were provided by consortia of European laboratories and institutes led by France , Italy , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom , Germany and Denmark , with a major contribution from scientific institutions in other countries such as the United States and Canada , ” Dordain added .
“ Herschel and Planck will enable us to go very far back in time , to the origins of our Universe and it is only by better understanding our Universe ’s overall past that we can help to better define the future of our planet , the Earth , not as a self - standing celestial body but as an integral part of the whole system , ” Dordain concluded .

Ian , Mark , Keeniacs , Friends , and Family ,
It ’s the first Wednesday after my arrest .
I ’m writing this thanks to the kindness of the other prisoners here .
I have n’t cooperated with the state up to this point .
I was completely isolated and cut off from the world until yesterday .
I ’m sure there are questions , so I ’ll do my best to explain .
I was at the court to get a copy of the sign on the wall restricting cameras in the lobby .
Lance the court security person had previously claimed it ’s an order .
Only problem , orders are signed by the issuing judge .
This order and the one obtained from the court clerk had no signature .
This is clearly an attempt by Judge Burke ( or whoever wrote it ) to usurp power , in direct opposition to District Court Rule 1.3 , which allows judges control over proceedings , and place very stringent guidelines explaining when freedom of the press and the public ’s right to open courts may be restricted .
What did you expect from a man appointed to a lifetime dictatorship by His Excellency the Governor – a nice little holdover from the days of King George , that remain in the New Hampshire constitution .
Talk about isolated from market signals … this must change .
Okay , the screaming .
I went to the court wearing a silver 1 / 4 inch thick cuff bracelet with flat edges .
It has very sharp corners , and the flat end makes 4 sharp points .
I was handcuffed over the bracelet .
As they dragged me the bracelet tangled even further with the handcuffs and began grinding into the bone .
The pain was severe and intense .
The cuffs were not locked , and they tightened an additional 2 clicks .
The guards were amused at my screaming , and told me to keep faking it and putting on a show .
Once they dragged me to the star chamber behind the courtroom , the cuffs were loosened and locked .
The bracelet was tangled and left in place .
I explained to the Keene PD who responded that he , as a Certified Peace Officer in the state of New Hampshire , which he confirmed , had a duty to arrest Lance for violation of 18 U.S.C. 242 and 241 , acting under color of law to deny me in my rights , .
His response , ” I do n’t care about that . ”
Funny is n’t it ?
How many times have we all heard the bureaucrats say , “ it ’s the law ! ”
Of course they mean as it applies to the subjects .
The Keene PD officer was angered that I brought out the violence that backs his every request .
I do n’t think he saw me as a human being in that moment .
It sends them off the deep end when people do n’t acknowledge their authority , and force them to show the gun in the room .
He yanked me up off the floor so hard , I floated weightless for a split second before being jerked towards the door .
I screamed in pain .
He mocked me and again told me to “ play it up . ”
And for all this , I forgive them .
I understand now why Lt. Shane Maxfield is angered by our acts of civil disobedience .
He knows “ the system ” up close and personal .
He knows the government has no issue throwing away as many lives as it takes to retain its control and legitimacy .
Police want us to look upon them as heroes , when in fact , most of them are cowards : scared of speaking out against the monster they have helped create , all the while collecting a paycheck , counting on that government pension , and telling themselves , “ it ’s the law . ”
Having seen the destruction and injustice , most of them cower at the thought of doing anything that might turn this out of control monster upon them .
“ Use the system , ” they say , “ After all , it ’s much much safer that way . ”
The problem , and what I have taken a stand to change … the government ’s monopoly on the legitimate use of force .
How does one go about using a system to change the bedrock upon which all of its actions depend ?
I believe the answer lies in educating and enlightening people to the ideas of freedom and liberty .
Once they do , a more fair , humane , and just solution will quickly evolve .
Once they dragged me out of the car at Keene PD , they saw the severe bruising and the lacerations .
From that point on I was treated with great care and respect , minus one thing .
I was dragged into a cell , and when I did n’t consent to the quetions and exercised my right to remain silent , one of the cops shouted something in anger and slamemd the cage door like a 4 year old throwing a temper tantrum .
I smiled in my understanding that he ’s only angry at himself , or more to the point , what I have shown him about himself .
I was quickly transported to the Cheshire Country Caging Facility .
I was dragged into the visitation room .
Before removing the handcuffs , I was told if I moved I would be sprayed .
The sadist guard then suggested getting the taser .
Luckily the man uncuffing me understood what I was doing and held my arm against my chest so I would n’t be tear gassed .
I was eventually dragged into a holding cell in a noisy booking room where the lights were kept on 24 hours a day .
I was once awoken to a 6 ’ 3 ″ imposing man barking questions .
He did n’t like my answers and left .
Some might consider these to be sleep deprivation tactics .
I stayed there for 2 days without a toothbrush , toilet paper , or even soap .
Until I scratched “ FreeKeene.com , there is a better way ” into the rubber wall of the holding cell .
Then I was stripped out of my street clothes , dressed in prison orange , and moved into a solitary max - security cage called E Block , where I sit now on Thursday morning writing this .
Yesterday I was delivered an order from Judicial Dictator Burke .
Apparently they held a hearing without me .
I ’ve been charged with 3 Class A misdemeanors carrying up to 3 years in jail , with a $ 10,000 cash bail .
The order says I have options ; I can motion the court , hire a lawyer , bond out , etc .
Only problem ?
The jail wo n’t allow me to use the phone , write a letter , petition the court , unless … I consent to their authority and tell them everything they want to know .
You see , in New Hampshire , rights guaranteed by the government are only given to those who bow before the government ’s authority .
Otherwise , they are perfect willing to railroad me through the system , throw away 3 years of my life , cost the tazpayers over $ 100,000 dollars ; all to be right about a system that boasts a 5 % rehabilitation rate .
Any animal trainer will tell you positive reinforcement is the way to change behavior .
The current system is designed to control , restrict , anger , and enrage .
When the prisoners lash out as expected , the state comes crashing down upon them .
The lesson ?
The state ’s authority cannot be challenged .
“ We will break you , so submit to our whims like a good slave . ”
This brings me back to Burke ’s order .
All of the terms are subject to change if I ’ll just consent , and he ’s awaiting my response , which I can provide once I consent .
I ’ve been on a hunger strike since I arrived .
The guards are moving past their initial response of anger , to curiosity .
They have started coming by asking why I wo n’t eat .
I did n’t have an answer at first .
I would simply tell them , “ I ’ll eat when I ’m free . ”
Now I understand my motives .
The state has taken away almost all of my freedoms .
This is one of the few choices I have left .
The fact is , I own me , at least until the state ’s doctors decide they need to take that are from me as well .
I ’ve told them I will consent , as they are willing to throw my life away to be right about their system .
Gandhi saiid it best : “ First the laugh at you , then they fight you , then you win . ”
They ’re done laughing at us , now New Hampshire is taking political prisoners .
The jailers have n’t known quite what to do with me , as they are used to dealing with anger and resentment .
I have only love and compassion to give .
That said , the jailers have gone out of their way to be polite and curtious , and for this , I commend them .
As the government will learn , what you resist , persists .
What we need are people who have the courage to take a stand for freedom in the face of tyranny .

NOTE : This is a quick port to the web of text I first wrote around 15 plus years ago .
If any obvious mistakes from my hurried reformatting are detected , I 'd appreciate hearing about them for correction .
Thanks !
Also , a better introduction and ' how - to ' are forthcoming .
In a looks - obsessed world , are blind people immune to appearances when they fall in love ?
As a new film looks at how sight - impaired people find romance , Damon Rose who is blind , says you do n't have to be sighted to be shallow .
There are many questions that blind people find themselves fielding regularly .
There 's the one about whether you can see in your dreams , the one about how you know where your mouth is when eating ... but the other , and possibly most surprising of all , is the one that goes : " How do you fancy someone if you can't see them ? "
To answer the question simply and directly , blind people will tell you that it 's the voice , brain and personality which initially catch the eye , or in this case , ear .
It 's a good understandable answer .
Everyone hears attractive voices on the radio .
Voices are powerful organs that convey humour , quirkiness , intelligence , sweetness and attitude .
How I 'd love to be able to sit here and tell you that blind people are without prejudice ... that 's just not true
Your voice is the mouthpiece for the brain , it communicates your personality very effectively .
Though love at first sight may happen for people blessed with eyes , love after first discussion is the closest you 'll get to it if you can't see .
I 've often thought that " sighties " might be just a little bit disabled by having vision .
I 've seen friends chasing people for their looks yet getting hurt very badly because their beauty is only skin deep , their personality somewhat rotten .
But good looks and attraction can be complex for blind people .
And oh how I 'd love to be able to sit here and tell you that blind people are without prejudice : not caring if you 're a prince or whether you 're plug ugly and that we do n't care about such superficial matters .
Sadly , that 's just not true .
It 's impossible to live in the UK and not soak up discussions about beauty and presentability .
It matters to everyone else , so of course it matters to us by proxy .
Blonde ambitions
When I was a teenager , I went to a boarding school for blind children where the sound of wildly rushing male and female hormones could be heard on every corridor .
I particularly remember a new girl arriving .
No one took much notice in her first few weeks ... until one lad said they 'd heard she was blonde .
Blind Loves is a Slovakian film featuring four sight - impaired people
She may have been a quiet shrinking violet but she suddenly started getting a lot of attention after her hair colour was made known .
Of course , few of her admirers could see her crowning glory , or even knew that blonde was a kind of light yellowy brown , but because " blondes " are talked about as desirable , and dare I say thought more attractive than darker haired people , she became very popular .
Shallow , is n't it .
But beautifully so .
Similarly , a blind friend of mine fell completely head over heels in love with a girl he thought the world of .
They started dating .
He talked about her all the time and , as mates do , he stopped going down the pub and started to prefer homemade meals and a nice bottle of wine with his loved one .
I remember him saying how much he liked her soft voice and her perfume .
They had similar politics , liked the same films , read the same books - a match made in heaven .
Then , his brother met her , unpleasantly told him she looked " a right dog " and my friend dumped her .
She was devastated ... and he started going to the Red Lion again .
I found it terribly sad but half understood where he was coming from .
So insecure was he about the world and what image and attractiveness meant , that he felt he had to get rid of someone who could reflect badly on him because he did n't know any better .
And on this occasion , he deferred to his brother who can see , after all .
Feat of clay Beauty is power .
Attractive people have an air about them .
They 're often very confident .
As the phrase goes ... they can walk into a room and own it .
But if the room has blind people in it , the " power " of their looks goes out of the window .
This can be confusing for people whose good looks usually count for a lot more than I 'm giving them .
Sighted ambassador for blind people - Lionel Richie and his lump of clay Let me give you an example .
I 'm at a party .
I start talking to someone .
I have no idea whether they 're good looking or not until this happens : " I just thought I 'd better tell you what I look like .
I 'm 5ft 5ins , I 've got shoulder - length blonde hair , my eyes are a deep brown colour and my skin tones are very light .
If anyone asks who was the petite one you were talking to , that 'll be me . "
Huh ?
What ?
Hello ?
How am I supposed to react to this ?
This is a situation that a number of blind friends have reported happens to them too .
In the early days I mistakenly thought I was being chatted up .
As I got a older though , I began to realise that this was more of a case study in egotism .
Some people just can't bear the idea that the blind person in the room wo n't consider them special or even worth talking to ... until they tell you how good looking they are .
The irony is that blind people tend to think less of them for doing it .
Of course , Lionel Richie has taught us that blind people are even more soulful than his music .
The video which accompanied his 1984 hit Hello featured a storyline where teacher Lionel had a seemingly unrequited love for a blind student in his art class .
At the end of the video , we discover she has feelings for him too because she modelled a likeness of his face .
Her soul touched his in a way that meant she did n't need to be able to see him to know what he looked like .
I guess the biggest insight into what blind people think is attractive is to hurl a lump of clay at them and see what they turn it into .

This article mentions perfume but makes no mention of how " natural " smells i.e. body adour , pheromones etc. affect the way a person is perceived by others ( whether fully sighted or not .
I find this very strange .
Marianna Galea Xuereb , Malta
The writer is absolutely right , we " blindies " ( is that a word ) still want to be seen partnering a good looking girl / boy .
But relationships for the blind have so many more complications than can be addressed here .
How do you make eye contact across a room , pick up a smile or a look that says " talk to me some more " etc , or even tell if someone is wearing a ring that indicates they are engaged / married .
I know several blind people who find everything to do with relationships so much more difficult , as if it is n't bad enough for " sighties " .
Ken Reid , North Berwick , Scotland
Thank you for this article .
It not only helps me to understand blindness a little ; but also helps me to understand myself .
Well done .
Dave Weston , Walton - on - Thames
There 's a reason why physical appearances matter , and they matter to everyone , probably even the blind .
It 's all about biology .
As living organisms we are drawn to fitness ( reproductive fitness ) whether we are conscious of it or not .
Perhaps the blind are less concerned with a well shaped nose and more concerned with a physically fit body .
This stuff matters , it 's etched in our DNA regardless of our physical abilities .
Mark , Seoul , Korea Fascinating !
I really enjoyed reading this .
Such an honest and humorous insight .
Kerryn , Johannesburg
A really thought - provoking article .
Bringing out the point that , even though sighted and unsighted people have some differences , underneath we are all the same .
Thanks
Geoff , York
What a sensitive , truthful and informative article .
The world today is ' looks - obsessed ' and it is all pressurised image especially young females .
Like blindness anyone with an impairment or disability are often talked at as if they are not there or less intelligent .
Articles like this gladly set the record straight .
tim mcmahon , pennar / wales Looks are n't everything but they do indicate reproductive health , which is an understandable selection mechanism for a mate .
Why should n't blind people be as interested as anyone else in this aspect of a potential partner ?
Tom Kennedy , Montpellier , France I once went out with a blind girl , but our relationship was spoiled by her so called friends who told her I was only going out with her because I felt sorry for her !
I rather suspect that they thought if she took up with a sighted person , she would leave them behind .
Alan , Cumbria
It 's not something I 've considered before but has made me rethink my own views .
Annabelle , London
Not sure I 'm ever going to give a blind person a lump of clay in that case .

Space Telescope Institute Spike : Hubble Telescope Scheduling System
The problem of optimal spacecraft scheduling is both important and difficult .
Efficient utilization of spacecraft resources is essential , but the accompanying scheduling problems are often computationally intractable and are difficult to approximate because of the pressures of numerous interacting constraints .
Although the fundamental requirements of optimal spacecraft scheduling are similar in many ways to those of other scheduling problems , encountered in commercial and industrial settings , the problems have been found to be notoriously difficult to solve in practical settings .
Spike is an activity - oriented scheduling system developed at Space Telescope Institute for scheduling the Hubble Space Telescope .
The overall approach adopted in Spike was inspired by advances in artificial intelligence research .
Spike also incorporates several novel features including an innovative constraint representation and reasoning mechanism , and a new type of search technique motivated by research on artificial neural networks .
This new approach is intended to tackle the four notable features of spacecraft scheduling that make it a difficult problem : interacting constraints , uncertainty , optimization criteria , and search .
For more information on Spike and the Space Telescope Institute , please visit http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/spike/.

Guitar Amplifier Guide
Your guitar amplifier can make the difference between really enjoying the great tone of your guitar , or creating frustration from lack of features , lack of volume , hum , or other problems .
The popular Fender Blues Junior Electric Guitar Amp
What are the most important factors to consider when you shop ?
Does it matter if you have an acoustic , or electric amp ?
How much should you pay ?
How much does a guitar amplifier cost ?
What features should you look for ?
How do amps work ?
How An Amplifier Works
To understand why you might want to purchase one type of amplifier over another , you first need to understand the basic components that make guitar amplification possible .
Many of the boxes sold as guitar amplifiers are actually a combination amplifier , effects processors , and one or more speakers .
Technically , the " amplifier " is just one part of the system ... the part that increases the signal from your guitar so you ( and others ) can hear it .
The rest of the box is : the cabinet , to hold all the other components ; the effects processors , to modify the incoming sound ; front panel knobs , dials or buttons , to control the volume and effects ; and the speakers , so produce audible sound .
Amplification Illustrated
Take a look at the illustration , below .
It 's a simplified look at the actual amplification part of the system .
Working from left to right , here 's what might happen :
The cable from your guitar plugs into the Input Jack .
Sound from your guitar enters a Pre -Amp as a weak signal .
The Pre -Amp increases it 's strength slightly .
The signal might pass through one or more devices that alter the signal , creating effects such as distortion .
A master volume control determines how much strength the signal should have as it exits the amplifier .
A second signal amplification device increases the signal .
The signal passes on to a speaker ( either built in to the same box , or connected by a cable ) .
Not All Amplifiers Are The Same
Manufacturer 's build and market guitar amplifiers specifically for acoustic guitars , electric guitars , bass guitars , voice , and for other purposes .
So , unless you want to experiment or find a unique sound , start with an amplifier made for your type of instrument .
Most manufacturer web sites , product guides , and online store - fronts make it clear which amplifiers are made for a particular type of instrument .
An Amplifier For Every Budget
Mass production , global workforces , and intense competition mean that today 's guitar amplifiers are better quality and lower - cost than ever before .
Computer and transistor technologies provide improved sound processing and a wide variety of sound effects .
Want feedback ?
Modern amps can simulate it .
Like reverb ?
It 's getting hard to find an amplifier without it .
Want echo , tone shift , play - along percussion , or a built - in tuner ?
How about recreating a famous amplifier no longer in production ?
Modern amplifiers can provide all these features .
In general , more extensive features and power drive costs up .
However , some of the very best guitar amplifiers at both ends of the price spectrum do little more than increase the volume of the sound you send it ... but they do this one thing very well .
The key cost factors with such bare - bones amplifiers are power ( the ability to produce loud volume ) and purity of sound .
Take heart , while writing this I surveyed prices and found a number of very good amplifiers , with generous features , for less than $ 300 ( USD ) .
Behringer 's ULTRACOUSTIC AT108 Case
Roland Cube 15
The Behringer ULTRACOUSTIC AT108 ( left , for acoustic guitars ) and the Roland Cube 15X ( right , for electrics ) are great budget amps .
For under $ 100 you get a CD input , headphone jack , and enough power to fill a room .
Many Shapes and Sizes
When you begin shopping for an amplifier , you will find numerous shapes , sizes and configurations .
Do n't worry , after reading this amplifier guide you will understand the combinations available , and be ready to select the right amp for you .
All In One Combo Systems
The most popular and versatile guitar amplifier is the Combo Amp. Think ' Combination of Everything ' .
It 's a convenient , all - in - one package .
Amplification , speakers , inputs , special effects .
What more could you ask for ?
You can find a combo amp of just about every shape and size , for just about any need , in a wide range of prices .
For a beginner player , it 's hard to recommend anything else .
Of course ...
A Head + A Cabinet = A Stack
For players who need power , and lots of it ... or who need power now and MORE POWER in the future ... a stack is the way to go .
To put a stack together , you need at least two boxes : the Head and a Cabinet .
Imagine if a snowman were your guitar amplifier ;-)
If he was made of amplifier stack parts , his head would be the Amp Head ( the power part of the system ) .
His eyes , nose , etc. would be the built - in effects controls , and our snowman 's body would be one or more speaker cabinets .
Manufacturers produce heads of various power ratings .
They also make cabinets to match the appearance of their heads .
This way , when you place a head on a matching cabinet it looks like a set .
In addition , the matched cabinet provides a stable platform .
The primary advantage of a stack is the flexibility you have to change your set up over time as your needs change .
Need more power ?
Sell your head and buy one that pumps out more volume .
Need additional effects ?
Plug in an effects processor .
Want more bass response ?
Get a new speaker cabinet .
On the down side ... combo's take up more space , tend to be more expensive , and are less portable than all - in - one combo systems .
Transistors or Tubes ?
Yes ... they still make tubes ... musicians love them and no amplifier guide is complete without discussing them !
Tubes are still used because of the tone they help produce .
There are players , engineers , and audiophiles who believe that the warmest tones and best sounds can only be obtained with a tube - based guitar amplifier .
SIDEBAR : Some people and companies refer to tubes as " valves " .
When you see " tubes " in this amplifier guide , feel free to substitute " valves " in your mind .
You can affect the sound of a tube amp when you replace burned - out tubes .
You must match tube types ( a square peg wo n't fit in a round hole ) , but tubes from a different manufacturer may change your sound in subtle , or obvious ways .
Various manufacturers try to differentiate themselves with subtle engineering differences and slight differences in sound reproduction .
This may or may not be important to you .
For many years , all guitar amplifiers were built around tubes .
The mass production of transistors allowed manufacturers to experiment with them in amps .
In general , transistors are cheaper , less likely to burn out , and can be controlled more precisely than tubes .
Ironically , today 's transistor amplifier systems are often programmed to replicate the sounds produced by the classic tube - based systems .
Are tubes right for you ?
Would you be happier with an all - transistor system ?
A transistor amp is more likely to include more extra effects than a tube amp .
But the bottom line will be the sound of your guitar with no effects at all .
So , the only way to decide between tubes and transistors is to listen to a few of each type , then decide which you like best .
SIDEBAR : Here 's a guitar amplifier shopping tip :
Many of today 's tube amps are actually hybrids ... tubes are used generate a warm tone , transistors create many of the special effects .
The two main drawbacks of tube amplifiers are : tubes eventually wear out and must be replaced ; tube - based amps are more expensive than transistor based amps .
For a more in - depth explanation of tubes , see the Amplifier Tubes Explained page .
Guitar Amplifier Buying Tips
Choose Carefully
First , do n't underestimate the progress you can make in just a couple years .
Today you may think any guitar amplifier will do .
But , before you now it you 'll need to produce enough volume to be heard along with a group of friends ... perhaps in a basement , or maybe a community center or church hall .
An amp that is OK at home in a bedroom is wholly inadequate for spacious rooms .
So , choose carefully .
You want an amp that has enough power to grow with your developing talent for at least two or three years .
Listen Carefully
The key to selecting a great amplifier is not how great you can play , it 's how well the amp sounds .
A great musician can make you ignore the flaws of an O.K. amp , but you 're not a great musician yet , and you do n't want an O.K. amp !
If you can , play through every amp you 're interested in .
Get a sense for it 's tone , but also listed to how quiet it is when you 're not playing anything at all .
Avoid any guitar amplifier that puts out any loud sound when nothing is connected to it : hum , hiss , crackle ... anything loud .
Get a guitar amplifier that is capable of producing great sound , even at medium volume levels .
What 's a medium volume level ?
Loud enough to get your parents or room - mate to complain .
You do n't need anything louder .
If you ever need to produce more sound you can either purchase a new , more powerful amp and cabinet , or use a microphone to pump your amplifier output into a P.A. system .
Nothing will discourage a new player more than the inability to have fun and produce improved tone over time ... so go for great sound .
Check The Controls
The controls ( knobs , dials , sliders ) should be easy to use .
They should have a smooth feel to them and you should be able to hear the effect when you increase or decrease each knob .
Are The Effects Effective ?
The number of effects is only important if you 'll use each one .
Chance are you 'll play with most of the effects , set the amp the way you like the sound , and almost never adjust them again .
What effects and controls should you consider ?
Nearly every amp should have the basics : volume , bass , and treble .
Other important effects and features are : reverb , an auxiliary input ( for a CD , MP - 3 player , or other accompaniment , headphone output .
If your guitar uses an XLR output , then you want a balanced input jack .
Get Informed Opinions
When you 've never shopped for a guitar amplifier before , where do you start ?
What 's a good company ?
Which model is a great deal ?
No amplifier guide can answer these questions for every player ... so , get informed opinions .
How ?
Ask your instructor , ask your friends , or rely upon web - sites that provide user reviews , such as Musician 's Friend .
How Much Should You Pay ?
The Amplifier Guide " Rule of Thumb " : be prepared to pay up to what you paid for your guitar .
However , good starter amplifiers are available starting at about $ 100 , and there are many very good amps in the $ 300 - $ 400 range .
Amplifier Guide Bottom Line
Do n't skimp on your first amplifier .
A less expensive electric guitar can be upgraded piece by piece , a flawed amp cannot .
If you purchase an amp that performs O.K. , you 'll quickly come to dislike its sound more than you disliked its price .
Jon Kyl , Senate Republican's # 2
" Hopefully the president wo n't nominate someone here who is so far out of the mainstream in terms of the way he or she approaches deciding cases that we wo n't have to do that , " Kyl said .
" In extraordinary circumstances , both Democrats and Republicans reserve the right to not only oppose a nomination , but also prevent the vote on a nomination .
That should be a rare case , and I would hope that the president 's nominee would not fall into that category .
But I think you never say never here , given the fact that the president has already signaled that he wants someone with empathy , and who will decide cases based on that .
I think you have to reserve it . "
I have n't studied their backgrounds to any great extent .
I 'm waiting until it 's narrowed down , till you see who 's really out there .
But as sort of an author of the words " extraordinary circumstances , " I do understand that there can be certain circumstances where you would -- you might vote against somebody on the filibuster .
But let me just say it this way .
I do n't care whether they 're liberal or conservative .
I just want to make sure they 're not activist .
I do n't want an activist on the -- on the bench .
When I was governor , I appointed almost 81-- over 81 judges -- the entire Nebraska supreme court , two chief justices , the entire court of appeals , and that was my -- I had no litmus test , but I did have a test , and that was did I believe that they were going to apply the law or were they going to be an activist and try to engineer the law .
Quite honestly , I think we want to read the law .
We do n't want to have to read judges ' minds .
So I think that 's the test -- will they be an activist or not -- and I -- I would hope that there would n't be any circumstances that would be so extreme with any of the president 's nominees that the other side would feel the need to filibuster or that I might feel the need to filibuster in a case of extraordinary circumstances .
That 's what the Gang of 14 was all about .
Arizona wingnut and corporate shill Jon Kyl is n't the most extreme member of the Senate .
According to Progressive Punch 's algorithm of every single vote in their careers , there are 7 members of the Senate ever so slightly to the right of Kyl : Richard Burr ( R- NC ) , Jim DeMint ( R- SC ) , Michael Enzi ( R - WY ) , Jim Inhofe ( R - OK ) , Jim Bunning ( R - KY ) , John Cornyn ( R - TX ) , and John Barrasso ( R - WY ) .
All other 91 members -- and not including Al Franken ( D - MN ) -- are more in tune with the American political mainstream than Kyl .
Very few members , however , are as in tune with the wishes of corporate America as Senator Kyl is .
Always more than willing to lend a hand to any wealthy , powerful business interests who " donate " to his political career , Kyl has faithfully served the interests of the banksters , a payback for the $ 3,711,808 they " contributed " to his campaigns , just as he 's always taken the interests of the medical - industrial complex to heart in return for their $ 1,971,468 .
One thing about Kyl though , as big a whore as he is for the rich and powerful , sometimes he just does things because he's an extremist sociopath , like when he recently sponsored Dutch neo- Nazi Geert Wilders ' trip to speak to America 's most fanatic right - wingers .
Aside from being McConnell 's # 2 in the Senate hierarchy , Kyl is also one of the most ruthlessly partisan members of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Within days of Obama 's election last November , while the mainstream part of America was celebrating that the nightmare was ending , Kyl was hysterically screeching that Obama would get no honeymoon and that if Obama tried to use " empathy " as a criteria for nominating judges , he would lead a filibuster to prevent confirmation .
Yep , Kyl was the first bonehead to start attacking Obama for suspicion of empathy --!
Most other rightists at least waited for the first Supreme Court vacancy before they started fulminating and threatening .
Real news stations usually prefer to shy away from pathetic and predictable hacks like Kyl , especially on Sundays , but he was Chris Wallace 's guest ontoday .
Aside from all the laughable party talking points , Kyl gave away the far right 's filibuster strategy : rope in the Gang of 14 by persuading them that whomever Obama nominates fits the " extraordinary circumstances " that merit filibuster .
And , aside from inviting on one of the most right - wing members of the Republican caucus on the show , the fair and balanced network also invited the indisputablyright - wing Democrat , Nebraska shithead -- and Gang of 14 zealot -- Ben Nelson , who , like his pal Kyl , also has a tendency to always vote in the interests of his biggest corporate contributors .
Needless to say , he agreed with Kyl in his own pseudo - moderate way :
This was n't a threat to lead an impeachment effort against hard right activist John Roberts .
It was an attempt to intimidate the very intimidatable Democratic president .
Two members of the Gang of 14 were defeated at the polls , Mike DeWine ( R - OH ) and Lincoln Chafee ( R - RI ) , and two , John Warner ( R - VA ) and Ken Salazar ( D - CO ) , resigned , but the 0ther 8 -- Lindsey Graham ( R- SC ) , Olympia Snowe ( R- ME ) , Susan Collins ( R- ME ) , John McCain ( R - AZ ) , Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) , Nelson ( D - NE ) , Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) , Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) , Daniel Inouye ( D - HI ) and Mark Pryor ( D - AR ) could easily find a whole gaggle of disloyal new -- and not so new -- Democrats who are champing at the bit to show the constituents back home how tough they are on their own president .
The obvious place to look for new members would be among the Evan Bayh anti-Obama Bloc , especially , Bayh ( D - IN ) himself , plus Blanche Lincoln ( D - AR ) and Michael Bennet ( D - CO ) .
Other Conservadems
Kyl could turn to include still - a- Republican - at - heart Arlen Specter ( D - PA ) , Kay Hagan ( D - NC ) , Max Baucus ( D - MT ) , Mark Begich ( D - AK ) , Tom Carper ( D - DE ) , Mark Udall ( D - CO ) , Jon Tester ( D - MT ) , Jim Webb ( D - VA ) , Mark Warner ( D - VA ) , Tim Johnson ( D - SC ) and , depending on the weather or what she ate or whatever loony way she decides what she 's going to be on any particular day , Claire McCaskill ( D - MO ) .
I 'm sure Kyl can cobble together a fine filibuster effort from that crew .
Labels : Ben Nelson , conservadems , Gang of 14 , Jon Kyl , Obama 's judicial nominees , obstructionist Republicans , reactionary Democrats , Supreme Court
A health official says Norway has confirmed its first two cases of swine flu .
National Health Directorate spokeswoman Anne Kirkhusmo says a man and a woman , both aged 20 , were infected .
The pair had been studying in Mexico , the epicenter of the swine flu outbreak .
Kirkhusmo says they were doing well and had not been to hospital .
Two other Scandinavian countries , Sweden and Denmark , earlier confirmed one case each of swine flu .
PARIS — President Nicolas Sarkozy opened France ’s first military facilities in the Gulf on Tuesday , deepening the government ’s alliance with the United Arab Emirates and highlighting its shifting foreign policy priorities .
Mr. Sarkozy attended a ceremony to open French naval , air and army facilities in Abu Dhabi .
The bases are the first permanent French military installations to be built outside of French territory since the process of decolonization began more than half a century ago .
The Gulf is of geopolitical importance both because of its gas and oil resources and because of its proximity to Iran .
Abu Dhabi sits just 225 kilometers , or 140 miles , directly across the Gulf from Iran .
“ The permanent French military installation in Abu Dhabi shows the responsibility that France , as a global power , agrees to assume with its closest partners , in a region that is a fault line for the whole world , ” Mr. Sarkozy said in the text of a speech delivered in the Emirate .

j Query vs MooTools
Most people getting started with JavaScript these days are faced with the challenging task of picking a library to use , or at least which one to learn first .
If you 're working for a company chances are they have already chosen a framework for you , in which case the point is somewhat moot .
If this is the case and they 've chosen MooTools and you 're used to jQuery , then this article might still be of some use to you .
Every day on twitter I see numerous posts that boil down to " MooTools or jQuery ? "
This article aims to help you make that choice .
Disclaimer
I am a MooTools developer .
I work on the MooTools framework .
I blog about MooTools .
I wrote the main online tutorial and the book about MooTools .
Obviously , I have a perspective that is somewhat biased .
I 'll also point out that I do n't use jQuery that often .
If you 're a jQuery developer and see anything that I have misrepresented here , please contact me and help me rectify the issue .
My objective here is to be helpful and accurate to people - not to sell one framework over another .
Purpose
Helping you make a choice between these two frameworks involves me telling you how they are different .
I 'll start out by saying that both of them are excellent choices .
You can't make a wrong choice here .
Both frameworks have their strengths and weaknesses , but , in general , they are both great choices .
There are other frameworks out there that are worth digging into as well .
Dojo , Prototype , YUI , Ext and others are all great choices .
Which one you choose really has more to do with your own style and what you need to accomplish .
The purpose of this article is to focus on MooTools and jQuery , as increasingly these are the two frameworks that I see a lot of people considering .
Finally , I 'm not trying to convince anyone to switch from one framework to the other .
There are interesting things about both frameworks from which you can learn .
You can read a little more about this article and why I wrote it in my blog post on Clientcide where I announced it .

The Mottos Say It All
If you go to the jQuery site , here 's what it says at the top of the page :
j Query is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing , event handling , animating , and Ajax interactions for rapid web development .
jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript .
... and if you go to MooTools , this is what you 'll find :
MooTools is a compact , modular , Object - Oriented JavaScript framework designed for the intermediate to advanced JavaScript developer .
It allows you to write powerful , flexible , and cross - browser code with its elegant , well documented , and coherent API .
I think this really sums it up .
If you ask me ( and you 're reading this , so I 'll assume you just have ) , the question is n't about which framework is better or worse .
It 's which one of these things above do you want to do ?
These two frameworks just are n't trying to do the same things .
They overlap in the functionality they provide , but they are not trying to do the same things .
j Query 's description of itself talks about HTML , events , animations , Ajax , and web development .
MooTools talks about object oriented - ness and writing powerful and flexible code .
j Query aspires to " change the way you write JavaScript " while MooTools is designed for the intermediate to advanced JavaScript developer .
Part of this consideration is the notion of a framework vs a toolkit .
MooTools is a framework that attempts to implement JavaScript as it should be ( according to MooTools ' authors ) .
The aim is to implement an API that feels like JavaScript and enhances everything ; not just the DOM .
jQuery is a toolkit that gives you an easy to use collection of methods in a self - contained system designed to make the DOM itself more pleasant .
It just so happens that the DOM is where most people focus their effort when writing JavaScript , so in many cases , jQuery is all you need .
Most of the code you write when you write MooTools still feels like JavaScript .
If you are n't interested in JavaScript as a language , then learning MooTools is going to feel like a chore .
If you are interested in JavaScript and what makes it interesting , powerful , and expressive , then , personally , I think MooTools is the better choice .
The Learning Curve and The Community
First , jQuery is , by and large , easier to learn .
It has an almost colloquial style that almost does n't feel like programming .
If all you want is to get something working quickly without learning JavaScript , jQuery is probably a better choice for you .
It 's not that MooTools can't help you accomplish the same things , but I 'll admit that MooTools can be a little harder to get the hang of if you 're new to JavaScript and also that there are just a lot of resources out there to help you learn jQuery - more than there are for MooTools at least .
If you compare the jQuery community ( see the " Discussion " page on jQuery ) and the MooTools community ( irc , mailing list , and unofficial forum ) you 'll quickly discover two things : 1 ) the jQuery community is far larger ( I attribute this mostly to the point I made above about how easy it is to learn , but also because ... ) and 2 ) they are more active in promoting the library .
If you measure jQuery and MooTools on metrics like the number of people using it , the number of search queries run on Google , the number of books sold , etc , you 'll see jQuery is ahead by a wide margin .
To tell you why you might consider MooTools I 'll first need to talk a little bit about what both the frameworks do .
Ultimately which framework you choose is going to come down to what you want to accomplish and how you like to program ( and maybe even if you like to program , at least in JavaScript ) .
What JavaScript Is Good For
Part of making this choice is asking what you want to do with JavaScript .
Let 's consider vanilla JavaScript .
No framework ; just plain old JS .
JavaScript gives you native objects like Strings , Numbers , Functions , Arrays , Dates , Regular Expressions , and more .
JavaScript also gives you an inheritance model - a somewhat esoteric model called prototypal inheritance ( which I 'll talk about more later ) .
These building blocks and the concept of inheritance are the bread and butter of any programming language and they have absolutely nothing to do with browsers or the web or CSS or HTML .
You could write anything you wanted to in JavaScript .
Tic - tac - toe , chess , photoediting , a web server , whatever .
It just so happens that 99 % of all the JavaScript out there is run in browsers and that 's what we think of it as .
The programming language for browsers .
Understanding that the browser , the DOM , is just where we happen to use JS most of the time but that it 's actually a very robust and expressive programming language will help you understand the difference between MooTools and jQuery .
More Than Just The DOM
If you think of the tasks that we want to accomplish in JavaScript strictly in terms of " get stuff on the page and do stuff to it " then jQuery is probably the best choice .
It excels at offering a very expressive system for describing behavior on the page in a way that does n't feel like programming sometimes .
You can still use the rest of JavaScript to do what you want to do , but if you 're focused on the DOM - changing CSS properties , animating things , fetching content via AJAX , etc - most of what you 'll end up writing will be covered by jQuery , and what is n't will likely be plain - old JavaScript .
j Query does provide some methods that are n't about the DOM ; for example , it provides a mechanism for iterating over arrays - $ .each ( array , fn ) - or , for example , it offers a trim method for strings - $. trim ( str ) .
But there are n't a ton of these types of utility methods , which is fine because , for the most part , if you 're just getting stuff out of the DOM , iterating over them , and altering them in some way ( adding html , changing styles , adding event listeners for click and mouseover , etc ) you do n't need much else .
But if you think of JavaScript 's scope in its full breadth , you can see that jQuery does n't focus on things outside of the DOM .
This is one of the reasons it is so easy to learn , but it also limits the ways it can help you write JavaScript .
It 's just not trying to be anything other than a solid programming system for the DOM .
It does n't address inheritance nor does it address the basic utilities of all the native types in the JavaScript language , but it does n't need to .
If you want to mess around with strings , dates , regular expressions , arrays and functions , you can .
It 's just not jQuery 's job to help you do it .
JavaScript as a language is there at your feet .
j Query makes the DOM your playground , but the rest of JavaScript is just not in its scope .
This is where MooTools is vastly different .
Rather than focusing exclusively on the DOM ( though , as I 'll get into in a bit , it offers all the functionality that jQuery does but accomplishes this in a very different manner ) , MooTools takes into its scope the entire language .
If jQuery makes the DOM your playground , MooTools aims to make JavaScript your playground , and this is one of the reasons why it 's harder to learn .
Inheritance with JavaScript
The JavaScript programming language has some really awesome things about it .
For starters , it 's a functional language , which means that it treats functions as high - order objects that can be passed around as variables just like any other object - strings or numbers for example .
It 's designed with this concept in mind and many of the methods and patterns in it work best when you write code this way .
It 's the difference between :
for ( var i = 0 ; i < myArray.length ; i++) { /* do stuff */ }
and
myArray.forEach(function( item , index ) { /* do stuff */ } ) ;
JavaScript has an inheritance model that is not quite unique but at least rather rare in programming languages .
Instead of classes that are defined that can be subclassed it passes along traits through prototypal inheritance .
This means that objects inherit directly from other objects .
If you reference a property on an object that inherits from another object , the language inspects the child object for that property and , if it does n't find it , looks for it on the parent .
This is how a method on , say , an array works .
When you type :
[ 1,2,3 ] .forEach( function ( item ) { alert ( item ) } ) ; // this alerts 1 then 2 then 3
the method " forEach " is not a property of the array you declare ( [ 1,2,3 ] ) , it is a property of the prototype for all Arrays .
When you reference this method the language looks for a method called forEach on your array , and , not finding it , then looks at the prototype for all arrays .
This means that the forEach method is not in memory once for every array in memory ; it is only in memory for the prototype of arrays .
This is incredibly efficient and ultimately quite powerful .
( Side note : MooTools aliases the forEach method as each )
Self Reference
Javascript has a special word : " this " .
It 's hard for me to succinctly define what " this " is all about but , by default , " this " is the object to which the current method belongs .
It allows objects to refer to themselves within their methods as they would otherwise have no means to do so .
This becomes important when you create children objects and have numerous instances of that object ; how else could the method of an object refer to itself ?
When the actual copy of the method exists on the parent , not the child , the " this " keyword allows these instances to refer to their own state .
( here 's a much more complete description of the " this " keyword , and another from Mozilla . )
The " this " keyword allows objects that inherit from other objects to refer to themselves , but there are times when you may want to reference something else through " this " .
This is called binding , wherein you specify a different " this " for a method .
The " each " method on Array allows you to specify the bound object with a second argument .
Here 's an example of where you might want to pass in a different " this " :
var ninja = { weapons : [ ' katana ' , ' throwing stars ' , ' exploding palm technique ' ] , log : function ( message ) { console.log ( message ) ; } , logInventory : function ( ) { this.weapons.each( function ( weapon ) { // we want " this " to point to ninja ... this .log (' this ninja can kill with its ' + weapon ) ; } , this ) ; // so we pass " this " ( which is ninja ) to Array.each } } ; ninja.logInventory ( ) ; // this ninja can kill with its katana // this ninja can kill with its throwing stars // this ninja can kill with its exploding palm technique
In the example above , we bind ninja ( which is " this " inside the logInventory method ) to the method we pass to the array so that we can refer to the log property of ninja .
If we did n't do this , " this " would be window .
These are just some examples of the power and expressiveness that JavaScript has to offer - inheritance , self reference and binding , and efficient prototype properties .
The bad news is that vanilla JavaScript does n't make these powerful things very useful or accessible , and this is where MooTools starts .
It makes these types of patterns easy and rather pleasant to use .
You end up writing more abstract code , and in the long run , this is a good thing - a powerful thing .
Learning how these patterns are valuable and how to use them properly takes effort , but the up side is that the code you author is both highly reusable and much easier to maintain .
I 'll talk about these two things a bit more in a minute .
MooTools Makes JavaScript Itself More Fun
Because MooTools focuses on making the JavaScript API itself more stable and coherent , it is focused less on giving you an interface that " changes the way you write JavaScript " and more on making JavaScript as a whole less frustrating ; MooTools is an extension to the JavaScript language .
MooTools tries to make JavaScript the way it is meant to be .
A significant portion of the core library is spent on augmenting Function , String , Array , Number , Element and other prototypes .
The other big thing it offers is a function called Class .
Now , Class looks to many people like it 's trying to recreate a more classical inheritance model that one might find in Java or C++ , but that 's not the case .
What Class does is make the prototypal inheritance model of JavaScript easier for you and me to access and take advantage of .
I 'll note that these concepts are not unique to MooTools ( other frameworks offer similar functionality ) , but both of these concepts are not present in jQuery .
jQuery does not offer an inheritance system nor does it offer any enhancements to native objects ( Function , String , etc ) .
This is not a deficiency of jQuery as the authors of jQuery could easily offer these things .
Rather , they have designed a toolkit with a different goal in mind .
Where MooTools aims to make JavaScript more fun , jQuery aims to make the DOM more fun and its designers have chosen to limit their scope to that task .
j Query Makes the DOM More Fun
And this is why jQuery is more accessible .
It does n't ask that you learn JavaScript inside and out .
It does n't throw you into the deep end with prototypal inheritance , binding , " this " , and native prototypes .
When you get started with jQuery in its official tutorial , this is the first jQuery code example you find :
window.onload = function ( ) { alert ( " welcome " ) ; }
and here 's the third :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " a " ) .click ( function ( event ) { alert ( " Thanks for visiting ! " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
If you read the MooTools book or the MooTools tutorial ( both of which I authored ) they start in a much different place .
While you can skip ahead and quickly learn about effects and the DOM , if you want to learn MooTools , you have to start with things like Class , and , I 'll admit : if you 're new to programming , or you just want to get something working on your site without having to learn everything about JavaScript , chances are jQuery is going to look a lot more friendly to you .
On the other hand , if you want to learn JavaScript itself , MooTools is a great way to do it .
It implements a lot of things that JavaScript is going to have ( many of the methods on Natives are just the JavaScript 1.8 spec and beyond ) .
If you 're used to programming , especially both object oriented and functional programming , MooTools has a lot of design patterns that are very exciting and expressive .
Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better
If you look at the things jQuery can do , there 's often a counterpart in MooTools .
If you look at the things MooTools can do , there is often no way to emulate it using jQuery code because of jQuery 's focus on the DOM .
MooTools has a broader functionality than jQuery , but there 's nothing about jQuery that prevents you from doing those things .
For example , jQuery does not come with any sort of inheritance system , but that 's ok .
You could , if you want , use the MooTools Class in conjunction with jQuery if you wanted to ( or write your own ) .
There 's even an inheritance plug - in for jQuery ( I have n't used it , but I assume it offers pretty much the same kind of functionality ) .
If we look at the example from jQuery above :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " a " ) .click ( function ( event ) { alert ( " Thanks for visiting ! " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
and we wanted to translate this to MooTools , we 'd have :
window.addEvent ( ' domready ' , function ( ) { $ $ ( 'a ' ) . addEvent ( ' click ' , function ( event ) { alert ( ' Thanks for visiting ! ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
These are very similar no ?
Here 's a more complex example from jQuery :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " #orderedlist li:last " ) .hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .addClass ( " green " ) ; } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .removeClass ( " green " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
and in MooTools :
window.addEvent ( ' domready ' , function ( ) { $ $ ( ' #orderedlist li:last - child ' ) .
addEvents ( { mouseenter : function ( ) { this .addClass ( ' green ' ) ; } , mouseleave : function ( ) { this.removeClass ( ' green ' ) ; } } ) ; } ) ;
Again , very similar .
I 'd argue that the MooTools version is more explicit , but also more verbose because of it .
It 's clear reading the MooTools code that we 're adding two events - one for mouse enter and one on mouse leave , while the jQuery version is more concise ; its hover method accepts two methods - the first for mouse enter and the second for mouse leave .
I personally like the fact that the MooTools code is more legible but that 's a very subjective observation .
I will say that sometimes jQuery can become too esoteric for my taste .
The methods do n't always make sense to me just looking at them and I find it hard to parse .
This is somewhat unfair though , as I am intimately familiar with MooTools , so reading MooTools is easy for me .
But one of the things I appreciate about MooTools is how almost all the method and class names really name the thing .
Methods are almost always verbs and leave little doubt as to what they do .
Every programming language requires you to go to the docs to look up syntax when you write it - I 'm not saying that .
I 'm just saying that I find the API of MooTools to be more coherent and consistent .
MooTools Lets You Have It Your Way
But what if you like the jQuery syntax ?
One way to illustrate the power of MooTools is to show you how easy it is to change it to suit your tastes .
If we wanted to implement the hover method from jQuery in MooTools , we could easily do so :
Element.implement ({ hover : function ( enter , leave ) { return this .
addEvents ( { mouseenter : enter , mouseleave : leave } ) ; } } ) ; // and then you could use it exactly like the jQuery version : $ $ ( ' # orderlist li:last ' ) .hover ( function ( ) { this .addClass ( ' green ' ) ; } , function ( ) { this.removeClass (' green ' ) ; } ) ;
Indeed , there are MooTools plug-ins that do just that ; give you the jQuery syntax for MooTools .
MooTools ' focus on extensibility means you can implement anything you like .
This is something jQuery can't do .
MooTools can mimic jQuery if you want it to , but jQuery can't mimic MooTools .
If you want to write classes or extend native prototypes or do some of the other things MooTools can , you 'll have to write it yourself .
Chaining as a Design Pattern
Let 's do another of these .
Here 's some jQuery ( from the jQuery tutorial ) :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ' # faq ' ) . find ( 'dd ' ) .hide ( ) .end ( ) . find ( ' dt ').click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .next ( ).slideToggle ( ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
This is an example of a syntax that I personally do n't prefer .
Looking at the code above I am hard pressed to be sure of what it 's doing .
Most notably I 'm curious about what .end does and how does . find , which follows it , relate to what .end does ?
Now , looking at the docs on jQuery makes it very clear what .end does ( it resets to the value of the original selector , in this case # faq ) .
But this seems very odd to me .
When I do work with jQuery , I often find myself unsure what a method is going to return to me .
Obviously this does n't bother everyone else as jQuery has a lot of people happily using it , so I 'll chalk it up to personal preference again .
Let 's look at the above logic as MooTools :
window.addEvent ( ' domready ' , function ( ) { var faq = $ ( ' faq ' ) ; faq.getElements ( 'dd ' ) .hide ( ) ; faq.getElements ( ' dt ' ) .addEvent ( ' click ' , function ( ) { this.getNext ( ). slide ( ' toggle ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
Again , the MooTools code is a bit more verbose , but also more explicit .
Also note that the design pattern here is to store the reference to #faq in a variable , where jQuery uses its .end method to return to it .
I 'll note that it 's possible to write highly chained code with Mootools .
For example :
item.getElements (' input[type=checkbox ] ') . filter ( function ( box ) { return box .
checked != checked ; } ) . set ( ' checked ' , checked ) .getParent ( ) [ ( checked ) ?
' addClass ' : ' removeClass '] ( ' checked ' ) . fireEvent ( ( checked ) ? ' check ' : ' uncheck ' ) ;
But really , writing code like this - lots of logic in a domready statement - with either framework , I 'd argue , is itself a bad practice .
It 's far better to encapsulate your logic into reusable chunks .
Reusing Code with jQuery
It 's very tempting when you 're working on a web project to write code this way .
Just add some logic on the page that selects the DOM elements and " sets them up " by hiding some , altering others , and adding event listeners for click or mouseover .
Developing code this way is very efficient , very fast .
The problem with writing all your logic in domready statements is that you end up with a lot of code that does the same thing in different places .
If we take the FAQ pattern above we could easily apply the same logic elsewhere on a different page with any list of terms and definitions .
Are we going to repeat the same logic every time we find this pattern ?
A simple way to make it reusable is to wrap the logic in a function and pass in arguments .
Here 's what that might look like in jQuery :
function faq ( container , terms , definitions ) { $ ( container ) .find( terms ) .hide ().end ( ).find ( definitions).click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .next ( ).slideToggle ( ) ; } ) ; } ; $( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { faq ( ' # faq ' , ' dd ' , ' dt ' ) ; } ) ;
This is much better for two really big and important reasons :
If tomorrow we need to change how these lists work ( maybe we want to add click tracking logic so we can measure it in our web logs or maybe we want to fetch the definitions via ajax ) we can just change our main faq method and everywhere we use it just gets updated .
Or if there 's a new version of jQuery released that changes the way things work , we can just go update our one method instead of a dozen copies everywhere .
I call this keeping a small footprint in my application .
By keeping the points where my application touches my more generic code as small as possible , it makes it easier for me to fix bugs , upgrade frameworks , add features , or alter functionality .
The second reason is that it 's less code .
By reusing the same method over and over again , I do n't repeat myself and this is valuable in any programming environment .
It also makes the code my visitors have to download smaller .
j Query actually has a slightly more refined system for writing reusable " widgets " like these .
Rather than encourage you to drop them into functions like the above example ( which is really rather crude ) it encourages you to write jQuery plug-ins .
Here 's what that would look like :
jQuery.fn.faq = function ( options ) { var settings = jQuery.
extend ( { terms : ' dt ' , definitions : ' dd ' } , options ) ; //" this " is the current context ; in this case , the elements we want to turn into faq layouts $ ( this ) .find(settings.terms ).hide().end ().find( settings.definitions).click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .next ( ).slideToggle ( ) ; } ) ; return this ; } ;
$ ( ' # faq ' ) . faq ( ) ;
which you would use thusly :
But looking at the example above , there 's not much difference between declaring our faq function this way vs. declaring it as a stand alone function .
Granted , it 's not in the global namespace , but we could have just as easily added it to a namespace of our own .
By attaching it to jQuery we can chain it with other jquery methods .
The other benefit is that the " this " inside our function is the current context of whatever is in the jQuery chain at that moment .
By using this pattern for plug-ins we 're able to make our plug - in look like it 's part of jQuery , but other than that , our plug - in is basically a single function that takes the current jQuery context , does stuff to it , and then returns the context for the next item in the chain .
There 's not a lot of complexity here , which makes it easy for anyone to write jQuery plug-ins - they 're just single functions .
Note that it is possible to write more complex plugins with jQuery with methods and state .
This kind of pattern is supported with the jQuery UI plugin system and does n't use the same mechanism as the basic plugin ( like our faq example ) .
Instead , you attach an object with methods and properties to the jQuery object ( i.e. $.ui.tabs ) .
There 's a shortcut to invoke this object ( $( selector ) .tabs ( ) ) so that you can continue chaining as with the faq plugin .
But because it does n't return a reference to the tabs object created for the items in your selector , you 're forced to call that selector again to invoke methods on it .
Instead of calling myTabInstance.add ( url , label , index ) you must execute the selector again and call your function by name ( as a string ) : $ ( selector ) . tabs ( ' add ' , url , label , index ) ; .
This means you 're running your selector twice ( unless you store it in a variable somewhere ) , and that you do n't ever have a pointer to the " add " method that you can do things like bind or delay .
This post is focused on the MooTools and jQuery cores , and while jQuery 's UI system does provide this functionality , it 's not something that comes with jQuery by default .
Reusing Code with MooTools
In MooTools when you want to define a pattern , you 're more likely to use either a Class or implement a method into a native object ( into String , for example ) .
Rather than give you an almost completely different language from JavaScript 's native style , MooTools attempts to walk the middle ground between defining its own custom syntax and extending JavaScript 's own design patterns .
One of the ways it does this is by extending the prototypes of the native objects in the language and in the DOM .
This means that if you needed a method to trim a string , MooTools encourages you to add that method to String itself ( note that String . trim is already in MooTools ; you do n't need to add this yourself ) :
String.implement ({ trim : function ( ) { return this .
replace (/^\s+|\s+$/g , '' ) ; } } ) ;
This means you can just execute " no more spaces on the end ! " . trim ( ) and get back " no more spaces on the end ! " .
Some would say that implementing properties into native prototypes is inappropriate .
It 's the reason why MooTools and Prototype.js can't play well with each other - any framework that manipulates prototypes of natives does n't play well with any other framework that does the same .
If I define String.prototype.foo( ) and another library on the same page defines it , too , which ever one comes last wins .
In a way , this is similar to the problem we face with the global window namespace .
This is how JavaScript works .
This is how JavaScript 1.8 has added so many features .
It adds them to the prototypes .
The MooTools developers include a robust framework that is easy for you to extend with your own functionality with the intention that people who include the framework in the page are going to use it , not some other framework .
It 's actually kind of rude to ask users to download two frameworks .
The only reason to include two frameworks is because you want to use plug-ins from both , and in the minds of the MooTools authors ( myself included ) , if you want a plug - in that is n't available with the framework of your choice , it 's more appropriate for you to spend the time porting it to your environment than to ask your users to download another framework .
Once you learn how JavaScript works and see the power of extending native objects , a whole new level of programming opens up .
You can write plug-ins that alter Elements or Dates or Functions .
While some might argue that adding methods to natives this way is a kind of pollution , I 'd argue that this is how JavaScript is meant to be used .
It is a design feature of the language .
By attaching methods to natives you allow your code to be concise and compartmentalized .
j Query does this too , but limits its prototype enhancements to the jQuery object .
While you can easily chain multiple method calls on the jQuery object , on any other type of object you have to use generics .
For example , in jQuery if you want to trim a string and then iterate over each line , you would have to write :
$ .each ( $.trim ( $ ( ' span.something ' ) . html ( ) ) .split ( "
" ) , function ( i , line ) {alert ( line ) ; } ) ;
But because MooTools modifies prototypes , you can do this :
$ ( 'span.something ' ) . get ( ' html ' ) .trim ( ) .split ( "
" ) .each ( function ( line ) {alert ( line ) ; } ) ;
Taking a look at this makes it extremely clear how powerful it is to modify prototypes .
Chaining on DOM elements is n't the only place chaining is useful .
MooTools lets you chain methods on any object , including running a method on multiple elements at once .
The key here is that at the heart of the MooTools framework is the notion that it 's there to let you program what you want .
If there 's functionality that 's not in the core , you can extend it and add your own .
The job of the core is not to provide everyone with every bit of functionality that they could ever want , but to provide the tools that allow you write the things that you want .
A big part of that is making it easier to extend the prototypes of natives , and take advantage of prototypal inheritance .
You can do these things with vanilla JavaScript but MooTools makes it easier and more pleasant .
MooTools and Inheritance
Despite its name , the MooTools Class function is not really a class nor does it create them .
It has design patterns that might remind you of classes in a more traditional programming language , but really Class is all about objects and prototypal inheritance .
( Unfortunately , using words like " class " are the most convenient way to describe these things , so for the purposes of this article , when I refer to " classes " I 'm referring to functions that return objects - which I 'll call " instances " - that inherit from a prototype . )
To make a class , you pass an object to the Class constructor like this :
var Human = new Class ( { initialize : function ( name , age ) { this .
name = name ; this .age = age ; } , isAlive : true , energy : 1 , eat : function ( ) { this .
energy = this .
energy + 1 ; //same as this.energy ++ } } ) ;
You pass Class an object ( above , we pass an object with members like " isAlive " and " eat " ) and this object becomes the prototype of every instance of that class .
To create an instance , you call it like this :
var bob = new Human ( " bob " , 20 ) ; // bob 's name is " bob " and he 's 20 years old .
Now we have an instance of Human .
bob has the properties of the object we defined when we created our Human class .
But the important thing is that bob has these properties through inheritance .
When we reference bob.eat , bob does n't really have this property .
JavaScript looks at bob and he does n't have an eat method , so it looks up the inheritance chain and finds it on the object we passed when we created the Human class .
This is true for energy , too .
At first glance this looks potentially bad ; we do n't want all the humans we create to gain energy every time that bob eats .
The important thing to recognize is that the first time we assign a value to bob 's energy , we assign him his own value and we no longer look at the prototype for it .
So the first time bob eats , he gets his own definition for energy ( set to 2 ) .
bob.eat( ) ; //bob.energy == 2
Note that bob 's name and age are unique to him ; these are assigned to him when the class is initialized in the initialize method .
This whole pattern may seem a little odd to you , but the value here is that we can define functionality for a pattern and create instances of that pattern every time we need it .
Each instance maintains its own state .
So if we create another instance each one is independent of the other , but inherits from the same base pattern :
var Alice = new Human ( ) ; //alice.energy == 1 //bob.energy == 2
Where things get really interesting is when we want to augment this behavior .
Extending and Implementing Classes
Let 's revisit our jQuery faq plug - in .
What would happen if we wanted to add more functionality to that plug - in .
What if we wanted to make an ajax version that fetched the answers to the questions from the server ?
Let 's imagine that the faq plug - in was authored by someone else and we want to add more to it without altering it in any way ( we do n't want to fork it ) .
Our only real choices are to either duplicate the faq plug - in 's logic entirely ( remember , it 's a single function ) , essentially forking it , or we can invoke it and then add more logic to it .
Given a choice , the latter seems to save us the most trouble .
It would look something like this :
jQuery.fn.ajaxFaq = function ( options ) { var settings = jQuery.
extend ({ // some ajax specific options like the url to request terms from url : '/ getfaq.php ' definitions : ' dd ' } , options ) ; //" this " is the current context ; in this case , the elements we want to turn into faq layouts $ ( this ) .find(settings.definitions).click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .load ( ..... ) ; // the logic to load the content from the term } ) ; this .
faq ( ) ; // call our original faq plug - in } ) ;
This has some down sides .
First of all , our faq class is going to repeat our selector for the definitions , which might be expensive ; there 's no way to store the retrieved definitions and pass it on for the second time they are needed .
Secondly , we can't add our ajax logic into the middle of the faq plug - in 's own logic for displaying the definition .
The original plug - in called slideToggle which expands the definition using an effect .
This is problematic because this effect is going to go off before our ajax finishes loading .
There 's no real solution here unless we just duplicate the entire faq plug -in .
Now let 's consider our MooTools Human class .
It has properties like isAlive and energy and it has a method called eat .
What if we wanted to make a new version of Human that had additional properties ?
With MooTools , we extend the class :
var Ninja = new Class ({ Extends : Human , initialize : function ( name , age , side ) { this .
side = side ; this .parent ( name , age ) ; } , energy : 100 , attack : function ( target ) { this .
energy = this .energy - 5 ; target .isAlive = false ; } } ) ;
You can see that we 've added a lot of functionality here into a subclass .
This subclass has all these properties that are unique to Ninjas .
Ninjas start off with an initial energy value of 100 .
Ninjas get a side .
They also get an attack method that lets them kill other Humans , but it costs the Ninja energy .
var bob = new Human ( ' Bob ' , 25 ) ; var blackNinja = new Ninja ( ' Nin Tendo ' , ' unknown ' , ' evil ' ) ; //blackNinja.isAlive = true //blackNinja.name = ' Nin Tendo ' blackNinja.attack ( bob ) ; //bob never had a chance
Picking this apart a bit , there are some interesting things to consider here .
Note that we have an initialize method in the Ninja class .
This would appear to overwrite the initialize method in the Human class , but we can still access it by calling this .
parent , passing along the arguments that the parent class 's initialize expects .
Further , we can control when our logic occurs ; before or after the call to the parent .
We can assign new values to properties ( like the energy value ) and we can define new functionality .
Imagine if we could do this with our faq plug - in for jQuery .
We could load our ajax and THEN slide open the value .
MooTools has another pattern called a Mixin .
Unlike the parent to child relationship that is defined by extending one class into a subclass , you can also define classes that are mixed into other classes to imbue them with their properties .
Here 's an example :
var Warrior = new Class ( { energy : 100 , kills : 0 , attack : function ( target ) { target .
isAlive = false ; this .energy = this .energy - 5 ; this .kills ++ ; } } ) ;
Here we 've broken the qualities that make a Ninja different from a Human and put them in a class of their own .
This lets us reuse this code outside of Ninja .
We could then imbue our Ninja class with the qualities of a warrior like so :
var Ninja = new Class ({ Extends : Human , Implements : Warrior , // can be an array if you want to implement more than one initialize : function ( name , age , side ) { this .
side = side ; this .
parent ( name , age ) ; } } ) ;
Ninja still works as it did before , but Warrior is at our disposal to reuse :
var Samurai = new Class ({ Extends : Human , Implements : Warrior , side : ' good ' } ) ;
Now we have a Samurai class and a Ninja class .
But look at how little code both Ninja and Samurai took to define .
Both of them are similar in that they are humans with warrior qualities , but they are different in that samurais are always , always good , while ninjas have shifting allegiances .
By spending the time to write a Human class and a Warrior class , we 're able to have three different classes with no repetition of code while maintaining a very granular level of control over when methods are called and how they relate to each other .
Each instance we create has its own state and the code itself is very legible .
Now that you have an overview of how classes work in MooTools , let 's look at our faq class that we wrote in jQuery and write it as we would in MooTools and then extend it to add Ajax to it just as we did with jQuery .
var FAQ = new Class ({ // Options is another class provided by MooTools Implements : Options , // these are the default options options : { terms : ' dt ' , definitions : ' dd ' } , initialize : function ( container , options ) { // we store a reference to our container this .
container = $ ( container ) ; //setOptions is a method provided by the Options mixin // it merges the options passed in with the defaults this.setOptions ( options ) ; //we store the terms and definitions this .
terms = this.container.getElements(this.options.terms ) ; this .definitions = this.container.getElements(this.options.definitions ) ; //we call our attach method // by breaking this into its own method // it makes our class easier to extend this .
attach ( ) ; } , attach : function ( ) {
// loop through the terms this.terms.each( function ( term , index ) { // add a click event to each one term.addEvent ( ' click ' , function ( ) { // that calls our toggle method for // the current index this .toggle ( index ) ; } , this ) ; } , this ) ; } , toggle : function ( index ) { //toggle open the definition for the given index this.definitions [ index ].slide ( ' toggle ' ) ; } } ) ;
Woah .
That 's a lot of code .
Even if we remove all the comments it 's still two dozen lines long .
I already illustrated above that we could build this plug - in with roughly the same amount of code as the jQuery version .
So why is this one so much longer ?
Well , we 've made it much more flexible .
To use the class , we just call the constructor , like this :
var my FAQ = new FAQ ( myContainer ) ; // and now we can call methods on it if we want : myFAQ.toggle ( 2 ) ; // toggle the 3rd element
We can access methods and properties of the instance .
But what about our ajax functionality ?
The problem with our ajax extension to the jQuery version was that we could n't delay the opening of the definition until after it loaded .
We do n't have that problem with our MooTools version :
FAQ .
Ajax = new Class ({ // this class inherits the properties of FAQ Extends : FAQ , // it also gets a new option in addition to the other defaults // this one for url , that we 're going to append the index of the // term to ; in reality we might make this more robust , but for // this example it serves the purpose options : { url : null ; } , //we 're going to cache the results , so if a section is opened // twice , we wo n't hit the server for the data indexesLoaded : [ ] , toggle : function ( index ) { // if we 've already loaded the definition if ( this.indexesLoaded [ index ] ) { // just call the previous version of toggle this .
parent ( index ) ; } else { // otherwise , request the data from the server new Request .
HTML ( { update : this.definitions [ index ] , url : this.options.url + index , // and when the data is loaded , expand the definition onComplete : function ( ) { this.indexesLoaded[index ] = true ; this.definitions[index ].slide ( ' toggle ' ) ; }.bind ( this ) }).send ( ) ; } } } ) ;
Now we have a version of our FAQ class that allows us to get the definitions from the server .
Note that we were able to integrate the new logic in a way that does n't expand the definition until after the content comes back from the server ( which we could n't do with the jQuery version ) .
Also note that we really only had to describe the new functionality ( the ajax ) and little else .
This extensibility makes it possible for you to create families of plug-ins that offer different shades of functionality .
It also means that you can use someone else 's plug - in and alter just the bits that you to be want different if you need to ( without forking it ) .
This helps explain why , for any given design pattern - a date picker , a tab interface , etc , that you typically only find a few plug-ins for MooTools .
Most of the plug-ins you get either solve your problem or , if not , you can just extend them to add the things you need .
As I illustrated earlier , it 's possible to write complex jQuery widgets with methods and state .
Most of the code you write when doing this is vanilla JavaScript when you need to express logic that is n't related to the DOM .
But jQuery 's model does n't offer a system for extending these instances into subclasses .
Nor does it help you with mixins that can be reused easily .
Finally , jQuery 's plugins are always attached to DOM elements .
If you wanted to write a class that , say , processed URLs , there 's no stateful system for such a thing unless you write it yourself .
Decision Time
j Query focuses on expressiveness , quick and easy coding , and the DOM while MooTools focuses on extension , inheritance , legibility , reuse , and maintainability .
If you put those two things on opposite sides of a scale , the jQuery side translates into something with which it 's easy to get started and see quick results but ( in my experience ) can turn into code that 's harder to reuse and maintain ( but really that 's up to you ; it 's not jQuery 's problem , per se ) , while the MooTools side takes longer to learn and requires you to write more code upfront before you see results , but afterwards is more reusable and more maintainable .
Further , the MooTools core does not contain every feature you can imagine and neither does the jQuery core .
Both frameworks keep their cores rather lean , leaving it to you and others to write plug-ins and extensions .
Their job is not to give you every feature you could want but to give you the tools so that you can implement anything you can imagine .
This is the power of JavaScript , and of JavaScript frameworks in general , and both frameworks excel at it .
MooTools takes a more holistic approach and gives you tools to write anything you can imagine beyond the scope of the DOM , but pays the price by having a steeper learning curve .
MooTools ' extensible and holistic approach gives you a superset of jQuery 's features , but jQuery 's focus on a slick DOM API does n't preclude you from using the native inheritance methods of JavaScript or from using a class system like MooTools if you want it .
This is why I say that both frameworks are excellent choices .
My effort here has been to highlight the differences in philosophies between the two codebases and highlight their advantages and disadvantages .
I doubt I 've been successful in keeping my preference for MooTools completely in check , but hopefully this has been helpful .
Regardless of which framework you choose to work with , you now know a lot more about both , hopefully .
If you have the luxury of time , I strongly recommend implementing a site with each .
Then write your own review of them both and maybe your perspective will highlight some things I missed .

The number of charity donors cancelling the direct debit payments they make to worthy causes has increased during the recession , research shows .
Average monthly cancellations rose from 3.32 % in 2007/08 to 4.64 % in 2008/09 , said Rapidata , which handles four million payments for charities a year .
The average monthly cancellation rate in 2008 /09 exceeded 5 % four times .
Scott Gray , Rapidata managing director , said it showed charities needed to focus on new ways of retaining donors .
The research looked at the company 's total business from more than 160 charities from April 2003 / 04 to March 2008 / 09 .
Mr Gray said : " Our analysis shows that from April 2003 until the summer of 2007 , there had been an overall fall in average monthly cancellation rates , which was a very positive trend .
If they clearly want to cancel , the charity should acknowledge that cancellation as soon as possible and and work on attracting them back
Scott Gray
" But that trend was abruptly halted and violently reversed after Northern Rock .
" Cancellation rates skyrocketed last summer so that , for example , in July , 54 % more people cancelled their direct debits than in the average July for the pre-recession period , while in December , there were 67 % more cancellations than for the average pre-recession December .
" There are a number of things charities can do to keep donors on board , including giving them the option to reduce the amount they pay , or allowing them to take a payment or gift holiday .
" If they clearly want to cancel , the charity should acknowledge that cancellation as soon as possible and work on attracting them back . "
Last month the government announced it would put £ 40 m towards helping charities to assist people through the recession .
The plan , for England and Wales , will include awarding grants to deprived areas , establishing a volunteering scheme and creating funds to help non-profit organisations merge .
Some charities have already been forced to cut staff and reduce services as they try to cope with the economic downturn .
A survey of 500 charities by the Charity Commission suggested one in four had seen donations drop , while one in five said they had experienced a surge in demand for their services .

Interesting LIE
Environmental aspects of political flights .
Added by GordonAten on Apr 30 , 2009 | Visited by 5384 | Voted by 52 persons
The amount of harmful emissions produced by an airplane during one long - haul flight equals CO ₂ emissions produced by one car in three years !
This is the truth , which somehow is ignored during disputes about environment and global warming .
How many airplanes are flying out there on the Globe ?
According to some estimates there are between 210,000 and 220,000 operating aircrafts .
Obviously , not all of them are long - haul , but it would be realistic enough to assume that at least one - third ( 70,000 ) is long - haul , while the other two - thirds would aggregate for another , say , 30,000 long - haul flights .
To stay conservative , we shall assume that two long - haul flights are done in 24 hours , and that not all of them are flying every day , but every other day .
Let 's put aside military planes , information about which is probably not available at all .
Then , we come to ( a quite conservative ) number of 100,000 long - haul flights per day globally .
( Only in the US there might be about 5,500 planes at one time in the sky on a busy day ! )
One tree compensates CO ₂ emissions produced by a car for 500 miles .
An average driver makes 20,000 miles a year , i.e. 60,000 miles in three years .
It means every driver needs to have his own 120 trees three years permanently working for him to compensate for the clean air spoiled by his car only .
It also means that for processing emissions produced daily by all planes on the globe , we need 12,000,000 trees dedicated only to this cleaning every day !
What about deforestation , guys ?
How many trees are cut out daily on our Earth ?
All these sad calculations may be continued endlessly .
The point is that while we are becoming more and more concerned about our cars and try to improve our drivers ' tastes and driving patterns in order to feel ourselves right about " protecting environment " , not very much is being said about the devastating role of the aircrafts .
Especially taking into account that they spoil the air exactly where it is most destructive for ozone layer in sense of creating the " greenhouse effect " .
Obviously , I am not calling for grounding of all air flights , as that would practically halt human civilization .
Instead , those who are in power to make decisions , should start an urgent assessment of measures in the air - flight industry .
And first and foremost , put in place some strict regulations ( including financial ) on use of luxury private jets and flights for state and international officials .
Otherwise , look what happens .
On one side , for example , politicians are " fighting " with climate warming and pollution , adopt not only strict regulations on population and on vehicle production and use , but also allocate billions of our money budgets for different green programs .
At the same time , these officials and their teams are flying planes like there is no day tomorrow and they do not have children , whose future to take care of .
Look what has been going on in a month time in Europe : G20 meeting in London , to which dozens of huge planes flew , then most of them flew to France and Germany , then to Prague .
Dozens of really huge planes carrying the same people all over Europe , without any hints of willingness for " traffic optimization " .
And they did it for what ?
For show - off and some group photos and nice declarations , which most probably have been prepared in advance ?
As we would n't like them doing all the same in one place ?
And those hundreds of people accompanying them , what did they do ?
Every week hundreds of thousands of politicians are flying in Europe to and back from Brussels and Strasbourg , one of their main prerogatives being adopting measures for combatting climate change and preventing global warming .
Most of them are doing a good job for this purpose , but they would do a much better job by giving more concern to optimizing those trips .
Are they all really necessary ?
Can some events be combined in one place ?
Can those vanity stuff accompanying the Big Shots be reduced to a minimum ?

I am sure with all assessment and accounting assets available to them , those politicians can produce a truly environment friendly travel directive for themselves and for the rest of us .
If the Republican Party thinks it has problems now , just wait .
The party ’s incredibly poor performance among young voters in the 2008 election raises questions about the long - term competitiveness of the GOP .
The “ millennials ” -- the generation of Americans born between 1982 and 2003 -- now identify as Democrats by a ratio of 2 to 1 .
They are the first in four generations to contain more self - perceived liberals than conservatives .
And a recent Daily Kos tracking poll should send shudders down the spine of any Republican who understands how powerful a voting bloc this generation could become over the next decade .
Only 9 % of millennials polled expressed a favorable opinion of the Republican Party .
Only 7 % were positive about the GOP ’s congressional leaders .
By contrast , 65 % of millennials had a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party , and a majority also approved of congressional Democrats .
Advertisement
Though many people question the political sophistication of the millennials , they have been instilled with egalitarian and participatory values by their parents since birth .
This child - rearing produced a generation that was wide open to the personal appeal and message of Barack Obama and his party .
Moving forward , the initial preference of millennials for President Obama and the Democrats will remain in place for a lifetime unless Republicans can quickly adapt their message and find a messenger who can speak to this powerful new force in American politics .
Only 41 % of all millennials were eligible to vote in 2008 , yet their overwhelming support for Obama transformed his win from what would have been a squeaker into a solid victory .
Obama ’s popular - vote margin over John McCain was about 9.5 million nationally ; millennials accounted for nearly 7.6 million of those votes .
In the 2010 off - year election , half of millennials will be eligible to vote , representing about a fifth of the overall electorate .
By 2012 , 60 % will be eligible to vote , and they could make up about a quarter of the American electorate when Obama runs for reelection .
By 2020 , when virtually all millennials will be over 18 , they will represent 36 % of the electorate and will completely dominate elections and the political agenda of America .
Advertisement
And it seems likely that this civic generation , like its “ Greatest Generation ” great - grandparents , will vote in big numbers .
Turnout among voters under 30 has been rising steadily since millennials began to replace the alienated and more cynical Gen - Xers in this age group .
From a low of 37 % in 1996 , turnout increased to 53 % of all eligible millennials , and 59 % in the key battleground states in 2008 .
Their unity of opinion and their numbers will make millennials ’ preferences for economic activism , a non-intrusive approach to social issues by government at any level and a multilateral interventionism by America in foreign affairs the policy paths to political success during the next decade .
It is simply inconceivable that the Republican Party can craft a winning strategy between now and then that does n’t accommodate these ideas .
But so far , Republicans appear to be tone - deaf on the issues that millennials care about .
Advertisement
Millennials have been reared with a desire to serve their community , and the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America
Act provides them an opportunity to do just that , while at the same time dealing with their single biggest financial worry -- the high cost of a college education .
Unfortunately , all but 25 House Republicans voted against the bill , despite its co-sponsorship by Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) .
Millennials also are experiencing higher levels of unemployment than any other generation .
They expect the federal government to take an active role in fixing that problem and support redistributing income if necessary .
But the almost - unanimous Republican opposition to the “ recovery ” act helped convince millennials that only one party actually understood their problems and was prepared to act in accordance with their beliefs .
Polls consistently show millennials are more committed to environmental protection than any generation in American history , willing to sacrifice economic growth or endure higher prices in order to save the planet .
Given the millennials ’ overwhelming concern with the environment , House Minority Leader John Boehner ’s comments recently that carbon dioxide is n’t a real threat because “ we all breathe it out ” and , besides , “ cows give out a lot of gas too , ” went beyond inanity into the realm of political suicide .
The only tentative Republican gesture to millennial power to date is the GOP ’s sudden fascination with a new social network platform , Twitter .
By choosing Twitter -- with its limitations on content -- to connect to millennials , Republicans are actually demonstrating how little they know about this generation ’s commitment to engaging in the content - rich challenges of rebuilding the nation ’s civic institutions and national unification .
Advertisement
Republicans will need to find a new message and much better messengers than their last presidential ticket or their current congressional leaders if they want to truly connect with today ’s young voters .
Failure to do so will leave Republicans , to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln , locked in the dogmas of their quiet past , unable to think and therefore act anew .

How the Government Dealt With Past Recessions
Since the Great Depression , presidents have frequently experimented with Keynesian economics to combat recessions .
Three economists chronicle the history of government policy during past recessions and explain what worked and what did n’t .
Mr Berlusconi says he does not believe his marriage can now survive Silvio Berlusconi has demanded an apology from his wife after she accused him of " consorting with minors " and said she wanted a divorce .
The Italian prime minister , 72 , told the Corriere della Sera that he did not think their marriage could survive .
Veronica Lario spoke out after her husband attended the 18th birthday party of a friend 's daughter .
She has also clashed with her husband over his choice of inexperienced but attractive female election candidates .
" Veronica must apologise publicly - and I do n't know if that will be enough , " Mr Berlusconi said in an interview with the Italian daily newspaper .
" It is the third time she has done this to me in the middle of an election campaign .
It 's too much , " the billionaire prime minister said .
Asked whether his 19 - year marriage to Ms Lario could survive , he added : " I do n't think so .
I do n't know if I want it to this time . "
' Unwittingly misled '
He insisted he had done nothing wrong and said his wife had been unwittingly misled by the media .
" Veronica has believed many inaccurate things written in the press , unfortunately , " he said .
I read in the papers about how he has been hanging around a minor - because he must have known her before she was 18
Veronica Lario La Stampa newspaper quoted Mr Berlusconi as saying he had handed the matter over to his lawyers and that his wife 's comments might even warrant legal action .
" To tell the truth , there may even be conditions to sue for defamation , but it 's best to leave that alone , " he said .
The row began last week when Ms Lario , a 52 - year - old former actress , wrote an open letter complaining about her husband 's choice of young , attractive female candidates - some with little or no political experience - to represent his Freedom Party in June 's EU elections .
But the final straw came when Ms Lario read that Mr Berlusconi had attended the 18th birthday party of the daughter of one of his business associates .
The teenager is reported to be an aspiring TV starlet from Naples who calls the prime minister " Daddy " .
Mr Berlusconi was reported to have bought her a golden necklace studded with diamonds as a present .
" That 's enough , I cannot remain with a man who consorts with minors , " Ms Lario was quoted as saying in La Repubblica .

" I read in the papers about how he has been hanging around a minor - because he must have known her before she was 18 - and how she called him ' Grandpa ' and about their meetings in Rome and Milan .
" This is no longer acceptable .
How can I stay with such a man ? "
La Stampa quoted her as saying .
She also said Mr Berlusconi had failed to attend his own daughters ' 18th birthday celebrations .
The BBC's David Willey , in Rome , say the spat between Mr Berlusconi and his wife is filling the pages of Italy 's newspapers .
Even one of Mr Berlusconi 's political allies , Umberto Bossi , is quoted as saying " if I had a starlet as a girlfriend , my wife would n't let me back into the house ! " .
The current dispute is not the first time Mr Berlusconi and Ms Lario have aired their differences in public .
In 2007 , Mr Berlusconi issued a written statement apologising to his wife for flirting with other women after she demanded a public apology .
Ms Lario is Mr Berlusconi 's second wife .
The couple have three children , all in their 20s .

[ T ]o make up for lost income , the card companies are going after those people with sterling credit .
Banks are expected to look at reviving annual fees , curtailing cash - back and other rewards programs and charging interest immediately on a purchase instead of allowing a grace period of weeks , according to bank officials and trade groups .
“ It will be a different business , ” said Edward L. Yingling , the chief executive of the American Bankers Association , which has been lobbying Congress for more lenient legislation on behalf of the nation ’s biggest banks .
“ Those that manage their credit well will in some degree subsidize those that have credit problems . ”
As they thin their ranks of risky cardholders to deal with an economic downturn , major banks including American Express , Citigroup , Bank of America and a long list of others have already begun to raise interest rates , and some have set their sights on consumers who pay their bills on time .
The legislation scheduled for a Senate vote [ today ] does not cap interest rates , so banks can continue to lift them , albeit at a slower pace and with greater disclosure .
Banks used to give credit cards only to the best consumers and charge them a flat interest rate of about 20 percent and an annual fee .
But with the relaxing of usury laws in some states , and the ready availability of credit scores in the late 1980s , banks began offering cards with a variety of different interest rates and fees , tying the pricing to the credit risk of the cardholder .
That helped push interest rates down for many consumers , but they soared for riskier cardholders , who became a significant source of revenue for the industry .
The recent economic downturn challenged that formula , and banks started dumping the riskiest customers and lowering their credit limits in earnest as the recession accelerated .
Now , consumers who pay their bills off every month are issuing a rising chorus of complaints about shortened grace periods , new hidden fees and higher interest rates .
The industry says that the proposals will force banks to issue fewer credit cards at greater cost to the current cardholders .
Consumer advocates say they have little sympathy for credit card issuers , arguing that they have made billions in recent years with unfair and sometimes deceptive practices .
“ The business model will change because the business model does n’t work for the public , ” said Gail Hillebrand , a senior lawyer at Consumers Union .
“ In order to do business under the new rules , they ’ll actually have to tell you how much it ’s going to cost , ” she said .
With many consumers mired in debt and angry at what they consider gouging by credit card companies , the issue of credit card reform has broad populist appeal .
Members of Congress and the Obama administration have seized on the discontent to push reforms that the industry succeeded in tamping down when the economy was flying high .
Austan Goolsbee , an economic adviser to President Obama , said that while the credit card industry had the right to make a reasonable profit as long as its contracts were in plain language and rule - breakers were held accountable , its current practices were akin to “ a series of carjackings . ”

If credit card companies can't rip off their least reliable customers , they 'll rip off their most reliable customers .
That 's the message they 're trying to get out now as Congress prepares to pass far too mild legislation reining in a few -- though certainly not all -- of the more egregious of the industry 's predatory practices .
Thereported that with Congress moving in to protect " riskier borrowers , " from whom the credit card companies were stealingof dollars annually , the companies will try to make up the lost revenue by pillaging their best customers .
Personally , I 've never paid a nickel in interest to any of these filthy satanic usurers .
My blood boils when a crooked bankster , who probably belongs in prison , blithely tells thethat people with sterling credit have gotten a free ride : “ Despite all the terrible things that have been said , you ’re making out like a bandit . ”
You want to talk " bandit ? "
Think of how much a better place the world would be if every stinking money - grubbing bankster was lined up against a wall , given a blind fold and a last cigarette .
Keep in mind that these threats are coming from a batch of slimy incompetent characters who ran their businesses into the ground and were bailed out with billions of taxpayer dollars .
Now they want to turn around and steal from the very taxpayers who saved their worthless hides !
The banksters have used our bailout funds to lobby Congress and to bribe individual members .
What they and their lobbyist are crying about is how -- in a society that has been engineered to make it nearly impossible to function without credit cards -- the Federal Reserve put a stop to the practice of arbitrary interest rate hikes based on tricking unwary customers , practices that make them over $ 12 billion a year in unjustifiable fees that amount to a combination of usury and outright theft .
So who are the whores of the Senate who have worked the hardest for the bribes they have gotten from the banksters ?
The banksters know their bribes have always kept the following dozen crooks in their camp , regardless of how badly it hurts their constituents ( from bad to worse ) :
And it passed 90 - 5 with only 5 credit card industry shills voting " no , " the two lame asses from Credit Card Rip - Off Central , Tim Johnson ( D ) and John Thune ( R ) plus three richly bribed Republicans , Lamar Alexander ( TN ) , Robert Bennett ( UT ) and Jon Kyl ( AZ ) .
But you can tell who really had their hearts in protecting the banksters and screwing their constituents .
Only Kyl and Thune voted against cloture .
Always remember what Dick Durbin said as part of this debate -- the banksters own the Senate .
They have plenty to be cheerful about today , although they will feign martyrdom .
Jeff Merkley , who worked hard to getto pass , is more optimistic than I am about the bill and sounds like he 's making the best out of a less than perfect situation .
" Today ’s vote in favor of credit card reform is a huge victory for American consumers .
The CARD Act will end deceptive practices and hidden fees that are stripping wealth from Oregon families .
I hope we ’ll soon have a bill on the President ’s desk to ensure that these reforms are in place and helping consumers .
I have heard from families across Oregon who have been hit with fees and arbitrary rate increases even though they paid their bills on time and did everything right .
It ’s time to diffuse the ticking time bomb of credit card debt that resides in the pockets of every American . ”

I usually agree with George Monbiot and love the way he says it but this time – with his assertion that the latest miracle mass fuel cure , biochar , does not stand up – he has got it only half right .
Yes , it is silly to rename charcoal as biochar and yes , it would be wrong to plant anything specifically to make charcoal .
So I agree , George , it would be wrong to have plantations in the tropics just to make charcoal .
I said in my recent book that perhaps the only tool we had to bring carbon dioxide back to pre-industrial levels was to let the biosphere pump it from the air for us .
It currently removes 550bn tons a year , about 18 times more than we emit , but 99.9 % of the carbon captured this way goes back to the air as CO2 when things are eaten .
What we have to do is turn a portion of all the waste of agriculture into charcoal and bury it .
Consider grain like wheat or rice ; most of the plant mass is in the stems , stalks and roots and we only eat the seeds .
So instead of just ploughing in the stalks or turning them into cardboard , make it into charcoal and bury it or sink it in the ocean .
We do n't need plantations or crops planted for biochar , what we need is a charcoal maker on every farm so the farmer can turn his waste into carbon .
Charcoal making might even work instead of landfill for waste paper and plastic .
Incidentally , in making charcoal this way , there is a by - product of biofuel that the farmer can sell .
If we are to make this idea work it is vital that it pays for itself and requires no subsidy .
Subsidies almost always breed scams and this is true of most forms of renewable energy now proposed and used .
No one would invest in plantations to make charcoal without a subsidy , but if we can show the farmers they can turn their waste to profit they will do it freely and help us and Gaia too .
There is no chance that carbon capture and storage from industry or power stations will make a dent in CO2 accumulation , even if we had the will and money to do it .
But we have to grow food , so why not help Gaia do the job of CO2 removal for us ?

It 's evident that the US of A's Department of Homeland Security is taking the H1N1 threat very seriously indeed , and we reckon that Secretary Janet Napolitano may have been taking some advice from Condoleeeeza " Waterboarding " Rice as to how to apply a " Guantánamo Bay " solution to the menace posed by swine flu .
Here 's an extract from Napolitano 's statement yesterday on the current state of pig plague play :
We 're also actively monitoring travellers at our land , sea , and air ports .
We 're watching them for signs of illness , and we have appropriate protocols in place to deal with those who are sick .
Precautions are being taken to protect travellers and border personnel .
Anyone exhibiting symptoms is being referred to an isolation room where they can be evaluated by a public health official before proceeding to their destruction .
Fair enough , and if that fails , here 's Ms Rice 's next piece of advice to Napolitano : " I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit .
It 's the only way to be sure . " ®

The man who captured the imagination of the football - watching world 24 years ago as a rookie defensive tackle and part - time fullback for the ’ 85 Bears is facing one of the biggest challenges of his life .
According to Kevin Allen of the Chicago Sun-Times , former NFL defensive tackle William “ Refrigerator ” Perry has been hospitalized in South Carolina due to symptoms of Guillian - Barre syndrome .
Last year , Perry spent five months in a hospital after being diagnosed with the condition .
This time around , he has been hospitalized for over a week .
The 46 - year - old , who spent ten years in the NFL , is expected to make a full recovery .
Best wishes , Fridge .
The league was a different place when he was in it , in a very good way .
CONVERTING a greenhouse gas into a clean - burning fuel offers two benefits for the price of one .
That ’s the thinking behind a novel process for converting carbon dioxide into methanol at room temperature , developed by a team at the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology in Singapore ( Angewandte Chemie International Edition , DOI : 10.1002/anie.200806058 ) .
Molecules of CO 2 are very stable , so processes that convert the gas to methanol normally require high temperatures and pressure .
They also use catalysts containing toxic metal ions .

PORT OF SPAIN ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama , commenting on an alleged assassination plot denounced by Bolivian President Evo Morales , said on Sunday his administration “ absolutely opposed ” the violent overthrow of democratically elected governments .
On Thursday , Morales said three suspected mercenaries were killed in the anti-Morales stronghold of Santa Cruz , Bolivia , after the police arrested a gang that officials said traveled from either Ireland or Croatia to slay him .
The Bolivian leader raised the issue during a meeting between Obama and South American leaders on Saturday at the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago .
He later told a news conference Obama should repudiate the assassination attempt publicly and criticized what he said was U.S. meddling in Bolivia .
Some press accounts said he was suspicious of U.S. involvement .
Asked about his contacts with Latin American leftist leaders at the summit , Obama told a closing news conference that he rejected coup plots against democratic leaders .
“ I just want to make absolutely clear that I am absolutely opposed and condemn any efforts at violent overthrows of democratically elected governments , wherever it happens in the hemisphere , ” Obama said .
“ That is not the policy of our government .
That is not how the American people expect their government to conduct themselves , ” he added .
“ And so I want to be as clear as possible on that . ”
He acknowledged the United States ’ history of involvement in the region that has left many countries mistrustful .
He said he emphasized in his talks with the leaders the need to move forward despite the past .
“ I am responsible for how this administration acts , ” Obama said , “ and we will be respectful to those democratically elected governments , even when we disagree with them . ”

One of the most sticky points in explaining Communism to people is the concept of property .
This is especially tricky because all socialists renounce the concept of Private Property as wrong and something to be abolished , which in turn created vast confusion to those not familiar with the theory .
This is even more accentuated by deliberate ( ie propaganda ) or accidental misunderstanding of Communism as it espousing that people wo n’t own stuff .
But it is an obvious truth that people like to own items for various reasons .
From the most simple of not wanting to share a toothbrush , to the more complex of feeling psychological attachments to various items that we would like to consider ours ( say a car or a toy ) .
This is understandable and it is obvious that it would be unnatural if any social theory proposed that this is undesirable .
Which is why Socialism does n’t demand it either .
Now this might seem contradicting but it is only because we are missing part of the puzzle .
The fact that one can define two different types of ownership .
The first type of ownership is the common one that everyone is familiar in our current society .
It is the type of ownership based on a legal claim to something , ie it is based simply on what the law will recognise based on previous contracts .
In this system of ownership , one can consider to own anything and it will remain his until he trades it away .
Private Property ( PP ) .
Precicely because this ownership is legally constructed is why it requires to be defined through contracts of some sort that will be recognised by the state .
Which is incidentally why any social system based on Private Property will require the existence of a state of some sort and extensive laws to clarify and settle disputes .
But this is not the only system of ownership that can exist .
There is another one that not only comes naturally to humans but it also avoids all the pitfalls of PP .
Possession or ownership based on use .
To put it simply , one can only ever lay claim to things that they use personally .
This is fundamentally different from PP in that it does not demand an extensive legal system to enforce it ( although it can benefit from it ) and it prevents accumulation of wealth .
Now there is an immediate straw man that people who hear of this system immediately jump to .
It goes something like this :
“ Under Possession , as soon as you left your car unattended , someone could take it legally .
Or someone could get in your house and lay claim to it . ”
If this sounds as an absurdity , it ’s because it is .
Of course socialists do not mean something like this when we talk about Possession .
Of course the claim to anything is more solid than this .
The basic difference from PP is that it is anchored on the use of the item in question rather than an arbitrary claim that goes back to the original forceful appropriation of land .
So under the rules of any society , the possession of any item can be defined socially or legally .
Socially for example , it would be unacceptable for someone to lay claim to a car that someone else left in the parking lot .
People doing so would be prevented with all the coercive measures any socialist society makes use of ( peer pressure etc ) .
However , as this is defined socially , it ’s the acceptance of society that would make act of appropriation act acceptable or not .
So for example , a car that has been left in a parking lot for years and is going to rust , could be taken on by someone else .
Common sense would say that this would be acceptable .
Of course these are not hard and fast rules , but up to each community to define to their own culture and experience .
But I hope to give you an idea of how this works .
Why is the difference between private property and possession so important ?
First it is because it explains what socialists mean by the abolition of the former and avoids straw man arguments about the “ unnaturality ” of communism .
The second is that it provides a link to pre-civilization human societies , or to be more precise , those which had a hunter / gatherer lifestyle which were egalitarian precisely because the concept of PP did not exist .
The third is that it draws attention to the severe drawbacks of PP and by extension it shows how the introduction of it directly led to inequality and relations of authority .
The main characteristic private property is that it allows accumulation of wealth .
As each persons claim of ownership is simply based on the law , one can keep massing up as many such claims as they can .
As society expands and as people are born without a claim to property , this in turn becomes a leverage for exploitation and , by extension , inequality .
Simply put .
Someone who does not own land , must sell the only thing he can , his labour ( and by extention freedom ) , and he must sell it at a price that is less than what he would make if he did own land .
The excess result of this labour , profit , of course goes to the employer who then uses it to expand his PP .
And the cycle of exploitation continues .
Contradict this with Possession , where any one person can only ever own as much as they personally use .
As such the scarcity of the land is automatically reduced , as there ’s not a few people controlling vast tracts or land and preventing its use until those desperate enough “ volunteer ” to their terms .
There is of course always the possibility that the amount of humans would eventually become so great as to create a situation of scarcity where people would be landless again .
But if anything human ingenuity has shown that we can always find more places to live in ( From multi storey buildings to space stations ) .
As such , inequality would not be possible without the ability of people to accumulate .
Without this incentive people in turn have no reason to exploit and emiserate their fellow humans for it would not bring them any social benefit .
As such , people would realize that their interest lies in spreading the surplus value they create and cooperating with others to collectively improve their life standard rather than competing with each other for diminishing returns ( as excessive wealth does not bring excessive happiness ) .
One would ask , how would Possession deal with items that are too big for one person to use , such as a factory ?
This is of course has a very easy solution : Collective ownership .
Each person who works in a factory is considered to own an equal share of it and as such , any surplus value it creates .
And this can not be run in any other way other than a democratic one .
For in a collection of equals , there ’s no room for bosses giving orders .
One can then imagine a society based on Possession rather than Private Property would be the exact opposite of what we have now .
A society where people would actually not have an incentive to be evil .
It is from this society that the necessary mind - frame would spring , of cooperation , voluntarism and freedom .
And as much as the above is true , so is it delusional to expect a society based on private property , an ownership system that promotes the mentality of greed and short term interest , to somehow transform into a libertarian society , where people actually act charitably and do not seek to exploit their inequality for personal gain .

Originally published in the October 2008 issue .
An editorial by James Hyder , Editor / Publisher
In April 1985 , the CEO of Coca Cola held a press conference in New York City to announce that the company was changing the century - old formulation of its famous soft drink .
The new version was officially given the “ Coca Cola ” name , and production of the original formula was halted that week .
The new soda , which became widely ( but unofficially ) known as “ New Coke , ” had received favorable reactions in taste tests and focus groups .
But ultimately , millions of customers , angered that the company would suddenly change the product it had labeled “ The Real Thing , ” pressured it to reintroduce the original flavor .
The company hurriedly returned it to store shelves less than three months later , re-branded as “ Coke Classic . ”
Coke executives were widely ridiculed for underestimating their customers ’ devotion to the brand and for their perceived highhandedness in tinkering with a classic .
In September 2008 , Richard Gelfond , co-CEO of Imax Corporation , told members of the Giant Screen Cinema Association that “ we do n’t think of [ IMAX ] as the giant screen . ”
Rather , he said , “ it is the best immersive experience on the planet . ”
The company takes this position because it has chosen not to differentiate its new digital projection system in any way from the 15/70 film systems it has been installing in giant - screen theaters since 1970 .
This despite the fact that , according to Imax VP Larry O’Reilly , its two major digital partners , AMC Entertainment and Regal Entertainment Group , both originally wanted to brand the new screens as “ IMAX Digital . ”
And based on the reaction Gelfond ’s announcement received in New York ( and on many conversations I ’ve had since ) many , if not most , institutional IMAX operators would prefer this as well .
In short , virtually all of Imax ’s customers and partners would like to see a distinct new identity for the digital system .
But Gelfond flatly rejected this possibility , offering an absurdly flawed analogy with BMW automobiles .
He said that the German carmaker offers the 7 - series line of larger , more powerful , luxury models as well as the smaller , entry - level 3 - series cars .
“ People do n’t say ‘ The 3 is n’t a real BMW because it ’s smaller . ’ ”
Of course , this ignores the fact that the model numbers , to say nothing of the prices , clearly distinguish BMW ’s different product lines in consumers ’ minds , while maintaining the unity of the brand .
No car buyer believes he has bought a $ 125,000 760 Li only to receive a $ 30,000 328i .
Yet this is the position in which Imax is now putting customers who pay $ 15 to see films at ( for instance ) New York City ’s AMC Empire 25 IMAX digital theater , with its 28 ×58 - foot ( 8.5×18 meter ) screen .
They see the IMAX name on the theater and have no idea until after their ticket has been torn and they walk into the auditorium that that screen is about the same size as the one in the adjacent 35 mm auditorium , and less than a quarter the size of the one in the AMC Lincoln Square IMAX 15/70 theater , 26 blocks away .
The screen in the older film theater is 76×98 feet ( 23×30 meters ) .
Here ’s a graphic representation of the difference :
Gelfond explained that the company feared an “ IMAX Digital ” brand might cast the older film - based theaters as “ second - class citizens ” in the public ’s mind , since “ digital ” generally has connotations of “ newer , ” and “ cooler . ”
Although this apparent concern for museums and other “ old school ” operators is touching , it seems far more likely that the company was worried that ticket buyers who noticed the difference between the average 4,800 square - foot ( 450 square - meter ) 15/70 film screen and a digital one 1,250 square feet ( 120 square - meters ) in area would n’t return to the smaller if they could see the same movie on the larger .
In other words , “ IMAX Digital ” might become the next “ New Coke . ”
Widespread public preference for the “ classic ” experience would harm Imax ’s return on the tens of millions of dollars it is investing in the 170 + joint venture deals it has signed .
The “ wow ” factor
Gelfond claimed that the company only puts IMAX digital systems into multiplex auditoriums that meet certain criteria .
He jokingly said , “ It ’s a very scientific test .
It ’s called the ‘ wow ’ factor .
So if you do n’t go in and go ‘ wow , ’ we wo n’t do it . ”
In more than 24 years in the business , I have personally been in 132 giant - screen theaters of all brands , formats , and sizes , including four MPX ( 15/70 film ) theaters and five IMAX digital screens .
I may be jaded , but none of those nine coaxed even a faint “ wow ” from my lips , because all were merely ordinary multiplex houses that had been modified slightly .
The seating rake was unchanged and nowhere near the 20 – 25 - degree angle that is standard in purpose - built IMAX theaters .
The room ’s depth , from the screen to the last row , may have been reduced slightly by moving the screen forward and removing a few rows of seats .
But most were still significantly deeper than the width of the screen , thus providing the audience a narrower ( i.e. , less immersive ) average field of view .
But most importantly , of course , the screens were only a fraction of the size of a “ real ” IMAX theater screen .
And all were shorter , 1.9 - aspect - ratio screens , not the tall 1.44 screens of classic IMAX theaters .
And let ’s face it , the biggest aspect of the “ wow ” factor is height .
It does n’t take a rocket scientist to see that even a very wide screen is not nearly as impressive as a one that towers six or eight stories high .
The screen door effect
Using two high - powered digital projectors , the IMAX digital system projects an image that is bright , with good contrast and slightly better resolution than other digital projectors .
But every IMAX digital theater I ’ve been in has also had a noticeable “ screen door effect , ” that is , a visible dark grid pattern separating the pixels .
It is particularly noticeable in lighter image areas , and is less visible the farther you are from the screen .
But even with my 53 - year - old eyes , I was able to see it from the front half of most of the five theaters I ’ve been in .
If you move back to eliminate the pattern , your field of view becomes narrower , and hence no different than an ordinary movie theater .
At the New York demonstration , I was seated in the fourth row next to a long - time IMAX theater manager .
I had not said anything to him about my perceptions of the IMAX digital theaters I had already seen .
But the moment the first image came up on the screen — it was the MPAA rating card for the first trailer —
I heard a gasp as he noticed the screen door pattern that made the card ’s white - on - green text look “ jaggy . ”
He later confirmed being stunned at how obvious and distracting the pattern was .
Although many people I spoke with after the demo shared this reaction , to my surprise not everyone found the pattern as noticeable or distracting as I had .
Some did n’t see it , others did , but did n’t mind it as much .
But for me it is clearly the biggest reason to say , “ This is not IMAX . ” I grant that the image is bright and contrasty , and has good color .
And it only took hearing a shuttle launch in Space Station 3D to know that the new sound system is fully up to IMAX standards .
I might even be willing to compromise on the aspect ratio .
But IMAX — real IMAX — presents reality .
Not reality as seen through a screen door .
And even though it beats conventional 2 K for brightness and contrast , IMAX digital is not , in my opinion , better than Sony ’s 4K SXRD system .
At ShoWest in Las Vegas last spring , I saw 21 in 4 K on a screen that was at least 60 feet wide , maybe bigger .
I intentionally took a seat less than one screen - height from the screen , right next to David and Patricia Keighley , as it happened .
I found the Sony ’s image to be bright , contrasty , and sharp , and as good or better than film would have been at that size .
And most importantly , I could n’t see any pixels or patterns .
Conclusions
Let me make one thing clear : I am not opposed to digital projection in principle , or to the IMAX digital system in particular .
I think the change to digital projection in the giant - screen world is inevitable .
And I fully admit that the IMAX digital system is superior , in certain respects , to some other digital systems .
But I object when anyone claims that two patently different things are the same .
Where I come from that ’s known as “ lying . ”
And call me naïve , but I do n’t believe that any company whose business plan is based on deceiving its customers can succeed with that strategy for very long .
Imax Corporation , whose very name means “ image maximum , ” has spent four decades persuading the public that that name is synonymous with “ big , ” with giant screens , with an experience that is completely unlike that of conventional multiplex cinema .
If , for perfectly understandable business reasons , Imax now has to move into those smaller screens , let it distinguish this new product from the other screens in that theater , as a “ premium multiplex experience , ” as Sydney ’s Mark Bretherton has suggested .
But expecting the ticket - buying public to believe that that experience is identical to one on a screen three or four times larger is insulting .
People who have been to a true giant - screen theater will realize they have been misled , and will be disappointed , if not angry .
Those who have n’t will wonder what the big deal about IMAX is , and will assume that any real giant - screen theater they come across in the future has nothing better to offer and perhaps never will have the real IMAX Experience .
By not distinguishing between two different products , Imax has degraded its brand with all customers .
And far from protecting the film - based theaters from second - class status , it has lowered the public ’s perception of all IMAX theaters .
This has even led some theaters in the institutional segment to consider dropping the IMAX brand from their marketing and perhaps even their signage .
When your oldest customers want to disassociate themselves from your brand , something is wrong .
The tragic irony is that , forty years after Imax Corp. started trying to persuade Hollywood to shoot with IMAX cameras , the success of Chris Nolan ’s The Dark Knight , the first to do so , has finally encouraged several other directors to follow suit .
Three or four coming films may incorporate 15 /70 footage .
And yet , by the time these movies open , the majority of IMAX theaters may be digital screens with 1.9 aspect ratios that make the dramatic transitions in resolution and image size all but invisible .
What a waste !
The lesson from Coca Cola is clear : Although the “ New Coke ” incident was initially perceived as embarrassing to management , the company ’s reputation was ultimately enhanced by its prompt response to customer concerns .
With two distinct products , “ Coke Classic ” and “ New Coke , ” sales rocketed and the company regained the top market position it had lost to Pepsi years earlier .
It has remained number one ever since .

Militants in Gaza fired five mortar shells into a field in southern Israel on Wednesday , and Israel retaliated with airstrikes on three smuggling tunnels along Gaza ’s border with Egypt , the Israeli military said .
Palestinian medical officials said that four Palestinians were wounded in the Israeli strikes .
The military wing of Hamas claimed responsibility for the mortar fire , according to the Palestinian news agency Maan .
On Monday , the Syria - based leader of Hamas , Khaled Meshal , told The New York Times in an interview that his group was not firing at Israel currently as “ part of an evaluation of the movement to serve the people ’s interest . ”
Israel Radio reported Wednesday that Mr. Meshal had been criticized by other Palestinian groups for his remarks .
Hanks , Dan Brown and Ron Howard were in Rome to promote the film Director Ron Howard has accused the Vatican of trying to hamper the filming of his new movie , Angels & Demons , starring Tom Hanks .
The movie sequel to author Dan Brown 's The Da Vinci Code features symbolist Robert Langdon helping to rescue four kidnapped cardinals .
But Howard said the Vatican exerted its influence " through back channels " to prevent filming near certain churches .
A Vatican spokesman said the director 's claims were purely a publicity stunt .
Howard told a news conference : " When you come to film in Rome , the official statement to you is that the Vatican has no influence .
Filming barred Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Everything progressed very smoothly , but unofficially a couple of days before we were to start filming in several of our locations , it was explained to us that through back channels and so forth that the Vatican had exerted some influence . "
Last summer , Rome 's diocese confirmed it had barred producers from filming inside two churches because the movie did not conform to the church 's views .
Ewan McGregor also stars in Angels & Demons
The director also claimed the Vatican got an event related to the film 's premiere in Rome cancelled .
" There was supposed to be a reception or screening here in Rome that had been approved and I suppose that the Vatican had some influence over that , " he said .
Speaking to the Associated Press the Vatican spokesman , the Reverend Federico Lombardi , refused to comment on Howard 's allegations about church interference , saying his charges were purely designed to drum up publicity for the film .
Science vs religion Catholic critics were unhappy with The Da Vinci Code which suggests that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and had children , creating a royal bloodline that Church officials kept secret for centuries .
But Howard challenged them to see the new movie before condemning it .
" My only frustration as a film - maker is that we actually reached out a couple of times , to sort of offer opportunities for bishops and others just to see the film .
And those opportunities have all been declined , " he said .
" So far all the criticism , all of the complaints about the film have been coming from people who have n't seen it . "
Over the weekend , a 102 - year - old Italian bishop was quoted in the Italian media calling the film " highly denigrating , defamatory and offensive to Church values " .
However , the storyline of Angels & Demons does not raise questions about Jesus Christ - it is billed as a " science vs religion " thriller that deals with an attempt to hijack a papal election .
Howard 's adaptation of The Da Vinci Code , which was panned by critics , earned more than $ 750 m ( £ 505 m ) at the box office worldwide .
Angels & Demons will be released in the UK on 14 May .

The very idea that unions would endorse legalizing illegal immigrants , as the country ’s two big labor federations did this month , strikes some as absurd .
Americans have a hard enough time competing with cheap foreign labor .
Why undercut them within our own borders ?
Especially with millions of citizens losing their jobs ?
These questions deserve an answer since the bad economy will only strengthen the stiff winds of opposition that President Obama will have to fight if he is going to win the sweeping immigration overhaul he has promised .
Legalization was already politically treacherous thanks to the tireless work of restrictionists who have spent years denouncing illegal immigrants as harmful to the country ’s health .
They have long compared the undocumented to invaders and parasites ; it ’s a very short distance from there to scabs .
To understand why that view is misguided , it helps to remember that the country has largely bought that argument and spent decades and billions to seal the border as tightly as possible .
It stages raids to pull people off assembly lines and out of their beds and cars .
It has added hundreds of thousands of prison beds to hold illegal immigrants and enlisted local police officers to enforce federal laws .
It has done everything it can to make illegal immigrants miserable in the hope that they will abandon their jobs , houses and citizen - children and tell everyone back home to forget about America .
And how has that worked ?
It has n’t .

My counterpart Phil wrote an article a couple months back entitled “ How Do We Motivate Gen -Y . ”
He wrote the article in response to several poorly written articles about how to motivate Millennials .
He offered some excellent alternative approaches about how to motivate a Gen -Y employee .
I want to take it one step further ; why do so many professional articles offer advice on how to motivate Millennials ?
Yes the advice offered is usually a hodgepodge of overused corporate catchphrases , but why do so many experts think Millennials need an exorbitant amount of motivation ?
If anything , I would consider most Millennials overly ambitious – products of our raising .
Ron Alsop , author of The Trophy Kids Grow Up : How the Millennial Generation Is Shaking
Up the Workplace believes that we all just want a trophy for participating and need constant mothering from our bosses , I ’m going to politely disagree , and actually provide the perspective of a Millennial .
While I may not be an “ expert ” like Ron Alsop , I ( unlike him ) actually happen to be a part of this demographic that he has under a microscope .
As a Millennial , I was raised as a “ trophy kid ” as Ron would label me .
I got a trophy for participation .
However contrary to Ron ’s opinion , my success was n’t solely defined by what place I took in a competition , but also by how many different activities I successfully competed / took part in .
I did n’t just get a trophy for basketball , but also for baseball and soccer .
While I was n’t training for sports , I was active in Boy Scouts collecting merit badges like an inmate collects tattoos .
When I was n’t reciting the mantra “ Be Prepared , ” I was competing at the state level with the chess club .
The list goes on and on .
But I ’m not tooting my own horn , all of my peers led similar lives .
This mindset was only perpetuated in high school .
Growing up being told “ you can achieve anything you set your mind to , ” we quickly realized that our resumes stacked up equally with everyone else ’s .
So we piled on Advanced Placement courses , language skills , leadership roles in clubs ad infinitum .
We grew up being told we needed to be the best , and we spent our lives learning how to accomplish just that .
So when articles come out talking about how to motivate me as a Millennial , I get frustrated .
When I see similar articles saying how Millennials are arrogant and think they can take over , I get even more frustrated .
I ’ve got news for you , as a Millennial I do n’t need fluffy motivational techniques .
I ’ve spent my life motivating myself past my peers .
What I need is the motivation that ’s found from being believed in as someone who CAN be successful and challenged accordingly .
Millennials ' personal drive should not be a threat to Corporate America , but an asset .
Companies that can put stock in their youth and trust in Gen - Y ’s personal drive have an invaluable leg - up on their competition .
I ’ve got 99 problems Corporate America , and motivation ai n’t one .
-- Now let me clear my throat --
“ A lot of what ’s in the film was already out there , ” Ms. Leonard said , “ but the style of the animation makes it easy to watch .
It is a nice counterbalance to the starkness of the facts . ”
The video certainly makes the facts stark and at times very political : “ We ’ll start with extraction , which is a fancy word for natural resource exploitation , which is a fancy word for trashing the planet , ” she says at one point .
“ What this looks like is we chop down the trees , we blow up mountains to get the metals inside , we use up all the water and we wipe out the animals . ”
Mark Lukach , who teaches global studies at Woodside Priory , a Catholic college - preparatory school in Portola Valley , Calif. , acknowledged that the film is edgy , but said the 20 - minute length gives students time to challenge it in class after viewing it .
“ Compared to ‘ An Inconvenient Truth , ’ ” he said , referring to Al Gore ’s one - and - a - half - hour documentary on climate change , “ it is much shorter and easier to compact into a class segment .
You can watch it and then segue into a discussion . ”
Mr. Lukach ’s students made a response video and posted it on YouTube , asking Ms. Leonard to scare them less and give them ideas on how to make things better .
That in turn inspired high school students in Mendocino , Calif. , to post an answer to Woodside , with suggested activities .
Dawn Zweig , who teaches environmental studies at the Putney School , a private academy in Vermont , said that the very reason the video appealed to teachers — it shows students how their own behavior is linked to what is happening across the globe — could also raise sensitive issues .
She said students , particularly affluent ones , might take the critique personally .
“ If you offend a student , they turn off the learning button and then you wo n’t get anywhere , ” Ms. Zweig said .

Sometimes teachers observe the opposite : children who become environmental advocates at home after seeing the video .
After Jasmine Madavi , 18 , saw it last year in Mr. Lukach ’s class at Woodside Priory , she began nagging her parents to stop buying bottled water .
Her mother resisted , saying that filtered tap water , Jasmine ’s suggested alternative , would not taste as good .
But Jasmine bought the filter on her own , and the household is now converted .

I purchased some mangoes at Whole Foods in Palm Beach Gardens .
When I took them home and cut two of them open the same day , it was spoiled .
By then , the store was closed so I brought the mangoes back the next day sealed in a plastic bag with the receipt .
Brandi was there and stated no returns were allowed .
I pointed out to her that I bought them yesterday and I was sold spoiled merchandise .
Brandi was very rude and again said it does n’t matter , that there are no returns .
I told her I would file a complaint .
She boasted that she was a “ shift manager ” and that “ they would not get rid of me ” .
Brandi had no concept of social distancing and kept getting too close to me .
She was not wearing a mask and I kept telling her to stop getting so close to me .
She rolled her eyes and responded by saying “ I ’m going to have to ask you to leave . ”

Now here 's a shocker : Tara Wall of the Washington Times -- owned and operated by the world 's most powerful theocrat , the Rev. Sun Myung Moon -- thinks America is a " Christian nation . "
Wall 's appearance today on CNN's Reliable Sources was briefly countered by both Howard Kurtz and David Corn :
KURTZ : Tara , why are some pundits on your side of the spectrum saying that perhaps Obama does n't believe in a Christian nation , when he was clearly just saying that America is a pluralistic society ?
WALL : Well , you know , his idea to forge ahead on this idea of religious neutrality , he essentially threw Christianity under the bus the same way he did Reverend Wright .
I mean ...
KURTZ : Threw Christianity under the bus ?
Where is that ...
WALL : Well , listen , the point is the history -- let 's revisit our history here .
This one dollar bill , all of our dollar bills say " In God We Trust . "
We are a country -- wait .
We are ...
KURTZ : It does n't say , ' In Christianity We Trust . '
WALL : We are a country based on Judeo - Christian values .
Our laws are inscribed based on Judeo - Christian values -- our Constitution .
CORN : You can go back and look at Thomas Jefferson .
WALL : And the point is , at the same time -- listen , because we are a Christian nation , we welcome all religions .
We are a free country ; we welcome individuality .
KURTZ : Let 's let David in here .
WALL : These are things that he can certainly communicate in communicating his message of religious neutrality without essentially saying we are not a Christian nation .
That 's completely false .
KURTZ : David ?
CORN : I know this is a media show , not a religious show , but this debate comes up again and again , whether we are or are not a Christian nation .
It 's not in the Constitution .
You can go back and look at some of our founders , including Thomas Jefferson ...
WALL : I have .
CORN : ... and he does n't call us a Christian nation .
In fact , his relationship to God is kind of on the iffy side , let alone his relationship , if he had one , with Jesus Christ .
And so , you know , here you have these people on the right , Lars Larson , Sean Hannity , again and again focusing , oddly enough , on the Christian end of the remark .
You know , they cut off his quote when he said we are not a Christian nation .
WALL : Because he says we are not a Christian nation .
And that 's false .
CORN : He says we 're not a Jewish nation and we 're not a Muslim nation .
KURTZ : Right .
WALL : But we are a nation ...
CORN : We have no official religion in this nation .
WALL : We are a nation based on Judeo - Christian values , and there is nothing wrong with asserting that notion while , at the same time , embracing all religions as we do .
And why people come here to flee religious persecution , because we are based on ...
Ask a Sudanese citizen what troubles him these days and he might not even mention Darfur or the International Criminal Court arrest warrant against the president .
To many here , it ’s the economy that is keeping them up nights .
Sudan ’s once - hard - charging economy , a source of national pride over the last five years , is in danger of grinding to a halt because of plummeting oil prices .
With the nation ’s oil - dependent budget in tatters , government employees are facing pay cuts .
Newly opened luxury hotels are slashing rates .
Even supermarkets are feeling the pinch .

“ People do n’t have as much money , ” said grocery store owner Nassir Aldin , who said his sales were down 50 % since last year .
Aldin was once able to sell Kellogg ’s Corn Flakes , a luxury item here , for $ 12 a box .
Now it ’s down to $ 9 , and still no one is buying .
For Sudan ’s embattled government , which is facing increased international isolation because of the ICC war crimes case against President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir , the financial crisis is the latest unwelcome development , and one that could have a steep political cost .
For years , the government has used rising oil revenues to fund a military buildup and buy political support , including paying off opposition leaders and arming private militias such as the janjaweed in the Darfur region .
“ Oil is what has kept them in power , ” said Mohamed Ibrahim Nugud , secretary - general of the Communist Party in Sudan .

Economists predict that if oil prices do n’t rebound , public anger over the economy could cause much more domestic frustration than Darfur or the ICC arrest warrant .
In 1985 , protests over rising gas and food prices helped bring down the government .
“ This is the fuel of revolution , ” said Elhaj Hamed M.K. Haj Hamed , a political economist at the Social and Human Development Consultative Group here in Khartoum .
Sudan has been one of Africa ’s fast - growing economies since it began exporting oil in 1999 .
Oil revenues account for about 65 % of the national budget and 97 % in the autonomous southern region .
Beginning in 2006 , the rise in crude prices helped transform this dusty capital into a modern city with dreams to build a skyline that would rival Dubai’s .
The growth was all the sweeter to many Sudanese because it came despite U.S. sanctions , imposed over the bloodshed in Darfur and the government ’s support of organizations on Washington ’s list of terrorist groups .
When the international credit crunch hit last year , Sudanese officials joked that U.S. sanctions had insulated them .
But when oil prices sank from above $ 140 a barrel last summer to as low as $ 35 recently , they stopped laughing .

“ The era of oil dependency is over , ” Finance Minister Awad Ahmed Jaz told state governors this year .
Now monthly oil revenue is half last year ’s level .
In February , officials said they ’d collected barely enough to cover expenses .
The government is scrambling to cut costs and raise revenues .
Last month , state employees in the south went unpaid .
In Khartoum , government doctors went on strike to protest missing paychecks .
Sales taxes were raised to 20 % .
The government of southern Sudan has approved the first income tax on its citizens , who are among the poorest in Africa .

“ But raising taxes is not the answer , ” said Abdulla Mursi , sales manager at a new Nissan dealership in Khartoum .
Higher import levies , now about 137 % , pushed up the price of a Nissan Tiida compact , known as the Versa in the U.S. , from $ 33,000 to $ 41,000 .
Mursi said sales had dropped so much that tax revenue from his dealership had gone down the last two months .
Real estate values and rents also are falling , particularly in high - end neighborhoods , said Syman Osman , a Khartoum broker .
He blamed the ICC case , which made some foreigners nervous about possible reprisals .
Besides oil revenue , much of the recent development has come with help from Arab nations .
But falling oil prices are also hurting Sudan ’s Middle East partners .
And the ICC case , which alleges that Bashir orchestrated a brutal counterinsurgency in Darfur , could increase international pressure to boycott the country .
Advertisement
The government in the south , led by the former rebel group the Sudan People ’s Liberation Movement , might find a warmer reception from international lenders .
But the crisis is likely to be much more severe in the south .
The recent oil price drop is forcing the southern government to live on a quarter of the money it budgeted .
And officials have come under fire from citizens who ask where $ 6 billion in oil money has gone since the south started receiving a 50 % share of the national proceeds in 2005 .
Roads , schools and electricity are still rare in much of southern Sudan .
Ali Abdalla Ali , an economic analyst and co-founder of the Khartoum Stock Exchange , said oil revenue should have been used to build up other industries , such as cotton , gum arabic , nuts and agriculture .
“ The problem with oil is that once you have it , you think it will just go on and on .
This is a good lesson for us , ” he said .

Many Sudanese complain that the oil party is ending before anything trickled down to them .
Standing in an unemployment line in front of the United Nations compound in Khartoum , electrical engineer Mike Abadi , 35 , acknowledged the new roads , streetlights and office towers around him .
But he said his life had n’t changed .
“ I ’ve never seen anything from the oil , ” he said .
“ Some of us never even knew Sudan had oil . ”

Her latest gambit to keep national attention is to turn down a third of her state 's stimulus money .
Of course , she would n't be Palin if she had n't already lied about it , claiming at first she was refusing half the money , then being forced to acknowledge she was actually only refusing a third .
Then this little nugget of joy :
The biggest single chunk of money Palin is turning down is about $ 170 million for education , including money that would go for programs to help economically disadvantaged and special needs students .
After this latest stunt , the legislature may over - rule her on a bunch of it .

Mexican troops have arrested 27 people including politicians and police chiefs in an efforts to rid the government of corruption and crush drug gangs .
The officials arrested include 10 mayors , a judge and a top police official .
They were accused of having links to violent drug cartels which have become a major problem for Mexico .
Things began to heat up on the weekend when one politician was found dead in the trunk of his car , burned to death .
Then gunmen attacked a car yesterday carrying four leftist politicians ; three were injured .
The attacks were blamed on the same drug gangs .
The arrests and the attacks all took place in regions of the country which are widely considered to be all but controlled by the drug cartels .
Nos contactó Greca para difundir su genial trabajo y página web .
Para poder presentarlos con justicia , les pedimos a ellos que nos describieran su trabajo y el material principal con el que trabajan : La resina poliéster .
Greca : La resina poliéster como el resto de los plásticos proviene del petróleo , pero a diferencia de la mayoría no se puede fundir para su reutilización .
Consecuentemente las fábricas que producen con resina poliéster generan desechos industriales que no se pueden reciclar .
Greca a través de una alianza ambiental , con una empresa botonera en Argentina , se dedica a la reutilización de esta “ basura ” generando nuevos productos .
¿ En qué consiste la alianza con la empresa ?
Tenemos nuestro taller dentro de la fábrica , eso nos permite utilizar sus desechos antes de que vayan a la basura .
Todos los botones que no pasan la etapa de calidad se descartan y nosotros les damos una nueva utilidad .
Por otro lado utilizamos su resina sobrante .
Si no se usa rápido se pone dura y termina en rellenos sanitarios .
Antes de que eso suceda la usamos para producir nuestros objetos .

This article has been edited from a previously published version .
A frightening buzz over the imminent demise of honeybees – and the disappearance of their critical pollinating prowess – is unfounded , according to a new Canadian - led study that shows their global numbers actually growing .
High - profile stories during the past three years detailing the mysterious decimation of thousands of bee keeper colonies had led to fears that the human food supply was being imperilled by a " pollination crisis , " says the study , which appears today in the journal Current Biology .
" But the declines in the U.S.A. , some European countries and the former U.S.S.R. are more than offset by large increases elsewhere , including Canada , Argentina , Spain and especially China , " says University of Calgary biologist Lawrence Harder .
Harder , who helped lead the worldwide survey of honeybee populations , says the number of hives in this country , for example , rose 65 per cent over the past half century and by 240 per cent in Spain .
Globally , the number of farmed hives has risen 45 per cent over the past five decades , driven mainly by ever - increasing demand for honey , especially in eastern European nations .
" The global growth in hives closely tracks the growth in the human population , suggesting that it has been driven by the number of human mouths demanding honey , rather than the need for agricultural pollination , " Harder said in an email interview from Japan .
Indeed , even in the U.S. , where mass colony loss has been front - page news , the declining bee numbers are due more to global economic conditions than disease or mysterious collapse , Harder says .
" For the U.S.A. , events such as the introduction of varroa mites and colony collapse disorder are extreme episodes in a general decline - much of which cannot easily be attributed to such biological problems , " Harder says .
" Instead , this decline seems more related to the high costs of producing honey in the U.S.A. and parts of Europe , so that the number of managed hives is declining there as bee - keepers leave the honey industry due to competition from other countries . "
A top University of Guelph bee specialist took issue with the study 's positive assessment of apiarian well - being , saying it misses the key loss years and fails to distinguish where the colony decimations are taking place .
" This document says part of the truth but not the whole truth , " says Ernesto Guzman , head of Guelph 's Honey Bee Research Centre .
" They do n't present the whole picture of what 's happening , " Guzman says .
For example , Guzman says , the study 's data , taken from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , ends in 2006 .
" And really the great collapse we suffered was in 2007 and 2008 , " he says .
" And obviously that changes the picture they show here . "
Canada , Guzman says , lost 32 per cent of its 600,000 colonies in 2007 and 35 per cent in 2008 .
Canadian beekeepers have been able to make those losses back by splitting colonies and importing bees from countries like Australia .
In the U.S. , where bee importation is not allowed , losses of the same magnitude have led to serious bee shortages .
The cost of renting one hive to pollinate crops in the U.S. has risen from $ 30 to $ 150 in less than a decade .
In addition , Guzman says , those losses were suffered in precisely the places that produce many of the fruits and nuts that depend on bees for pollination .
" It is true you cannot call this ( collapse ) a global thing because it is patchy and regional and it depends on what country you are talking about , " he says .
" If you look at figures in North America and in Western Europe there is a sharp decline in the number of honey bee colonies ... and that is where those bees are needed for pollination . "
Unlike in these fruit basket regions , undeveloped countries typically use bees only for honey production , Guzman says .
Harder , however , points out that cultivation of crops that require bees and other pollinators – such as apples , raspberries , papaya , almonds and cashews – has increased more than 300 per cent since 1991 .

" This growth is not being met by the growth in the numbers of honey bee hive , so wild bees and other pollinators must be taking up some of the slack , " he says .
" However , this growth in the cultivation of pollinator - dependent crops is not sustainable in the long run , especially as natural ecosystems are increasingly converted to the production of these crops . "
Australian cricket umpire Daryl Harper says increasingly ferocious hits in the fast - paced Twenty20 format of the game is forcing officials to consider using baseball helmets for protection .
" I guess it 's only a matter of time before you see us using those , " Harper told the Times of India newspaper on Tuesday .
" The bats are getting heavier , the shots are hit with more ferocity ...
I can bet umpires have to be very careful , " he said , suggesting a baseball helmet with a full face cover would act as a good form of protection .
Harper made special reference to the threat posed by Australian enforcer Matthew Hayden and Sri Lankan destroyer Sanath Jayasuriya .
" In one of the games , Sanath 's shot hit me so hard that I was feeling breathless for a while , " he said .
" And Hayden 's hits have brushed my ears a few times as well . "
Cricket 's newest format is gaining popularity because of the frequency of big hits and Harper said this was putting umpires at greater risk due to their proximity to the batsman .
" I was talking about this to some of the other umpires and they were also of the same opinion , " said Harper , currently officiating in the Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in South Africa .
" Given the pace with which some of the players hit those shots , it 's becoming really dangerous for us . "

La empresa estadounidense
Weatherford se gan� un contrato valorado en m�s de 646 millones de d�lares para perforar y terminar 500 pozos petroleros en Chicontepec , al este de M�xico , inform� hoy Petr�leos Mexicanos ( Pemex ) .
La compa��a Pemex Exploraci�n y Producci�n ( PEP ) , filial de Pemex , consider� que Weatherford M�xico present� " la mejor propuesta t�cnica y econ�mica " en la licitaci�n internacional , a la que concurrieron 24 empresas , de las que siete resultaron finalistas .
La empresa tiene entre el 15 de abril pr�ximo y el 14 de julio de 2012 ( mil 187 d�as ) para terminar las obras , detall� la petrolera mexicana en un comunicado .
Pemex pretende relanzar sus proyectos energ�ticos en Chicontepec , zona ubicada entre los estados �de Veracruz y Puebla , para en los pr�ximos a�os extraer de ah� entre 600 mil y 700 mil barriles diarios de crudo .
Ese �rea de M�xico atesora el 39 % de las reservas totales de hidrocarburos del pa�s , " que en volumen representan 17.700 millones de barriles " de petr�leo crudo equivalente .
Con el fallo anunciado hoy ya han sido licitados contratos de Pemex por valor de 7 mil 350 millones de d�lares en lo que va de 2009 .
El plan de exploraci�n petrolera de la Chicontepec forma parte del Programa Nacional de Infraestructura 2007 - 2012 , impulsado por el presidente de M�xico , Felipe Calder�n .
To be a good foster volunteer , you need to be able to socialize and train your new charge making him adoptable .
Do not over worry about this , it is just like having your own Dachshund but with lots of help .
I have also written a book that show you how to easily How to housebreak a Dachshund - I works .
The rescue group that I volunteered for where very helpful in providing many guidelines and a contact person that I could call anytime for advice .
Just treat the new Dachshund like he is part of the family .
It is surprising how fast they adapt to their new surroundings .
The length of time a foster Dachshund will stay in your home varies widely .
Young puppies are in demand , so are adopted quicker than an older dog with heartworm .
There are dedicated foster homes who take in Dachshunds that due to illness or age may stay with them for years .
You do of course have a certain say in which dogs you are willing to take .
If you do find yourself with one that really does not fit into your home , it may be possible to find him a more suitable foster home .
However , give them all a chance first ; sometimes a dog that may seem snappy could just be upset and missing his home .
Often with love and care , they settle down quickly
In the international exploitation and trafficking of women for sex , it 's men , the customers , who have been overlooked , writes Victor Malarek , in his new book , The Johns : Sex for Sale and the Men who Buy It .
One of Canada 's top investigative reporters , Malarek urges governments to go after the johns , whom he calls " the users and abusers . "
Some claim that women choose to work as prostitutes , but you call it the ultimate act of humiliation and desperation .
A very small number do it by choice .
Studies show that the vast majority , 89 per cent in one , desperately want out .
They 're hungry , need to feed children or give health care to aging parents , and the only alternative is to take their clothes off and service platoons of men .
They can't get any other work ?
Not in many Third World countries or where sex tourists go .
For women in Moscow , Kiev , other parts of Ukraine , there is absolutely no work for young women .
They are in abject poverty ...
There are so many escorts , from Third World countries , you have to ask , " How did they get here ? "
They do n't have business acumen or language skills .
On the lower east side in Vancouver , the vast majority have serious mental - health issues , drug issues , or are native women tossed off reserves .
They 're controlled by pimps with a bag of white powder .
The drug is their handcuffs .
You say men are the root of the problem , and in seeking a " moment of bliss , " they deepen the misery of the women they pay for sex .
These men never ask how she is , how did she get here , is she being forced .
They do n't look into her eyes beyond the veneer of gaudy makeup , stiletto heels and cheap clothes .
They just want to get their rocks off .
When money changes hands , it 's the ultimate conscience pacifier .
They do n't have to deal with guilt .
Most johns you encountered express entitlement , like the one who urged his fellow " mongers " to get out there and " enjoy what man was put here for . "
Do johns know what women really think of them ?
They delude themselves into believing that every moan and groan is because of their magnetic masculinity .
They want to believe it , and the women are trained to do this .
The story of Norm , a john who confesses his capacity to " ignore " the effects of his hobby , is revealing .
His insight was rare ?
When anyone on the world ( online ) sex sites raises the question about conscience , they are immediately asked , " Are you a feminist , a fem - Nazi , a fundamentalist ?
Who are you ? "
They do n't want anyone to raise the question .
You have no patience with what you call the " happy - hooker lobby , " which claims that these are pros who take pride in their jobs and exercise choice .
The happy - hooker crowd is shilling for the porn industry , the strip clubs , pimps and escort services .
The big hot button is health .
Women carry health cards to show they are disease - free .
Why just women ?
Why should they be the ones playing Russian roulette every time a guy comes in ?
Guys are the vectors of disease .
On those sites they say , " I like to go `bareback . ' "
It 's the men who go home and transfer it to their significant others .
Then there 's harm " reduction . "
They do n't say " elimination . "
They can never guarantee a woman will not be beaten up by her next john .
Many people think it 's safest for women to legalize prostitution .
Why do n't you ?
In Amsterdam , the mayor is saying , " What a big fricking mistake . "
Women are still controlled en masse by pimps , beaten , trafficked , forced .
They are on drugs .
Organized crime is all over this .
Unions never happened .
Escape clauses for women who wanted to get out – they did n't put in place the measures they were supposed to .
When a country legalizes prostitution , it lives off the avails of prostitution through taxation and in effect becomes a pimp .
If johns are charged , as you recommend , how would women be protected ?
I strongly believe the vast majority of women are victims and should n't be charged or picked up in vice raids .
You should pick up the men .
They are demanding it , doing whatever they want .
Sweden decriminalized the women and criminalized the men .
They know it is a human - rights violation , that you 'll never have equality and dignity and respect for women as long as this is allowed .
Sweden is a beacon .
The number of prostituted women has been reduced by half .
Norway just introduced legalisation in January .
Would it work here ?
I believe it would .
We have a mishmash of laws that do n't seem to make sense .
Sweden is concerned with equality of women ... and an option for women to be retrained , to seek psychological help , all the safety valves .
Here , there is certainly no protection for women .
Why do you say we can't " give up " and say prostitution has been part of life and likely always will be ?
You hear clichés that prostitution is the oldest profession .
I counter that it 's the oldest oppression .
I do n't live in a dreamland .
I know it will always exist , but we have to put breaks on what has become an absolute sexual calamity around the world .
Look at the planeloads of men arriving in Thailand , or Costa Rica , bars filled with Canadian men , and think of millions of young women around the world servicing from three to four to 20 men a day .
This seems to be more and more accepted .
Traffickers , pimps and brothel owners can't find enough local women , so they hunt down petrified girls who have never wanted to do this .
Can you see any circumstance where you 'd understand why a man would visit a prostitute – invalid wives , sexless marriages , and men with disabilities ?
I tell them , " Go look for a relationship . "
There are a lot of men who are extremely lazy .
They say they do n't want the drama , they do n't want to invest in relationships .

You 've written about your own difficult youth .
Did you ever have any such encounters ?
No ... I was in a hotel talking to a prostitute , she said , " By the way , I normally charge $ 175 , but because you 're good - looking I 'll charge you $ 100 . "
My jaw dropped .
I did n't know what to say ...
I walked away .
When a bug is filed in a free software project ’s bug tracker , a social exchange takes place .
Bug reporters give their time and attention to describing , debugging and testing , in exchange for a fair chance that the problem will be fixed .
Project representatives make the effort to listen and understand the problem , and apply their specialized knowledge , in exchange for real - world testing and feedback which drive improvements in their software .
This feedback loop is one of the essential benefits of the free software development model .
Based on the belief that this exchange is of mutual benefit , the people involved form certain expectations of each other .
When I report a bug , I expect that :
the bug will be reviewed by a project representative
they will make a decision about the relative importance of the bug
project developers will fix the most important bugs in future releases of the software
When I receive a bug report , I expect that :
if more information is needed , the bug reporter will supply it
if I ca n’t diagnose the problem independently , the bug reporter will help with the analysis
if I need help to test and verify a fix for the bug , the bug reporter will provide it
Naturally , everything works best when the system is in equilibrium : there is a steady flow of testing and bug reports , and users feel satisfied with the quality of the software .
Everybody wins .
Ideally , much of this activity takes place around pre-release snapshots of the software , so that early adopters experience the newest features and fixes , and developers can fix bugs before they release a new version for mainstream use .
This state produces the best quality free software .
Unfortunately , that is n’t always the case .
When our expectations are n’t met , or sufficient progress is not made , we feel misled .
If a bug report languishes in the bug tracker without ever being looked at , the bug reporter ’s time and effort have been wasted .
If the report lacks sufficient detail , and a request for more information goes unanswered , the developer ’s time and effort have been wasted .
This feeling is magnified by the fact that both parties are usually volunteers , who are donating their time in good faith .
The imbalance can often be seen in the number of new ( unreviewed ) bug reports for a particular project .
At one extreme ( “ left ” ) is a dead project which receives a flood of bug reports , which are never put to good use .
At the other extreme is a very active project with no users ( “ right ” ) , which suffers from a lack of feedback and testing .
Most projects are somewhere in the middle , though a perfect balance is rare .
Ubuntu currently receives too many bug reports for its developers to effectively process , putting it well left of center .
It has a large number of enthusiastic users willing to run unstable development code , and actively encourages its users to participate in its development by testing and reporting bugs , even to the point of being flooded with data .
A similar distance to the right of center might be the Linux kernel , which receives comparatively few bug reports .
Kernel developers struggle to encourage users to test their unstable development code , because it ’s inconvenient to build and install , and a bug can easily crash the system and cost them time and work .
There are a huge number people who use the Linux kernel , but very few of them have relationships with its developers .
So , what can a project do to promote equilibrium ?
Users and developers need to receive good value for their efforts , and they need to keep pace with each other
The Linux kernel seems to need more willing testers , which distributions like Fedora and Ubuntu are helping to provide by packaging and distributing snapshots of kernel development to their users .
The loop is n’t quite closed , though , as bug reports do n’t always make their way back to the kernel developers .
Ubuntu , perhaps , needs more developers , and so we ’ve undertaken a number of projects to try to make it easier to contribute to Ubuntu as a developer , and to help our developers work more efficiently .
Soon , it should be possible to commit patches directly into Launchpad without any special privileges , so that they can be easily reviewed and merged by project developers .
This is n’t a fix , but we hope it will help move us closer to a balance .

Stunning Steel House Made by One Industrious Individual [ Dornob ]
Editor 's note :
This report is part of an ongoing series of CNN profiles on economic survival in this time of financial crisis .
Eric
Bell went from earning about $ 100,000 a year to picking up $ 216 weekly unemployment checks .
( CNN ) -- Eric
Bell worked his way into middle management during his nearly 10 - year career at eFunds , a financial services company in the Phoenix , Arizona , area .
He made about $ 100,000 a year , and his career was on the up .
Times were good .
But it came to a crashing halt in May when his job was slashed after another company acquired eFunds .
No big deal , he thought , a guy like me with an MBA can get a new job quickly .
Seven months later , the 41 - year - old father of a 5 - year - old boy has yet to find a full - time job .
He now files for unemployment benefits every week online -- a check totaling $ 216 .
" I never envisioned that my job search would take so long , and it 's still ongoing , " the Arizonan wrote to CNN 's user - generated site , iReport.com .
" The fall was very frustrating as companies put everything on hold with the economy falling apart . "
He added , " You hear horror stories of 300 - plus resumes being submitted for the most basic job -- very challenging prospect to get your resume read .
The key activity to obtain quality interviews is networking .
Unfortunately , it is a slow process . "
But Bell was fortunate .
He received a three - month severance package when he was pink - slipped , and he and his wife over the years did what financial experts say everyone should do :
Live within your means , keep your mortgage low , pay off your cars and build up an emergency six - month cash fund for when hard times hit .
Without that rainy day fund , Bell said , his situation would be much more desperate .
" It 's dwindling , " he said of the emergency cash .
" Our first goal once I get hired is to rebuild that fund . "
His wife has a professional job , helping maintain cash flow for the family .
But still , Bell said , more than half of the family 's income has disappeared .
He said he 's better off than most unemployed Americans and his family is " fortunate . "
He might have less money , but he said unemployment has n't stripped him of his optimistic outlook .
" For somebody that 's unemployed right now , you need to turn off the news , " he said .
" It will affect the positive attitude you need to have .
You 've got to be positive , because it 's not easy .
All you read is the job cuts :
It can be very depressing . "
Bell has three tips for people like himself who are unemployed :
• Remain positive ;
• Analyze yourself and figure out what you 're best at ;
• Network as much as possible .
" You ca n't sit in front of the computer all day and go : ' Woe is me , why is this happening to me ? '
You 've got to get out and network , " he said .
That type of attitude is exactly what somebody in the unemployment ranks needs to have , said Erik Fisher , a psychologist and co-author of " The Art of Managing Everyday Conflict . "
" Life is about lessons , and it 's about learning .
In this situation , it 's not about feeling bitter and resentful .
It 's about moving forward , " Fisher said .
Fisher said that all too often people fall into a " victim mentality , " often blaming others for their plight .
While that might be natural to a degree after losing a job , it 's not the best way to move on , he said .
" What I like about this guy is that he's not a victim , " Fisher said upon learning about Bell 's situation .
" If we had a world full of these guys , then we would n't be in this mess .
He did n't look to take advantage of what was given to him . "
He added , " Even when things fell apart , he was n't looking at what the world was going to do for him .
He was still looking at what he could do for the world .
He 's going to learn from it .
He 's going to get a better job .
He chooses to see it as an opportunity . "
The nation 's economic hard times were reinforced last week when major corporations announced more than 100,000 job cuts .
In 2008 , nearly 2.6 million jobs were lost , the highest yearly total since 1945 .
In times such as these , it might be easier to feel like a victim .
But Fisher said Americans must remain optimistic for the betterment of their future and for the sake of the nation .
He advises clients at the end of every day to ask themselves : " Did I live my life with truth , honor and integrity today ? "
" Failure is only an emotion , but it becomes a reality when we quit , " he said .
Bell has no plans to quit his job hunt .
He continues to network through Web sites such as LinkedIn and attends events hosted by the local chamber of commerce .
iReport.com : Share your economic survival stories
He also took a four - month coaching seminar .
" You have to have your story in line so that people will say , ' That 's interesting and I need you for my company . ' "
Last week , he began working a contracting job for a multimedia company .
It 's not his ideal job , but it 's better than nothing , he said .
" Once they see how I work and how I can help them , they may decide we can't live without this person , " he said .
" I am positive I will come out of this situation with a better job . "

Apple Relents and Approves " Eucalyptus " iPhone App , Despite all the Freaky Sex Shit
Apple has relented in the face of public pressure and has finally approved James Montgomerie 's Eucalyptus iPhone app for sale in the Apple store , an app which will allow people to read " Project Gutenberg " books straight from their iPhones .
The app will be available without any content filters , a decision which means a full victory for Montgomerie and all the other outraged supporters who rallied to Montgomerie 's cause earlier this weekend .
The Eucalyptus app had previously been banned for obscenity because " Project Gutenberg " includes Sir Richard Burton 's translation of the " Kama Sutra . "
As a result of mass interdignation about this ban , Apple rushed Montgomerie 's claim to the top of their " fix " list and called him up , wringing their pork - pie hats and letting steam escape from under their collars .
From Montgomerie 's blog : " Earlier today I received a phone call from an Apple representative .
He was very complimentary about Eucalyptus .
We talked about the confusion surrounding its App Store rejections , which I am happy to say is now fully resolved .
He invited me to re-build and submit a version of Eucalyptus with no filters for immediate approval , and that full version is now available on the iPhone App Store .
" Since my previous post , I 've been so pleased with the overwhelmingly positive articles , blog posts , comments and tweets -- and also the emails from those of you who felt so strongly about the issue you wanted to contact me directly .
They were all much appreciated .
Thanks for all the support .
It 's been a roller coaster of a weekend !
" Eucalyptus will compete against the Stanza , eReader , and Kindle apps that have been charging per book for these public domain works .
Eucalyptus is only charging for the reader ( ten bucks ) and will let people read the books ( 20,000 or so ) for free .
Right now , somebody at Apple is wearing an iron glove and stroking a white cat .
Now they are curling their iron glove into a fist and bringing it down hard on a pink plastic computer console .
There are sparks !
A henchman cowers !
" Did you make the call ? " " I made the call . " " Did you tell him it was an honest mistake ? "
" I said those words . " " And now his app will be available in our store ? " " Indeed . " " What can we do about it ? " " Nothing , yet .
We can wait .
We can tinker .
We can ' innovate . '" " Aha . " " We 'll need a new platform . " " Yes ... " " With new rules . " " Very good . " " But for now ? " " For now , we must bide our time .
Tick tock .
Tick tock . " " By damn , we had a schedule !
It was all going to be so perfect ! " " Patience , milud .
Patience . "
VANCOUVER–All hail – or inhale – the 2010 Olympic Torch .
Or , as it 's jokingly known around Vancouver , the Olympic Toke .
Composed of stainless steel , aluminum and sheet moulding , the torch was designed to evoke snow , ice , skiing and skating , but to many , the metre- long white torch looks suspiciously like a marijuana joint , especially when lit .
The observation has become so common in this city that it's hard to know who was the first to say , " Hey , does n't that look like ... "
But the torch 's resemblance to British Columbia 's biggest cash crop was evident right away to Jodie Emery , editor of Cannabis Culture magazine .
" A lot of people come to Vancouver because it 's marijuana - friendly , so I think people who already enjoy a joint themselves will feel a little more kinship to the Olympics , " said Emery , who ran as a Green party candidate in the provincial election this month .
" I 'm sure the organizers did n't intend for it to look like a joint , but that 's what a lot of people are seeing . "
The association between toking and the Olympics did n't begin with the torch , of course .
At the 1998 Games in Nagano , Japan , Whistler skier Ross Rebagliati won , then lost , the gold medal in snowboarding after testing positive for marijuana .
The medal was returned after Rebagliati explained he had inhaled second - hand smoke .
And Olympic swimming sensation Michael Phelps was photographed in February smoking pot from a bong .
Industrial designer Mark Busse said he does n't see a joint so much as a tweezer or scalpel .
" Sure , it may look a little bit like a joint , but I can tell you that what they were going for was ergonomics , sleekness , modernity , " he said .
Suzanne Reeves , the Vancouver organizing committee 's director of communications for the Olympic torch relay , said she has taken the torch across the country and people 's faces light up when they get the chance to hold it .
At Nathan Phillips Square a couple of weeks ago , Reeves said she had the torch in a bag when a cyclist went by and did a double - take when he saw what she had .
Reeves said what she sees when she looks at the torch is the edge of snow and an unfurling flag .
" It 's quite magical .
Most people 's reactions are emotional , " she said .
The torch will be carried by 12,000 people over 45,000 kilometres as it makes its journey across Canada .
Because the torch will travel through the winter months , it had to meet some tough technical requirements , including being able to withstand high winds , cold temperatures and different altitudes .

The torch officially is meant to resemble the lines left behind by skiers and skaters on snow and ice .
Any double – or doobie – entendres , officials say , are purely unintentional .

She regenerated the capitalist system in Britain and was right to privatise large areas of state ownership , but failed to reform such vital sectors as education and health which could not be delegated to private management .
After a decade in power she had exhausted her energy , ideas and credibility , and governed increasingly erratically .

Her most significant acts were fighting for the recovery of the Falklands and recognising that she could “ do business ” with the Soviet leader , Mikhail Gorbachev .
She was wrong to say and believe that “ there is no such thing as society ” , undermining the essential bond that connects a humane society – shared responsibility for one another .
She began the coarsening and degrading of local and national community .
Tony Benn Labour MP in the 1980s and previously a Labour minister
She mounted a counter - revolution against the welfare state and the 1945 reforms , strangled local government and privatised public assets .
Trade union legislation today is less progressive than in 1906 .
Her greatest achievement was New Labour , which is a Thatcherite party .
When Eric Heffer [ a Liverpool Labour MP ] died , I spoke at his memorial .
Someone was coughing behind me , and it was Thatcher .
I thanked her for coming .
Jonathan Aitken Backbench Conservative MP during Margaret
Thatcher ’s premiership and former suitor of her daughter , Carol
She was right about the Falklands War , the excess of the unions and general economic liberalisation .
She could be unnecessarily combative , abrasive and harsh .
But what you saw was what you got .
Hanif Kureishi Playwright , screenwriter and novelist
Her view of human nature and of people was that that they were aggressive and competitive and only interested in themselves .
She took it for granted that people were not altruistic , which has brought us to where we are today – a consumer society obsessed with celebrity .
We are only now reopening the way we think and talk about ourselves in light of the bankruptcy of consumer capitalism .
Once in the National Theatre , I turned round to find that I was with the Queen , Michael Heseltine and Thatcher .
Had I been in possession of a bomb , Britain would have been considerably changed .
Sir Bernard Ingham Margaret

Her most significant act was to stand against the prevailing pale - pink consensus which had stood for 35 years .
She did n’t do a lot wrong .
She might have been less abrasive but then she would not have achieved as much .
Beryl Bainbridge Novelist
I never voted Conservative , but she was a strong and able woman , well educated and she was n’t scared of men .
I saw her a couple of years ago with Carol .
I had had a drink and I just went up to Margaret and kissed her .
I felt terribly ashamed afterwards .
Carol asked me why I did it and I just said , “ she ’s nice ” .
Germaine Greer Writer , academic and feminist
Her most significant act was introducing cervical cancer screening for women , although I did n’t think it was a good idea at the time .

She spoke to us in the sixth form .
I was only 16 , but I never understood the sexual allure she held with some people in the Cabinet .
Maybe it was power .
Tariq Ali Novelist and left - wing political campaigner
The Falklands War and inciting consumerism and xenophobia as a result of that conflict was her biggest act .
Both laid the basis for the new consensus .
Did she do anything right ?
No .
Billy Bragg Singer and left - wing activist
Taking on the National Union of Miners was her biggest act because , by destroying them , she broke the back of the post - war consensus .
Anything she did right was obscured by the vindictive way she carried out her policies .
We are still living with the legacy of what she did wrong .
Edwina Currie Health minister in Margaret Thatcher ’s government
Her most significant act was to defeat [ the miners ’ leader ]
Arthur Scargill and to open up the economy .
She failed to respond in 1989 - 90 when the downside of the economic revolution was making itself felt .
But she called those of us who were worried about it “ moaning minnies ” .
She was a fantastic leader to work with and very supportive .
She made the men look like wimps .
Ann Widdecombe Backbench Conservative MP under Margaret Thatcher
Privatisation was her biggest act and doing away with the idea that the state has to own everything that was essential .
But she failed , as all successive Prime Ministers have , to get to grips with the welfare - dependency culture .
Lord Coe Olympic 1500 m winner in the 1980s and Tory MP in the 1990s
At a Downing Street reception ahead of the Seoul Olympics in 1988 she asked me when I was going out , and I said I would go early because I needed four weeks to acclimatise .
She said : “ You do n’t need that amount of time . ” I said : “ I think I do . ” “ I think you ’re wrong and I am a research chemist , ” she said .
“ I think I ’m right and I have won the title twice , ” I replied .
I do n’t think she understood sport .
John Fortune Satirist and cast member of Yes , Minister
Encouraging people to buy council houses was her biggest act , and she was right in that .
She was wrong to demonise Arthur Scargill and the rest of the miners and to create the idea that the working classes were the enemy within .
Robert Lawrence Falklands
War veteran and subject of the film Tumbledown
I met her and Denis at a fundraiser .
He was introduced to me and was told I was the subject of Tumbledown , but he misheard and said : “ What a load of left - wing crap , ” and walked away .
I passed the word along that I was outraged .
When it got back to him the garden party parted like the Red Sea as he strode towards me and grabbed my damaged hand saying : “ Bless your golden heart , sonny . ”
Alexei Sayle Comedian and cast member in The Young Ones
I remember them dropping litter in St James ’s Park so she could go round and pick it up on camera as a Keep Britain Tidy message .
That told me a lot about her and her mind .
I always made sure I never met her or I would have had to punch her .
April 8 , 2009
Lichi D’Amelio responds to the charge , sadly made in a left - wing newspaper , that the boycott , divestment and sanctions movement against Israeli apartheid is anti-Semitic .
" PART OF the deepening pattern of Jew - baiting and anti-Semitism in the middle - class left worldwide . "
You might think that such an ugly and provocative statement had to come from a right - wing , pro-Zionist publication , where the accusation of anti-Semitism is routinely used against all expressions of opposition to Israel 's war on the Palestinian people .
But no .
It is part of an article titled " Israel Boycotts and Divestment Serve as Cover for Anti-Semitism " in the April 6 edition of the Militant , the newspaper of the Socialist Workers Party ( SWP ) .
In it , writer Paul Pederson attacks other socialists and their organizations ( including the International Socialist Organization , and myself in particular ) for participating in the growing international boycott , divestment and sanctions ( BDS ) movement against Israeli apartheid .
We face the same charge of anti-Semitism from the pro-Israel side in its campaign to try to intimidate and silence anti-Zionist activists .
Considering that I recently spoke on a pro-Palestine panel alongside SWP member Dan Fein , the Militant seems an unlikely source for the argument .
So it 's fair enough to ask just which side these socialists are on .
Protesting Israel 's deadly assault on Gaza in Seattle ( Robert Friend Weber Whitlock )
The growth of the global BDS movement that is helping to shine a spotlight on Israel 's barbaric and racist policies towards Palestinians is perhaps the most exciting and positive development pro-Palestine activists have seen in a long time .
In a struggle that has unfortunately been artificially separated from the broader antiwar movement and has faced a number of obstacles in building solidarity -- not least of which is the incessant accusation of anti-Semitism -- leftists and progressives everywhere should be welcoming this urgently needed step forward .
The call for BDS against Israel comes from Palestinians themselves .
More than 170 Palestinian organizations , including unions and civil society groups , were part of the July 2005 call for activists around the world to :
impose broad boycotts and implement divestment initiatives against Israel similar to those applied to South Africa in the apartheid era .
We appeal to you to pressure your respective states to impose embargoes and sanctions against Israel .
We also invite conscientious Israelis to support this call , for the sake of justice and genuine peace .
In the wake of the Israeli assault on Gaza that began at the end of last year , the initiative gained new momentum .
Students on campuses across Britain and the U.S. , for example , have been organizing to put pressure on their administrations to divest from companies that profit from Israel 's ongoing war on the Palestinian people .
Students for Justice in Palestine ( SJP ) at Hampshire College in Amherst , Mass. , won this demand , making Hampshire the first college in the U.S. to divest .
It seems like a no - brainer that these students should be applauded and their efforts seen as a source of inspiration for other students that we can actually win .
Instead , the SWP has chosen to condemn them as undercover anti-Semites .
In February , South African dockworkers in Durban refused to offload a ship carrying Israeli cargo and successfully blocked scab labor from doing so .
The Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) issued a statement shortly afterward , encouraging " other workers and unions to follow suit and to do all that is necessary to ensure that they boycott all goods to and from Israel until Palestine is free . "
And the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( SATAWU ) stated that " the worker victory in Durban yesterday spurs COSATU members on to more determined action in order to isolate the apartheid state of Israel . "
This dockworkers ' action and the South African unionists ' comparison of Israel to South African apartheid are curiously missing from Pederson 's article .
Does he make an exception here ?
Or does the SWP think that these dockworkers were " Jew - baiting " ?
UNDERLYING PEDERSON'S criticism of the BDS movement is his contention that Israel is not really an apartheid state that should be compared to South Africa .
He dismisses the idea that the daily suffering , humiliation and death endured by Palestinians should be compared to the apartheid system .
" Applied to Israel , " he writes , " the term ' apartheid ' is simply an epithet , rather than a scientific description of a social structure . "
Really ?
Archbishop Desmond Tutu , the Nobel Peace Prize winner and famed opponent of apartheid , has an entirely different take on the matter .
In an article titled " Apartheid in the Holy Land , " he wrote :
I 've been very deeply distressed in my visit to the Holy Land ; it reminded me so much of what happened to us Black people in South Africa ... Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation ?
Have they forgotten the collective punishment , the home demolitions , in their own history so soon ?
I 'm going with Desmond Tutu 's firsthand experience on this one , rather than whatever Pederson means by " a scientific description " ( incidentally , he never actually provides one ) .
There is , in fact , quite an impressive list of people , including Jewish South African leftists Ronnie Kasrils and Max Ozinsky , who agree wholeheartedly that what exists in Israel is some form of apartheid .
Today 's anti-Israel BDS movement is very proudly modeled on the international campaign against South African apartheid , which played a crucial role in bringing down the system of racial separation .
But Pederson is content to ignore these voices and concentrates instead on his straw - man argument that misrepresents the comparisons activists are making between Israel and South Africa .
" The attempt to paint [ Israel and South Africa ] as the same simply obfuscates the real social and class relations in Israel and the tasks facing the toilers there to chart a revolutionary course forward , " he writes .
Now , I 've been to a number of meetings in New York City recently on the topic of Israeli apartheid , and at every single one of them , the differences between the two racist states are always analyzed and discussed .
Pederson is simply being dishonest .
I do n't think I 've ever heard anyone argue that South Africa and Israel are exactly the same -- of course they are not .
But the similarities are simply more overwhelming than the differences , and they certainly merit a discussion .
What would Pederson call a state whose indigenous inhabitants have been shoved into refugee camps on their own land , with the bogus promise of eventual " nationhood , " only to be controlled , harassed and brutalized by an occupying force ?
How does he explain the monstrous wall that tears through historical Palestine , separating Palestinians from their land , resources , livelihood and families ?
How does he explain a state that has " Jewish - only " roads and settlements , is filled with checkpoints and trigger - happy soldiers , and issues ID cards that indicate whether or not someone is Jewish ?
What " scientific description " would he use for a state that has a law proclaiming the right of Jews everywhere around the world to live in what is now Israel , but that explicitly denies that same right to Palestinians who were born in the Arab villages that Israel is now built upon ?
If he 's going to claim that Israel is n't an apartheid state , then he needs to have some good answers to these questions , beyond twisting the arguments of Palestinian solidarity activists .
There are some important differences between the particular forms of apartheid in today 's Israel compared to yesterday 's South Africa .
The white South African regime , for example , sought to exploit Black labor while forcing Black South Africans to live separately , in " homelands , " infamously known as bantustans , or townships on the outskirts of cities and towns .
The goal of the Israeli state , however , is to exclude Palestinians from playing any active role in the economy .
In fact , the concept of " Jewish land , Jewish labor , Jewish produce " was instrumental in the Zionist colonization of Palestine and was implemented through Histadrut , Israel 's twisted version of a trade union .
In an excellent article on ElectronicIntifada.net titled " Histadrut : Israel 's racist ' trade union , ' " author Tony Greenstein explains " that Histadrut , an organization of the settler Jewish working class , was the key Zionist organization responsible for the formation of the Israeli state . "
FRANKLY , I do n't think Pederson actually understands " the real social and class relations in Israel " that he feels so confident in schooling the rest of us about .
His attempt to apply Marxism to the historical oddity that is the state of Israel is clumsy in the extreme .
Pederson 's charge of anti-Semitism rests on the idea that working - class Israelis and Palestinians have a common interest in overthrowing the Israeli capitalist class -- therefore , boycotts and divestment only alienate the Israeli working class , who we should be trying to win away from Zionism .
This may sound like a Marxist argument , but it is n't .
In fact , by this logic , it 's unclear why anyone should have supported the divestment movement against South African apartheid .
Would n't sanctions against apartheid have alienated the white South African working class ?
Pederson 's claims about Israel sound a lot like Ronald Reagan 's explanation for opposing sanctions on South Africa - - he called his policy " constructive engagement . "
Moshe Machover and Akiva Orr , former members of the now - defunct Israeli Socialist Organization , provide us with a much better approach to understanding the peculiarities of the Israeli state in their 1969 article , " The class character of Israel " :
The experience of classical capitalist countries has often demonstrated that internal class conflicts and interests dominate external conflicts and interests .
However , this theory fails to hold in certain specific cases .
For example , in a colonized country under the direct rule of a foreign power , the dynamics of the colonized society cannot be deduced simply from the internal conflicts of that society , since the conflict with the colonizing power is dominant .
Israel is neither a classic capitalist country , nor is it a classic colony .
Its economic , social , and political features are so unique that any attempt to analyze it through the application of theories or analogies evolved for different societies will be a caricature .
An analysis must be based rather on the specific characteristics and specific history of Israeli society .
Pederson seems to base some of his case on the fact that there are Palestinians who live inside Israel , and they are considered Israeli citizens ( though it is second - class citizenship ) .
The BDS movement , he insists , might hurt them , too .
This gives the impression that Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel are in the same boat .
But what Pederson does n't understand is that Israel is not a state of its citizens .
It is explicitly a Jewish state .
This means that special rights and privileges are afforded to Jewish Israelis , while Palestinian citizens of Israel are subjected to racist policies in virtually every aspect of life .
THE REAL problem with Pederson 's argument is that in his insistence that Israeli workers must not be alienated , he ends up alienating Palestinians instead .
Just as socialists would not tailor our tactics so as to avoid offending the white working class under apartheid -- or racist white workers in the Jim Crow South , for that matter -- we should n't in the case of apartheid Israel either .
Pederson 's rigid formulas extend to his position on the Palestinian national liberation movement .
He takes issue with me in particular over the idea that I would agree with anything said by Khaled Meshaal , a leader of Hamas , the organization that was democratically elected by Palestinians to a majority in the Palestinian Authority 's legislative assembly .
Again , Pederson takes the low road by using a questionable quotation from the Hamas charter from 1988 to try to imply that I 'm an anti-Semite -- as if I ever said I agree with everything Hamas has ever written , and as if Hamas is the same organization today as it was in 1988 .
Here 's what Khaled Meshaal said in a 2006 interview , when asked if there was any truth to the claims we hear in the mainstream media that Hamas just wants to " kill the Jews " :
This is not correct .
Killing Jews is not our aim .
For centuries , we have lived in Palestine peacefully with Jews and Christians of all kinds .
We are fighting Israel because it occupies our land and oppresses our people .
We are fighting Israel to finish this occupation .
We want to live freely on our land just as other nations .
We want to have our own country just like other people .
But the Zionist movement came from all over the world to occupy our land .
And the real owner of the land has been kicked out .
This is the root of the problem .
I agree with that statement .
And clearly , a large number of Palestinians do , too .
Perhaps most enraging about Pederson 's article is that nowhere in it will you find even a recognition that Palestinians might be suffering more than Israelis !
There is no excuse for this , especially in the aftermath of Israel 's most recent onslaught on Gaza that killed over 1,400 Palestinians in 22 days , leaving the already blockaded territory in ruins .
And , incidentally , Israel 's Gaza assault had the support of 84 percent of Israeli Jews , according to opinion polls .
Of course , there are Israeli Jews who will become disgusted with Zionism and turn against it ( Orr and Machover are clearly testament to this ) .
But we can't ignore the fact that an overwhelming majority of Israelis support their government 's violent and racist policies against Palestinians -- because those policies allow Israel to continue existing on stolen land .
Marxists should n't ignore reality .
The fact is that the Israeli working class materially benefits from the financial support the state receives from its patron , the U.S. government .
( The ISO , by the way , has never argued that the " Israel lobby " controls the U.S. government , as Pederson 's article disingenuously suggests -- we have written many articles in our publications arguing the opposite ) .
As Machover and Orr explain :
Israel is not a country where foreign aid flows entirely into private pockets ; it is a country where this aid subsidizes the whole of society .
The Jewish worker in Israel does not get his share in cash , but he gets it in terms of new and relatively inexpensive housing , which could not have been constructed by raising capital locally ; he gets it in industrial employment , which could not have been started or kept going without external subsidies ; and he gets it in terms of a general standard of living which does not correspond to the output of that society .
That is the reality of the state of Israel .
And that is why a movement for boycott , divestment and sanctions against Israel can play such an important role .
It can help to build international working class solidarity -- which we caught a glimpse of , thanks to the brave dockworkers in Durban .
How 's that for " charting a revolutionary course forward " ?
Pederson and the SWP need to get a grip .
Rather than using half - truths and lies to slander other socialists and pro-Palestine activists ( when we finally have some real momentum going ! ) , they should take up some of the real questions facing the movement .
And then they should decide which side they 're on : the oppressor or the oppressed ?

With at least the tacit backing of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officials , operatives linked to anti-Castro terrorists introduced African swine fever virus into Cuba in 1971 .
Six weeks later an outbreak of the disease forced the slaughter of 500,000 pigs to prevent a nationwide animal epidemic .
A U.S. intelligence source told Newsday last week he was given the virus in a sealed , unmarked container at a U.S. Army base and CIA training ground in the Panama Canal Zone , with instructions to turn it over to the anti-Castro group .

I also spent quite a while dealing with that and had it taken down .
Well , it 's the internet so yet again I found that an article I wrote on my new blog , Collectibles Mercantile was scraped , stolen and appears on some site called e-shout.com .
The worst part is that they actually have the html code for that page and a box where people can copy and paste the article along with all of my photos and use it as their own work .
Of course I was furious but quickly remembered the frustration and stress it caused me the last couple of times this happened .
I am not going to do anything about it .
All I have to say is I feel sorry for people who do not have the intelligence to write …
This blog has absolutely nothing to do with swedish furniture
In an attempt to nail down what psychological aspects factor into " the successful life , " researchers have been following 268 Harvard students from the 1940s until now , conducting extensive physical and psychological tests each year .

In a lengthy but fascinating piece , The Atlantic reports on what 's known as the Grant Study and its current lead , Dr. George Vaillant .
These days Vaillant 's speeches about the study 's findings focus on the effect of positive emotions on well - being .
It 's no surprise that love , compassion , gratitude , hope , trust , faith , and forgiveness make us happier people who live longer and healthier lives .
Still , negative emotions , like anger , sadness , and distrust , can be more attractive psychologically in the short term .
Vaillant explains :
Positive emotions make us more vulnerable than negative ones .
One reason is that they 're future - oriented .
Fear and sadness have immediate payoffs — protecting us from attack or attracting resources at times of distress .
Gratitude and joy , over time , will yield better health and deeper connections — but in the short term actually put us at risk .
That 's because , while negative emotions tend to be insulating , positive emotions expose us to the common elements of rejection and heartbreak .

Of course the Grant Study is rife with problems , not the least of which that it was limited to males who graduated from Harvard , and that at one point it was funded by Philip Morris , which led to questions about what the participants ' cigarette brand preferences were .
Still , this story is worth a read , with full hope that it will lead to more long - term studies that are more inclusive and more fully and consistently funded .
( Interestingly , John F. Kennedy was one of the Grant Study men , but his records have been sealed until 2040 . )

HENRYETTA —
A state trooper caught on video kicking a handcuffed woman faces a misdemeanor assault and battery charge .
Barry Jacob E. Rowland , 32 , of Bixby has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the charge against him , Oklahoma Highway Patrol spokesman Capt .
Chris
West said .
Rowland has been a trooper since May 2006 .
Rowland was charged March 3 in Okmulgee County District Court .
He is accused of repeatedly kicking Dana Michelle Walls , 32 , of Tulsa on Nov. 21 while she lay handcuffed on the ground outside Carolina ’s Trail Club in Henryetta .
Calls to Rowland and his attorney , Gary James , were not returned .
Complaint filed against trooper
District Attorney Tom Giulioli said Walls did n’t file a complaint against Rowland .
The charge stems from allegations made by other officers responding to a call for assistance at the club that night .
The patrol headed the investigation , which includes statements from other troopers and Henryetta and Dewar police officers .
Giulioli said video from Rowland ’s patrol car and another trooper ’s vehicle show Rowland kicking Walls at least three times in the chest .
Rowland claims
Walls spit on him and was drunk , according to court records .
Walls is charged in Okmulgee County District Court with public intoxication and a felony complaint of placing bodily fluid on an officer .
Walls told The Oklahoman she does n’t recall how many times Rowland kicked her , but she woke up in the county jail the next morning with large bruises .
" I did n’t file a complaint because I figured I was n’t the first person this had happened to , ” Walls said .
" I doubt I ’ll be the last .
Besides , he ’s a cop .
I figured nothing would probably happen if I did ( file a complaint ) . ”
She said she did n’t spit on Rowland , but remembers Rowland asking her several times on the way to jail why she did it .
" I kept telling him ‘ I did n’t spit on you , ’ ” Walls said .
Giulioli said the video does n’t show Walls spitting on Rowland .
Patrol wo n’t release video
Patrol spokesman
West declined to release the patrol video to The Oklahoman , saying it is part of an ongoing investigation .
If convicted , Rowland could face up to 90 days in the county jail and be fined up to $ 1,000 .
If Walls is convicted of spitting on Rowland , she could be sentenced to up to five years in the county jail .
Giulioli said there are strict statutes protecting law enforcement officers who are assaulted .
" It may not seem fair , but I ’m not the one that makes the laws , ” Giulioli said .
" Take that up with the state Legislature . ”

John Burton was Tony Blair ’s agent throughout his 24 years as Sedgefield ’s MP .
Today , his book , looking at how religion coloured the Blair premiership , is published .
He talks to Chris Lloyd about faith , socialism and his own beliefs .
ON a table in a corner of John Burton ’s living room is a framed photograph of him and his wife , Lily , shaking hands with Bill Clinton .
On the table in the opposite corner is a Bible and a prayer book .
“ It was Alastair Campbell who said ‘ We do n’t do God ’ – but we did .
Tony did God all the time , ”
says Mr Burton .
Outside the window is Trimdon ’s 12th Century church of St Mary Magdalene which Mr Burton has attended as boy and man .
It was where , after prayers one fateful September Sunday in 1997 , Tony Blair uttered the immortal words to the world ’s TV cameras about the newly - deceased Diana being “ the People ’s Princess ” .
“ That ’s God in a wider sense , ” continues Mr Burton , whose new book is published today , and looks at how religion coloured Blair ’s premiership .
“ It was n’t a Christian thing .
In the end , Tony was taking the Bible and the Koran to bed and I know he was on his second time through the Koran when he was still prime minister .
“ Religion has played a big part in his life , and it is bound to affect decisions .
It affects everything . ”
Mr Burton was Blair ’s agent throughout his 24 years as Sedgefield MP .
He helped him grow from the gauche young barrister kipping in his spare room – Bible by his bedside – into a prime minister with enormous early popularity .
But that popularity whittled away as the war in Iraq wore on .
“ Tony was always aware of right and wrong , but it was n’t a Christian thing , more of an overall religious thing , ” says Mr Burton .
“ It did n’t matter whether it was a Christian or Muslim country in difficulty , if he felt that was the right thing to do he would support it .
“ That ’s the socialist side of it – supporting people who are less well off and in need of help .
The two are tied together .
“ I said to him the easiest thing for you to do over Iraq is to do nothing .
But he said ‘ I ca n’t do that John , not with all the information from the CIA , MI5 , and the French and Russian secret services about weapons of mass destruction – I ca n’t do nothing ’ .
“ He took the decision in the best interests of the country , but it ’s still an agonising decision , sending your young people to war .
He knew there would be a stage when it would be sorted out – but he also knew that before we reached that stage , there were going to be casualties . ”
Did a firm belief in God make that decision easier ?
A schoolboy throws a stone through a window and , when asked why , points at his friend and says : “ He made me do it . ”
A prime minister makes an unpopular decision and , when asked why , points to his God and says …
“ It does n’t work like that , ” says Mr Burton , momentarily exasperated .
“ ‘ I ’m doing something because God guides me ’ – that does n’t come into it .
You live your life according to your faith and you make the right decisions .
God does n’t come into it – otherwise you ’d get all the politicians out of the Cabinet and put the local priest , the archbishops , the chief rabbi and the Muslim and Sikh leaders in and ask them to make the decisions . ”
The book , written in conjunction with North - East television journalist Eileen Mc- Cabe , traces how Blair ’s faith was vital in the creation of New Labour , in Sedgefield .
Old socialism had ruled Durham for decades , and had failed , as the dying coalfield communities showed .
Mr Blair ’s arrival in 1983 coincided with the area ’s need for a different brand of Labour .
“ Tony believed socialism dragged people down .
It was n’t aspirational , did n’t attempt to lift people , ” says Mr Burton .
“ He was influenced by those Christian values of wanting people to be better off and so everything we did was about lifting people up : the minimum wage , improving social inclusion , improving hospitals and schools and people ’s chances in life . ”
It was because of Blair ’s religion that he controversially pushed on with creating faith schools , despite what his advisors recommended .
“ Faith schools ’ results were far better and he felt that had something to do with ethos of the school , the way children and staff interacted with the religious philosophy , ” says Mr Burton .
“ I thought single - faith schools were divisive – okay , let religion into school , but let the kids of different religions go to the same school .
“ I did n’t agree with Tony about those schools , but I ca n’t disagree that standards in those schools were higher . ”
Since leaving power two years ago , Blair has formed a faith foundation to bring the world ’s faiths closer together .
He became the first world leader to be photographed with US President Barack Obama at a National Prayer Breakfast , and he has converted to Catholicism , the church of his wife , Cherie .
“ Tony was a High Church Anglican and always said he did n’t see any reason to change – it was just as well he did n’t , as I ca n’t see how he would have got on with Ian Paisley as a Catholic , ” says Mr Burton .
‘ BUT I always felt a bit sorry for him when he went to a Catholic church like St John Fisher in Sedgefield with his family .
They went up for communion and , of course , he could n’t .
“ I remember staying at Chequers and we went to the Catholic church at Great Missenden .
I was at the end of the row and Euan , his son , gave me a great nudge in the ribs and said ‘ Go on ’ .
I know I ’m not supposed to , but I take communion in a Catholic church – I do it in good faith – so I led the family up .
Tony could n’t go .
It was ridiculous . ”
Mr Burton ’s own involvement in the church out of the window started when he joined the choir , aged ten .
“ All my friends were involved in the church .
We went together for choir practice and had a game of football on the green afterwards , ”
he says .
“ That does n’t happen now . ”
He had considered becoming a clergyman , but says : “ I ’ve always thought practical politics is where I ’ve shown my Christianity . ”
His wife has been flitting through the living room during the interview , tidying around , bringing coffee and keeping him right .
She ’s been just as immersed in the church out of the window and now it is helping her in her fight against serious illness .
“ I give thanks for every day and for my family , ”
she says , momentarily alighting on a cushion .
“ I really do .
I stay positive and I pray . ”
They really do do God , and always have done .

" Lost Levels "
Deep within Super Mario Bros. 3 lie hidden , unused levels .
Some of them seem polished , with working goals and plenty of enemies , while others are devoid of enemies , lacking exits , or too short to be full levels .
Whether they evolved into other levels , or were merely used for testing , the " lost levels " provide an interesting glimpse into the development of Mario 3 .
Lost enemies
The lost levels contain two enemies not present in the regular levels : Gold Cheep Cheeps , and Green Parabeetles .
The Gold Cheep Cheeps come in groups and swim faster than regular Cheep Cheeps .
The Green Parabeetle is basically a red Parabeetle that flies faster .
Our very own MEGAß ¥TE made a ROM patch that allows easy access to the lost levels -- if you have the SMB3 ROM .
He replaced World 1's map screen with a custom map , with pipes leading to the levels so that you can re-enter them as many times as you wish .
( Some patching programs and their instructions can be found here ) .
Below , we have maps of the levels with item and enemy positions , along with short descriptions .
Map key appears below the last description .
01
With the Kuribo Shoes , Spinies , and the two floors connected by pipes , this one reminds me of World 5 - 3 .
But , 5 - 3 started you out on the right , and only had one connecting pipe .
02
Another level reminiscent of 5 - 3 .
The end is really interesting , due to the unfinished nature of the level .
The pipe I 've marked with a " * " takes you to a Coin Heaven with a treasure chest containing a Jugem 's cloud at the end .
When you collect it , you are taken back to the map screen .
To find the real goal , you have to fly over the wall behind the pipe .
03
This one is like 7 - 3 with the hills , Continuous Starmen , and Lakitu .
Perhaps this was scrapped in favor of 7 - 3 .
What 's with that one Coin in the middle of nowhere ?
04
A lot like 1 - 5 , sans a Coin Heaven .
Big doors at the beginning are actually two doors side - by - side .
05
This one has a bunch of unused Tanooki Suit bonus rooms .
Game Genie code YLLLLI is great for walking through the walls to check out all the rooms .
Counting the pipes on the ground , numbers 4 , 5 , 7 , and 8 take you to empty space where you eventually fall to your doom .
If these were part of the real game , the pipes would take you back to the level .
06
In the original game , this level is also accessible with Game Genie code AOZULT because the START panel on World 1's map screen had a pointer to it , and the code forces level entry .
However , with the code , the colors are a bit off because other pointers are incorrect .
Inside this possible World 6 reject , annoying jumping Cheep - Cheeps and Fire Chomps show up at the most inconvenient times .
The blocks dip up and down like Worlds 3 - 3 and 3 - 8 .
There is actually a weird bug you can do here :
As " big " Mario , jump on the middle of the moving platform .
Do n't move , and as you pass directly under the wood block , Mario 's feet will stomp the Cheep Cheep , and then the Fire Chomp , which will force Mario off the moving platform .
But wait , now Mario 's standing in mid-air !
The game thinks you 're still on the platform , except what you 're now standing on is an invisible platform about one block long , so there 's nothing more you can do except walk off and fall in the water .
The goal area at the end actually goes up higher than what I 've mapped , but there 's nothing but the pipe up there so you 're not missing anything .
07
Argh , another auto - scrolling water level with Jelectros ( 7 - 4 ) .
The auto - scroll basically follows the Jelectro groups .
Near the end , the scroll will let you get out of the water onto a small stretch of land ( of mostly Munchers ) , then back into the water to the exit pipe .
New enemy : Gold Cheep Cheeps !
They act like their green brethren , except they swim faster , and in groups .
I think they were supposed to be in groups of threes ; the second time they appear , they start out too close to the water surface and only two appear .
08
Of all the " lost levels , " this one is my favorite .
To get to the top , you must swim up the waterfalls .
Small area , no enemies .
09
As in Worlds 3 - 3 and 3 - 8 , the blocks steadily move up and down .
New enemy : Green Parabeetles !
They act like the normal red ones , but move faster .
10
Another moving - block stage like 3 - 3 and 3 - 8 . More Green Parabeetles .
A possible enemy - infested Coin Heaven , because the end pipe would lead back to the level .
11
A lot of things here can be found in 1 - 6 .
12
A different take on # 11 , but a lot shorter .
No exit here , except the deadly pits .
13
Same as # 12 .
ROM offset : 230D4
Enemy offset : CB54
14
No enemies , no exit .
The black stuff at the top of the screen is interesting ; it 's possible the background is supposed to be black , and those are the stars .
15
No exit in this level either , nor any enemies to speak of except an inactive Bullet Bill cannon .
Interesting stacked cloud platforms here did n't appear in the final game .
Key = Coin = Brick Block = Brick Block w/ Coin = 10 - Coin Block ( in Brick Block ) = Question Block ( contains one Coin ) = Question Block w/ Fire Flower
( Super Mushroom if " small " Mario ) = Question Block w/ Super Leaf
( Super Mushroom if " small " Mario ) = Giant Question Block w/ Tanooki Suit = Question Block w/ Starman = Question Block w/ Continuous Starman
( will contain a Coin if Mario is not invincible ) = Note Block = Invisible Note Block ( leads to Coin Heaven ) = Invisible Block

Special thanks : to Mario Improvement 3 for first bringing the lost levels to my attention
to MEGAß¥TE for the ROM patch , which made mapping the levels a lot easier
to the SMB3 Level Discombobulator for help with the enemy starting points
Unused bonus games
Here we see Hammer Brother and Koopa Troopa sprites next to Toad , who hosts the bonus games .
It looks like these two traditional Mario enemies hosted dice games for keys and coins , and another game of chance for cards .
This IPS patch , made for the Japanese ROM by BMF54123 , replaces World 1's map screen with spade panels allowing access to the two partially working games .
Since the games are unfinished , the graphics are not 100 % correct .
This Japanese text , found with the other bonus game text , would be spoken by the hosts .
Unused text Translation １がでたら １
２がでたら かげを
それいがいは こいんをあげよ う
If " 1 " appears , 1 ( ? )
If " 2 " appears , I 'll give you a key
Otherwise , I 'll give you coins .

If an odd number appears ,
I 'll let you play the Roulette Game .
ぐーすうがでたら

２ もどれ 2 , return (? ) ものを やろう？ Give something ?
３かい ぷれいだ よ
Play three times !
ちゃんすは ２ か い
おなじ かーど を
２まい あててごら ん Chance to twice
Set aside two identical cards ２ もどれ 2 , return ( ? )
The Japanese text above exists in both the US and Japanese ROM .
Found with other bonus game and map screen sprites , these additional question mark graphics may have appeared in the unused bonus games .
( Picture on the right shows all the graphics . )

More unused sprites
This skull was ready for the map screen , while the " P - ball " and Toad sprites may have been made for the lost bonus games .
An unused propeller found with underwater sprites .
Some unused background graphics : spikes and a wheel .
CORRECTION : Though it looks like a Toad Suit , the sprite below is actually the Hammer Suit that pops out of the big Question Block in Worlds 6 - 10 and 7 - 8 .
Unused sprites above found by BMF54123 .
Debug mode
The debug mode in SMB3 is unlockable via Game Genie code KKKZSPIU .
( The code does not unlock the special menu screen the game testers saw , but it still works if you pay attention to the title screen . )
The debug mode has five features :
Start at any level - Press Up and Down to select from Worlds 1 through 8 , then press Start and you 're there !
Or , on controller 2 , press B + A + Down to rescue Princess Toadstool or B +
A + Right to go straight to the credits .

In a level , pressing Select upgrades Mario 's power .
( When Mario has the Hammer Brother Suit , pressing Select takes him back down to " small " Mario . )
The best part : Hold A or B and press Select to enable / disable Kuribo's Shoe !
The shoe might look a bit weird in levels it was never supposed to appear in , however ( as seen in the third screen shot below ) .

Everything works the same for Luigi as well .
When Super Mario All - Stars brought SMB3 to the Super NES , the " Select code " from the debug mode snuck into some copies of the game .
It works the same way , except you can also hold X or Y when toggling Kuribo 's Shoe .

Newsweek 's Joshua Alston got his laptop stolen when he was in the shower .
Sounds like the beginning of a porn movie , but it 's one about detectives .
Cyberdetectives that mock their suspects before sending the police .

Alston was showering when he heard a thump .
After coming out of the bathroom he noticed all his gadgets missing , including his laptop .
Fortunately , he had installed a little program called LogMeIn , which allowed him to securely and remotely log into his notebook .
He waited until the thief got online to start getting information that would allow him to pinpoint his location and go to the police .
While some cyberdetectives get to watch porn on the thief 's computer , Alston had some fun with him .
He deleted any music he uploaded to the system , keep messing around with anything he did and , on April 1st , changed his desktop picture to feature him photoshopped as a lepper .

Taking advantage of the solar - energy , a new futuristic - looking stadium in Kaohsiung , Taiwan , can generate its own electricity .
It is worth mentioning that the stadium has been constructed for the World Games , which are going to take place this July .
This is world 's first stadium to use exclusively solar power technology to produce all of its electricity , having 8,844 solar panels installed on its roof .
The solar panels will be able to produce the amount of electricity that could power 3,300 lights along with two giant monitors on the stadium .
Having the shape of a horse shoe , the huge structure can boast a seating capacity of 55,000 .
Its developers say that the stadium will be used for athletics and rugby events .
After the 2009 World Games , the Taiwanese national football team is going to play its home matches there , reports Daily Mail .
The design of the gigantic construction is attributed to Japanese architect Toyo Ito .
The somewhat unusual semi-spiral shape was designed with the goal of imitating a dragon and offering a " cordial welcome and a cheerful greeting " to all athletes and viewers with its open - ended structure .
According to a Taiwanese official , the solar panels will be able to produce up to 1.14 million kWh of electricity per year , which means a reduction on annual carbon dioxide emissions by 660 tons .
Everything that everyone learns , researches , discovers , creates is always based on what others have learned , researched , discovered or created .
Human knowledge is not original , rather it is a natural consequence of previous human knowledge .
We are not ever really creators .
Instead we are discoverers of truths .
Knowledge is global property .
Imagine a world , where all the progress and discoveries made in say the field of cancer research were treated as proprietary knowledge .
Not enough people would have access to life - saving knowledge , and more people would suffer and die .
The pharma industry , one of the most sinister elements of the realm of patent - mongery , is guilty of hiding knowledge , and preventing the discovery or spread of knowledge for the sake of material profit .
Look at the battles Big Pharma wages against generic HIV drugs .
What Big Pharma is saying is , they get to decide who knows or knows not .
Who lives or dies .
For the sake of profit .
Overpaid executives playing God with the wretched lives of brown children in far away lands .
Knowledge is for everybody .
To monopolize it , is to steal from all mankind .
I believe in ( Free ) and Open - Source Software ( FOSS ) .
Imagine people like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein had closed their knowledge from the eyes of the world .
Imagine , a world where only one man or one group of people know how to develop aspirin , birth control pills or band - aids .
Proprietary knowledge is the enslavement of the minds of people .

The concepts of progressive enhancement and graceful degradation have been in the air for a while .
However these terms are completely opposite , they are often used in conjunction .
It ’s not surprising as both pursue the same goal – to make web pages accessible to a variety of browsers and their versions .
Before digging deeper into the topic , I want to point out that progressive enhancement and graceful degradation are not frameworks , compilation of rules or technology stack and do n’t force you to avoid JavaScript .
They are just development methodologies , an approach if you like .
Graceful degradation
Image credit : Beacon
Graceful degradation means building an application with a baseline of full functionality available in modern browsers and then taking the layers off to ensure it works with older browsers .
Basically , you downgrade / degrade the enhanced version ( that why it ’s called this way ) .
Progressive enhancement
Image credit : Beacon
Progressive enhancement is the opposite of graceful degradation .
Instead of developing all features from the start , a web page is built from a baseline of the features supported by all browsers ( and browser versions ) .
Then , more advanced features are added like layers , so the web page takes advantage of the functionality newer browsers have to offer .
There is a great analogy suggested by Tiffany Tse .
If you want to make a cake , you actually start with baking the cake base .
In the web world , it might be a plain HTML so the page would work in every browser version and device .
Then , you ’d want to add icing , which can be considered as CSS .
If the browser does n’t understand CSS , it can ignore it but the web page will still be accessible .
You may also want to add topping and candles .
This would be a JavaScript in the web world .
It does n’t mean that you should avoid using JavaScript or build the core functionality with HTML only .
Before starting the development , you should decide what is the core functionality and how you can realize it .
If there is no way to avoid JavaScript – let it be .
Which one to choose ?
Both methods assist in making a website accessible alongside providing the enhanced features for those who can take advantage of it .
So which one is better ?
Progressive enhancement is usually considered a better practice as it starts with the simple basics and adds enhancements on top of that .
As progressive enhancement starts from HTML , not only it guarantees that the application will work in any browser , but also ensures that search engines and screen readers will understand it .
When designing something from scratch , you should be thinking in terms of progressive enhancement .
If you are trying to make an existing website more accessible and comply with new standards , the situation is different .
Unless you want to start everything over , graceful degradation is the path to follow in this case .
In regards of testing , it ’s way easier to test progressive enhancement than graceful degradation .
If we work from the progressive enhancement point of view , we can simply start with developing the basic version and verify whether it works properly .
Then we add one more layer and check if everything still works the right way and so on .
So , simply put , each time we add and additional layer , we need to verify it does n’t break the basic version .
On the contrary , we need a different approach when using graceful degradation .
The advanced features are already there and can be tested .
In order to verify that they do degrade gracefully , we must disable the support of those features .
In some cases you ’ll need to test in a different browser , but in most cases you can use accessibility features of Opera , Web Developer Toolbar in Firefox or Developer Tools of Chrome .
Also , note that Googlebot uses Chrome 41 for web rendering so make sure the website works properly in this Chrome version ( obviously , it should work the right way in all versions ) .
Regressive Enhancement
Regressive enhancement does n’t cause much buzz around but it ’s another methodology developers use all the time .
Regressive enhancement methodology means building a baseline of full features and then replicating / emulating full features through a regression using other technologies supported by the older browsers .
Regressive enhancement is often used alongside progressive enhancement as an abstraction layer on top of progressive enhancement .
For example , AngularJS and jQuery libraries are used to regressively enhance older browsers with features they do n’t support out of the box .
To sum up , progressive enhancement is considered to be the best way to follow and is used in the majority of cases ( layered with regressive enhancement ) .
But graceful degradation should n’t be considered as an “ unwanted ” approach .
It ’s important to understand that building a website , web developers use a combination of all three methodologies whether they know it or not .
Products like the Human Assistive Limb exoskeleton have a frustrating tendency to remain in the labs and universities that spawned them , usually for reasons of impracticality or cost .
But this one is going mainstream .

This is great news for HAL 's target market :
Its ability to grant its wearer tenfold strength increases during specific actions could change the lives of people with degenerative muscle diseases , or accident victims who would otherwise need long , difficult rehabilitative therapy to regain basic mobility .
And with a five - hour battery life , it could be quite practical for day to day use .

It 's also great news for extreme hobbyists , certain factory workers and the children of the rich , who can enjoy near - full robotization for about $ 4200 when these things start rolling off the line .
The first run , to be sold in Japan , is planned at 400 units , so unless you can make the case that your RoboCop fantasies are more important than giving a dystrophic Japanese child his legs back , you might still have a while to wait .

I received more feedback on Perl roles versus Duck Typing than any other entry in my series on Perl roles so far .
Much of this feedback asked very good questions and pointed out places where I 'd assumed that theory or implications were clear .
Before I compare Perl roles to any other mechanism , it seems useful to clarify more about what I meant in my duck typing entry .
If you have n't also read The Why of Perl Roles , start there .
Those design goals are important to understanding the benefits and drawbacks of other approaches .
Ca n't You Just Design Your Hierarchy Correctly ?
Ryan Funduk wrote in Ruby you can solve a lot of this by simply designing your class hierarchy appropriately ..
That 's true -- sometimes .
If your data model fits nicely into a singly - rooted hierarchy , and if you can add variants at the leaves of the inheritance tree , inheritance works just fine .
Sometimes that 's not possible .
Ruby ( and Perl and Python ) make that process much easier .
If your language supports multiple inheritance , you can have multiple parents ( but as Perl Roles versus Inheritance describes , multiple inheritance has its own complications ) .
Ca n't You Code More Carefully ?
paddy3118 pointed out , quite correctly , there 's no substitute for knowing your code .
I agree !
I worry less about my code than I do about the code of other people .
When I release code to the CPAN , I try to write robust code that 's sufficiently generic ( or polymorphic ) that I do n't prevent smart people from doing smart things I never anticipated .
I respect my published interfaces ( and theirs ) .
I do n't forbid subclassing or specialization .
I respect encapsulation .
Sometimes I even install tests that they can adapt and specialize if they adopt and specialize my code .
Of course I also try to write safe and robust code .
One of the mechanisms by which I try not to forbid other people from doing something I anticipated is to avoid forcing them to inherit from my classes .
I could sprinkle isa( ) checks throughout my code , but then they'd have to lie by overriding isa ( ) or inherit when they really wanted to delegate or reimplement or compose .
I could throw can ( ) checks to make sure that whatever they pass in supports a method of the appropriate name , but that leaves the code vulnerable to the false cognate problem .
I could ignore all of those possibilities and tell people that if the code breaks , they get to sweep up the pieces .
I prefer something safer and less prescriptive .
If you pass my code an object which you 've explicitly marked as performing a role we both understand , great !
My code will do its best to work with it in a way that we both understand .
There may be bugs -- especially bugs of mutual misunderstanding of what that role implies -- but the role system will protect us against typos and incompleteness and collisions , and that 's something you do n't get from duck typing .
What if someone gets a role wrong ?
Then your program has bugs , the same way as if someone gets inheritance wrong .
What if a role is n't a sufficient test of interoperability ?
Then your program has bugs , the same way as if someone gets inheritance wrong .
What if two implementations of a role are incompatible in a given context ?
I 'm not sure what this means .
If you compose two roles into a class and both roles supply a method of the same name , the role system will throw a compilation error .
It wo n't try to disambiguate them ; it cannot .
You will have to do so .
This often means figuring out the context in which your class will perform one method or another and writing your own method which can dispatch appropriately .
Dog / Tree is a Dumb Example
Justin Donaldson wrote two longer , thoughtful responses : Duck Typing and " Roles " in Object Oriented Programming and Duck Typing and " Roles " .
Justin's right ; the " A dog can bark ( ) and a tree has bark ( ) example is silly . "
That 's part of the reason it's a catchy Perl cliché .
It 's a deliberately simple , deliberately dumb example you can explain in a sentence or two to demonstrate a very real principle that appears in code in much more subtle ways : similar words do not always mean similar things .
If you prefer an example from spoken languages , never tell a native Spanish speaker that you 're embarazada when you mean that you 're embarrassed .
Ca n't You Check Multiple Methods ?
Justin pointed out that if checking for the existence of a single method on an invocant of unknown type is insufficient to determine its type equivalence , checking for multiple methods is safer .
I agree -- but then you have to check for multiple methods ( likely with your runtime reflection system ) , and you 've only reduced your uncertainty of false cognates .
I 'm sure you can see where this is going .
Perhaps after you 've checked three methods you 've reduced your uncertainty sufficiently , at the cost of multiple lines of code and multiple runtime checks .
Perl Roles force you to specify roles explicitly
Yes , they do .
To perform a role , add does Name to your class declaration .
I joke .
It 's not quite that easy .
For that to work , you must have identified a role in your system somehow , either by declaring it explicitly ( similar to how you 'd declare a class , except using the role keyword instead of the class keyword , for a savings of one character ) or by declaring a class and treating that class as a role ( an ability you get for free ) .
If your program is small and you 're not worried about future extension or the cost of false cognates or duck typing problems , do n't use roles .
Do n't use types .
Do n't use inheritance .
That 's perfectly acceptable .
They 're most valuable in larger systems where you do want pervasive polymorphism and extensibility without worrying about the drawbacks of ad hoc and unspecified invocations .
Checking methods is silly anyway ; no one does that !
If duck typing 's drawbacks were n't a problem , you would n't see Wikipedia on Duck Typing recommending the use of Python try / catch blocks for invoking methods on unknown invocants .
If the method call cannot possibly fail , there 's no reason to catch the " Hey , this method call failed !
Hm ! " exception .
Similarly , using can ( ) to check that an invocant supports a potential method is a well - worn idiom in Perl in the same way that checking responds_to ? is hoary Ruby .
I 've never used Justin 's haXe , so I 'm completely unqualified to talk about how it solves these problems .
I can only take his word for it .
However ....
There 's no boilerplate if you predeclare a type !
Justin's followup argues that if you predeclare a type which defines an interface and use that interface pervasively throughout your system where you would normally use a type , you do n't have to write boilerplate reflection code .
I agree , but I 've categorized that as writing an interface ( see Perl Roles versus Interfaces and ABCs ) : the act of explicitly declaring some combination of behavior and naming it and modifying your program to use that type instead of concrete , instantiable types .
You can do the same thing with roles .
( You can also do more with roles . )
This is a fine technique , and I 've used it to good effect .
I do n't classify it as duck typing , because it 's an act of will to define this entity .
I do n't want to quibble over definitions , however .
Runtime reflection checks are rare in my code
Good !
You do n't run into the same problems I do .
Roles are rigid and top down
I 'm not sure I agree with this .
Most of the uses I 've seen of roles are anything but rigid and top down .
They 're definitely more formal and structured than duck typing , but less so than subclassing inheritance .
My colleague and sometimes co-author Ovid had a throwaway paragraph buried in his Flying Without Source Control rumination that using roles at the BBC has improved the flexibility of their code such that projects that would have taken multiple months now take minutes .
Roles violate Perl 's loosely structured nature
" Violate " is a strong word , but a robust system is a robust system .
Does Perl 's test - infected culture violate its nature ?
Does the presence of an optional mechanism for managing code reuse and declaring the expected behaviors and relationships of entities without mandating their implementations of their behavior substantially change the nature of the language for the worse ?
That 's a philosophical question , and I 'm not going to answer the worst case scenario .
I prefer to believe that allowing the use of roles -- without mandating their use -- provides Perl with more opportunities to write great , robust , extensible , and understandable code .
Certainly Ovid 's writings demonstrate that his team has used them to great effect .
( While he 's one of the best and most reliable coders I 've ever worked with , he 'll be the first to disclaim any notions of rockstardom . )
I still do n't get it
That 's fine .
Roles are subtle .
I spent several years burning my fingers trying to combine code reuse with sufficient genericity and robust coding .
When we saw Andrew Black present the Smalltalk Traits paper , a couple of my colleagues convinced me that what I was developing was sufficiently similar to the paper that Perl 6 could borrow their formalisms and achieve my goals .
If you really want to stretch your mind , consider this : what if your language had pervasive multi- dispatch built in , and dispatched not based on the class of all of its dispatchable invocants , but on the role of all of its dispatchable invocants ?
Remember , every class implies a role .
I do n't intend to disparage any code that uses duck typing ( or inheritance or interfaces or abstract base classes ) successfully ... but consider the implications in the previous paragraph .
How would you even build such a thing using those techniques ?
Remember my design constraints for roles :
They must not dictate the implementation of conforming entities , allowing inheritance or delegation or composition or reimplementation .
They must not require editing existing entities to enable or improve polymorphic capabilities .
They must be full - fledged members of the type system .
They must provide compile - time disambiguation and refuse ambiguous composition .
If those are n't your design goals , that 's fine .
You can write a lot of useful , maintainable programs without them .
Yet I believe we can write even more programs with them .
Disagreement over the definition of atheist and agnostic has cluttered up various threads here , scattering confusion in its wake like a muckspreader in autumn .
The cause of the confusion is that atheists and theists have different definitions of the words agnostic and atheist , and adamantly refuse to accept the validity of each other 's definitions .
Here is a short form of the definitions from the two separate points of view .
Theist version :
An atheist is certain there is no God , an agnostic is not certain .
Atheist version :
An atheist believes there is no God , an agnostic does n't know .
The two versions are only subtly different , but a great deal of hot air has been expended on this difference .
Let 's look at the two definitions of atheist first , because this is where the cause of the confusion really resides .
It is the distinction between " believes " and " is certain " .
In choosing the two different forms of words , I am trying to convey that the theists ' definition of atheism suggests that atheists know beyond any possibility of doubt that they have proof of God 's nonexistence .
The self - described atheists tend to use the word " believe " as meaning a very high degree of confidence , sufficient to live their lives on this basis , but falling short of 100 % proven certainty .
When atheists try to explain this , a common riposte from theists is " You 're not 100 % certain , so you 're not an atheist , you 're just an agnostic , because you do n't really know ! "
There is a reason why some theists define atheism in these terms .
If they define atheists as being 100 % certain of the non-existence of God , then they can claim that atheists hold their view as a faith position .
This appears to make some theists more comfortable , it frames the debate in more familiar terms – a religious battle between competing faiths .
Also , by widening the definition of agnostic as far as possible , I suspect that some theists feel more comfortable with the idea that these waverers may in due course return to the one true faith .
There are very few self - described atheists who conform to the theists ' definition of atheism .
This is because the great majority of atheists have a scientific understanding of the world , and do not hold their atheism as a matter of faith , but rather through their understanding of the balance of evidence .
They are aware that in principle some new piece of evidence might turn up tomorrow , and they leave themselves open to that possibility , no matter how unlikely they believe it to be .
If you accept that some degree of confidence short of 100 % proved certainty of God 's nonexistence is sufficient to allow somebody to qualify for the description of atheist , then how short of 100 % certainty do you have to be before agnostic is a more accurate description ?
It 's a fuzzy boundary and there is no objective answer .
I take the practical view that if people are sufficiently certain they call themselves atheists and in practice live their lives on the assumption of God 's nonexistence , then it is not very useful to insist on describing them as agnostic .
As for the boundary between believers in any faith and agnostics , I 'm quite happy to apply the same principle .
A Christian is somebody who says he is a Christian , and an agnostic is somebody who says he does n't know .
If we all accept each other 's self - applied labels , we can all get along much better .
So I 'm an atheist .
OK ?
Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh : the making of a mass murderer
By David Walsh
19 April 2001
Timothy McVeigh , the Oklahoma City bomber , is scheduled to die May 16 by lethal injection at a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute , Indiana .
On April 19 , 1995 , McVeigh detonated a seven - ton truck bomb outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building that killed 168 people , including 19 children , in the deadliest act of terrorism ever committed on US soil .
The impending execution has once again raised issues surrounding the bombing and the figure of McVeigh himself .
Various commentaries have appeared in the media , most of them superficial in the extreme .
As a rule , they go no farther than discussing McVeigh 's subjective motives , and generally reach the conclusion that he is nothing more than a monstrous aberration , whose emergence is not related to broader social questions .
Approaching McVeigh in this manner is not only inadequate , it is an evasion .
To grasp the Oklahoma City tragedy and the character of its perpetrator requires seriously examining and coming to grips with some ugly truths about American society .
The most striking and immediate aspect of McVeigh and the atrocity he committed is something official commentators pass over in virtual silence — the intense alienation from society and its official establishment that he exhibits .
What accounts for such a level of alienation , and the anti-social form it has assumed in the figure of McVeigh ?
What is the socio- psychological process that transformed a working class youth into an unrepentant mass murderer ?
McVeigh 's cold - blooded act horrified millions in the US and around the world .
But a recently published book , American Terrorist : Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing by two Buffalo News reporters , Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck , reports that McVeigh has no regrets about his act .
He openly acknowledged having set off the bomb to the authors and claims sole responsibility for the mass killing .
During an appearance on ABC News's “ Prime Time Thursday ” March 29 , Herbeck commented , “ He [ McVeigh ] never expressed one ounce of remorse for the Oklahoma City bombing . ”
Michel described McVeigh 's reaction to the explosion 's aftermath : “ Damn , I did n't knock the building down .
I did n't take it down . ”
According to Michel and Herbeck , McVeigh claimed not to have known that a day - care center was located in the Murrah Building , and that if he had known it , in his own words , “ it might have given me pause to switch targets .
That 's a large amount of collateral damage . ”
Michel and Herbeck quote McVeigh , with whom they spoke for some 75 hours , on his attitude to the victims : “ To these people in Oklahoma who have lost a loved one , I 'm sorry but it happens every day .
You 're not the first mother to lose a kid , or the first grandparent to lose a grandson or a granddaughter .
It happens every day , somewhere in the world .
I 'm not going to go into that courtroom , curl into a fetal ball , and cry just because the victims want me to do that . ”
McVeigh 's lack of remorse for the deaths of 19 children , as well as secretaries , clerks , administrators and others employed by the federal government , and the dozens of people who were merely visiting the building , should serve as a warning about the character of elements promoted by the ultra - right in the US .
They are brutal , cowardly and ruthless .
While American Terrorist contains some valuable material , it provides little insight into the social source of McVeigh 's act .
Indeed Michel and Herbeck end their work on the following note : “ The same imponderable question haunts those who lost sons , daughters , spouses , friends , and other loved ones when America 's long - simmering tensions over gun rights and big government exploded in Oklahoma City .
Why ? ”
This amounts to an admission of failure on the part of authors who , by all rights , should have dedicated their 388 - page book to answering that very question .
One would certainly not go to the house - organ of liberal complacency , the New York Times , for an explanation of “ Why ? ”
The Times , in a March 30 editorial , denounces McVeigh without making any effort to explain the conditions that produced him .
The newspaper 's editorial asserts that the Oklahoma City bomber 's comments reveal “ a mind warped by self - induced militancy and by a detached , phonily objective language of profit and loss . ”
The editorial writers of the Times imply there are no social circumstances in the US that would justify militant opposition to the status quo , from any quarter , left or right .
The editorial absolves American society ; McVeigh , according to the logic of the Times , in no way reflects on the social and political order as a whole .
Human beings , however , are social creatures and develop their personalities and psyches as members of a particular society under definite historical conditions .
Their essence is the composite of their social relationships .
Individuality lies in the specific and unique manner in which a man or woman reflects and refracts a variety of social and historical processes .
The growth of the extreme right in the US , a process that has had semi-official sponsorship over a period of decades , made it virtually inevitable that someone would carry out an atrocious act like the Oklahoma City bombing .
For Timothy McVeigh to turn out to be that someone , many things in his life had to fall into place .
Two social processes come together in the life experience of Timothy McVeigh — economic blight and political reaction .
McVeigh was born in April 1968 in Lockport , a town of some 23,000 in western New York state , 20 miles northeast of Buffalo and 15 miles east of Niagara Falls .
Lockport is cut in half by the Erie Canal , from whose locks the town gets its name .
The Buffalo area was a major business and industrial center by the beginning of the twentieth century .
In 1910 Henry Harrison began making automotive radiators in a small shop in Lockport .
By 1920 Harrison Radiator was a division of General Motors and remained one until 1995 , when Harrison Thermal Systems was spun off to Delphi Automotive Systems .
Harrison remains the largest employer in Lockport .
Both Timothy McVeigh 's grandfather ( 30 years ) and father ( 36 years ) worked at the Harrison plant .
By the late 1970s the state of western New York 's economy and the automobile and steel industries that formed its backbone had begun to worsen dramatically .
Harrison stopped hiring in 1979 .
The steel mills in the Buffalo area were decimated in the early 1980s by slump and international competition .
The city and region entered into a spiral of decline .
As a 1995 Washington Post profile noted : “ McVeigh 's teens coincided with the most traumatic economic times since the Depression .
Buffalo's experience was typical of the Rust Belt .
Major blue - collar employers — auto and steel — shut down or downsized dramatically .
Two major banks failed , throwing thousands of white - collar workers out of jobs and causing downturns in real estate , advertising , law and other fields . ”
On the same day in early April 2001 that the Buffalo News published the third and final excerpt of Michel and Herbeck 's book on McVeigh , it carried an article reporting that the Buffalo Niagara region had “ lost a bigger share of its population during the 1990s than any major metropolitan area in the nation , ” according to an analysis of the recently - released 2000 census figures .
The decline dropped Buffalo - Niagara from the thirty - fourth to the forty - third largest metropolitan region in the US .
Economic decay has been accompanied over the last quarter century by a growth of social inequality that has increasingly split American society into two worlds : a small , fabulously wealthy elite and the vast bulk of the population , either struggling to get by or living in outright poverty .
This has been as true in the Buffalo area as everywhere else .
A few suburbs have flourished , while the inner city has decayed and once relatively stable working class communities have deteriorated .
Decay and social polarization , however , cannot entirely explain Timothy McVeigh 's evolution .
Why did the discontent in the late 1980s and early 1990s primarily take the form of the growth of right - wing militia - type movements ?
Why was there not a growing movement against capitalism ?
Why did McVeigh 's own disaffection take a right - wing direction ?
McVeigh came to maturity during the years of the Reagan presidency , a period characterized by a relentless attack on the living standards and gains of the working class and an equally ferocious assault by right - wing ideologues against every current of progressive social thought .
Anticommunism , directed against the “ Evil Empire ” of the Soviet Union , militarism , racism , national chauvinism , religious bigotry and fanaticism , conformism and a general intellectual deadening — every form of reaction flourished .
This had its consequences .
In McVeigh 's case , the barrage of right - wing propaganda apparently combined with an emotional vulnerability — his parents ' marriage began to break up when he was 11 ; he was slightly built and bullied in school — to form a particular kind of paranoid adolescent personality .
From an early age , he was obsessed with survivalism .
At 14 ( 1983 ) he was stockpiling food , camping equipment and weapons “ in case of a nuclear attack or the communists taking over the country , ” according to a neighbor .
Accounts of the tribulations endured during the gas shortage of 1973 - 74 , plus his own experience during the great blizzard of 1977 , when Buffalo was virtually shut down and large numbers of people were left without means of transportation , helped convince McVeigh that individuals had to learn to fend for themselves .
According to Michel and Herbeck , he read gun magazines voraciously and ordered books from advertisements on their pages .
“ One that captivated him was a volume entitled To Ride , Shoot Straight and Speak the Truth , by Jeff Cooper , a military man and a world - renowned expert on self - defense .
... The Turner Diaries was another book that hit a nerve .
The novel by former American Nazi Party official William L. Pierce ( under the pen name Andrew McDonald ) had become a kind of bible for a loose movement of gun collectors , militia groups , and government protesters after its publication in 1978 . ”
The book 's narrative “ is sympathetic to Adolf Hitler , suggests that blacks and Jews are inherently evil , and advocates killing them . ”
Apocalyptic and anticommunist Hollywood films also captivated McVeigh , including The Omega Man , Logan 's Run , the Planet of the Apes series and especially the 1983 Cold War screed Red Dawn ( directed by right - winger John Milius ) — about a group of small - town teenagers who become guerrilla fighters when “ communists ” invade the US — which he rented four times .
He also favored militaristic fantasies like First Blood , the first of the Rambo films , and Missing in Action , in which Chuck Norris rescues American prisoners of war .
McVeigh began collecting guns and firing them , going so far as to purchase a 10 - acre piece of property in southwestern New York with a friend where they could fire their weapons in peace .
During the 1980s right - wing politicians and media types stirred up racism , often couched in attacks on “ welfare cheats ” and the like .
McVeigh grew up in a lily - white community where , according to Michel and Herbeck , “ brown and black faces were about as common as Martians . ”
After a brief stint at a two - year business college — he scored high on mathematical aptitude tests and had an early interest in computers and the Internet — McVeigh went to work for an armored car service in Buffalo .
He got his first exposure “ to racism during those armored - car runs through the city .
On runs to check - cashing shops on the East Side of Buffalo , his white co-workers spared little sympathy for the shop 's heavily minority clientele and the minorities who lived in the area . ”
McVeigh 's unhappy or distorted relations with women helped fuel his rage .
His mother took the active role in breaking up his parents ' marriage and left her son behind with her husband .
McVeigh apparently developed a wider resentment .
According to Michel and Herbeck , in interviews McVeigh “ would also lash out — repeatedly and emotionally — at the concept of working mothers and two - income families , which he considered a major cause of problems in American society .
‘ In the past thirty years , because of the women 's movement , they 've taken an influence out of the household , ' ” he told the reporters .
( It can hardly have failed to occur to McVeigh that an explosion in an office building during working hours would be likely to kill or injure mostly female employees , which , in fact , his bomb did . )
Reading about his life , one wonders if McVeigh — and his experience was hardly unique — ever encountered a single left - wing or socialist idea during his entire youth .
No one is born to be a right - wing terrorist .
But the social , intellectual and psychological circumstances of McVeigh 's upbringing mitigated against his inchoate discontent finding a progressive channel .
The unrelenting character of the right - wing propaganda in the 1980s and early 1990s was only made possible by the advanced state of decay of American liberalism and the Democratic Party .
“ Reaganism ” was , in fact , a bipartisan policy ; the Democrats , who controlled Congress , were fully complicit in the attacks on the working class .
They either openly joined in the chorus of attacks on the poor or adapted themselves to them .
In cities like Buffalo , Democrats participated in cutting budgets and social services .
Not wanting to be outdone by Reagan and his cohorts , Democratic Party politicians took every opportunity to promote anticommunism and militarism .
Figures like Bill Clinton , a governor of a small , “ right - to - work ” Southern state , were promoted by the right - wing Democratic Leadership Council , which by the 1990s became the dominant force within the party .
During these years the Democratic Party abandoned the policies of social reform identified with the Great Society and the War on Poverty of the early 1960s ( which themselves were of an extremely limited character ) , and generally repudiated any form of “ income redistribution ” to lessen economic inequality and improve the conditions of broad masses of people .
The Democrats , basing themselves on an ever more narrow social base , turned to fiscal conservatism , catering more and more directly to big business , and to identity politics , appealing to the more privileged layers of blacks and other minorities .
It is worth noting in this context that McVeigh became even more susceptible to the propaganda of the right when , following his army service , he scored high on civil service exams for both the state and federal governments and failed to land jobs because , he believed , of affirmative action programs favoring black applicants .
One feature of Michel and Herbeck 's book that jumps out at the reader is the absence of a single reference to the unions and , in particular , to the United Auto Workers .
UAW Local 686 at Harrison Radiator was formed in 1943 .
The Washington Post depicts McVeigh 's father , Bill , as “ a registered Democrat and union man who on a recent afternoon sported a black nylon United Auto Workers windbreaker and baseball cap . ”
It is a damning indictment of the AFL - CIO unions that right - wing militia groups emerged in industrial states where years of layoffs , carried out with the complicity of the unions , had devastated the working class .
The UAW , to which members of the McVeigh family had been paying dues for 52 years by the time of the Oklahoma City bombing , had long ceased to represent a progressive social force .
Corporatism was now its official policy , and union leaders had intervened for years to help impose wage cuts and other concessions as agents of the auto companies .
The UAW and United Steelworkers had been at the forefront of the chauvinist frenzy during the 1980s , with their anti-Japanese campaigns .
In towns like Lockport they played a deeply reactionary social role .
Local 686 , with approximately 9,700 “ active and retired members , ” according to a column in the UAW 's Solidarity magazine , continues to promote chauvinism ( although the Harrison Thermal Division makes parts for every major European , Japanese and Korean auto manufacturer ) , sponsoring “ a Buy American weekend each year and ... staunchly promoting American - and union - made products . ”
In May 1988 , after six months of the armored car job and seeing no future for himself in Buffalo , McVeigh , just turned 20 , joined the US Army .
Along with the other recruits , he underwent a process of brutalization in the military .
Michel and Herbeck comment : “ During dawn runs and their long , exhausting marches over the Georgia sand , their sound - offs revolved around killing and mutilating the enemy , or violent sex with women .
‘ Blood makes the grass grow ! ' recruits were taught to chant .
‘ Kill ! Kill ! Kill !'
‘ I ca n't hear you ! ' barked the sergeant .
‘ Blood makes the grass grow !
Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! ' ”
McVeigh continued to develop and promulgate his right - wing views in the army .
It was here he met Terry Nichols , his fellow conspirator in the Oklahoma City bombing .
McVeigh ran into difficulty with his evident racism in the army , when he was accused , as a sergeant , of assigning blacks to the worst jobs .
His love of the army and its discipline conflicted with his views of the US government as oppressive and representative of the New World Order , stalking horse for a UN - dominated world government and so on .
The experience of the Persian Gulf War , during which he operated a Bradley fighting vehicle , apparently deepened his misgivings about the role of the US military .
McVeigh , a crack shot , was gung - ho about the war when it began in February 1991 .
However , Michel and Herbeck write : “ The American soldiers pictured their adversaries as bloodthirsty zealots , slashing throats and firing chemical weapons .
Instead they found a bedraggled horde of Iraqis , poorly trained , organized , and equipped ....
McVeigh felt as if he were one of the bullies , one of a type he had reviled since childhood . ”
McVeigh left the army in late 1991 , embittered with the military and the US government .
He expected that some employer would be happy to employ a Gulf War hero .
Michel - Herbeck comment : “ But it did n't work out that way .
Western New York , its economy still struggling as it had been when he went off to the Army , did n't have much to offer McVeigh — a realization that hit him hard .
The next thirteen months back in Pendleton [ where his father had moved from Lockport ] would turn out to be the most disappointing time of his life , and it would drive him into a deep depression . ”
McVeigh obtained a job as a security guard for Burns Security .
He began writing letters to local newspapers and politicians , expressing his right - wing , populist views .
Here is a typical confused passage :
“ Racism on the rise ?
You had better believe it .
Is this America 's frustrations venting themselves ?
Is it a valid frustration ?
Who is to blame for the mess ?
At a point when the world has seen communism falter as an imperfect system to manage people , democracy seems to be headed down the same road .
No one is seeing the ‘ big ' picture .
“ Maybe we have to combine ideologies to achieve the perfect utopian government .
Remember , government - sponsored health care was a communist idea .
Should only the rich be allowed to live longer ?
Does that say that because a person is poor he is a lesser human being and does n't deserve to live as long , because he does n't wear a tie to work ? ”
He added ominously : “ Is civil war imminent ?
Do we have to shed blood to reform the current system ? ”
The events at Ruby Ridge in August 1992 , during which a FBI sniper shot and killed the wife of a white supremacist in Idaho , hardened McVeigh 's resolve .
The massacre of the Branch Davidians at Waco , Texas — the site of which McVeigh had visited earlier in the siege — on April 19 , 1993 by federal law enforcement forces helped to send him over the edge .
Now dividing his time between Arizona , Michigan and western New York , McVeigh began associating with militia groups and producing pamphlets of his own .
In a letter to an ex-friend in July 1994 he wrote : “ Blood will flow in the streets , Steve .
Good vs. Evil .
Free Men vs. Socialist Wannabe Slaves .
Pray it is not your blood , my friend . ”
By the autumn of 1994 McVeigh had apparently decided to blow up a federal building .
He claims that Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier , both of whom were charged in the crime , were his only accomplices .
This seems dubious .
McVeigh by this time had connections throughout the extreme right - wing underworld and it is known that before the bombing he called a number of fascist and racist organizations in search of a prospective hideout .
McVeigh justified his bombing , now set for the second anniversary of the Waco massacre — April 19 , 1995 — on military and tactical grounds .
Michel and Herbeck note : “ The Army had been his teacher in the horrors of war ....
‘ You learn how to handle killing in the military , ' he explained .
‘ I face the consequences , but you learn to accept it . '
“ It was the same tactic the American government used in armed international conflicts , when it wanted to send a message to tyrants and despots .
It was the United States government that had ushered in this new anything - goes mentality , McVeigh believed , and he intended to show the world what it would be like to fight a war under these new rules , right in the federal government 's own backyard . ”
McVeigh was shaped , and warped , in a very direct way by both the internal and external sides of the deepening crisis of American capitalism — the growth of social inequality and political reaction at home , and the eruption of American militarism abroad .
Michel and Herbeck are incapable of explaining , even defining , McVeigh 's political outlook .
Concerning the period following McVeigh 's graduation from high school , they write : “ For the first time in his life , Tim was reading widely , and really beginning to think about himself and his place in the world .
He knew he loved guns , the outdoors , and heading off in his car to explore things .
And it must have been around this time that he fixed upon the idea of freedom — as his guiding principle , as the value he loved most of all . ”
“ Freedom ” is sympathetically identified here with McVeigh 's extreme individualist and even misanthropic sentiments ; it is divorced from the project of liberating humanity from economic and social oppression .
Because of their own political blindness , Michel and Herbeck come dangerously close to offering an apology for McVeigh and his actions in this passage and others .
The authors confuse their subject 's social dissatisfaction with the anti-social and reactionary means he found of expressing it .
Michel and Herbeck paint a picture of McVeigh 's ultra - right conceptions , but they are incapable of going beyond characterizing his politics as “ anti- government , ” making no distinction between right - wing and left - wing opposition to the status quo .
McVeigh opposed the federal government for its intrusions and repressions , but he largely saw it not as the representative of an exploiting elite , but as the embodiment of collective versus individual activity .
And he identified the federal government as the defender of minorities , women and others who , he believed , were eating away at his perceived status as a white male .
McVeigh 's act of mass terror heralded the emergence of a fascist tendency in the US .
As the statement printed in the May 8 , 1995 issue of the International Workers Bulletin ( predecessor of the World Socialist Web Site ) , which we are posting today , explained : “ The bombing was a conscious political act .
From the standpoint of the fascists who carried it out , their present lack of popular support was all the more reason for an outrage of huge proportions .
It was their way of announcing their arrival on the political scene . ”
“ Fascist ” is not simply an epithet .
The appeal of ultra-right militia movements in the US is attributable , in the first place , to the worsening of economic conditions that have thrown wide layers of the population off balance , deeply alienating many .
A small minority of disoriented middle - class and working class elements have evolved an opposition to the status quo that rejects parliamentary - democratic norms and embraces what it conceives to be “ revolutionary ” means , i.e. , terrorism .
Fascism finds its ideological sources in the filth thrown up by decaying bourgeois society : racism , anti-Semitism , the cult of guns and violence .
The authors of American Terrorist flatter McVeigh when they attempt to make a coherent ideology out of the hodgepodge that he puts forth .
While endowed with native intelligence , McVeigh holds political notions that are at best banal and confused — a mix of slogans about the Second Amendment ( the right to bear arms ) , a few phrases about the dangers of “ One World Government ” and the “ New World Order , ” racist “ White Power ” prejudices , inchoate populist nostrums , and so on .
The confused ideology reflects the internally contradictory position of the militia and “ Patriot ” movements .
Certain sections of the petty bourgeoisie — from the ranks of small businessmen , middle managers , civil servants , professional employees — particularly in the decaying industrial states , and disoriented , disaffected working class youth like McVeigh , deprived of a relatively secure life in the factory by economic dislocation , come together out of desperation and frustration .
In the final analysis , fascism involves the whipping up of the disoriented petty bourgeoisie against the working class in the interests of big capital .
In essence , fascism is the politics of regression and despair .
McVeigh came to see himself as a “ soldier ” in a crusade , and an inevitable martyr .
He acted in revenge for the Waco massacre and other crimes of the US government , but with little real hope that his act would spark a popular uprising .
He was deeply pessimistic ; indeed , according to the interviews conducted with Michel and Herbeck , he contemplated suicide on a number of occasions .
He suggested that he knew he would be caught and eventually executed , and referred to the bombing as “ state - assisted suicide . ”
Timothy McVeigh is the product of a political and social malaise , bound up with the decay of American capitalist society .
As conditions for masses of people worsened in the late 1980s and early 1990s and a social chasm yawned , the political establishment was shifting sharply to the right , encouraging the growth of ultra - right forces .
The Democratic Party was repudiating its own history of social reformism and any consideration of the needs of working people .
The putrefaction of the trade unions had reached an advanced stage .
This coincided with the more general , international collapse of the traditional labor organizations , which found its highest expression in the demise of the Soviet Union .
Triumphalist reaction encountered a working class betrayed and politically disoriented , and therefore unable to mount any serious resistance .
At the same time these processes were working away at the foundations of American bourgeois democratic institutions .
The semi- fascist organizations with which McVeigh had associations were finding an increasingly sympathetic ear within the extreme right of the Republican Party .
By the time of the Oklahoma City bombing , many state and federal Republican legislators had close ties to militia organizations and other fascistic and racist political outfits .
There is a continuum that extends from these circles to the top echelons of the Republican Party .
It was revealed in December 1998 that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and Congressman Bob Barr — a Clinton impeachment zealot — had addressed gatherings of the Council of Conservative Citizens , the direct organizational successor of the Citizens Councils that organized segregationist forces in the 1950s and 1960s , serving as a more respectable ally of the Ku Klux Klan .
The Democratic Party has adapted itself to this process .
It proved incapable of seriously opposing either the anti-Clinton impeachment drive or the successful effort by the Bush forces to hijack the 2000 presidential election .
There is an urgent need to draw the lessons of the Oklahoma City bombing and McVeigh 's evolution .
There are many signs today that the acute contradictions of American society are beginning to break through the surface of political reaction .
What shape this process takes will very much depend on the political education and preparation of the forces now coming into struggle .
The American working class faces the task of freeing itself from the grip of the Democratic Party and the semi-corpse of liberalism and establishing its political independence .
By placing itself firmly on the basis of a socialist program and demonstrating its determination to break the stranglehold of the financial and corporate elite over society , such a workers movement will appeal to the broadest layers , including many sections of the middle class , opening the way for a new social order based on genuine democracy and equality .

On March 26 , in a town hall meeting - style format , President Obama ginned up a laugh that is still ringing , a week - and - a - half later .
Obama ’s attempt to address the fact that cannabis legalization questions keep pushing their way to the top of his online political issues polling lists , that marijuana legalization had even popped up in the area of economic development .
He looked aside at the crowd , “ I do n’t know what this says about the on - line audience … ”
Wink , wink …and the people around the President cracked up .
“ The answer is no , I do n’t think that is a good strategy to grow our economy , ” Obama chuckled along with them .
Humor is based on tension ; a joke releases it .
Obama ’s pot ha- ha has released a powder keg of tension .
The national commentary on the topic of marijuana driven from his laugh has been far reaching : Time Magazine , The Week , Town Hall , Washington Post , The Atlantic , Salon , Boston Herald , etc …
Mr. President , do know what all your ‘ cannabis friendly ’
Internet polls really say about “ the online audience ” ?
What ?
You do n’t recognize us , “ the online audience ” ?
We ’re the very people that helped get you elected , helped raise all those millions on the Internet–people like my wife and I , both 60 - years old , parents and grandparents , business owners , taxpayers , involved in our community , we are the people who want you to end marijuana prohibition , the worst American public policy since slavery .
The question to you , Mr. President , is this :
After the 20 - million marijuana arrests since 1965 , what ’s so damn funny ???

After five years running primarily on private donations , the Leadership Academy won a city contract last June for up to $ 10 million a year .
Its centerpiece is the Aspiring Principals Program , a 14 - month paid boot camp that has graduated 336 people since 2003 , 227 of whom are now principals  15 percent of the total .
One Leadership Academy alumnus was removed from his post this month , pending Education Department investigations , after a public screaming match with the school ’s parent coordinator ; more than 250 parents had signed a letter citing a “ litany of problems ” including “ increased staff turnover , parent dissatisfaction and general turmoil . ”
Another was removed upon his arrest in February for driving while intoxicated and fleeing the scene of an accident .
The first independent analysis of the academy ’s effectiveness , done at New York University , is due in June .
“ I think our batting average is quite good , ” Mr. Klein said .
“ Could it improve ?
I ’m sure it could improve . ”
Pulling Their Own Strings
Andrew M. L. Turay vividly remembers , back when he was principal of the Bronx ’s mammoth Evander Childs High School in 2001 , the day an assistant principal who had struggled at another school walked into his office and announced she would now be working with him : superintendent ’s orders .
“ You were the figurehead as a principal , but the actual power was in the superintendent ’s office , ” he said .
“ They were pulling the strings . ”
Now , as principal of Peace and Diversity Academy , a small high school in the Bronx that he founded in 2004 , Mr. Turay not only picks his own staff but decides how to train them .
Still cringing over the time he returned to Evander from a required daylong monthly session to find that a student had assaulted a staff member in the cafeteria , Mr. Turay can  and does  choose to skip virtually all meetings outside the office .
Where he oversaw more than 3,000 students at Evander , Mr. Turay now has 315 , and makes it his business to know who was just absent for five days ( the girl with multiple face piercings ) , and who is struggling with sexual identity ( 18 students are openly gay ) .
There is no superintendent regularly visiting ; it is up to Mr. Turay to call his network leader  his primary support person  on her cellphone when he needs help .
Someone sent by the Education Department descends on the school for a few days at least once every three years and then submits a “ quality review ” on its shortcomings and successes , but Mr. Turay is judged , in large part , by a thick stack of documents .

Compliance checklists , on items including vision - testing and fire drills .
School report cards ( he got a B ) .
Parent and teacher surveys .
A review of how well he has met his own goals .
The speculation is over .
Microsoft ’s search engine officially has a new name , Bing .
The name , along with some new features , opens the latest chapter in Microsoft ’s quest to best Google in the search engine wars .
If you ’re expecting Bing to be a Google - killer , reset your expectations .
The most dramatic change , in my view , remains the name itself .
I ca n’t say that Bing is the best of names , but neither is it the worst .
It ’s certainly better than the “ Live Search ” moniker that ’s resonated with few , including even those at Microsoft itself .
The new name , along with $ 80 million in marketing that Microsoft is unleashing , will undoubtedly attract brand new visitors to Microsoft ’s search engine plus get some who had previously given up on Live Search to take another look .
What they ’ll find is a search engine with solid relevancy plus some new features that might hook a few of them into staying .
Below , a drill - down on those new features .
However , I highly recommend that you also read Greg Sterling ’s companion article , Microsoft ’s Bing Vs Google : Head To Head Search Results .
For those interested in a market analysis of how Bing may fare , see my companion article : State Of Search : Google Will Stay Strong Despite Bing & Yahoo
Note that in the screenshots below , you ’ll still see the old “ Live Search ” branding or sometimes the “ Kumo ” brand that was used internally at Microsoft .
While the logos might be different , the functionality is the same as that which will be shown to those using Bing — which is set to launch early next week , first as a “ preview ’ and then formally .
I ’m also focusing on changes to the main search results page .
Bing , like Live Search before it , has a variety of specialized search engines .
It ’s simply too much to cover all of these in a single review — as separate search engines on their own , they deserve more room ( and would also need to be compared to corresponding specialized search engines from Google and others ) .
Also , some of these services have n’t changed dramatically other than in branding , so a deeper look now is n’t as necessary .
Categorized Search & Web Groups
Probably the most significant change is that Bing now organizes search results into categories .
For example , in a search on obama , you can see in the screenshot above how the arrow points to the new categories that are listed at the top left of the page ( in a column that Microsoft calls the Explore Pane , and the tab - like links are called — yes — “ Quick Tabs ” ) :
Images
Biography
Facts
Quotes
Speeches
Issues
Videos
This is Bing telling the searcher that for the general topic of “ obama , ” it has results that relate to his biography , speeches he ’s made , issues he ’s taken and so on .
Not every search brings up these links .
At launch , Microsoft they ’re more likely to appear for queries relating to :
Automobiles ( car models , car manufacturers )
Travel & Local ( countries , cities , states , points of interest like stadiums and parks )
People ( celebrities , athletes , musicians , bands , politicians )
Sports ( NBA , NFL , NHL and MLB teams )
Health ( cancer , diet , over - the - counter and prescription drugs , symptoms , genetic and conditional disease , injury trauma )
Entertainment ( popular television shows , movies )
Retail ( certain electronics such as cameras , cell phones and optics products )
Events ( Oscars , Fourth of July , NASCAR , etc. )
Over time , more queries will also get categorization .
By clicking on the category links , you can drill into more specific results .
More on that , in a moment .
However , anticipating that some searchers might ignore the category options , Bing also automatically lists results from each category into the main results page , into what it calls “ Web Groups . ”
For example , the screenshot above shows how images of Obama are automatically shown , then below that , some general search results about him .
But if you scroll further :
Notice how there ’s a subheading called “ Obama Biography ” followed by some results on that topic , then there ’s another subheading called “ Obama Facts , ” followed by results on that subject .
Scroll further still :
Now you have another subheading called “ Obama Quotes ” with matching results , followed by “ Obama Speeches ” with results on that topic .
In all , you get 20 results rather than the 10 results that have long been the norm for search engines .
I ’d say that ’s a good thing , in that the more results you present , the more chances you ’ll have at surfacing something that will match a searcher ’s interest ( assuming you have good overall relevancy ) .
Most searches do n’t go past the first page of results — so a match should help reinforce a sense of satisfaction .
Then again , Microsoft is taking a chance that people will be interested in the Web Groups it has selected .
To increase the odds of this , the company says these groups are drawn on the topics most queried in relation to a core term .
In other words , many people looking for “ obama ” also then do additional queries to find his biography , or information on his speeches and so on .
Will it work ?
That remains to be seen , of course .
Personally , I find the page fairly busy .
I suspect people either wo n’t notice the various subheadings ( and so miss out on the grouping Microsoft is trying to do ) or find they ’re distracting from the actual listings .
The concept of grouping results also is n’t new .
Long known as clustering , you can see it in operation at Hakia ( see obama there ) or Clusty ( again , see obama there ) .
Microsoft says that it is putting its own unique blend to it , but will that be compelling enough ?
Also keep in mind that even Google has a form of clustering .
Called related search suggestions , it ’s nowhere near as dramatic as what Bing does .
In some cases , if Google thinks someone might be searching for results related to what they initially entered — but not exactly the same — it will insert these into the middle of the page .
For example , consider a search on mini :
Microsoft lists far more categories related to the car , from “ parts ” to “ specs , ” but note also that in the Related Searches section , “ miniclip ” comes up :
They may seem like different things —
Google ’s simply showing you matches for a related search while Microsoft is taking a set of search results and organizing them .
But that ’s not the case .
Actually , each of the “ Web Groups ” themselves on Bing is a related search .
Remember earlier I said that if you clicked on a category link , you could drill - down ?
If you do that for the Biography category of the obama search , you get 10 biography - specific results .
And the first three of those ?
They ’re the ones that get mixed into the “ biography ” section of the main page .
The same is true if you select the Facts category .
In short , if what Microsoft is doing really catches on , I have little doubt that Google could replicate it .
But I ’m not really expecting it will be a major feature that grabs attention .
Certainly it will make Microsoft distinctive from Google — which can be good — but I also think the feature is going to morph in short order .
And that brings me to Related Searches .
Related Searches
In the screenshot above , you can see a list of “ Related Search ” for my original search of memorial day .
Related searches are n’t new to to Microsoft .
Live Search had them — heck , MSN Search before Live Search had them .
All the major search engines have related searches .
I point them out primarily because they ’re confusing to me with the categories , which are also related searches , just under a different name .
Both are ways to refine a search , and I worry that by splitting things up , Microsoft is actually dividing attention away from an important feature — even if it ’s one that relatively few will use .
I followed up with Microsoft about this point , and this is what they sent me :
With categorized search what we ’ve done is take the related searches for individual queries and pop them up a level of abstraction to about classes of entries .
That allows us to offer a consistent set of refinement tools between different queries about the same class of entries .
For example , almost any city query will show “ attractions ” as a refinement in the web groups .
Web Groups are common refinements for a class ( i.e. autos ) and entity within that class ( i.e. Cooper Mini ) that we see people across the web making post their initial query for that class entity ( Auto , Mini Cooper ) .
We use the web groups both to help with one - click refinement BUT also to break up the results on the search engine results page ( SERP ) into these common follow - on refinements .
In other words , if we know many people traditionally search for Problem after Mini , why not display a few of the organic results for “ Mini Problems ” right on the first page of the SERP ( which is what we do with web groups ) .
Clicking on Problems in the TOC [ category listings tab ] does issue an entirely new query where the entire SERP is dedicated to “ Mini Problems ” organic results .
Related Searches , on the other hand , are really more about collaborative filtering and dictionary / synonym technology to understand the most common queries related to that initial term .
Web Groups offer a level of abstraction that help you see the most common results within the most common refinements for a query easily .
How used will related searches be , much less the category tabs ?
Historically , features like these are n’t used much .
Microsoft says its studies find nearly half the queries initially performed get refined at some point in a search session .
But most of that refinement is done by people manually adding new words , rather than using helper features , they confirmed for me .
Still , perhaps the unique tabs will catch on more .
Search History
Further below on the left side of the search page is a new Search History area .
Way , way back in Microsoft ’s early days , they had a feature somewhat like this .
It ’s nice to see it come back .
Search History activates even if you ’re not logged in , keeping track of your queries for up to 48 hours , as long as you ’re using the same browser .
If you manually clear your history , which is easy to do — or clear your browser ’s cookies — then the history is gone .
Want to store things longer ?
If you have a Windows Live account , you can make use of Windows SkyDrive folders and access your history from any computer .
Want to save to your computer ?
If you ’ve got Silverlight , then you can save to your “ My Search Folders . ”
No Silverlight , no luck .
While search history is nice to have , it ’s incredibly rudimentary compared to the more mature search history system that Google operates — and importantly , also uses to help refine results based on a user ’s interests .
But Microsoft says improvements will continue here .
The also sent me as a follow - up on this aspect :
While the feature does n’t have every aspect that Google ’s History feature does , it does make the history feature more usable by most people by virtue of not requiring a sign - in and placing it on the main search results page by default .
Best Match
For some queries , a single “ Best Match ” results may appear , such as for UPS , as the screenshot shows above .
These are designed to show the very best site in cases where Microsoft is super confident you only need a single link .
It also provides things like the ability to search a particular company ’s web site below its link , along with links to key areas of its site and customer service numbers .
I like the simplicity of this and look forward to continuing to test how well it works .
In other cases , a Best Match result will appear above other search results , rather than these being hidden .
This is in cases where Microsoft is pretty confident is knows what most people want but also wants to cover the few looking for something different .
A search for “ target ” or “ apple ” brings up examples of this .
Quick Previews
Keep your thumbnail images , Bing ’s trying something different .
Hover next to the right of any listing , and you ’ll see a short excerpt from the page , text that Microsoft thinks is additionally relevant beyond the standard description that showing .
It ’s a nice feature that hopefully will get used , though it ’s easy to miss .
It can allow you to better decide if you want to click through and save some time .
Instant Answers
While some of these are n’t new , “ instant answers ” or “ direct answers ” is an area I think Microsoft is particularly strong .
Getting the actual results to the Oscars or the Kentucky Derby at the top of the page ?
That ’s great relevancy , even if there are human editors involved .
Beyond that are some standard things like entering a flight number to get airline tracking information or movies followed by a ZIP code for local listings .
Google and Yahoo also offer similar features , so where Microsoft shines is places where it goes beyond — such as the ability to get a ski report .
Other Things
There ’s much more in the new release .
I ’ll highlight a few things that particularly resonate with me , and we might focus on these features more in the future :
Infinite scroll of images .
Do an image search , and just keep scrolling and scrolling through the results .
More keep coming up without you having to hit Next .
I ’ve long loved this feature at Microsoft .

Finally , a reminder of the companion pieces to this story :
Similar to Greg Sterling in his head - to - head piece , I ’ve been fighting my Google Habit for the past week and deliberately running searches on Bing to compare to Google .
The relevancy has been solid .
Sometimes

An appeals court decided to back consumers on Tuesday , unanimously upholding a Federal Communications Commission order banning exclusive cable video contracts in apartment buildings and other multiple dwelling units ( MDUs ) .
The agency acted well within the bounds of the law , ruled the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit .
The court even smiled on applying the new regulations to current cable / realtor deals , noting that the FCC " balanced benefits against harms and expressly determined that applying the rule to existing contracts was worth its costs . "
The call is also a victory for telcos like AT&T and Verizon , both of which pushed hard for the FCC to make its decision .
Changing course
The Commission moved on this issue on the last day of October in 2007 , invoking Section 628 of the Communications Act , which prohibits cable companies from pursuing deals that have " the purpose or effect of hindering significantly or preventing their competitors from providing satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to subscribers or consumers . "
That decision reversed a 2003 call on the question which decided that the trade - offs between the " pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects " of exclusive contracts were too close to call .
By 2007 , however , the agency had reached a new consensus on the matter , its order noting that by then , thirty percent of Americans lived in MDUs , many of them minorities .
Restricting an apartment building 's access to one cable provider foreclosed the expansion of fiber and " triple play " ( phone , video , Internet ) services in many areas , the Commission observed .
" Exclusivity clauses deny MDU residents the benefits of increased competition , including lower prices and the availability of more channels with more diverse content . "
Two days earlier , then FCC Chair Kevin Martin had tipped reporters that the agency would take this step .
" Should Martin & Co. actually strike down existing contracts , expect speedy litigation from the cable operators , " Ars ' Nate Anderson predicted at the time .
And sure enough , they did , suing the FCC in appellate court .
The National Cable and Telecommunications Association and several real estate groups offered two very technical arguments against the Commission 's decision .
Abuse of market power
First , the plaintiffs contended that when Congress wrote Section 628 , they were not worried about barriers to expanded service choice , but with practices that prevented consumers from getting certain kinds of programming .
The legal arena of conflict on lawmakers ' minds was the endless battle between content providers and cable companies , NCTA et al contended , not roadblocks to service in general .
The DC Court rejected this argument in a few pages , noting that nothing in the literal text of Section 628 prevented the FCC from making its ruling .
And although NCTA pointed to " considerable evidence that Congress was specifically concerned with unfair dealing over programming , " the judges explained , " they offer no evidence from the legislative record to show that Congress chose its language so as to limit the Commission solely to that particular abuse of market power . "
Second , the NCTA lawsuit invoked an old standby — that the FCC had not properly explained why it had changed its position on exclusive MDU contracts , thus running afoul of the Administrative Procedures
Act 's prohibition against " arbitrary and capricious " decision making among government agencies .
But the DC Circuit noted that the FCC had not changed its policy on exclusive contracts in 2003 in large part because of insufficient data on the question .
The Commission 's perspective on this issue was clearly in flux .
And , in an interesting tangent , the judges bowed to the Supreme Court 's recent reversal of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals strikedown of the FCC 's fine against CBS for the famous Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction of 2004 .
The Third Circuit had agreed with CBS that the Commission 's new regulations against " fleeting images " were arbitrary and capricious .
Not so , declared the Supremes .
The agency " need not demonstrate to a court ’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one , " the high court ruled ; " it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute , that there are good reasons for it , and that the agency believes it to be better . "
( The judges added italics here . )
The DC Circuit cited this sentence in upholding the FCC 's order against exclusive MDU deals .
Assuming this case does n't go any further up the judicial ladder , the Commission 's ban on exclusive apartment contracts for cable service is now a done deal .
But it does n't affect all MDU - like dwellings , among them " time share units , academic campuses and dormitories , military bases , hotels , rooming houses , jails , prisons , halfway houses , hospitals , nursing and other assisted living places , and other group quarters characterized by institutional living , high transience and , in some cases , a high need for security , " the order noted .
So if you are reading this story in a maximum security lock down , you 'll still have to take whatever video service they give you .
About four months after its decision on MDUs , the agency extended the exclusivity ban to ISPs as well .
" There is no reason that consumers living in apartment buildings should be locked into one service provider , " the FCC's Martin declared shortly after the move .
" Competition is ultimately the best protector of the consumer 's interest . "

The last survivor of the sinking of the Titanic has died aged 97 .
Millvina Dean was nine weeks old when the liner sank after hitting an iceberg in the early hours of 15 April 1912 , on its maiden voyage from Southampton .
The disaster resulted in the deaths of 1,517 people in the north Atlantic , largely due to a lack of lifeboats .
Miss Dean , who remembered nothing of the fateful journey , died on Sunday at the care home in Hampshire where she lived , two of her friends told the BBC .
Her family had been travelling in third class to America , where they hoped to start a new life and open a tobacconist 's shop in Kansas City .
Miss Dean 's mother , Georgetta , and two - year - old brother , Bert , also survived , but her father , Bertram , was among those who perished when the vessel sank .
If it had n't been for the ship going down , I 'd be an American
Millvina Dean
The last Titanic survivor
The family returned to Southampton , where Miss Dean went on to spend most of her life .
Despite having no memories of the disaster , she always said it had shaped her life , because she should have grown up in the US instead of returning to the UK .
She was fond of saying : " If it had n't been for the ship going down , I 'd be an American . "
In 1985 the site of the wreck was discovered and , in her 70s , she found herself unexpectedly in demand on both sides of the Atlantic .
" I think sometimes they look on me as if I am the Titanic ! " she said after a visit to a Titanic convention in America .
" Honestly , some of them are quite weird about it . "
Unimpressed
But she never tired of telling her story .
" Oh not at all .
I like it , because everyone makes such a fuss of me !
And I have travelled to so many places because of it , meeting all the people .
Oh I would n't get tired of it .
I 'm not the type . "
Millvina Dean in her mother 's arms a few weeks after the disaster
But she was unimpressed when divers started to explore the wreck , located 3,000 m below the surface of the Atlantic , saying : " I do n't believe in people going to see it .
I think it 's morbid .
I think it 's horrible . "
According to BBC South transport correspondent Paul Clifton , she refused to watch James Cameron 's epic film of the disaster , starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo diCaprio , fearing it would be too upsetting .
But in the last years of her life , she began struggling with monthly bills of £ 3,000 at her care home and had been in danger of losing her room .
She began selling some of her Titanic - related mementoes to raise funds , and in April a canvas bag from her rescue was sold at auction for £ 1,500 .
It was bought by a man from London who immediately returned it to her .
Actors Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio , who appeared in the 1998 movie Titanic , also contributed towards her care costs , along with the film 's director James Cameron , by donating to the Millvina Fund which was set up by her friends .
TITANIC IN NUMBERS 882ft by 92ft , 46,328 tonnes - largest vessel afloat at time 2,223 passengers and crew left Southampton on 10 April 1912 Struck iceberg , sank in two hrs 40 mins at 0220 GMT on 15 April 1,517 killed , 706 survived Total lifeboat capacity : 1,178 but ship could carry up to 3,547 Survival rates by ticket class - first : 60 % , second : 44 % , third : 25 % , crew : 24 % John White , managing director of exhibition company White Star Memories , and organiser of the Millvina Fund campaign said Miss Dean was always " very supportive " .
She travelled to exhibitions around the country and took the time to sign autographs and write personal messages for adults and children .
" She was a lovely supportive lady and very kind - hearted , " Mr White told BBC News website .
International Titanic Society President Charles Haas , from Randolph , New Jersey , met Miss Dean on numerous occasions and described her as an " effervescent person with a wonderful sense of humour " .
" It is truly the end of an era , " he said .
" She was a truly remarkable woman .
She had a marvellous approach to life .
It is almost as if God gave her the gift and she really took advantage of it . "
David Lawrence , from the Nomadic Preservation Society , was a friend of Miss Dean and said he was " very sad " to hear the news .
" She was very sharp - minded and very sprightly .
One of those people who could make a whole room laugh with a story , " he said .
Youngest passenger Built in Belfast , the White Star Line vessel became infamous for not having enough lifeboats onboard , leading to the deaths of many passengers .
Elizabeth Gladys Dean , better known as Millvina , was the Titanic 's youngest passenger , born on 2 February 1912 .
Another baby on board , Barbara Joyce West , was nearly 11 months old when the liner sank .
She also survived .
Barbara Joyce Dainton , as she became when she married , died in October 2007 , leaving Miss Dean the last Titanic survivor .

A company can have many employees .
Yet in law and in grammar it is a single entity .
You should always use singular verbs with companies , even when the company name sounds plural .
The same applies to countries , political parties , governments and partnerships .
All are singular .
Some people think using they instead of it makes writing more personal .
It can do .
But that ’s not the point .
Marketing departments like to describe companies as plural because they think that gives readers a point of connection .
It makes us think we are dealing with human beings .
That may be true .
Even if the company in question are a bunch of great people who really are fun to do business with , that ’s not the point .
It ’s still a singular legal and grammatical entity .
And anyway , we all know companies are staffed by humans .
Singular adds clarity
The problem here is that incorrect grammar makes your writing and , more important , your meaning , unclear .
There is another reason .
If you read a company described as plural in print on a website , that ’s a clear sign that the writer , editor or publisher is second - rate .
Those of us who have worked for a long time in written communications know the writer or maybe whoever employed that writer , is unprofessional or , if that sounds too harsh , sloppy .
Most readers may not spot this as an error on a conscious level .
Yet they know what professional writing looks like and many will subconsciously recognise the words in front of them are not professional , even if they ca n’t articulate why .
They may have an inkling there is something wrong here .
When that happens they will be wary of what they read .
Consciously or subconsciously they ’ll think that if the writer does n’t know enough to get simple grammar correct , it ’s unlikely they did a professional job of fact - checking .
When you write they do you mean the company or all the people who work for the company ?
If you mean the employees , then make this clear .
There ’s nothing wrong with talking about , say , the staff at my local café .
Resist all temptation to treat companies as plurals .
That goes for countries , political parties , governments and other organisations .

From the Free Range Kids blog , the story of Lori from a small town in Mississippi , who sent her 10 - year - old on foot to soccer practice , only to have him picked up by the cops , who reported " hundreds " of 911 calls by curtain - twitchers who were horrified at the thought of a 10 - year - old walking a third of a mile to a local school .
The cops told her she could be charged with child endangerment !
After she complained to the cops , the local police chief called her to apologize and to reassure her that she lived in a safe neighborhood .
The moral of the story : stand your ground when crazy people tell you that your kid needs to be swaddled in bubblewrap until she 's 22 .
My 10 - year - old son wanted the chance to walk from our house to soccer practice behind an elementary school about 1/3 mile from our house .
He had walked in our neighborhood a number of times with the family and we have driven the route to practice who knows how many times .
It was broad daylight – 5:00 pm .
I had to be at the field myself 15 minutes after practice started , so I gave him my cell phone and told him I would be there to check that he made it and sent him off .
He got 3 blocks and a police car intercepted him .
The police came to my house – after I had left – and spoke with my younger children ( who were home with Grandma ) .
They then found me at the soccer field and proceeded to tell me how I could be charged with child endangerment .
They said they had gotten " hundreds " of calls to 911 about him walking .
Now , I know bad things can happen and I was n't flippant about letting him go and not checking up , but come on .
I live in a small town in Mississippi .
To be perfectly honest , I 'm much more concerned about letting him attend a birthday party sleepover next Friday , but I 'm guessing the police would n't be at my house if I chose to let him go ( which I probably wo n't ) .

KATHMANDU ( Reuters ) - Nepal ’s Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda resigned on Monday after a crisis sparked by his sacking of the country ’s army chief , plunging the Himalayan republic into political turmoil .
Army chief General Rookmangud Katawal ( L ) talks with his generals during an event to mark Loktantra Diwas ( Democracy Day ) in Kathmandu in this file photo April 24 , 2009 .
Nepal 's President Ram Baran Yadav has asked Katawal , who was sacked May 3 , 2009 , to stay in his post , a spokesman said on Monday , defying the Maoist government and thrusting the Himalayan republic deeper into political crisis .
Picture taken April 24 , 2009 .

The 8 - month - old Maoist - led government fired General Rookmangud Katawal on Sunday , accusing him of disobeying instructions not to hire new recruits and refusing to accept the supremacy of the civilian government .
But President Ram Baran Yadav , who hails from an opposition party and is commander - in - chief of the army , called the move unconstitutional .
“ I have resigned from the cabinet , ” Prachanda said in a televised address to the nation .
“ We made enough efforts to forge a consensus but various forces were active against this and were encouraging the president to take the unconstitutional and undemocratic step ( of keeping Katawal in office ) , ” he said .
The crisis is a huge blow to a 2006 peace pact that ended a decade - long civil war that pitted the army against the Maoists .
The peace agreement ushered the Maoists into the political mainstream and they won an election last year .
Hundreds of riot police in full battle gear guarded major road intersections across the Nepali capital on Monday but there was no obvious sign of unrest or street protests .
Maoist leaders said they would launch street protests against what they said was a power grab by the president .
Analysts said a new election was unlikely .
Nepal ’s other parties appeared to be readying for a new government , with or without the Maoists .
The main opposition party , the Nepali Congress , and moderate communist party the UML said they could both try to form a new government .
“ We want a government of national consensus , ” said Prakash Sharan Mahat , a Nepali Congress leader .
IMMENSE CHALLENGES
Some experts said Prachanda had pre-empted the inevitable end of his government by resigning .
Two government parliamentary allies withdrew from the ruling coalition to protest against the army chief ’s dismissal , leaving the Maoists with a thin majority and possibly leading to a confidence vote in the government .
“ He has resigned because the government was headed to become a minority , ” said Lok Raj Baral , head of the Nepal Center for Strategic Studies think tank .
“ Now the other political parties will be busy to form an alternative government .
But it is too early to say anything definitive now . ”
The challenges are immense .
The Maoists came to power with huge expectations from voters won over by their promises of a “ new Nepal ” in one of the world ’s poorest countries .

But a crippling shortage of electricity and the highest inflation in a decade have hampered economic growth , forcing industries to cut production by about 60 percent .
The resignation is an about - turn for Prachanda , who scored a surprise win in a special assembly election last year but did not get a parliamentary majority .
The assembly abolished Nepal ’s 239 - year - old monarchy and declared the nation a republic .
Prachanda led an insurgency against the monarchy in the jungles around the Himalayan foothills .
Once he came out of the jungle , Prachanda transformed himself from a revolutionary insurgent into a wily politician , insisting that Maoists are not “ dogmatic communists ” and that globalization and free markets were facts of life .
Now any new government might face strong Maoist opposition .
“ Any new government will be shackled by internal divisions and a lack of strategy to take the political process forward , ” said Rhoderick Chalmers , Nepal head of the Brussels - based think - tank International Crisis Group .
“ The Maoists have said they are still committed to the democratic process .
But what we expect is that Maoists are going to use various tactics , including street protests , to bring pressure on the government . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court said on Monday that it would decide the constitutionality of giving juveniles who commit crimes other than murder a sentence of life in prison without the chance of release .

The nation ’s high court agreed to hear two Florida cases , one involving a 13 - year - old convicted of raping an elderly woman and the other involving a 17 - year - old who took part in an armed home - invasion robbery while on probation for an earlier violent crime .
Their lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court and argued that life imprisonment , without the possibility of parole , for juveniles whose crimes did not involve murder violated the Constitution ’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
The Supreme Court in 2005 abolished the death penalty for juveniles .
The justices will consider in the two cases whether to extend that ruling to sentences of life without parole for juveniles convicted of crimes other than murder .
The justices are expected to hear and then decide the two cases during their upcoming term that begins in October .
In one case , Joe Sullivan , now 33 , was convicted of burglary and rape of a 72 - year - old woman in Pensacola , Florida , a crime he committed in 1989 at age 13 .
According to his supporters , Sullivan is only one of two people in the United States to be serving a life sentence without possible parole for a crime other than murder committed at age 13 .
The other inmate , also in Florida , was convicted for a 1990 robbery and attempted murder .
Sullivan ’s attorneys argued that the extremely rare imposition of a life - without - parole sentence for a 13 - year - old for a crime other than murder reflected “ a national consensus on the reduced criminal culpability of children . ”
The other case involved Terrance Graham , who was 17 when he was arrested for a 2004 home - invasion robbery .
He had pleaded guilty the previous year to burglary and attempted armed robbery and was on probation .

RIYADH ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia may ban marriage for girls below 18 , a government minister said after a case of an eight - year old girl marrying a man more than 40 years her senior drew international criticism and embarrassed the kingdom .
“ Among the options that are available and excluding the issue of puberty , is to ban marriage for ( people ) under 18 , ” Justice Minister Mohammed al - Eissa told Asharq al - Awsat newspaper .
He was responding to a question about his ministry ’s plan to deal with the marriage of young girls .
“ A girl below 18 is often not fit to take the family responsibility especially if she quickly gives birth ( after marriage ) , ” he said .
Saudi Arabia is a patriarchal society that applies an ascetic form of Sunni Islam which bans unrelated men and women from mixing and gives fathers the right to wed their sons and daughters to whomever they deem fit .
Many Saudi clerics , including the kingdom ’s chief cleric Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul - Aziz Al al - Sheikh , endorse the practice of marrying underage girls , arguing that in doing so they avoid spinsterhood or the temptation of engaging in relationships outside the wedlock .
A 50 - year old man in the small Saudi town of Onaiza agreed this week to divorce his eight year - old bride .
Financial considerations could prompt some Saudi families to wed their underage daughters to much older men .
Many young girls in Arab countries that observe tribal traditions are married to older husbands but not before puberty .
Such marriages are also driven by poverty in countries like Yemen , one of the poorest countries outside Africa .
Is there any hard evidence of laboratory origins ?
Why we should n't dismiss the conspiracy theories outright
Vaccinated doctors dead in days
Another reason to avoid vaccines
( NaturalNews ) Perhaps due to the genetic makeup of the fast - spreading H1N1 strain of influenza -- which includes genetic elements from bird flu , swine flu and human flu spanning three continents -- there is considerable speculation that the origins of this virus are man-made .
It 's not an unreasonable question to ask : Could world governments , spooked by the prospect of radical climate change caused by over - population of the planet , have assembled a super - secret task force to engineer and distribute a super virulent strain of influenza designed to " correct " the human population ( and institute global Martial Law ) ?
Technically , it 's possible .
The U.S. military , all by itself , has the know - how to engineer and unleash such a virus .
That does n't mean they 've done so , however .
It would be an astonishing leap intoto intentionally unleash such a biological weapon into the wild .
Then again , governments of the world have routinely engaged in crimes against humanity , have n't they ?
The U.S. , for example , dropped nuclear bombs on civilian populations in Japan .
Israel rained white phosphorous on Palestinians , Hitler exterminated countless Jews , and Americans fired millions of rounds of depleted uranium rounds into targets in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Unleashing a viral biological weapon in Mexico City is no great leap beyond what governments have already done to achieve their goals .
Throughout human history , virtually -- mostly in the name of peace , prosperity and security , by the way .
So let 's be clear about one thing : Governments are certainlyof doing this if properly motivated .
Let there be no question about that .
As of this moment , I have not personally seen any conclusive evidence of laboratory origins for this H1N1 swine flu .
I am open to the possibility that new evidence may emerge in this direction , however , and I am suspicious of the genetic makeup of the virus as one possible indicator of its origins .
I am not a medical specialist in the area of infectious disease , but I have studied microbiology , genetics and a considerable amount of material on pandemics .
What seems suspicious to me is the hybrid origin of the viral fragments found in H1N1 influenza .
According to reports in the mainstream media ( which has no reason to lie about this particular detail ) , this strain of influenza contains viral code fragments from : • Human influenza• Bird Flu from North America•
Swine flu from Europe• Swine flu from AsiaThis is rather astonishing to realize , because for this to have been a natural combination of viral fragments , it means an infected bird from North America would have had to infect pigs in Europe , then be re-infected by those some pigs with an unlikely cross-species mutation that allowed the bird to carry it again , then that bird would have had to fly to Asia and infected pigs there , and those Asian pigs then mutated the virus once again ( while preserving the European swine and bird flu elements ) to become human transmittable , and then a human would have had to catch that virus from the Asian pigs -- in Mexico ! -- and spread it to others .
( This is n't the only explanation of how it could have happened , but it is one scenario that gives you an idea of the complexity of such a thing happening ) .
Now , on a common sense level , what is the likelihood of such a combination of seemingly unlikely , trans - continental events taking place ?
At first glance , without the benefit of additional laboratory analysis , It 's not outside the realm of possibility , of course , but it seems exceedingly remote that such events happened without some human encouragement .
This is perhaps why the internet is smoking hot with talk of swine flu conspiracy theories .
Alex Jones is , of course , covering the issue in articles like this one : http://www.infowars.com/medical-director-swi...
If the release of the virus was intentional , there are essentially two explanations for who might be behind it : 1 ) Governments attempting to reduce the human population , 2 ) Bio-terrorists attempting to kill lots of people .
Or perhaps 3 ) Those two groups are one and the same !
Many of the points made in conspiracy articles are well made , in fact :
There is both a motive and a means for governments of the world to have played a role in the creation and transmission of this virus .
Still , it does n't mean they did , and NaturalNews will be cautious in reporting such conclusions until more evidence emerges .
There 's no question about one aspect of the circulating conspiracy theories , however :
If governments wanted to infect people with this bio- engineered swine flu , .
It seems interesting that Mexico City health officials , in particular , leaped to a mass vaccination campaign in the midst of the swine flu outbreakSo what , exactly , were Mexico City 's health officials injecting into health care workers and patients ?
There 's absolutely nothing they could have been injected with that would make any medical sense other than Tamiflu .
But Tamiflu is an oral medication , not an injection .
So what , then , was being injected into Mexico City 's hospital workers ?
What 's very clear here is that .
The potential from economic damage caused by other nations banning travel and imports from Mexico is very real , and as a strategy to minimize that economic damage , Mexico seems to bewhile engaging in elaborate theater whose only purpose is to make its own medical authorities appear to be doing something useful .
Hence the useless vaccines stunt .
This is further supported by medical personnel whose comments appeared on the Barbara Walter show , published with ABC News Australia ( http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2008/s25531... ) .
Read carefully what these medical experts have to say about the real situation on the ground in Mexico City : Did you catch what was said here ?
As Dr. Yeny Gregoria Davila posted on the BBC website , vaccines were given to theand those very same medical personnel were dead within six days .
Thus , the vaccine is certainly not protecting these people from infection .
According to the conspiracy theories , these vaccines may indeed beof the virus .
Injecting front - line medical personnel with the virus is the fastest way to spread it even further because medical workers interact with large numbers of immune - compromised people on a daily basis , including many people who tend to travel from far away to visit the hospital and then return to their distant towns , burros or villages in Mexico .
Furthermore , the true number of people infected or killed by the virus is being vastly underreported , according to these doctors .
It 's just like China 's handling of SARS :
The country was hesitant to admit the disease existed at all in order to avoid international embarrassment over its lackluster health policies .
As the WHO knows quite well , nations are universally reluctant to tell the truth about infectious disease .
There 's even a good reason why : Big Pharma usually attempts to acquire the virus early on , patent its particular genetic code , then manufacture expensive vaccines that it sells back to the stricken nation at a ridiculously - high price .
This is how Big Pharma profits from a pandemic , turning human suffering into corporate profits .
Thus , because WHO routinely shares viral specimens with pharmaceutical companies .
This is just one factor in a long list of factors that compel nations to lie about infectious disease outbreaks .
Even when it comes to pandemic outbreaks , we are still dealing with layer upon layer of commercially - motivated deception on the part of nations .
That 's why it 's so important to figure out how to " read between the lies " of the mainstream media .
I teach some techniques for doing that in my upcomingwhich you can read about here : http://www.truthpublishing.com/Swine_Flu_the...
This teleconference also reveals secret Chinese Medicine formulas for expelling viruses , how to survive disruptions in basic infrastructure ( which are likely to occur if this swine flu goes pandemic ) , why flu masks are utterly useless at protecting you from flu , and many other topics .
Click the link above to read more about this teleconference .
Let 's suppose for a minute that the conspiracy theory angle on this swine flu infection is correct .
If the spread of the virus starts to wane , the best way for health authorities to unleash a second wave of infections is towith vaccines that are intentionally contaminated with live H1N1 viruses .
Does that sound far - fetched ?
Consider the news item published here on NaturalNews just one month ago , entitled https://www.naturalnews.com/025760.html ) .
As that article explained , one pharmaceutical company was caught inserting LIVE bird flu viruses into vaccine materials sent to 18 countries .
Was this a trial run for the H1N1 global infection effort ?
It certainly raises suspicions .
When a new virus seemingly " engineered " from three different species suddenly appears in multiple nations -- just one month after a drug company was busted inserting live bird flu viral fragments into globally - distributed vaccine materials -- it should raise the eyebrows of even the most steadfast skeptics .
It does n't prove anything , of course , but it does raise suspicions that this sort of thing could be happening beyond closed doors .
The question to ask yourself on this is the usual one :
Once you answer that question , you 're well on the way to determining the truth or falsehood behind the H1N1 conspiracy theories .
I 'm not even going to answer that question for you .
I 'll let you ponder the answer yourself .
Once you answer the question of who benefits from a pandemic , ask yourself this second question :
Are they capable of harming or killing humans to accomplish their goals ?
Answer that question and you 've figured out most of the true story behind these events .
NaturalNews will continue to cover this H1N1 swine flu outbreak in greatly detail .

This particular “ church ” was pro-abortion .
There was once a minister in town that would baptize the aborted babies , if the mother made such a request .
Again , ever element of our lives here has been corrupted by George Tiller .
This is what happens when the United States Supreme Court , the legal system , and our elected officials , and even some religious institutions , have all been corrupted to the point that a man can profit so much from killing babies .

I. What is Online Reputation Management ?
When customers perform a search for your company , what do they see in the first page of the search engine results ?
Chances are , if you ’ve been around for a while , a Google search will include websites with negative comments , reviews or blogs .
The Most Effective Way to Boost Your Online Reputation
The most effective Online Reputation Management strategy is to get positive websites about your company to rank high , which pushes everyone else down in the rankings -- ideally out of the top 20 search engine results .
Easier said than done , of course .
But this strategy has three distinct advantages :
1 ) You do n’t have to confront the owners of the negative sites , who may or may not be cooperative in removing the comments or forum posts .
2 ) You are in control of your efforts to rank the positive sites , and are no longer at the whims of complainers , critics , or disapproving reviewers who post their opinions online .
3 ) It ’s completely fair .
You ’re not forcing anyone to change their content , whether through begging , arm - twisting or legal threats .
You ’re simply helping those who search on you to see the good side of your company .
Imagine the effect on your Online Reputation Management vs. Traditional Public Relations How does Online Reputation Management fit into your overall PR strategy ?
In short , it ’s part of PR , and a very crucial one in today ’s online world .
Much of public relations concerns managing your reputation , whether it ’s publicizing good news about your company or responding to criticism .
No doubt you ’d prefer that the public only heard positive comments and was not exposed to anything critical about you .
That ’s what we aim for with Online Reputation Management , only we focus on what people see about you when performing an online search .
And since that ’s the way more and more potential customers , sales people , and journalists learn about you these days , managing your image on the search engine results pages becomes a very important part of PR .
The Bottom Line Negative websites , articles , forum posts and other comments are hurting your brand and costing your company money in terms of lost sales and revenue .
You can either let your reputation and sales suffer , or you can manage your online reputation just as you manage everything else in your company -- taking steps to get the results you want and keep your company on track for success .
Online Reputation Management is the key to making that happen .

3 ) It ’s completely fair .
You ’re not forcing anyone to change their content , whether through begging , arm - twisting or legal threats .
You ’re simply helping those who search on you to see the good side of your company .
Imagine the effect on your online reputation when an online search produces a page full of websites containing only positive reviews , complimentary articles and glowing testimonials .
You ’ll project a much better image to everyone who finds you through Google .
The way to make sure the positive sites rank higher with the search engines is to perform search engine optimization ( SEO ) .
Today , Search Engine Optimization is a combination of including relevant content on your web pages and getting other websites to link to those pages .
You see , Google and other search engines gauge the relevance of a web page based on how many other websites link to it .
The more “ backlinks ” you have to your website , the more likely it is that your website deserves to be ranked higher .
So far , so good .
But we still need to push all those negative sites out of the higher rankings , which means we need other sites to take their places .
To accomplish this , we find or create websites that contain positive or neutral information about your company and perform SEO to get them to rank higher .
And once the top ten spots of a search are wiped clean of any negative sites , we go to work on the next ten spots .
The goal is to eventually give you two search results pages of positive sites .
This is a necessary cushion , because a negative site ’s ranking could move up or down by a few spots over time .
By “ owning ” the first two pages , you make it more likely that a negative site ca n’t suddenly pop up on Page 1 of a search .

How a Few Complaints Can Hurt Your Online Reputation
Nearly every business is going to have an unhappy customer from time to time .
Often , it ’s a complaint that ’s easily fixed with a quick refund , a replacement item , or better customer service .
Still , you ca n’t please everyone .
And nowadays it ’s too easy for a dissatisfied person -- or a competitor -- to post complaints and accuse your company of being a scam or worse .
Trouble is , for every ten thousand happy customers who do n’t post positive comments about you , there ’s one unhappy customer who posts negative comments .
So when your potential customers do an online search , all they may see will be those negative postings .
It only takes a few complaints to start showing up on the search engine results pages for your online reputation to suffer .
Now , would n’t it be great if every happy customer posted a postive comment or compliment about you online ?
Sure .
And that will happen when pigs fly , hell freezes over , and we all live together in peace and harmony .
In other words , do n’t hold your breath .
Satisfied customers have no need or little incentive to spend time posting good reviews or comments about you .
And you may feel it ’s beneath your dignity to actually suggest they do this .
But it often does n’t hurt to ask , and your loyal customers may be happy to spend the time online recounting their pleasant experiences with your company .
Try to identify those customers who have nothing to complain about and who have been with you a while .
Then politely suggest that , if they are happy with your products or services , they go to such - and - such website or forum and mention their positive experience with you .
The more you can do this , the better your online reputation will be .
If you do n’t feel comfortable doing this , I understand .
It ’s not easy asking for compliments outright .
This is why I make sure good reviews get posted about my clients , which is a key strategy in reputation management .
We just do n’t want to let those few complainers overshadow all the good things about your company .
III .
Online Reputation Management for Businesses
Here ’s something that comes up in executive meetings all the time : “ Why are people saying bad things about us on the Internet , and what can we do about it ? ”
This can be especially troubling to the CEO who founded the company and who has spent long years working hard to build the brand .
He wakes up one day and finds defamatory remarks online about his company — not constructive criticism , but outrageous accusations and almost slanderous comments .
Worse , the negative reviews are on websites that rank high on search engine results pages , so that anyone doing a search on the company will see them .
And it ’s not just one negative review website , but several , causing the company ’s online reputation to suffer .
As an executive , you need to be aware of your online reputation and know that you can take steps to manage it .
You should n’t just leave it up to fate , or simply hope that people wo n’t post negative comments about your company .
Your online reputation can have a dramatic effect on not only your brand perception , but also your company ’s revenues .
A couple of years ago I met with a company that had a severe online reputation problem .
When potential customers searched their company name , seven out of the top 10 Google rankings were negative .
After a careful review of their rankings , and prior - year revenues , I determined that they were probably losing more than $ 1.5 million a year in sales due to negative search engine results .
The company confirmed the fact that my estimates were indeed accurate — but low .
All companies face a unique challenge in protecting their online reputation .
And because your success or failure depends on how potential customers perceive you , I want to cover the basics of managing and improving your online reputation .
1 ) What we mean by “ online reputation ”
Your online reputation is determined by the top Google rankings a prospect sees when they do a search on your company name .
A prospect can quickly glance down the page of results and look for anything of interest that pops out at them .
If a lot of those websites have negative reviews and complaints about your company , it will automatically diminish your reputation in their eyes .
But if they see a list of websites with positive comments and testimonials , they ’re more likely to sign up without further hesitation .
Because most people rarely look past the first page or two of search engine results , your online reputation is determined by the top 10 or 20 search results .
2 ) Where negative postings come from Some websites specialize in letting anyone post a complaint .
That makes it extremely easy for a dissatisfied customer to go online and share his or her experience with the world .
And the complaint will still appear years later , even if it was a customer service issue that was quickly handled .
Websites like scam.com , ripoffreport.com and complaintsboard.com will pretty much accept postings from anyone .
However , they rarely check for accuracy and are not likely to remove a posting if you request it .
These websites also tend to rank high in the search engines , so if your company is named in a complaint on one of these websites , expect it to show up on a search about you .
3 ) How a few complaints can hurt your online reputation
You might think that if you have thousands of happy customers and distributors , a few online complaints should n’t matter .
But the math does n’t work out that way .
Consider that a Google search returns 10 results on the first page .
If just three of those are websites with complaints or criticisms , it means nearly a third of the search results are for negative websites .
They may still be in the minority , but when a curious prospect sees a link that promises to reveal the “ dirt ” on a company , it ’s hard to resist clicking through .
After all , is n’t that what you ’d do ?
Even one review on a website like scam.com can have an impact if it shows up near the top of the page .
Sometimes a single complaint , valid or not , is enough to scare away a prospect .
I know this sounds dire , but basic human psychology is at work here .
All it takes is one negative review to give them a reason to say no to the opportunity .
4 ) What it takes to have a good online reputation Fortunately , there are steps you can take to manage your online reputation so you are not at the mercy of your company ’s critics .
Start out right by following these three steps : Step No. 1 : Accept the fact of online reviews .
Short of outright slander or libel by the reviewers online , you really do n’t have much legal recourse to make the negative postings go away .
People have a right to complain , and these days it ’s all too easy for unhappy customers to vent their frustrations and share their opinions with the whole world .
When you see a negative review about your company the instinctive reaction is to post a response to set the record straight .
I understand the human need to respond , but you have to consider Google ’s point of view .
Here ’s why .
Search engines rank various websites high for a few reasons , one of which is relevant content , especially when that content is updated on a regular basis .
When you post a comment on a website , you are in effect giving it new content .
And if you get into a back - and - forth discussion with someone on a review website about your company , Google thinks “ Ah , there ’s a lot about this company here , so we ’ll rank this website high for searches on their company name . ”
Now when someone does a search on your company , they are even more likely to see the negative review .
You want to avoid that .
In fact , you want the websites with negative comments to slip further down the Google rankings so they do n’t appear on the first page or two of a search .
The next two steps help you with that .
Step No. 2 : Focus on getting positive content .
A major part of online reputation management involves pushing the negative websites off of the first page or two of a Google search .
How ?
By posting positive content and getting those pages to rank higher than the negative websites .
You need to direct your marketing or PR department to make online reputation management part of their regular duties .
That means they should always be looking for , gathering or creating positive content that can be used to continually update your websites .
Do n’t put everything onto one corporate website .
Instead , set up different websites for different purposes .
For example , you can have a website for new distributors , a website about your charitable giving , a website about conferences and meetings , a website for photos and perhaps individual product line websites .
This gives you a nice stable of websites that you have control over .
Step No. 3 : Push positive websites higher .
In the online world , your reputation is all about who owns the top - ranking results in a search for your company name .
You want that space to belong to you — or at least be shared only with websites that have good things to say about you .
If you can do that , then the negative websites will be pushed off the first page of a Google search .
And since very few people look past the first page of a search , those negative websites may as well not exist .
The best way to accomplish this is by performing search engine optimization on the positive websites to make them rank higher .
Carefully review your websites ’ content and the meta title tags to be sure they contain your company name .
And most important , you ’ll need to create plenty of back links to your positive websites so they are seen as more popular by Google .
The magic of ranking higher in Google is relevant content and gathering a substantial number of links from other websites that point to your websites .
These links are anchored by your company name .
The goal of getting all the positive websites to rank higher than the negative websites can be a hard one to reach .
But considering how important your online reputation is , achieving this goal is well worth the effort .
This is not always easy , and it can take many months of steady effort to achieve .
Still , consider that the alternative is to let the complaints and negative reviews dominate the search results and trash your online reputation .
Of course , there are even more details to managing your online reputation , but the above steps give you the basic outline of what needs to be done .
Just keep in mind that these days your company ’s online reputation is one of the most important factors in determining its success .

Some things are so ubiquitous that we forget they have an origin , like soup , pants and fizzy water .
Yet everything that we know -- sans nature itself , which we owe to a higher power -- is the product of some person or persons ' imagination .
Even the cocktail itself has a birth date .
For us , that 's May 6 , 1806 .
In all fairness , that 's not when the cocktail was born .
That 's one of the earliest mentions of the cocktail in print in The Balance & Columbian Repository , a now defunct paper from Hudson , New York .
Who created it and the exact date of said creation is the product of much speculation and may forever elude us .
( The name itself , " cocktail " , is also a mystery and I would point you elsewhere for more information about the debate . )
After all , nobody knew on that fateful day that the cocktail would damn near rival the apple pie for the title of most widely known American culinary invention .
The mention of the cocktail in The Balance is followed one week later with a definition , and a little political commentary , when the editor responds to a reader 's question asking what a cocktail is :
As I make it a point , never to publish anything ( under my editorial head ) but which I can explain , I shall not hesitate to gratify the curiosity of my inquisitive correspondent : Cock - tail , then is a stimulating liquor , composed of spirits of any kind , sugar , water and bitters it is vulgarly called a bittered sling , and is supposed to be an excellent electioneering potion inasmuch as it renders the heart stout and bold , at the same time that it fuddles the head .
It is said also , to be of great use to a democratic candidate : because , a person having swallowed a glass of it , is ready to swallow any thing else .
What does this simple four - ingredient combo have to do with the Apple Martini or a Blue Motorcycle ?
Not much , but this singular definition gave way to a category that expanded into a catch - all phrase for any mixed drink .
Yet stalwarts like the Manhattan and Old Fashioned continue to stay true to their origins .
Fujitsu Venus .
Image credit : PC Watch
( AP ) -- Japanese computer maker Fujitsu Ltd. said Wednesday that it has successfully developed the world 's fastest supercomputer processing unit with more than twice the speed of the current leader .
A new central processing unit , or CPU , prototype successfully computed at 128 billion times per second - beating the current record , held by Intel Corp. , by 2.5 times , company spokesman Masao Sakamoto said .
The company shrunk the size of each central circuit , thus doubling the number of circuits per chip , he said .
The prototype is also energy - efficient and was able to cut power consumption to one - third of the conventional Fujitsu model .
Fujitsu aims to put the new CPU , with a code name " Venus , " into practical application in supercomputers " within several years , " Sakamoto said .
Computer makers , including IBM Corp. , Cray Inc. and Intel , have been competing to develop a faster CPU .

Texas school standards next attack : Removing references to the age of the universe .
Image source : NASA Hubble Space Telescope .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The fight over the new education and curriculum standards for the public schools in Texas has been long and publicized .
Most of the publicity , though , focuses on the school board 's focus on " intelligent design " as it relates to the biological question of evolution .
Because evolution has long been contested in public schools , it is no real surprise that this has gotten the most play from the media .
But one thing that has n't been mentioned as much is the fact that the Texas school standards also remove mention of the age of the universe .
Long - standing ideas of cosmology are being challenged as well .
Originally in the Texas school standards was this phrase : " concept of an expanding universe that originated about 14 billion years ago . "
However , board member Barbara Cargill thought this was n't good enough .
It was too definite .
The standards now read , " current theories of the evolution of the universe including estimates for the age of the universe . "
You can bet that the age of the earth is not listed in the Texas curriculum as about 4.5 billion years old -- in spite of the fact that most of the people my age and older have known ( or rather , estimated ) this for years .
There certainly are many different theories about the formation of the universe .
Whether it was a big bang or a big bounce are two of them .
Cosmologists and astronomers wonder about the rate of expansion in the early universe , and they debate the effects of gravity ( not to mention its nature ) as well as consider questions about the composition of the universe and the kinds of particles that exist .
However , despite the questions that do exist about the origination of the universe , there is very little debate about its age .
Right now , the latest estimate is that the universe is 13.73 billion years old , plus or minus 120 million years .
This information is the latest from results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe ( WMAP ) .
While the age of the universe is likely to be fine tuned in coming years , it is extremely likely that it will remain in the neighborhood of 14 billion years .
And few scientists see the age of the earth being cast in doubt as well .
But it appears that cosmology could now be thrown into the fray of science v. religion .
Until now , matters of space have been very little addressed in terms of religion .
After all , could n't God have created the universe well before putting humans on Earth ?
But it appears that by working from Earth outward , some are becoming concerned .
If God created humans on Earth just a few millennia ago , then Earth can't be 4.5 billion years old .
And if Earth is n't as old as all that , surely the universe is n't , either .
It 's an interesting train of logic .
And one that could result in all we know about space science being brought under attack .

… in response to the Court 's inquiries , the Office of the Deputy Attorney General has reviewed the facts of this case and determined that the investigation , prosecution , and conviction of defendant are entirely consistent with the policies of DOJ and with public statements made by the Attorney General with respect to marijuana prosecutions .
The legal plight of medical marijuana provider Charlie Lynch has provided a useful instrument with which to measure the new administration 's commitment to respecting state medical marijuana laws .
Attorney General Eric
Holder has stated that only cases involving violation of state laws will be pursued , prompting the judge in Lynch 's trial to request guidance from the Dept. of Justice before handing down the sentence .
Here 's what came back Huh !?
That can only be true if Lynch violated California 's medical marijuana laws , which has n't been proven in court ( he was only charged under federal law ) , and is entirely inconsistent with his well - documented cooperation with local authorities including the city council and chamber of commerce .
Charlie Lynch is exactly the sort of defendant we are n't supposed to be seeing anymore under Obama , and yet here he is , scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday and the new administration wo n't lift a finger to stop it .
He 'll likely receive a 5 - year mandatory minimum for doing something the President has repeatedly said would not be prosecuted under his administration .
It 's just that simple .
On Thursday , we 'll find out exactly how much Obama 's campaign promises were worth .
This wo n't go down quietly .
Stay tuned .

The Malaysian dragonfly Pseudagrion microcephalum .
( K. Wilson )
At least one in ten species of dragonfly and damselfly are threatened with extinction , according to the first world survey of their numbers .
The figure may be an underestimate as so little is known about many species .
However , the news is not all bad .
The survey published in Biological Conservation is the first to assess the vulnerability of any insect group on a global scale .
And it suggests the extinction risk faced by insects has been exaggerated .
PROPORTION OF THREATENED SPECIES 31 % of amphibians 20 % of mammals 12 % of birds 10 % of dragonflies and damselflies Viola Clausnitzer led an international team of conservation scientists from Germany , Australia , Japan , Russia and the UK among others .
They reviewed the status of a random sample of 1500 of the 5680 dragonflies and damselflies known to science .
The team assessed the population and distribution of each species according to the Red List criteria set down by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) .
They found that more than half of the species should be categorised as Least Concern , which means they likely remain widespread globally , or are not threatened even if they live in a restricted range .
But one in 10 species is threatened , meaning it is categorised as critically endangered , endangered or vulnerable .
The Pemba Featherleg ( Platycnemis pembipes ) a fragile damselfly first discovered in 2001 .
The species inhabits a single stream in Tanzania and is listed as Critically Endangered .
( V. Clausnitzer ) " It 's fair to say that is an underestimate , " says Clausnitzer , as too little data exists to accurately assess the status of 35 per cent of the species .
Dragonflies and damselflies , which belong to the insect order known as the Odonata , are susceptible because the larvae of each species live in water .
So pollution and changes to habitat , such as forest degradation , which affect water courses can have an impact .
Indeed , because of their sensitivity to water and habitat quality , dragonflies are frequently used to assess environmental health .
With their striking colours and behaviour they can be used as indicator species .
" If they disappear you 've got something wrong with your habitat , " says Clausnitzer .
Those species most at risk tend to live in south east Asia and Australia .
In south east Asia , a large number of species are endemic to islands such as the Philippines or within Indonesia , and cannot escape detrimental impacts on their habitat .
ALREADY EXTINCT
Two species of Odonata are known to have gone extinct Both lived on islands Sympetrum dilatatum once lived on Saint Helena Megalagrion jugorum once lived on Maui in the Hawaiian islands
In Australia , climate change is having an especially strong impact on freshwater systems .
The survey is the first to assess the global health of any order of insects .
Compared to vertebrates , the dragonflies and damselflies are not doing badly .
" Amphibians are more threatened than dragonflies in general , " says Clausnitzer .
Amphibians are being particularly afflicted by the deadly chytrid fungus .
" Another difference is that adult dragonflies are more mobile .
If one site is destroyed they still have the chance to fly to another site , which frogs do n't have . "
They also seem less to be less threatened than the mammals , but at a similar level of risk as birds .
" We were a bit surprised that the dragonflies are not that bad off , " says Clausnitzer .
" There is a big discussion going on about invertebrates and extinction rates in insects , and this discussion is not based on any real figures .
It is all estimations , " she adds .
Only males of Klugi's Threadtail ( Protoneura klugi ) were known from two locations in Amazonian Peru .
The species is listed as Data deficient .
( R. W. Garrison )
In general , conservationists have feared that a much higher proportion of insect species face extinction .
However , Clausnitzer cautions that much more research needs to be done to be sure , and different groups of insects might face very different challenges .
For instance , while the reliance of dragonflies and damselflies on water makes them susceptible , says Clausnitzer " dragonflies are the strongest fliers in the insect kingdom .
So you might get a very different picture if you take less capable fliers . "

The Colorado Senate today narrowly rejected a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants in - state tuition after five Democrats joined with Republicans to vote against it .
A disappointed Sen. Chris Romer , the Denver Democrat who sponsored the bill , said it was hard for some lawmakers to support the bill in the current tough economic times .
“ You do n’t make these decisions overnight , ” Romer said , adding that he would try to bring the legislation back next year .
Controversy had followed the legislation , Senate Bill 170 , from its introduction all the way to the Senate floor .
The bill only made it out of the Senate Appropriations Committee last week after Democrats called a meeting in the absence of one Republican member on the committee , setting off angry accusations from GOP senators that Democrats had pulled a sneaky maneuver to get the bill approved .
Today , though , Democrats delayed debate on the bill long enough to allow Sen. Jennifer Veiga , D - Denver , to make it back from the airport to participate in the debate .
Sen .
Ted Harvey , the Republican who was absent from last week ’s Appropriations meeting while caring for an ailing family member , sarcastically applauded Democratic leadership for waiting for Veiga ’s arrival .
“ I think it ’s great that we ’re getting back to the premise of senatorial courtesy , ” said Harvey , R- Highlands Ranch .
The bill would have allowed any student who had attended a Colorado high school for at least three years and graduated to attend public colleges and universities at the in - state tuition rate , regardless of their immigration status .
Similar bills had failed in previous years , but this year ’s legislation had the backing of some top Republicans , including Alex Cranberg , chairman of Aspect Energy and a top GOP donor ; and Dick Monfort , co-owner of the Colorado Rockies and chairman of the University of Northern Colorado Board of Trustees .
Republicans argued that the bill would run afoul of a 1996 federal law that prohibits illegal immigrants from getting college benefits that are not available to all U.S. citizens .
However , nine other states have passed laws allowing in - state tuition to illegal immigrants , and whether the federal law specifically prohibits that practice has not been squarely decided in court .
A challenge to a similar law in California is now pending in that state ’s supreme court .
Proponents of the Colorado bill said that children of illegal immigrants had no say in their coming to the United States and should not be punished by being required to pay out - of - state tuition , which is two to four times higher than the in - state rate .
Romer said a “ cancer of hopelessness ” exists among such students , who ca n’t afford college .
Sen .
Abel Tapia , D - Pueblo , said his Hispanic ancestors had come to Colorado generations ago , but he said all newcomers had the right to aspire to be something more than “ ditchdiggers and dishwashers . ”
And in an at times angry speech , Senate President Peter Groff , a Denver Democrat and one of only two blacks in the legislature , hearkened to the civil - rights era and to the country ’s “ dark past . ”
“ I hope we can live with ourselves if we vote ‘ no ’ today , ” Groff said , accusing those who opposed the bill of not having the “ courage ” to do the right thing .
Sen . Joyce Foster , a Denver Democrat who is the descendant of Jewish immigrants , invoked the Holocaust and appealed to senators ’ compassion .
“ I understand rules , and I understand laws , but sometimes we have to think with our hearts , ” Foster said , “ and I beg you today to think with our hearts . ”
But Republicans said Democrats ’ compassion was misplaced .
They said Democrats lacked a sense of fairness because foreign students who entered the country legally could not receive the in - state rate .
“ By rewarding those people who come here illegally with government services , we will only beget more illegal behavior in the future , ” Harvey said .
A Republican amendment to give all foreign students the in - state rate failed as did another that would have given the lower rate to all students in Colorado .
Sen . Bill Cadman , R- Colorado Springs , said that granting students who are illegal immigrants in - state tuition was like saying “ if their parents robbed a bank , their kids could keep the money . ”
Though the bill would require students who get the in - state tuition rate to sign an affidavit stating they would seek legal residency , Sen .
Mike Kopp , R - Littleton , said the affidavit “ is worth probably less than the paper it ’s printed on . ”
In hopes of attracting more Democratic votes , proponents added an amendment that said the bill would only become effective upon passage of the federal DREAM Act .
That measure being considered in Congress would provide a path to citizenship to illegal immigrants who serve in the military or attend college in the United States .
It was n’t enough .
Democratic Sens. Morgan Carroll of Aurora , Jim Isgar of Hesperus , Moe Keller of Wheat Ridge , Linda Newell of Littleton and Lois Tochtrop of Thornton voted against the bill .
Carroll , after the debate , referred reporters to a statement on her website that said she could not support the bill “ in a climate where the state is cutting or eliminating over $ 1 billion of benefits to the people and is facing a $ 300 million cut to higher education , which virtually ends higher education as we know it in the state of Colorado . ”
Isgar and Tochtrop made similar comments about cuts to colleges , while Keller declined comment on her vote .
Newell , who was elected in November by a razor - thin margin , simply said “ I listened to my constituents ” when asked about her vote .

During the Pirate Bay trial Monique Wadsted represented several major movie studios and called for a “ very significant ” prison sentence for the defendants .
This did n't go down particularly well with some Pirate Bay supporters and now , in a retaliatory move , a few of them have now taken down her law firm 's website .
Taking on The Pirate Bay in court seems to be asking for trouble .
A few days ago the IFPI ’s website was DDoSed by a group of Pirate Bay supporters .
Now MAQS , movie industry lawyer Monique Wadsted ’s site , has been targeted and taken down .
The DDoS attack against the IFPI website was part of Operation Baylout which also encouraged people to send black faxes to movie industry lawyer Monique Wadsted .
We do n’t know if her fax machine survived , but Wadsted ’s law firm ’s website is now out of business also .
A message on the site informs potential clients and passers by about the unexpected downtime .
“ Our website is currently under attack and we have therefore decided to shut it down until the attack ceases .
For further information call Monique Wadsted , ” it reads .
During the final day of the Pirate Bay trial Wadsted said that the people involved in TPB are not as innocent as they claim to be .
What they do is even worse than individuals who share copyrighted material because they make money off their file sharing platform while ignoring the copyright holders , she argued .
Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde said earlier that he understands the frustrations of the people who turn against the entertainment industry lawyers and representatives .
Sunde added that it ’s not likely to solve the problem though .
“ I hope they do something more permanent instead , like making sure the idiots that give power to the media industry lose their own power , ” he told us .
We have no confirmation that the attacks are indeed linked to Monique Wadsted ’s involvement in the Pirate Bay trial , but it is safe to assume that they are .
Meanwhile , the webmaster of the MAQS law firm is praying that the cyber - mob will go away soon .
Sir Alan Haselhurst claimed more than £ 3,000 for the roof of his centuries old farmhouse to be retiled .
He also submitted a bill for pea shingle for his drive

One striking feature of many machine learning algorithms is the gymnastics that designers go through to avoid symmetry breaking .
In the most basic form of machine learning , there are labeled examples composed of features .
Each of these can be treated symmetrically or asymmetrically by algorithms .
feature symmetry Every feature is treated the same .
In gradient update rules , the same update is applied whether the feature is first or last .
In metric - based predictions , every feature is just as important in computing the distance .
example symmetry Every example is treated the same .
Batch learning algorithms are great exemplars of this approach .
label symmetry Every label is treated the same .
This is particularly noticeable in multiclass classification systems which predict according to arg max l w l x but it occurs in many other places as well .
Empirically , breaking symmetry well seems to yield great algorithms .
feature asymmetry
For those who like the “ boosting is stepwise additive regression on exponential loss ” viewpoint ( I do n’t entirely ) , boosting is an example of symmetry breaking on features .
example asymmetry Online learning introduces an example asymmetry .
Aside from providing a mechanism for large scale learning , it also enables learning in entirely new ( online ) settings .
label asymmetry
Tree structured algorithms are good instances of example asymmetry .
This includes both the older decision tree approaches like C4.5 and some newer ones we ’ve worked on .
These approaches are exponentially faster in the number of labels than more symmetric approaches .
The examples above are notably important , with good symmetry breaking approaches yielding substantially improved prediction or computational performance .
Given such strong evidence that symmetry breaking is a desirable property , a basic question is :
Why is n’t it more prevalent , and more thoroughly studied ?
One reasonable answer is that doing symmetry breaking well requires more serious thought about learning algorithm design , so researchers simply have n’t gotten to it .
This answer appears incomplete .
A more complete answer is that many researchers seem to reflexively avoid symmetry breaking .
A simple reason for this is the now pervasive use of Matlab in machine learning .
Matlab is a handy tool for fast prototyping of learning algorithms , but it has an intrinsic language - level bias towards symmetric approaches since there are builtin primitives for matrix operations .
A more complex reason is a pervasive reflex belief in fairness .
While this is admirable when reviewing papers , it seems less so when designing learning algorithms .
A third related reason seems to be a fear of doing unmotivated things .
Anytime symmetry breaking is undertaken , the method for symmetry breaking is in question , and many people feel uncomfortable without a theorem suggesting the method is the right one .
Since there are few theorems motivating symmetry breaking methods , it is often avoided .
What methods for symmetry breaking exist ?
Randomization .
Neural Network learning algorithms which initialize the weights randomly exemplify this .
I consider the randomization approach particularly weak .
It makes experiments non-repeatable , and it seems like the sort of solution that someone with asymmophobia would come up with if they were forced to do something asymmetric .
Arbitrary .
Arbitrary symmetry breaking is something like random , except there is no randomness — you simply declare this feature / label / example comes first and that one second .
This seems mildly better than the randomized approach , but still not inspiring .
Data - driven .
Boosting is a good example where a data - driven approach drives symmetry breaking ( over features ) .
Data - driven approaches for symmetry breaking seem the most sound , as they can result in improved performance .
While there are examples of learning algorithms doing symmetry breaking for features , labels , and examples individually , there are n’t any I know which do all three , well .
What would such an algorithm look like ?
Next Recession Victim : Your Pension and Retirement Plan Some companies are eliminating their pensions as they struggle with the economy .
March 30 , 2009  --
As if there were n't already plenty of economic gloom and doom these days , now some U.S. workers are apparently starting to worry about the safety of their pensions .
Cash - strapped companies are cutting back everywhere possible , and one target has been retirement plans .
With the stock market down , companies have been forced to contribute more money to their plans in order to keep them fully funded .
Several are deciding instead to end future contributions to the programs .
VOTE : Are You Worried About Losing Your Pension ?
Another set of workers has another concern :
Their companies have gone into bankruptcy .
Pensions are insured through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. , a creation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 .
But there are limits to the insurance , now $ 54,000 a year for workers who retire at age 65 .
Younger retirees receive less .
Click Here for the Latest Business Stories From ABC News
Raul Miller , a 55 - year - old flight attendant for United Airlines , had expected to retire this year after 36 years with the company .
But when the airline emerged from bankruptcy in 2007 , his pension was a lot less than what he had planned .
" It 's was sustainable enough to begin with , " Miller said .
Now that the pension has been cut , though , " it means that I can not retire .
It means that I have to continue working as long as I have expenses . "
Miller said he pays more today for food , gas and countless other daily living expenses .
" While everything else is going up , our pension is going down , " he said .
" My pension is not going to be substantial enough .
I 'm going to have to have a full time job . "
Like many other workers , Miller had taken his job expecting and planning on having a pension .
" I was working hard and loyally for this company and one of the reasons was , one of the things I was looking forward to , was the security of a pension in my retirement , " he added .
" It 's just not happening the way I anticipated . "
Even if your company does n't go bankrupt , you might not get the pension you once thought you would .
About one - third of employees nationwide participate in a traditional or defined benefit pension plan .
Pension plans pool together the retirement savings of an entire company 's workforce , young and old .
The employer sets aside an amount of cash each pay period , based on a percentage of each worker 's salary .
The percentage is set by how long the average worker is expected to live , what kind of return the company hopes to get on its investments and on how large of a payout the company plans to make at retirement .
It all gets invested and is eventually used to make payments to workers once they retire .
Freezing Pensions
Many companies are deciding to freeze those pensions now in order to save money in the long - run .
Employees get credit for their time already served but wo n't get any additional credits .
That can really hurt employees who are close to retirement but not quite there because pension plans tend to give more generous benefits for the later years of service .
For instance , one employee might have planned on staying with a company for 30 years , only for it to freeze the pension during their 25th year .
The employee would still get credit for those 25 years of work , but it 's really those last five years that push up the value of the pension .
Peter Austin , executive director of Bank of New York Mellon Pension Services , said that many companies are forced to make higher contributions because the value of their pension portfolios plunged .
To make matters worse , a lot of companies can't borrow cash to add to the fund because of the credit crisis .
" It 's probably the perfect storm for these pension plans , " Austin said .
Austin said many of his corporate clients are now considering other options , including freezing their plans .
Many are switching over to a defined contribution plan , such as a 401 ( k ) instead of a pension .
But he cautioned that while bankruptcy is never a good thing , " the sky 's not falling . "
He said the plans are set up in a way that even if a company collapses , workers are safe from losses .
" Even in the worst case of bankruptcy , " he said , " their benefits will be protected . "
Olivia S. Mitchell , executive director of the Wharton School 's Pension Research Council at the University of Pennsylvania , has been noticing a similar scaling back by companies .
She said roughly $ 2 trillion has been lost in 401 ( k ) s and pension plans during the recession .
" Plan sponsors are going to have to start contributing more to back the promises they 've already made , " Mitchell said .
" Corporate plan sponsors are looking very hard at whether they can reduce future benefit accruals . "
Companies can't touch the benefits workers already received but nothing stops them from ending their pension plans in the immediate future .
Underfunded Plans
Newhouse Newspapers , for instance , is cutting pension contributions and shifting to a 401 ( k ) program .
Cell phone maker Motorola suspending its contributions in December .
Then there is a final group of companies , who have seen their funding drop so low that they are required by the federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 to make changes to their plans .
For instance , book publisher Houghton - Mifflin Harcourt notified its employees last week that they will no longer be able to take a lump - sum payment at retirement , according to spokesman Joe Blumenfeld .
Employees instead will have to either take traditional monthly payments or can chose to get half of the lump - sum payment and the rest through monthly payments .
Blumenfeld said the plan fell below the 80 percent funding level and the company , by law , had no choice but to make the change .
" There was n't a great uproar about it , " he said , but many were asking : " Who has a defined pension anymore , anyway . "

This was the predicament in which Julie Kirkbride found herself yesterday as she tried and failed to save her political career : she had said that she would be out and about in Bromsgrove but knew that if she kept her word she faced the lethal ordeal of being harangued by constituents in full view of the press .
– Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own –
Are the 305 million people living in the United States the most evil in the world ?
Is this the reason why the U.S. , with 5 percent of the world ’s population , has 25 percent of the world ’s prisoners and an incarceration rate five times as high as the rest of the world ?
Or is it a matter of a criminal justice system that has gone dramatically wrong , swamping the prison system with drug offenders ?
That rhetorical question , asked on the floor of the U.S. Senate by Virginia Senator Jim Webb , fits into what looks like an accelerating shift in public sentiment on the way that a long parade of administrations has been dealing with illegal drugs .
Advocates of drug reform sensed a change in the public mood even before Webb , a Democrat who served as secretary of the Navy under Republican Ronald Reagan , introduced a bill last month to set up a blue - ribbon commission of “ the greatest minds ” in the country to review the criminal justice system and recommend reforms within 18 months .
No aspect of the system , according to Webb , should escape scrutiny , least of all “ the elephant in the bedroom in many discussions … the sharp increase in drug incarceration over the past three decades .
In 1980 , we had 41,000 drug offenders in prison ; today we have more than 500,000 , an increase of 1,200 percent . ”
The elephant has ambled out of the bedroom and has become the object of a lively debate on the pros and cons of legalising drugs , particularly marijuana , among pundits on both sides of the political spectrum , on television panels and in mainstream publications from the Wall Street Journal to TIME magazine .
True watersheds in public attitudes are rarely spotted at the time they take place but the phrase “ tipping point ” comes up more and more often in discussions on the “ war on drugs ” .
“ Something has changed in the past few months , ” says Bruce Mirken , of the Marijuana Policy Project , one of a network of 30 groups advocating the legalisation of the most widely - used illegal drug in the United States .
“ In the first three months of this year we ’ve been invited to national cable news programs as often as in the entire year before . ”
SHIFTING MOOD
Allen St. Pierre , who leads the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) , also feels that the most serious public discussion in more than a generation is getting under way .
“ In mid-March , ” he said in an interview , “ there were 36 separate marijuana bills pending in 24 states — on legalization , de-criminalization , medical marijuana .
Not all the bills will make it , but they are a sign of change . ”
So are public opinion polls .
On a national level , they show an increase from about 15 percent in support of marijuana legalization four decades ago to 44 percent now .
The numbers differ from state to state .
In California , the most populous , a recent survey showed 54 percent in favour .
St. Pierre sees a confluence of reasons for the shift in attitudes — baby boomers , a generation familiar with drug use , are in charge of the country ’s institutions ; the dismal economy makes people question public expenditures that do not seem essential ; and the drug violence in Mexico that has begun spilling across the border .
Contrary to widespread perceptions , marijuana accounts , by many estimates , for considerably more than half the illegal drugs smuggled from Mexico to the United States .
The argument for legalizing marijuana , and eventually other drugs , is straightforward : it would transform a law - and - order problem into a problem of public health .
A side effect of particular importance at a time of deep economic crisis : it would save billions of dollars now spent on law enforcement and add billions in revenues if drugs were taxed .
If drug policies were decided by economists , the debate would have begun earlier and might be over by now .
Four years ago , 500 economists including three Nobel prize winners urged the administration of George W. Bush to show that marijuana prohibition justified “ the cost to taxpayers , foregone tax revenues and numerous ancillary consequences … ”
Such as prisons holding , in the words of Senator Webb , tens of thousands of “ passive users and minor dealers . ”
While they contribute to prison overcrowding in some states , they have little to fear in others .
To fully grasp the bizarrely uneven treatment of marijuana use , consider the annual “ smoke- out ” on April 20 in Boulder , Colorado .
There , on a sunny Monday , a crowd estimated at more than 10,000 converged on the campus of the University of Colorado to light up marijuana joints , whose smoke hung over the scene like a grey blanket .
Overhead , an aircraft dragged a banner with the words “ Hmmm , smells good up here . ”
Police watched but made no arrests and issued no fines .
Even the most optimistic of reform advocates do not see an end to prohibition in the near future .
President Barack Obama endeared himself to reformers during his election campaign by an honest answer to a question on past drug use : “ Yes , I inhaled .
Frequently .
That was the point . ”
But his spokesman recently said Obama opposed legalization .
It remains to be seen whether that stand remains the same if Webb ’s proposed commission , assuming it will be established , came up with recommendations for deep change .
That happened to the last report by a blue - ribbon commission on the subject .
The so - called Shafer report , whose members were appointed by then - president Richard Nixon , found in 1972 that “ neither the marijuana user nor the drug itself can be said to constitute a danger to public safety ” and recommended that there should be no criminal penalties for personal use and casual distribution .
Nixon rejected the report .
He had already declared “ war on drugs ” , and American prisons soon began filling up .
There ’s good evidence that women can ejaculate some kind of fluid during orgasm , but we ’re only just starting to understand how and why it happens ( Image : Spencer Rowell / Getty )
See also Six things science has revealed about the female orgasm
WHEN the British Board of Film Classification ordered 6 minutes and 12 seconds of material cut from British Cum Queens in 2002 , they found themselves under attack from an unlikely quarter : a group of feminists .
The offending segment showed some of the female participants apparently ejaculating fluid from their genitals on orgasm .
The film board stated that female ejaculation did not exist , so the actresses must have been urinating .
And urinating on another actor on film is banned under the UK’s Obscene Publications Act .
The group Feminists Against Censorship marshalled all the scientific evidence they could find to prove that some women do in fact ejaculate .
The film board eventually backed down from its complete denial of the phenomenon , stating that female ejaculation was a “ controversial and much debated area ” .
It was only a partial climbdown , however , as the film board insisted that the scenes in question were “ nothing other than straightforward urination masquerading as ejaculation ” .
In their defence , most pornography scenes that depict women ejaculating are indeed staged .
Either the fluid is put into the vagina beforehand off - camera , or the actresses are simply urinating .
The dispute raises an intriguing question .
In the 21st century , when human biology has been investigated right down to the genetic level , how can the existence of female ejaculation still be open to debate ?
Medical textbooks are silent on this aspect of female physiology …
First posted over at TouchArcade.com , a YouTube video depicts what could be World of Warcraft running on the iPhone .
is an incredibly popular massively multiplayer online role - playing game ( MMORPG ) with over 11 million subscribers .
While there have been sketchy rumors in the past that this game could find its way to the iPhone , the video seems believable as it shows the game running within the Vollee client application .
Vollee is a company that develops software to allow mobile 3G phones to play CPU intensive PC applications over the network .
Their first demonstration in 2008 showed Second Life on a mobile device .
The software works by essentially streaming video of the game rather than rendering it by the handset itself :
The companys VolleeX engine adapts applications for screen size and key layout , and then streams the original application to mobile devices .
Vollees interactive video streaming platform optimizes compression to minimize bandwidth requirements and also leverages the 3G mobile networks in such a way that gamers can easily and smoothly navigate virtual worlds .
Vollees technology is also extensible to fast paced , high quality video games previously impossible on mobile .
Vollee has also previously announced upcoming iPhone support as well as a partnership with ActivisionBlizzard which would make this client a distinct possibility .
The company , however , has been rather quiet lately and their website is currently not resolving .
( CNN ) -- NASA scientists say new data provided by twin spacecraft analyzing the sun will help them more accurately predict how so - called solar tsunamis wreak havoc on our planet .
NASA says new data on so - called solar tsunamis will help predict how they will affect our planet .
The tsunamis -- powerful explosions known as coronal mass ejections , or CMEs -- produce solar cosmic rays that can interfere with technology , causing power blackouts and disrupting air traffic communications and cell phone networks .
NASA says images captured by its twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory , or STEREO , spacecraft have enabled scientists to map the tsunamis in 3D to examine their structure , velocity , mass and direction .
The solar ejections , its says , can release billions of tons of high - velocity plasma into space , producing a shockwave that generates cosmic rays which then plow into our atmosphere .
These can create the brightly - colored auroras , more commonly known as the Northern or Southern lights , but also have more damaging effects , posing particular threats to spacecraft and astronauts .
Solar physicist Angelos Vourlidas of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington said the new data from the STEREO craft -- launched into orbit in October 2006 -- will revolutionize the study of cosmic weather patterns .
" Before this unique mission , measurements and the subsequent data of a CME observed near the sun had to wait until the ejections arrived at Earth three to seven days later , " he said in statement .
" Now we can see a CME from the time it leaves the solar surface until it reaches Earth and we can reconstruct the event in 3D directly from the images . "

Telecom regulator TRAI said Internet service providers ( ISPs ) and telecom operators offering Internet services should not accommodate over 50 users per unit of Internet bandwidth in case of home users and 30 users per unit for business users .
Trai���s guidelines are aimed at ensuring that companies don���t congest the available bandwidth with too many users , thus causing low Internet speed .
As per international practices , there are 50 home users and 20 business users on an average for one unit of bandwidth .
The telecom regulator also directed the service providers to ensure availability of the minimum required bandwidth in their network as specified on the basis of number of subscribers .
In addition , Trai said that all service providers must provide detailed information to subscribers regarding Internet and broadband services being offered to them .
Trai has said that the service providers will have to publish contention ratio ��� number of users per unit of bandwidth ��� for different Internet and broadband services quarterly on their website .
Faced with increased complaints of poor quality broadband , Trai had initiated a consultation paper in January to strengthen the existing regulations on broadband quality .
The Internet service providers association of India ( ISPAI ) , the body representing all stand - alone ISPs , had said that fixing a contention ratio at this juncture would put stand - alone ISPs at a disadvantage as it would increase the cost of delivery .
The association has urged Trai to put off the proposal for 2 - 3 years .
As per 2006 regulations , service providers are expected to monitor their network and take corrective actions before the quality of service is impacted .
Yesh Din said Israel 's mining broke international laws
An Israeli human rights group has filed a petition at the High Court demanding an immediate halt to Israeli mining operations in the West Bank .
The group , Yesh Din , accuses Israel of breaking international law by exploiting the occupied territory 's resources for its own gain .
It says Israel has never conducted a thorough review of the practice .
But Israel says the procedures are in line with both international law and agreements with the Palestinians .
Yesh Din cites military documents which show nine million of the 12 million tonnes of rock and gravel mined in the West Bank each year are sold in Israel - and says Israel is " addicted to the exploitation " .
It says its High Court petition addresses " the illegal practice of brutal economic exploitation of a conquered territory to serve the exclusive economic needs of the occupying power " .
' Pillage '
" According to international law , this kind of activity is a violation of occupation laws as well as of human rights laws and , in certain cases , might be defined as pillage , " says the petition .
Long - term Israeli construction plans show the authorities intend to rely on the continued use of materials taken from the West Bank over the next 30 years , says the group , leaving the territory " empty of natural resources " .
Israel , which has occupied the West Bank since 1967 , has rejected the accusations .
Military spokesman Miki Galin said all mining operations were carried out in line with " the relevant directives of international law " and agreements with Palestinians .
" The Civil Administration is carrying out staff work to evaluate the up - to - date policy regarding the operation of the quarries , " he said .
We 've seen plenty of systems that rely on facial recognition for an interface , but they 've so far been a decidedly rarer occurrence when it comes to in - car systems .
Toshiba looks set to change that , however , with it now showing off a new system that 'll not only let you control the A/C or radio with the glance of your eye , but alert you if you happen to take your eyes off the road for too long .
That 's done with the aid of a camera mounted above the steering wheel that 's used to identify and map out the driver 's face , letting the car ( or desktop PC in this demonstration ) detect everything from head movement and eye direction to eyelid blinks , which Toshiba says could eventually be used to alert drowsy drivers .
Unfortunately , Toshiba does n't have any immediate plans to commercialize the technology , although it apparently busily working to make it more suited for embedded CPUs .
Barack Obama with Peter Orszag , the OMB boss , in the Oval Office .
When Barack Obama visited Prague and talked to Czech President Václav Klaus , Obama told his Czech counterpart that his environmental offices are filled with people who have no sense of economic reality when it comes to carbon regulation .
Later , President Klaus praised Obama for saying things that sounded like the music from the Heavens to Klaus 's ears : it almost looked like Klaus was modestly feeling like the # 2 denier in the Castle at that moment .
The Secretary of Music in the Heavens was Dr Satan , but that 's another story . ;-)
We could have had some hopes or doubts - depending on your point of view - what Obama really believed about the costs and benefits of the CO2 regulation .
These hopes or doubts are likely to grow .
Why ?
Recall that the U.S. Supreme Court has declared carbon dioxide a pollutant in April 2007 .
What 's happening with this crazy , toxic decision ?
A decision that the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has endorsed and interpreted as a reason to act ?
Last month , EPA decided that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare .
According to
[ T ]he EPA regulation of the gases blamed for global warming will have serious economic consequences throughout the U.S. economy ...
If the EPA proceeds with the regulation of heat - trapping gases , factories , small businesses and institutions would be subject to costly regulation ...
The EPA failed to explain adequately how it determined that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare ...
an internal 2009 memo of the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) was just released .
It is calledand it says things that all sane people realize to hold but the EPA does n't .
The OMB is currently led by Peter Orszag , a Princeton economist who is a disciple of Joseph Stiglitz and Robert Rubin .
The nine - page document compiled by many White House offices and leaked by the GOP Senators today says that The last question is arguably the most skeptical one .
Note that it is not only the EPA but also the Supreme Court that should try to explain the unexplainable .
In fact , later I learned that EPA 's boss Lisa Jackson has already stated that she has just copied her statement from the Supreme Court so she can't be blamed for its being a bullshit .
In fact , she said that she has always understood that the regulation was costly ! ;-)
Such a widespread " turning of the coats " right before the alarmism 's collapse has been predicted by many .
The new document also criticizes the EPA for an unbalanced summary , e.g. for the failure to notice that a hypothetical warming would be beneficial at least for states like Alaska .
The Green Sheet ( " ee " , not " i " ) has already revealed that Obama plans to kill the polar bears
What will they write now ? ;-)
But do n't get carried away .
All the statements above were only written by someone in the Obama administration and they happened to be included in the OMB summary .
So far it 's not clear whether the whole document has this character or whether it is an inconsistent bound state of individual opinions .
The latter would be disappointing but it would still be a huge step forward from the tragedy of the " consensus " .
Researchers at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center say they 've prompted rodents to forget painful memories by injecting them with a drug called ZIP , which interferes with a neural substance integral memory functions .
So it 's only a matter of time before you 'll be able to pop a pill and forget all about that photo of the Chinese guy 's tumors or Lindsay Lohan 's awkward appearance with Lily Allen !
The Times has a feature on the Brooklyn lab today , as part of a series on brain research .
According to Dr. Todd Sacktor , mice who had previously learned to avoid an electrified area of their cage forgot all about the zap zone after a dose of ZIP , and rats forgot about their disgust for a taste that had made them sick .
Sacktor believes the drug could one day be used effectively with humans , and a variant of it could also enhance memory .
But Dr. Steven E. Hyman , a neurobiologist at Harvard , is urging caution : " We know that people already use smart drugs and performance enhancers of all kinds , so a substance that actually improved memory could lead to an arms race ...
This possibility of memory editing has enormous possibilities and raises huge ethical issues . "
DC Anchor to outing blogger : I would like to ' give you a punch across the face . '
Todd Heywood
Published : Thursday May 7 , 2009
Print This Email This Michael Rogers of BlogActive.com and editor of PageOneQ.com was on Let 's Talk Live on News Channel 8 , an ABC affiliate in the greater D.C. area when anchor Doug Mckelway told him he would like to " give you a punch across the face . "
Rogers is now calling on Mckelway to issue an on air , as well as a written , apology .
WASHINGTON , D.C.-- Activist and blogger Michael Rogers is calling on a television show talk host to apologize on air for threatening to " punch " him because he disagreed with Rogers ' take on the issue of outing , as well as a written apology .
" I 've been in some pretty lively debates , including ones with Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly , " Rogers said .
" I 've never been treated like this on air by anyone . "
Rogers continued , " I am demanding that Mr. Mckelway issue an on air and written apology for his treatment of me . "
Rogers was a guest on the D.C. show Let 's Talk Live on Wednesday discussing the film Outrage -- in which he appears .
The film , directed by Kirby Dick , explores the controversial idea of outing -- or disclosing the sexual orientation of persons who work against the LBGT community , while actively seeking same - sex sexual activity .
Rogers says it is an issue of hypocrisy ; Mckelway says it 's an issue of privacy .
During the debate , Rogers accused Mckelway of believing that being gay was something bad .
Mckelway demanded Rogers retract his statement , then pointed his finger at Rogers .
A transcript of the exchange follows :
Mckelway : I 'm about ready to do a lot more than point my finger at you
Rogers : what would that be ?
Mckelway : I , er , I will take you outside and give you a punch across the face because that is not what I said and that is not what I mean .
Calls to News Channel 8 and the Let's Talk Live !
segment producer seeking comment were not returned .
Rogers says the situation with Mckelway is more than just a casual , passing statement in the heat of the moment .
" Mckelway 's use of threatened violence is another indication of how far the LGBT community has yet to go to be safe in America .
Had this been any other minority in America , Mckelway would never have felt that threatened violence was acceptable .
And even if he had , he would not longer have a job , " Rogers said .
" This is why it 's important for the elected leaders of this country begin making progress towards treating gay people equally under the law .
Otherwise , people like Doug Mckelway feel perfectly comfortable abandoning professional ethics and threatening a gay man over a simple disagreement in philosophy . "

Advertisement A nurse who secretly filmed for the BBC to reveal the neglect of elderly patients at a hospital has been struck off for misconduct .
Margaret Haywood , 58 , filmed at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton for a BBC Panorama programme in July 2005 .
She was struck off by the Nursing and Midwifery Council which said she failed to " follow her obligations as a nurse " .
Ms Haywood , a nurse for over 20 years , said she thought she had been treated harshly and had put patients first .
Ms Haywood , from Liverpool , said : " I am absolutely devastated and upset by it all .
I think I have been treated very harshly .
Panorama believes that Margaret Haywood has done the elderly population of this country a great service
BBC spokesman
Calls for whistle - blower review " It is a serious issue and I knew it was a risk I was taking but I thought the filming was justified and it was in the public interest .
" I always made it clear to the BBC that patients would come first at all times . "
She said she had voiced her concerns through her immediate line manager " but nothing was really taken on board " and the whole process now needed to be reviewed .
' Patients ' dignity compromised ' A Department of Health spokesperson said : " Whistle - blowers already have full protection under the Public Interest Disclosure Act passed by this Government .
" We expect that any member of staff who reports concerns about the safety or quality of care to be listened to by their managers and action taken to address their concerns . "
She was found guilty of misconduct on Wednesday following a fitness to practise hearing .
The panel said she " followed the behest of the filmmakers ... rather than her obligations as a nurse " .
The chair of the panel , Linda Read , said Ms Haywood had prioritised the filming , which in the view of the panel " was a major breach of the code of conduct " .
She said : " A patient should be able to trust a nurse with his / her physical condition and psychological wellbeing without that confidential information being disclosed to others .
HAVE YOUR SAY
How can the NMC expect respect and confidence from the public they are supposed to be serving when they react in this deplorable and protectionist manner ?
Graham , Canterbury " Although the conditions on the ward were dreadful , it was not necessary to breach confidentiality to seek to improve them by the method chosen .
She said the misconduct was " fundamentally incompatible with being a nurse " .
" The registrant could have attempted to address shortcomings by other means .
But this was never a course of action which she fully considered . "
Ms Haywood had admitted breaching patient confidentiality but denied her fitness to practise had been impaired .
This makes total nonsense of all the talk about openness and transparency in the NHS .
Cover -up is the order of the game
Joyce Robins , Patient Concern Elizabeth Bloor , the BBC programme 's producer , told the hearing there had been " an over - arching public interest " to produce the Undercover Nurse documentary because Panorama had received up to 5,000 complaints about conditions .
In November the panel found no evidence that Ms Haywood broke the NHS Trust 's policy on whistle - blowing by raising concerns about patient care in the documentary , or that she failed to assist colleagues when a patient was having a seizure .
A BBC spokesman said : " There was clearly a strong public interest in revealing that some elderly people were not receiving the level of care we expect from our national health service .
" Panorama believes that Margaret Haywood has done the elderly population of this country a great service . "
' Right and proper ' The National Union of Journalists ( NUJ ) said its code of conduct stated that surreptitious means of gaining information were permissible in the public interest , and the same should apply to whistle - blowers .
Tim Gopsill , of the NUJ , said : " Sometimes the only way to get anything done is to go to the media .
No -one could possibly argue that this story was not in the public interest . "
The panel 's ruling was also criticised by Joyce Robins , co-director of Patient Concern .
She said : " This just demonstrates the priorities of the regulators - rules come before patients every time .
The message that goes out to nurses is : however badly you see patients treated , keep your face shut .
" This makes total nonsense of all the talk about openness and transparency in the NHS .
Cover - up is the order of the game . "
Ms Haywood 's actions were also defended by Gary Fitzgerald , chief executive of Action on Elder Abuse .
He said : " We know that we 're seeing older people suffering the most appalling care and neglect too often in our care environments .
" In that context I believe what Margaret Haywood did and what Panorama did was right and proper . "

I grew up on Z80 and x86 assembly .
I happily moved data into my registers from anywhere in memory and back without ever giving it a second thought .
Life was nice and simple .
It was n't until years later , when I started dealing with caches , vector units , and different architectures that data alignment became a big deal .
Today , data alignment is an inescapable reality , and we all have to deal with it one way or another .
Data alignment refers to where data is located in memory .
All data is at least 1 - byte aligned , meaning that it starts at any one byte in memory .
Data that is n- byte aligned is located somewhere with a memory address that is an exact multiple of n bytes .
It 's All About Performance
We care about alignment for a single reason : Performance .
In modern hardware , memory can only be accessed on particular boundaries .
Trying to read data from an unaligned memory address can result in two reads from main memory plus some logic to combine the data and present it to the user .
Considering how slow main memory access is , that can be a major performance hit .
Some platforms such as the PowerPC choose not to hide such an inefficient use of hardware and simply raise a hardware exception flagging the invalid memory access .
Neither scenario is particularly attractive .
Even when reading from fast , level - one cache memory , unaligned access to data will use up more cache lines , making poor use of the available memory and evicting data that might be accessed again .
As a result , sections of your code can thrash the cache and become major performance bottlenecks .
Vector operations usually force programmers to deal with data alignment explicitly .
To squeeze more performance without increasing the frequency of CPU cores , hardware designers have been putting more emphasis on vector operations ( which are just a type of SIMD instruction -- single instruction multiple data ) .
One vector instruction can operate on four or more data points at once , considerably improving the performance of a program that operates over each data point serially .
Vector units often have a restriction that they can only work on data aligned on a particular boundary .
For example , Intel 's and AMD 's SSE vector instructions operate on data aligned on 16 - byte boundaries , so it is the programmer 's responsibility to align the data properly before feeding it to the vector units .
In general , the more you interface with the hardware directly , the more careful you will have to be about the alignment of your data .
Cell phone video shows highway patrol grabbing paramedic by the throat

Thursday , May 28 , 2009
A scuffle between two highway patrol officers and an EMT was captured on video after the police pulled over an ambulance on route to the hospital with a patient on board .
The incident occurred on Highway 62 near Boley in Okfuskee County , Oklahoma .
The video begins with the patient ’s son , Mr Kenyada Davis , explaining “ Highway Patrol have pulled my mom ’s ambulance over because he ’s mad we did n’t pull over . ”
The troopers were responding to a call of their own and were evidently annoyed that the ambulance did not yield and give way to them on the road .
“ He ’s trying to arrest the EMT taking my mother to the hospital . ”
Davis explains .
The video then shows one of the troopers pointing at the paramedic and yelling “ You are under arrest , you are under arrest ” .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As the patient begins to scream inside the ambulance , the EMT , Mr Maurice White , Jr. , tries to explain that he is trying to get to the hospital .
As he raises a hand in gesture , one of the troopers is seen to grab Mr White in an attempt to put him in an arm lock and cuff him .
Mr White resists and a scuffle breaks out .
Mr
White attempts to get back into the ambulance , at which point the trooper grabs him by the throat .
“ I ’m going to the hospital . ” Mr White again says , while Mr Davis pleads “ he ’s a doctor ” .
The troopers then relent and return to their vehicle .
Watch the video below :
( Article continues below )
Mr White has given a statement in which he explains how he told the trooper he had a patient in the ambulance and that they were on their way to the hospital .
“ He ignored my statement , became even more belligerent , and demanded my partner come to his patrol car so he could write him a ticket , ” White says .
“ I calmly told the officer that we were transporting a patient and we could continue this at the hospital . ”
White also writes that the trooper told him they could continue on to the hospital , but that he would be under arrest once they arrived .
White was not arrested , but states that the troopers told him he should be prepared to turn himself in if a warrant was issued .
Paul Franks , the driver of the ambulance , has also provided a written statement .
According to reports , the troopers have claimed that the paramedic assaulted one of them before the camera started rolling .
The district attorney in Okfuskee County is expected to take a look at the video and may file charges against Maurice White as soon as this week .
The Oklahoma Highway Patrol have refused to comment on the video while it is still under review .
Thankfully the patient was treated at the hospital and was released later the same day .

With the Tesla Roadster and other plug - in electric vehicles hitting the road , so demand is growing for readily accessible refueling points to recharge them .
Carbon Day Automotive has now demonstrated a solar - powered recharging point , known as the Solar Plug - In Station , which lets motorists easily charge their cars using electricity that has been generated without any environmental emissions .
The Solar Plug - In Station thas gone on show in Chicago as part of the city 's bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games .
According to Carbon Day Automotive , the solar - powered recharge station is part of the vital infrastructure required for electric vehicles in Chicago and was the focus of a recent visit by the International Olympic Committee .
These solar - powered electricity points will be used daily by Chicago to fuel the city ’s electric vehicles with power from the sun .
While the the electric vehicles are driven by solar energy , their carbon imprint is n't completely removed but rather relocated to the power plant where the electricity was generated .
But by generating the electricity from pollution - free solar cells , the C02 emissions are reduced to zero .
“ Solar energy and electric vehicles are an inevitable partnership that is one more step to reducing our dependence on foreign oil , ” says Richard Lowenthal , CEO of Coulomb Technologies .
Coulomb Technologies recently developed the components required for individual recharging stations , marketed as ChargePoint Networked Charging Stations .
Carbon Day Automotive is the Midwest distributor for the ChargePoint stations .
The Solar Plug - In Station , built by Carbon Day Construction , consists of giant solar panels in the shape of a tree - like canopy that shades the tiny ChargePoint Networked Charging Station .
The solar panel is connected to an underground battery pack that stores the solar energy on a grid , ready for everyday refueling .
“ Without these stations it would be like driving around in traditional cars without the availability of gas stations , " says Scott Emalfarb , CEO at Carbon Day .
" The day of true plug - in electric vehicles will be here sooner than most people realize and the world needs to be ready to accommodate them . ”

Hemp , a plant from the cannabis family , could be used to build carbon - neutral homes of the future to help combat climate change and boost the rural economy , say researchers at the University of Bath .
A consortium , led by the BRE Centre for Innovative Construction Materials based at the University , has embarked on a unique housing project to develop the use of hemp - lime construction materials in the UK .
Hemp - lime is a lightweight composite building material made of fibres from the fast growing plant , bound together using a lime - based adhesive .
The hemp plant stores carbon during its growth and this , combined with the low carbon footprint of lime and its very efficient insulating properties , gives the material a ‘ better than zero carbon ’ footprint .
Professor Pete Walker , Director of the BRE Centre for Innovative Construction Materials , explained : “ We will be looking at the feasibility of using hemp - lime in place of traditional materials , so that they can be used widely in the building industry .
“ We will be measuring the properties of lime - hemp materials , such as their strength and durability , as well as the energy efficiency of buildings made of these materials .
“ Using renewable crops to make building materials makes real sense - it only takes an area the size of a rugby pitch four months to grow enough hemp to build a typical three bedroom house .
“ Growing crops such as hemp can also provide economic and social benefits to rural economies through new agricultural markets for farmers and associated industries . ”

Once on opposite sides of a major U.S. court case Bush V Gore to determine the outcome of the 2000 presidential contest , Ted Olson and David Boies are now filing a federal challenge over the courts ruling on proposition 8 .
The two attorney powerhouses are arguing that prop 8 violates the U.S. constitutional guarantee of equal protection and due process and maintain that federal courts will recognize sexual orientation as a suspect class that must be protected nationwide .
Below is a video of Ted Olson and David Boies discussing their case and plans with CNN's Larry King .
The loudest critics against this move are coming from those within the LGBT community .
They are suspicious over Ted Olson who does n't try to hide the fact that he is conservative .
They also feel that there are not enough federal protections to have sexual orientation deemed a class that needs protection and do n't believe they have the votes needed at the U.S. Supreme Court level to bring forth federal marriage equality .
The activists and organizations prefer to take the state by state route , and feel that the Supreme Court issuing a ruling against same - sex marriage would set a very bad precedent for the movement .
What are your thoughts about this federal case for marriage equality ?
Regardless of the outcome should the push be made .
Can we compare it to other civil rights struggles , where states refused to grant rights until mandated by the courts ?
As part of his environmental agenda , President Barack Obama announced in March he would order a review of a regulation approved late last year by the Bush administration that severely weakened the Endangered Species Act .
The prior administration turned its back on animals and plants in December by giving federal agencies permission to ignore input from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service when constructing dams , highways , parking lots and other projects .
The reasoning was that many federal agencies have their own scientists , but those individuals do n’t necessarily specialize in wildlife and habitat issues .
Thankfully , that wrong - headed regulation has now been reversed .
As announced last week by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke , federal agencies will again have to adhere to the protection of endangered species the way they did before the Bush administration .
That means consulting with federal fish and wildlife experts before shovels go into the ground .
“ By rolling back this 11th hour regulation , we are ensuring that threatened and endangered species continue to receive the full protection of the law , ” Salazar said .
Now that the regulation has been reversed , one wonders what then - Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne was thinking when he approved the rule change a month after Obama had been elected and a month before Bush left office .
Kempthorne had to know there was a high probability that the regulation would be reversed , given Obama ’s vow to strengthen environmental protections .
This is just one of many examples of how the Obama administration is finding itself bogged down by the legacy of the Bush presidency .
The timing of the decision by Salazar and Locke is critical as the nation enters a new phase of construction projects that are being financed by the economic stimulus package .
Although these projects are essential to creating jobs and getting the economy moving again , the input from wildlife and habitat scientists will help ensure that endangered plants and animals are protected .

Who Wants A One World Government ?
by Michael Barker
( Swans - April 6 , 2009 ) Throughout the past century , liberal elites organizing to build the institutional foundations for a one world government have regularly acted as whipping boys for conservative commentators who accuse them of conspiring to enmesh the global populace within the oppressive chains of communism .
In the past , popular promoters of such misconceptions have been derived from far - right groups like the John Birch Society , but more recently the accusations have come from top religious and political leaders like Pat Robertson and Ron Paul .
In the eyes of these conservative commentators , liberal elites stand guilty of promoting a one world government , or New World Order , designed to rein in individual freedom and enslave humanity .
The most notable ringleader elites of this conspiracy include influential neo-centrics like George Soros ( who founded the Open Society Institute ) , and members of the Rockefeller family -- most notably David Rockefeller and the liberal foundations that receive funding from his family .
Like most widely accepted analyses presented in the mainstream media this conservative interpretation of world events comprises an element of truth .
Consequently , this article analyses the conservative interpretation of world events .
It reviews the ongoing activities of groups that openly acknowledge their desire to promote a one world government and goes on to critique the left 's approach to global government .
It will demonstrate how the critical onslaught from the Right has , to date , served to prevent the progressive community from engaging in this critical debate ; that is , the debate to shape the future of global politics to enable us to create a new peaceful world order .
Finally , it offers a progressive theoretical framework to expose the disturbing ambitions of the liberal elite .
World Federalists , " Socialists , " and Gorbachev Power
Elite aspirations for creating more efficient means of managing the world are not new .
One of the most significant US - based organizations pushing this global agenda has been the American branch of the World Federalist Movement , a group that was first known as the World Federalists of America .
Formed in the aftermath of World War I , the World Federalists of America " call[ed ] for the formation of a world government with the power to make and enforce laws which will control pollution of the earth 's atmosphere and water , curb the waste of its resources , and dismantle the war machines of all nations . "
Later , as Joseph Baratta recounts in his book , The Politics of World Federation : From World Federalism to Global Governance ( Praeger , 2004 ) , by 1939 :
... as the League [ of Nations ] collapsed , bolder spirits began to call for establishment of a true world federal government , by delegation of sovereign powers at least for the maintenance of peace and security .
...
They included Clarence Streit , author of the book that practically conjured up the movement , Union Now .
Another was Tom Otto Greissemer , German émigré from Hilter 's Reich , who edited World Government News .
Gressemer , educator Vernon Nash , and advertising executive Mildred Riorden Blake founded the World Federalists in New York in 1941 .
The Wall Street lawyer and " statesman incognito " behind the Wilson and Roosevelt administrations , Grenville Clark , had some influence when the times were auspicious , and later he and Harvard international lawyer Louis B .
Sohn wrote one of the classics of the movement , World Peace through World Law . ( p. 3 )
In 1947 , this group along with World Federalists of America met in Asheville , North Carolina , with representatives of three other like - minded world - federalist organizations to merge to become the United World Federalists which boasted a roster that " read like a Who 's Who of academe , science , politics , the media , the legal community , business , and labor . "
( 1 ) Although this newly - formed group had substantial support from the elites , Baratta observed that in its early days , " The only substantial money to come into the [ World Federalist ] movement -- $ 1 million from McCormick reaper heiress Anita McCormick Blaine -- funded the Foundation for World Government . "
( 2 ) In later years United World Federalists would undergo a number of name changes before finally settling on their current name Citizens for Global Solutions ( in 2004 ) .
Following sustained attacks from radical conservatives like Pat Robertson ( author of The New World Order ) , world federalists have become sensitive to openly declaring ambitions to create a world government .
However , the former president of the World Federalist Movement , ( 1991 - 2004 ) , the late Sir Peter Ustinov , has openly stated that a " World Government is not only possible , it is inevitable ... " ; similarly , in 1992 , Strobe Talbott , writing for Time magazine famously quipped , " I 'll bet that within the next hundred years ... nationhood as we know it will be obsolete ; all states will recognize a single , global authority . "
( 3 ) Significantly , David Rockefeller noted in his memoirs , how some quarters considered the Rockefeller family " internationalists " who " conspire [d ] with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure , one world , if you will . "
His response to this accusation was : " If that 's the charge , I stand guilty , and I am proud of it . "
( 4 ) On this point , Baratta observes how " Federalists want world government , like any government , not as a good in itself but as the necessary instrument to establish peace and justice .
Not to talk of government is not to face squarely the issue of willing the means for the end . " ( p.536 )
Since 2004 the work of the World Federalists of America has been presided over by the Very Rev. Lois Wilson .
Just prior to becoming the acting president of the World Federalist Movement ( in 2004 ) , Rev. Wilson served as Canada 's special envoy to the Sudan ( 1999 - 2002 ) , ( 5 ) but she had also been the first Canadian to be the president of the World Council of Churches ( 1983-90 ) .
Around this time , Rev. Joan Brown Campbell became the first woman to be named executive director of the US office of the World Council of Churches -- a position she held from 1985 until 1991 .
To date Rev. Campbell is an influential member of the globalist interfaith community and is presently a board member of the World Council of Religious Leaders and The Interfaith Alliance , while she chairs the Global Women 's Peace Initiative ( a group whose executive director , Marianne Marstrand , is the sister - in - law of the world 's leading globalists , Maurice Strong ) . ( 6 )
In 1983 , the World Federalist Movement formed the Institute for Global Policy , which acts as their research arm .
In 2003 , the Institute launched their Responsibility to Protect - Engaging Civil Society Project ( R2PCS ) that ostensibly " seeks to promote commitment by the international community to prevent and respond early and effectively to threats of genocide and other mass atrocities . "
Stephen Gowans recently exposed the selective nature of this project 's concerns with human rights violations , highlighting that ,
... the plight of the Palestinians is nowhere to be found on the [ir ] website ... , though R2PCS has much to say about " the crisis in Darfur , " " the crisis in Myanmar " and " the crisis in Zimbabwe , " as well as the " genocides in Cambodia , Rwanda and Bosnia , ( and ) crimes against humanity in Kosovo . "
That the humanitarian catastrophe visited upon the Palestinians is absent from the R2PCS 's concerns hardly jibes with its professed mission to " promote concrete policies to better enable governments , regional organizations and the U.N. to protect vulnerable populations . "
In late 2007 , R2PCS formed a new initiative to build a Right to Protect ( R2P ) " global civil society coalition , " which was supported by groups like " Oxfam International , Human Rights Watch , International Crisis Group , and Refugees International . "
The last three groups mentioned on the Project 's Web site are all tightly connected to " humanitarian " warrior George Soros , ( 7 ) and so it is no coincidence that Anthony Fenton writes :
In short , R2P has been defined as a situation wherein " the power of the sovereign state can be legitimately revoked if the international community decides that the state is not protecting its citizens . "
Importantly , the state 's power is not only taken in extreme instances , via military intervention .
Sovereignty can also be undermined by policies imposed under the " preventive " and " rebuilding " phases of the R2P spectrum , often in the form of economic sanctions , " coercive diplomacy , " " democracy promotion , " " good governance , " and structural adjustment programs .
Although Fenton 's work focuses on the utility of R2P doctrine to imperial interventions in Haiti , he makes the more general observation that " Following the controversial inclusion of the ( albeit watered - down ) R2P language in the UN's 2005 World Summit Outcome document , a veritable , well - funded ' R2P Lobby ' has stealthily emerged to advance and consolidate the doctrine as a ' global norm . ' "
The proponents of this R2P doctrine fit within an ideological grouping that I refer to as the " Project For A New American Humanitarianism . "
Given the World Federalist Movement 's service to imperial interests , it appears paradoxical that the same group would be amongst the leading promoters of an idea called subsidiarity .
Maurice Strong , " a great believer in the principle of subsidiarity " defines this concept as ensuring that " responsibility for decision making resides at the level closest to the people affected at which it can be exercised effectively . "
However , Strong and the World Federalist Movement 's interpretation of this democratic ideal are vastly at odds with those of groups challenging ( not creating ) hierarchies , for example anarchists , who strongly support the devolution of power to the people .
Consequently , as Aaron deGrassi points out :
[ W] hile subsidiarity may seem to portend the desirability of decentralization , the concept also raises crucial questions of who decides what is " practicable " ( and hence what are the limits of decentralization ) , on which criteria , with which evidence , and through which processes ?
Deciding where to allocate powers and resources thus inherently involves " the politics of the possible , " and consequently the principle of subsidiarity can and has been used across the political spectrum equally to justify higher - level intervention or non-intervention -- a tension present in the crowning pinnacle of subsidiarity to date , the Maastricht Treaty . ( 8 )
On this latter point Takis Fotopoulos , writing in 1994 , notes how in contrast to following the genuine principle of subsidiarity , the European Economic Community 's implementation of the principle works by delegating " all unimportant decisions " to local decision - taking bodies .
Returning to the World Federalist Movement , Rev. Wilson took over the reins of the Movement in 2004 when the former president , actor Sir Peter Ustinov , passed away .
Ustinov had served as the president of the Movement since 1991 and was a member of Ervin Laszlo 's Club of Budapest -- a group that " appear [s ] to be working to attempt to promote a form of spirituality that can overcome all geographic and cultural divides , " which seem " well suited to other homogenizing globalizing tendencies . "
In 2002 , Ustinov received the Club of Budapest 's Planetary Consciousness Award along with the controversial Shimon Peres ( see Khaled Amayreh 's recent article " Shimon Peres : Murderer , Liar , and Hypocrite " ) and the United Nations ' Messengers of Peace , Paulo Coelho ( who also serves as a board member of the Shimon Peres Institute for Peace ) .
Here it is noteworthy that in 1978 Shimon Peres was elected as vice president of Socialist International , the " worldwide organisation of social democratic , socialist and labour parties , " a group that Peres described as " probably the most important nongovernmental political organization in Europe , if not in the world . " ( 9 )
During Peres 's service at Socialist International , the organization 's president was the late Willy Brandt ( who served in this position from 1978 until 1992 ) .
At present the secretary general of Socialist International is Luis Ayala .
Ayala is a patron of One World Action , a group that was cofounded by Glenys Kinnock , the wife of the former UK Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock ( who is an honorary president of Socialist International , and the vice president of the pro-European membership organisation , European Movement ) .
( 10 )
It is noteworthy that the vice president of One World Action , Sir Sigmund Sternberg , is a Club of Budapest member , a businessman turned into a powerful interfaith philanthropist who coordinated the religious component of the World Economic Forum .
Recently he assisted Tony Blair to establish the Tony Blair Faith Foundation serving as an " informal advisor . "
( 11 ) Sternberg also acts as the president of the Movement for Reform Judaism , and in 1997 helped co-found the Three Faiths Forum , a group that focuses on " improving understanding between the Muslim , Christian and Jewish communities . "
From the Forum 's founding until his death in 2008 , Sidney Shipton acted as the coordinator of the Three Faiths Forum -- a strange choice given that he was a " bastion of the Zionist Establishment " who had formerly headed the UK arm of the Jewish National Fund ( a Zionist colonialist agency of ethnic cleansing ) .
In addition , the former Archbishop of Canterbury , Lord Carey of Clifton , who serves as a patron of the Three Faiths Forum , is the cofounder of the World Faiths Development Dialogue -- a group he set up in 1998 with the aid of prominent Zionist James Wolfensohn ( the then president of the World Bank ) to promote " dialogue on poverty and development " .
( 12 ) One has to be sceptical of the type of just and equitable outcomes that can be achieved for Muslims by engaging in this type of dialogue with Zionists .
Socialist International and assorted interfaith groups clearly fulfill an important role in World Federalists ' global governance agenda .
However , coming back to the World Federalists of America ( now known as the World Federalist Movement ) , another critical individual who helped found this group in the 1940s was the late Alan Cranston , who went on to serve as their president from 1949 until 1952 .
In 1945 Cranston published The Killing of the Peace , which was released in the hope that it would build support for the United Nations .
Cranston remained a dedicated promoter of World Federalism until the end of his life , and in 1995 he " teamed with former Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev as the chairman of the Gorbachev Foundation / USA , a San Francisco based think - tank seeking nuclear disarmament . "
This think tank , which was founded in 1992 by Jim Garrison and John Balbach , " set the stage for the establishment , " in 1995 , of another San Francisco based non-profit institution , the State of the World Forum , which was formed to " gather together the creative genius on the planet in a search for solutions to critical global challenges . "
The following provides a brief introduction to this unique global - level forum and the personalities that drive it .
Funding for the State of the World Forum is obtained from the Canadian International Development Agency , a multitude of liberal foundations , ( 13 ) and corporate sponsors like Booz Allen Hamilton and McKinsey & Company .
John Balbach ( " a pioneer of the broadband wireless industry " ) served as co-founder of the Forum ( and also acted as vice president of the Gorbachev Foundation ) .
Balbach presently acts as senior counsel to the Seva Foundation -- a philanthropic effort that was founded by Larry Brilliant ( the executive director of Google 's philanthropic project Google.org ) -- and is the managing partner and founder of the international strategic consultancy Global Alliances .
Balbach 's consultancy , Global Alliances , " served as the founders of the first State of the World Forum , " while some of their other clients include free - market environmental groups ( e.g. , Environmental Defense Fund , and the Natural Resources Defense Council ) , and world leaders like Boris Yelstin , Margaret Thatcher , and George Bush . ( 14 )
Another important person connected to both the Gorbachev Foundation and the Forum is James Hickman .
He was vice president of the Gorbachev Foundation in 1993 , and served as the director of Programs and Business Affairs for the State of the World Forum ( 2000 - 04 ) .
Hickman currently sits on the latter 's board of directors and in addition sits on the board of Wisdom University ( see below ) , and on the executive committee of Citizens Democracy Corps , " a non-profit organization that supports private sector development and economic growth in emerging and transitioning economies throughout the world " -- a group that is intimately enmeshed in the US government 's global democracy - manipulating activities .
Jim Garrison is the president of the Forum ; the convening chairman is Mikhail Gorbachev , and founding co-chairs of the first forum ( held in 1995 ) included leading liberal elites like Oscar Arias , Maurice Strong , Ted Turner , and Jane Goodall ( see " Jane Goodall 's Elite Monkey Business " ) .
Given Oscar Arias 's connection to Deepak Chopra ( see ( 15 ) ) , a leading proponent of " capitalist spirituality , " it is critical to draw attention to a significant link between the State of the World Forum and the Wisdom University .
This is because in 2005 Jim Garrison became president and chairman of Wisdom University , and both the other two board members of the State of the World Forum ( James Hickman and Caroline Myss ) happen to be the same three board members for Wisdom University ; given this overlap the following section will throw some much needed light on this ostensibly spiritual university .
Capitalist Spirituality for the New World Order
So what type of spiritual education is provided by the Wisdom University ?
Well , according to their Web site :
The average student enrolled at Wisdom University is a professional , with an established career and one or more advanced degrees .
They have come to the conclusion that they need deeper spiritual challenges in order to maintain momentum and meaning in their lives .
Our students soon discover that they can continue to grow spiritually and professionally at Wisdom University , thus combining spiritual nourishment with enhanced professional qualifications .
It appears that Wisdom University provides spiritual guidance for corporate and political elites who have lost their way ( and inner peace ) in the harsh capitalist , individualistic , secular world that they promote as the panacea for the world 's problems .
This form of globalized corporate spirituality is an important phenomenon .
Paul Heelas writes in his landmark book The New Age Movement ( Blackwell Publishers , 1996 ) how : " A significant number of New Agers have in fact moved beyond counter - cultural antagonism to the capitalistic mainstream .
Instead , they incorporate the creation of prosperity . "
( 16 ) This is what Jeremy Carrette and Richard King refer to in their book Selling Spirituality : The Silent Takeover of Religion ( Routledge , 2005 ) as " capitalist spirituality , " which they argue is " utilised to ' smooth out ' resistance to the growing power of corporate capitalism and consumerism . "
( 17 )
They write :
The interiorisation of spirituality and its location within the bounds of the modern , individual self emerged with the development of psychology in the late nineteenth century .
It became popularised , however , in the 1950s and 1960s with the rise of Humanistic Psychology ( particularly the work of [ Abraham ] Maslow ) , professional counselling , and psychedelic culture .
Having been cast as a private and psychological phenomenon , " spirituality " has gone through a second major shift in the 1980s .
This is the point at which the first privatisation -- involving the creation of individual , consumer - oriented spiritualities -- begins to overlap with an increasing emphasis upon a second privatisation of religion -- that is , the tailoring of spiritual teachings to the demands of the economy and of individual self - expression to business success .
This is no better illustrated than by the various self - improvement movements of the 1980s ... ( 18 )
Michael Parenti draws our attention to the activities of the arch - democracy - manipulator , Vaclav Havel , who " now promotes a sort of New Age spiritualism . "
Parenti points out how Havel has ...
... called for a new breed of political leader , who would rely less on " rational , cognitive thinking , " and show " humility in the face of the mysterious order of Being " and " trust in his own subjectivity as his principal link with the subjectivity of the world . "
We should have a " sense of transcendental responsibility , archetypal wisdom , " and the ability " to get to the heart of reality through personal experience . "
Havel lists the ecological dangers facing the world but denounces the idea of rational , collective social efforts to solve them .
He denounces democracy 's " traditional mechanisms " for being linked to " the cult of objectivity and statistical average . "
He thinks he is being visionary when in fact he is putting forth an elitist subjectivism and antidemocratic obscurantism . ( 19 )
As Steve Bruce noted in 2006 , " New Age spirituality would seem to be a strong candidate for the future of religion because its individualistic consumeristic ethos fits well with the spirit of the age . " ( 20 )
Returning to Wisdom University , in order to provide spiritual comfort to their already well - educated students the University employs fourteen faculty chairs " who teach and conduct research and other programs at Wisdom University . "
For instance , Caroline Myss , a " pioneer in the field of energy medicine and human consciousness , " is chair of Energy Medicine , while other chairs cover subjects as diverse as Sacred Dance and Interspecies Connections .
Yet , the one chair that seems particularly relevant to the topic of this essay is Barbara Marx Hubbard 's chair in Conscious Evolution . ( 21 )
Marilyn Ferguson recounts some of Hubbard 's achievements in the new age classic , The Aquarian Conspiracy : Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980s ( Paladin Books , 1982 ) :
In 1967 , Barbara Marx Hubbard , a futurist moved by [ Pierre ]
Teilhard 's vision of evolving consciousness , invited a thousand people around the world , including [ Abraham ]
Maslow 's network , to form a " human front " of those who shared a belief in the possibility of transcendent consciousness .
Hundreds responded , including Lewis Mumford and Thomas Merton .
Out of this grew a newsletter and later a loose - knit organization , the [ pro- space exploration group ]
Committee for the Future . ( p.59 )
Hubbard is well qualified to teach Conscious Evolution as she is the president of the Foundation for Conscious Evolution -- a group that has been " supported by major financial gifts from [ the late ] Laurance S. Rockefeller , " amongst others .
Furthermore , although not organized by Hubbard , Ferguson notes how in 1970 Lockheed Aircraft underwrote a meeting held at De Anza College in Cupertino , California , " that was the first group of scientists and physicians -- friends -- gathered in a public forum to assert their interest in spiritual realities and alternative approaches to health . "
She adds that within a few years similar meetings were taking place all over America , and the " Rockefeller , Ford , and Kellogg foundations funded programmes exploring the interface of mind and health . " ( 22 )
An important person working alongside Barbara Marx Hubbard at the Foundation for Conscious Evolution during the 1990s was Nancy Carroll , who served as the Foundation 's executive director from 1993 to 1999 .
Like Hubbard , Carroll happens to be a founding board member of a group called Women of Vision and Action -- a group whose advisory board includes people like Maurice Strong 's wife , Hanne Strong , and Alison Van Dyk ( who is the chairman of the board and interim executive director at the Temple of Understanding at the United Nations ) .
Here it is interesting to return to the fact that one of Hubbard 's most influential supporters at the Foundation for Conscious Evolution was David Rockefeller 's brother , Laurance Rockefeller .
This is noteworthy as Rockefeller dynasties activities have long provided fertile grounds for one world government conspiracy theorists ( for example , in 1952 Emanuel Josephson published his book Rockefeller , ' Internationalist ' : The Man Who Misrules the World ) .
Ironically Laurance Rockefeller is directly involved in funding research that advocates the legitimacy of some phenomena often categorised as conspiracy theories .
Writing in 2002 , Leslie Kean , an investigative reporter and producer with Pacifica Radio , noted that " a study about to be published [ on crop circles ] by a team of scientists and funded by Laurance Rockefeller concludes ' it is possible that we are observing the effects of a new or as yet undiscovered energy source . ' "
This funding of what in many circles is considered to be non-academic research is not however an anomaly , as for instance Laurance Rockefeller has also supported the research of the late professor of psychiatry John Mack ( formerly based at Harvard Medical School ) .
( 23 ) Indeed , John Mack , shortly before publishing his book , Abduction : Human Encounters with Aliens ( Charles Scribner , 1994 ) , with funding provided by Laurance Rockefeller , founded the Program for Extraordinary Experience Research .
Thus the very family that is considered to be at the heart of the one world government conspiracies ( the Rockefellers ) is involved in promoting research that encourages the public to believe in theories that more sceptical people consider to be conspiratorial . ( 24 )
A significant observation is that Hubbard 's spiritual work is complemented by her pro-space exploration activities , which saw her provide financial assistance to a group called the L5 Society , a group that was formed in 1975 and later merged ( in 1987 ) with the National Space Institute to form the National Space Society .
More recently , Hubbard provided the " inspiration " that ( in 2005 ) helped launch the Council for the Future -- a joint project of three leading space advocacy groups : the Space Frontier Foundation , the National Space Society , and the Mars Society .
According to their Web site :
The Council [ for the Future ] is shaping an Earth / Space / Human Development Agenda .
The Council is also shaping a new social meme or world view that is consistent with that Agenda .
As part of the meme , there is full agreement as to the imperative of extending human civilization into space , and that logical coherent steps must be taken in the very near term to facilitate that accomplishment .
Hubbard sits on the Council for the Future 's board of directors alongside Rick Tumlinson .
Tumlinson is linked to Walter Anderson , one of the world 's leading capitalists who plans to colonize space and profit from an imperialist space agenda .
Tumlinson is the executive director and cofounder of the ominously named Foundation for the International Nongovernmental Development of Space , a group that was launched with $ 5 million from Anderson .
Anderson backed the Roton project that aimed to make space travel " affordable . "
In 1991 he funded the establishment of the Space Frontier Foundation .
This foundation 's advisory board includes a representative from the Center for Enterprise in Space , and a variety of popular authors including the late Arthur C. Clarke of 2001 : A Space Odyssey fame .
Like Hubbard , Clarke happened to be a member of the Club of Budapest , whose efforts to promote a form of spirituality that can overcome all geographic and cultural divides appears to be highly suited to the homogenizing practices of corporate - led globalization and the defeat of democracy .
Hubbard 's direct affiliations to other liberal corporate globalizers are strong , and in 1966 she helped cofound the World Future Society -- current board members of this group include amongst others , Maurice Strong , and the former US secretary of defense and subsequent Ford Foundation president , Robert McNamara .
In addition , until recently the well - known corporate futurists Alvin Toffler and his wife , Heidi Toffler , sat alongside the late Arthur C. Clarke on the World Future Society 's global advisory council .
Hubbard 's ties to corporate - backed futurists does not bode well for her involvement in teaching any form of emancipatory lessons in higher consciousness at Wisdom University .
As Murray Bookchin observed :
The radical thrust of utopian thinking , as exemplified by [ Charles ] Fourier , has been transmuted by academics , statisticians , and " game theorists " into a thoroughly technocratic , economistic , and aggressive series of futuramas that can be appropriately designated as " futurism . "
However widely at odds utopias were in their values , institutional conceptions , and visions ( whether ascetic or hedonistic , authoritarian or libertarian , privatistic or communistic , utilitarian or ethical ) , they at least had come to mean a revolutionary change in the status quo and a radical critique of its abuses .
Futurism , at its core , holds no such promise at all .
In the writings of such people as Herman Kahn , Buckminster Fuller , Alvin Toffler , John O'Neill , and the various seers in Stanford University 's " think tanks , " futurism is essentially an extrapolation of the present into the century ahead , of " prophecy " denatured to mere projection .
It does not challenge existing social relationships and institutions , but seeks to adapt them to seemingly new technological imperatives and possibilities -- thereby redeeming rather than critiquing them .
The present does not disappear ; it persists and acquires eternality at the expense of the future .
Futurism , in effect , does not enlarge the future but annihilates it by absorbing it into the present .
What makes this trend so insidious is that it also annihilates the imagination itself by constraining it to the present , thereby reducing our vision -- even our prophetic abilities -- to mere extrapolation .
( 25 )
Like the aims of the Club of Budapest , Hubbard 's work appears better geared towards constraining new thought to the stifling confines of capitalist prerogatives .
This makes it especially ironic that Hubbard is a member of the Leadership Council of the Association for Global New Thought .
The Association 's executive director , Barbara Fields Berstein -- who also serves on the board of Hubbard 's Foundation for Conscious Evolution -- is the former co-director of Harvard University 's Global Negotiation Network 's Abraham Path Initiative .
This affiliation is significant because , as recounted in the article , " Alternative Dispute Resolution or Revolution , " the activities promoted by the Global Negotiation Network 's work are indicative of the type of strategies that the corporate and political elites zealously promote to boost global corporate equity , not human equality .
Finally , it is interesting to point out that Berstein is a board member of EarthAction , another project that is linked to Harvard University 's Alternative Dispute Resolution network through the head of their Global Negotiation Project , William Ury ( who serves on the advisory board of EarthAction ) .
Consequently , given its key role in attempting to catalyse the formation of a one world government , the following section will explore the background of this group .
Global Action to " Save the Earth "
The background of EarthAction returns us more concretely to the elite agenda for propagating a one world government .
Formed in 1992 at the UN Conference on Environment and Development , or Earth Summit ( which was presided over by Secretary General Maurice Strong ) , EarthAction now boasts that its work encompasses more than 2,600 civil society organizations from 165 countries , making it the " world 's largest network of organizations , policymakers , citizens and journalists that work together for a more just , peaceful and sustainable world . "
The president and executive director of EarthAction , Lois Barber , formerly served as the creative director of the World Future Council Initiative . ( 26 ) This initiative , which was launched in late 2004 , led to the creation of the World Future Council , a group whose founder and first president , Jakob von Uexkull , also serves as a board member of EarthAction .
( 27 ) Uexkull is most famous among progressive circles as being the founder of Right Livelihood Award , but amongst his other responsibilities he serves on the Council of Governance of the democracy - manipulating group Transparency International , and is a patron of Friends of the Earth International .
Due to the integral role played by Barber in launching the World Future Council it is worth initially exploring their background before returning to EarthAction .
Thus , according to their Web site the Council " considers itself the global advocate for the concerns of future generations in international politics . "
The World Future Council is comprised of 50 personalities from around the world , whose mission is to " inform and educate policy makers and opinion leaders about the challenges facing future generations while providing them with practical solutions . "
Council members include progressive activists like Vandana Shiva to one - worlders like Tony Colman , who is the chair of One World Trust ( a group that was formed in 1951 as the " charitable arm " of the All - Party Parliamentary Group on World Government ) .
( 28 ) Beside board chair Jakob von Uexkull , the only other board members of the World Future Council are the " world market leader for private islands , " Farhad Vladi , and Alexandra Wandel , who is the former European trade and sustainability programme coordinator of Friends of the Earth International .
Between 1999 and 2006 Wandel had coordinated European NGO activities at the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conferences , and acted as an advisor to the then EU Commissioner Pascal Lamy ( now the director general of the World Trade Organization ) on behalf of the major European environmental NGOs .
Returning to EarthAction , the next member of their seven - person - strong board of directors is Anne Zill .
In 1974 , Zill co-founded two reformist projects , the Women 's Campaign Fund ( to " support pro-choice women for elected office " ) and the Fund for Constitutional Government ( which is a philanthropic foundation that is " dedicated to the exposure and correction of corruption in the United States federal government . " )
Zill is currently the president of the latter Fund for Constitutional Government . ( 29 ) The group 's chairperson , Russell Hemenway , is linked to four controversial organizations : he is the chair of the Center for National Security Studies , a trustee of the Fund for Peace , a board member of the National Security Archive ( for further details see " Coopting Intellectual Aggressors " ) , and he is a board member of the Population Institute -- a group which is presided over by the influential neo-Malthusian , William Ryerson .
The Fund for Constitutional Government is based on the first floor of 122 Maryland Avenue in the home of their former board member , the late Stewart Mott .
Like Hemenway , Stewart Mott formerly aided the work of the neo-Malthusian Population Institute by serving on their public advisory committee .
The Stewart R. Mott Charitable Trust -- of which Stewart Mott was president -- is also based at 122 Maryland Avenue ; but more significantly this philanthropic trust shares the same executive director as the Fund for Constitutional Government ( his name is Conrad Martin ) .
Given Mott 's powerful influence on liberal activism it is worth highlighting that :
Liberal philanthropy runs in the Mott family , and Stewart Mott 's father was Charles Steward Mott , the founder of the Charles Steward Mott Foundation -- a foundation on which his younger sister , Maryanne Mott , presently serves as a board member .
Like many other liberal foundations , the Charles Steward Mott Foundation describes its role as existing to " support efforts that promote a just , equitable and sustainable society , " a mission statement that belies reality .
Indeed , a good case can be made that elite liberal philanthropy helps sustain capitalism rather than promote equitable alternatives to it .
Ironically , this contradiction is not something that the Charles Steward Mott Foundation attempts to hide , as their Web site demonstrates that one of the many groups that they have provided funding to is the notorious democracy manipulator , the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) .
( 30 ) The Foundation 's openness about being connected to a group that carries out the work that the CIA once undertook covertly is not surprising : this is because groups like the NED and Charles Steward Mott Foundation can rely upon the fact that the mainstream media ( and even progressive alternative media ) will do little to critique their ostensibly progressive credentials .
This partly explains why the CIA transferred many of their formerly covert democracy - manipulating activities to the overt interventions that are now undertaken by the NED .
The adoption of such transparency by all manner of democracy - manipulating groups helps explain why EarthAction board member Ellen Miller can comfortably sit alongside NED board member Esther Dyson on the five - person - strong board of the Sunlight Foundation , with no questions asked by the global media . ( 31 )
The most interesting ( and progressive ) EarthAction board member is Jackie Smith , who is an associate professor at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies ( an institute that , problematically , is a member of the " humanitarian " Save Darfur Coalition ) .
For many years Smith 's work has documented the importance of the World Social Forum , and one of her most recent books ( co- authored with Marina Karides ) is titled Global Democracy and the World Social Forums ( Paradigm Publishers , 2007 ) .
This book includes a short section that examines a report made to the Trilateral Commission in 1975 called The Crisis of Democracy -- a report suggesting , as Smith and Karides surmise , that the global " problems we face are not attributed to faulty economic reasoning and corporate profiteering but [ instead ] to the influence of ' nonexpert ' citizens on economic and social policy decisions . "
In the spirit of plutocratic governance , Smith and Karides point out that the report recommends that " governments should encourage political passivity so that prevailing excessive citizen democratic participation can be reduced . " ( pp. 8 - 9 ) Referring to Holly Sklar 's edited book Trilateralism : The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World Management ( South End Press , 1980 ) , Smith and Karides acknowledge that " David Rockefeller , president of the Chase Manhattan Bank , founded the Trilateral Commission in 1973 . "
Yet despite making this anti-democratic connection , Smith and Karides fail to draw attention to David Rockefeller 's efforts to manipulate civil society through his liberal philanthropy ; i.e. , via the influential Rockefeller Foundation .
This omission is concerning given the controversial support that the World Social Forum has obtained from some of the world 's most powerful liberal foundations . ( 32 )
Smith and Karides describe Francisco ( Chico ) Whitaker as " one of the prime movers of the forum from its inception , " so it is fitting that he should be a council member of the aforementioned World Future Council .
That said , although they fail to critique the influence of liberal philanthropy , they do write :
Particularly contentious is the claim by Chico Whitaker that the forum is simply a space , one without a pyramidal politics or power relations .
In fact , however , the WSF does have its pyramids of power .
April Biccum , for example , contends that it would be naïve to assume " that the open space is space without struggle , devoid of politics and power . "
Many of these struggles revolve around the organization of the forum in general and the role of the International Council ( IC ) , the association of 150 nonelected organizations and intellectuals that decide where the global forums are held and how they are to be organized .
Many grassroots activists have criticized the IC , as well as local and regional organizing committees , for acting precisely as a closed space of representation and power , limited to certain prominent international organizations and networks with access to information and sufficient resources to travel .
( p. 38 )
Unfortunately , Smith and Karides do not delve any deeper into the issue , and are content in noting that while some groups critique the " closed and , at least at the time , nontransparent " nature of the forum , others like Immanuel Wallerstein have " argued , [ that ] the WSF could not function without an organization , one that is hierarchical , has power , and makes decisions . " ( p. 39 ) Here it should be noted that Wallerstein , who has long been an influential scholar of the Left , is a member of the Network Institute for Global Democratization , a group whose six - person - strong board of directors includes Jackie Smith .
Moreover , problematically , the former chair of this network , Teivo Teivainen ( 2001 - 02 and 2005 - 06 ) , has in the past been supported by an assortment of liberal foundations , including both the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation . ( 33 ) Most recently , while working at the Network Institute for Global Democratization , Teivainen co-wrote the briefing paper ( with Heikki Patomaki ) for the Ford Foundation - supported project " Elements for a Dialogue on Global Political Party Formations " -- a project that was successfully launched in late 2005 . ( 34 ) That said , Teivainen 's previous seemingly uncritical relations with the foundation world may soon become a relic of the past , as since 2007 he has served on the international advisory board of the radical academic journal Critical Sociology ( formerly the Insurgent Sociologist ) .
This is particularly significant because in May 2007 Joan Roelofs guest edited a special issue of Critical Sociology ( along with Daniel Faber and Robert Arnove ) that provided one of the most up - to - date critical examinations of the problems associated with liberal philanthropy .
Roelofs concludes her contribution to this issue by noting how the evidence demonstrates ...
... that the pluralist model of civil society obscures the extensive collaboration among the resource - providing elites and the dependent state of most grassroots organizations .
While the latter may negotiate with foundations over details , and even win some concessions , capitalist hegemony ( including its imperial perquisites ) cannot be questioned without severe organizational penalties .
By and large , it is the funders who are calling the tune .
This would be more obvious if there were sufficient publicized investigations of this vast and important domain .
That the subject is " off- limits " for both academics and journalists is compelling evidence of enormous power . ( 35 )
The final EarthAction board member to be examined here is Jan Roberts , a Florida - based psychotherapist who in 1995 helped found Michael Lerner 's Foundation for Ethics and Meaning -- a group that aims to " encourage a holistic and community spirit of caring that promotes tolerance , justice , and reconciliation . "
( Lerner is most famous for being the editor of Tikkun magazine ) .
Most significant is that in July 1999 Roberts became involved in the Earth Charter movement when she attended a small conference held in Italy on " Spirituality and Sustainability " ( co-sponsored by St. Thomas University in Florida and the Center for Respect of Life and the Environment ) .
Roberts then became involved with promoting the Earth Charter in the United States , and in 2000 Mikhail Gorbachev invited her to attend the June launch of the Earth Charter campaign at The Hague Peace Palace .
( 36 ) Gorbachev along with Maurice Strong had played a key role in " develop[ing ] " the Earth Charter as a " civil society initiative " -- a process that had begun in 1994 working through organizations they each founded ( Green Cross International and Earth Council respectively ) . ( 37 )
As a result of these and other elite meetings , in 2005 Roberts founded Earth Charter U.S. , and she presently acts as an advisor to Earth Charter International , serving alongside environmentalists like Herbert Girardet ( see footnote # 27 ) , " humanitarian " activists like Bianca Jagger ( who is also a member of the Club of Budapest ) , and other assorted environmental capitalists like Amory Lovins . ( 38 )
The four - person - strong advisory council of EarthAction bolsters EarthAction 's one world government credentials .
As mentioned above , one member is William Ury , but others include Nicholas Dunlop , Robert Johansen , and Michael Shuman .
Dunlap , in addition to being a member of the World Future Council , is the co-founder and secretary general of the e-Parliament , and former secretary general of Parliamentarians for Global Action .
Johansen is a council member of e-Parliament , and a fellow of the World Federalist Institute ; however , Shuman , a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies , appears to be involved in research that runs counter to one world government trends .
For instance , Shuman recently published the book The Small - Mart Revolution : How Local Businesses Are Beating the Global Competition ( Berrett - Koehler , 2006 ) .
That said , the Web site Small - Mart.org that developed as a result of the book is funded through grants from two major liberal foundations , the W. K. Kellogg Foundation and the controversial Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
Possible Scenarios for the Future
This article has suggested that there are many long - range projects and trends that provide the institutional basis for creating a corporate - driven one world government , or new world order .
The advent of the most recent global crisis of capitalism means that the time has now come when the citizens of the world need to decide what type of alternative forms of governance will rise in the wake of the crisis .
William I. Robinson , a professor of sociology at the University of California , Santa Barbara , suggests that there are five possible responses to the current structural crisis of global capitalism .
These are : ( 1 ) the advent of global neo-Keynesianism , ( 2 ) the resurgence of the Left , ( 3 ) a recoiling into national protectionism , ( 4 ) a move toward 21st century fascism , and ( 5 ) a global collapse , and the possible degeneration into global warlordism .
( 39 ) Robinson notes that he " is not predicting any one of these five happening , " and he suggests that they " are not mutually exclusive . "
For example , he points out that you could envisage a scenario where there is " right wing neo -Keynesianism involving very authoritarian structures . "
The creeping threat of fascism ( on a global level ) is a real and present danger , ( 40 ) but this article has been predominantly concerned with tracing a small part of the development of the structures needed to coordinate a one world government , or in Robinson 's terms , " a global neo -Keynesianism ... to save capitalism from itself and from potential radical challenges from below . "
Thus with regard to the current crisis it is fitting to cite Robinson at length on the potential of this response .
He notes that :
[ T ]he first signs we are seeing of this are of the Obama Administration putting forward a reformist neo-Keynesianism type project .
But we can also see how the transnational elites became split in the late twentieth , early 21st century , and one wing started arguing for this global neo-Keynesianism , global reformism ...
We see reregulation , and we see a return of state intervention to regulate and resuscitate , and organize capitalist accumulation including stimuli's and bailouts and so forth .
And possibly we will see -- this is just speculation -- the states out for this option trying to ferment a shift back from financial to productive accumulation .
And I would say though that if this option is to be viable , any new deal must be global .
Given the extent of global integration ... to talk about a new New Deal , or a neo -Keynesianism project in one country is not realistic at all ...
We can't talk about anything other than a global neo-Keynesianism ...
This scenario faces a major contradiction , and it's that we have a globalizing economy with a nation - state based political system .
I always emphasise that .
So transnational state apparatus are incipient , they are unable to impose any regulation on the global economy ....
Transnational elites recognize this problem .
If they want to implement the global neo-Keynesianism they have to set up transnational institutions to actually regulate and organize it .
So in the G - 20 meeting late last year , British prime minister Gordon Brown said " We now have global financial markets , global corporations , global financial flows , but what we do not have is anything other than national and regional regulations and supervision .
We need a global way of supervising our financial system .
We need very large and very radical political institutional changes . " ( 41 )
However , while Gordon Brown downplays the existing mechanisms of international governance outlined in this article , it is apparent that the transnational networks and institutions needed to coordinate a global neo-Keynesianism have already been created .
Such institutions represent a real and present danger to global democracy , and so it is fitting to note how Robinson ends his talk on an optimistic note as the current financial crisis " opens up space for social forces from below and collective agency to influence the course of history in ways that are not possible in times of equilibrium and stable government . "
He continues , this " opens up new opportunities for change and for new ideas to flourish , " as " the future is never predetermined . "
The " future is open to us , " and how we respond to this crisis will determine whether the antidemocratic forces pushing the neo-Keynesianism One World Government agenda will win out , or NOT ( as I am hopeful that the case will be ) .

He adds that : " Among the notables associated then or later with world federalism were , from the literary world , John Hersey , Lewis Mumford , Robert Sherwood , Edna Ferber , Sinclair Lewis , Clifford Odets , Edna St. Vincent Millay , Upton Sinclair , James Thurber , and E. B . White ; from government , politics , and the military : Supreme Court Justices Owen Roberts and William O. Douglas , Thomas K. Finletter ( who would serve as Truman 's secretary of the air force ) , Chester Bowles ( governor of Connecticut ) , John Winans ( the Republican governor of New Hampshire ) , Senator J. William Fulbright , and two future senators ( Alan Cranston and Harris Wofford ) ; from business and finance , W. T. Holliday ( president of Standard Oil of Ohio ) , Beardsley Ruml ( chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ) , Harry Bullis ( president of General Mills ) , Grenville Clark ( a prominent former Wall Street lawyer ) , and Robert Gaylord ( chairman of the executive committee of the National Association of Manufacturers ) ; from the media , numerous magazine and newspaper editors , most prominently Norman Cousins , the editor of Saturday Review . "
In May 1947 , Cord Meyer became the first president of the United World Federalists and served in this position until 1951 when he decided to leave to join the US government 's Central Intelligence Agency ( where he stayed until his retirement in 1977 ) .

2 . The Foundation for World Government , which was founded in 1948 , was managed by Stringfellow Barr , a director of Federal Union and vice president of United World Federalists , who served as the Foundation 's president from its founding year until 1958 .
Baratta observes that : " Most of its work took place in brilliant seminars led by Scott Buchanan and in funded studies that resulted in rather unsuccessful books prepared in the early Cold War in such new fields as functional economic and social cooperation , Gandhian nonviolence , individual educational field work anticipatory of the future Peace Corps , world development corporations like the new World Bank or future U.N. Development Programme , statecraft on the models of the Fabian Society and the World Zionist Organization , world citizenship following French , not American , models , a federation of the federalists leading to the establishment of a world federalist political party , and university institutes for world federation to conduct the intellectual research and publication necessary to guide humanity through a very long struggle toward the necessary government of the whole . " ( p.397 ) Incidentally , Barr later served as a fellow at Robert Maynard Hutchins ' Ford Foundation - funded Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions from 1964 until 1969 ( for further critical information on this group see " Social Engineering , Progressive Media , and William Benton " ( pdf ) ) .
Anita McCormick
Blaine 's family fortunes ( which led to the creation of the Foundation for World Government ) were derived from her grandfather Cyrus McCormick , and her father , Cyrus Jr. ; the former headed " the boardroom when workers struck the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company -- which led to the bloody Haymarket demonstrations in 1886 -- blacklisted employees who dared have ties to labor groups . "
Likewise , his son Cyrus Jr. , " irate over strikes and walkouts during his reign from 1902 to 1919 , refused to recognize his employees ' unions . "
Soon after the death of Anita ( in 1954 ) a new philanthropic body called the New World Foundation was formed , and under the guidance of Ann Blaine ( Nancy ) Harrison ( 1954 - 77 ) " New World awarded grants to large numbers of labor groups -- from the United Woodcutters Services to the Fresno Organizing Project . "
Nancy was the wife of the " typical Cold - War , anti-communist liberal " Gilbert Harrison , who was the editor of The New Republic from the late fifties to the mid-seventies .
Regarding more contemporary theorizers of world federalism , Baratta writes : " The primary focus of the world order school of thought led by Saul Mendlovitz and Richard A. Falk , who were originally inspired by [ Grenville ] Clark and [ Louis ] Sohn , is on this transition [ of incremental U.N. reform ] , which they realistically call the ' struggle of the oppressed . '
A similar approach at time of writing is the 20 - 40 year program ' Global Action to Prevent War , ' led by Jonathan Dean , Randall Forsberg , and Saul Mendlovitz . " ( p.16 ) Backtracking again , it is worth recognizing that in 1960 Grenville Clark founded the World Law Fund , and four years later launched a " multinational project that became known as the World Order Models Project " ( whose founding director was Mendlovitz ) ; to this day , Baratta note , the World Policy Institute has " carried on this [ projects ] work " ( p.508 ) .
According to the Institutes most recent online annual report ( 2004 - 05 ) , notable members of their advisory board include State of the World Forum ( see later ) co-chair Oscar Arias , the editor of The Nation magazine , Katrina vanden Heuvel , and Henry Arnhold ( who also happens to be a board member of the controversial " environmental " group Conservation International ) .
Baratta states that other organizations that " were founded at least in part by former world federalists include : the Committee on a Sane Nuclear Policy ( SANE ) ( Norman Cousins , 1957 ) , Members of Congress for Peace through Law ( Senator Joseph S. Clark , 1959 ) , Institute for International Order ( Harry Hollins , 1960 ) , Coalition on National Priorities and Military Policy ( Joseph Clark , 1969 ) , the International Peace Academy ( Ruth Young , 1970 ) , the U.N. Special Committee on the Charter and on Strengthening the Role of the Organization ( Carlos Romulo , 1974 ) , and Parliamentarians for World Order ( Nicholas Dunlop , 1978 ) . " ( p.511 ) ( back )
3 . Other sympathetic elites like Anne- Marie Slaughter suggest that " world government is both infeasible and undesirable . "
Slaughter draws our attention to what she calls " the globalization paradox .
We need more government on a global and a regional scale , but we do n't want the centralization of decision - making power and coercive authority so far from the people actually to be governed .
It is the paradox identified in the European Union by Renaud Dehousse and by Robert Keohane in his millennial presidential address to the American Political Science Association .
The European Union has pioneered ' regulation by networks , ' which Dehousse describes as the response to a basic dilemma in EU governance : ' On the one hand , increased uniformity is certainly needed ; on the other hand , greater centralization is politically inconceivable , and probably undesirable . '
The EU alternative is the ' transnational option ' -- the use of an organized network of national officials to ensure ' that the actors in charge of the implementation of Community policies behave in a similar manner . ' "

Marking a rare event for a progressive writer , Terrence Paupp in his book Exodus From Empire : The Fall of America 's Empire and the Rise of the Global Community ( Pluto Press , 2007 ) notes how " [ David ]
Rockefeller , a banker and an oilman , represented an era and a coalition of interests that had little concern for the fact that their policies were devastating the Global Community and most of the people who were trying to survive within it . " ( p. 219 ) Moreover Paupp is well aware of the Orwellian practices of such democracy - manipulating elites : for a start he refers to William I. Robinson 's book Promoting Polyarchy , noting : " While US policy is more ideologically appealing under the title of democracy promotion , it does nothing to reverse the growth of inequality and the undemocratic nature of global decision making . " ( p. 90 ) Later Paupp refers to James Petras 's work on the manipulation of non-governmental organizations , observing how " neoliberal elites of the North have sought to contract nonprofit voluntary associations ( NGOs ) and convert them into their agents as strategic partners " to promote their agenda of " good governance " that " has nothing to do with democracy or human rights . "
( p.297 ) He continues that " these efforts are designed to demobilize social movements , " because : " If social movements succeed in their radical opposition , there will not be a reform of the system , but rather a replacement of it . " ( p. 299 ) The problem then is not that Paupp does not recognise that elites systematically manipulate civil society , which he does , but that he fails to see how many of those same elites ( most notably Rockefeller ) are also the same people most zealously promoting the global governance agenda that Paupp identifies as a potential solution to elite manipulation .

5. According to their Web site , Citizens for Global Solutions " was a leading supporter of a treaty to create an International Criminal Court , culminating in the creation of the treaty in Rome , August , 1998 , where World Federalists played a key leadership role in organizing backing for the ICC by the NGO community .

6. Elaine Dewar 's book , Cloak of Green : The Links between Key Environmental Groups , Government and Big Business ( Lorimer , 1995 ) , contains a wealth of critical information on Maurice Strong ( based on an interview she undertook with him over two days ) .
For instance , Dewar writes : " Maurice Strong opened many doors for me in Geneva , doors I would never have thought to go through on my own .
He seemed to want me to understand the full range of his works , to see how he managed complex and interrelated groups , how he managed the PGOs , the GOPs , the business lobbies , and all the other groups calling themselves NGOs who were coming to the Rio Summit , for example .
He clearly considered them political levers he could use to exert public pressure on national governments on their own turf - without being seen to do so .
It seemed to me this was a brilliant and subtle variation of Mackenzie King 's gift to the Rockefellers -- the concept of a company union .
One scholarly American commentator on King 's work had described these unions as ' fake organizations , ' but had also been forced to acknowledge that they endured and benefitted the industrial interests who used them for many years .
Similarly , these GOPs and PGOs - private government organizations - endured : like weeds they pushed out true grassroots groups , since they took money , policy or both from governments and large corporate donors .
It did n't matter that they had few members : they had means .
Through constant publishing and promotion they set the margins for public debate .
They pushed ideas out in public where governments had to acknowledge them .
They promoted the Agenda Strong wanted set . " ( p. 296 )

Among his numerous affiliations , liberal democracy - manipulator George Soros is a member of the board of sponsors of a think tank called the Center for War / Peace Studies , which has close relations with a number of world federalists -- like fellow sponsor , John Anderson ( who is the former president of Citizens for Global Solutions ) .
In addition , the Center 's executive director , Lucy Law Webster , is the first vice chair of the council of the World Federalist Movement , a steering committee member of the World Federalist Institute , and is president of the New York Tri-State chapter of Citizens for Global Solutions .

" Establishment decentralization is presented as a rational choice made by central governments or strongly encouraged by international agencies -- usually the World Bank or USAID .
In this conservative and bureaucratic form of decentralization , local government is transformed from being a direct provider of services to a facilitator .
Much first world decentralization is also driven by conservative attempts to downsize government support for the poor and to diminish the public sector , all under the slogan of the ' post - welfare agenda ' .
As Joel Samoff has noted , such approaches use the language of ' service delivery , ' ' efficiency , ' and ' cost recovery . '
The Kerala experiment [ in India ] by contrast promotes popular democracy as an alternative to conservative decentralization . "

Peres presently serves on the advisory board of two important democracy - manipulating organizations , the Project on Justice in Times of Transition and the Forum 2000 Foundation .
While I have summarized the work of the first group elsewhere , the second group , which was founded in 1996 by well established democracy - manipulators Vaclav Havel , Yohei Sasakawa , and Elie Wiesel , is currently headed by Oldrich Cerny -- an individual who also serves as the executive director of the free - market think tank the Prague Security Studies Institute .

11 . The Tony Blair Faith Foundation was founded in 2008 by Tony Blair , an individual who should be " tried for war crimes " according to the Nobel prize - winning playwright ( and One World Action patron ) Harold Pinter .
Thus in an utter act of hypocrisy Blair 's foundation states that it " aims to promote respect and understanding about the world 's major religions and show how faith is a powerful force for good in the modern world . "
Given Blair 's track record it seems more likely that his foundation will be working to ensure that the world 's major religions defer to the power of capitalism ( that is , financial plunders like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs International ) .
This seems especially likely considering that soon after leaving the British government Blair became a part - time adviser to JPMorgan Chase , and started lecturing at the Yale Center for Faith & Culture ( whose advisory board includes the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International , Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach , who formerly served as Margaret Thatcher 's special advisor , and is a patron of the Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust -- which was founded by " humanitarian " warrior Baroness Cox ) .
Here it is significant that the Jewish member of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation 's advisory council is Rabbi David Rosen , the director of the American Jewish Committee 's Department for Interreligious Affairs , and an honorary president of the International Council of Christians and Jews .
The sole patron of the latter group is Sir Sigmund Sternberg ; while other honorary presidents , aside Rosen , include the likes of Richard von Weizsacker ( who is the former president of the Federal Republic of Germany and a member of the Club of Budapest ) .

Here it is interesting that Blu Greenberg also serves as a co-chair of the Global Peace Initiative of Women ; this is because her husband , Rabbi Irving Greenberg is connected to the two " humanitarian " Jewish front groups that organized the cynical Save Darfur Coalition ( he served as chairman of the US Holocaust Memorial Council from 2000 until 2002 , and is a member of the American Jewish World Service 's advisory board ) .

15 .
In addition to serving as a co-chair of the State of the World Forum , Oscar Arias ( who has been the president of Costa Rica since 2006 ) is a member of the Club of Budapest , and is connected to many other globalist projects , the most interesting of which is perhaps the Alliance for the New Humanity .
Formed in 2003 , the Alliance aims to " create an alliance of people based on the awareness of humanity 's interconnectedness . "
They go on to note that they aim to create a " sustainable world , reflecting the unity of all humanity " ; and observe believe that : " If enough people shift their awareness toward social justice , human rights , and environmental sustainability , then injustice , oppression , and the destruction of the ecosystem can be stopped . "
To get an idea of the type of " humanitarian " activists who sat alongside Arias on the founding board of the Alliance for the New Humanity one could do well to look to Deepak Chopra : an individual who according to Jeremy Carrette and Richard King is one of the world 's leading proponents of " capitalist spirituality " and " ultimate ' feel - good ' spirituality for the affluent . "
In their detailed critique of his work Carrette and King cite the work of Susan Bridle , and here it is worth quoting her criticisms at length to get an idea of the type of activities the alliance is engaged in .
" Chopra promises that we can fulfil all our worldly desires , desires that the great wisdom traditions have repeatedly reminded us are the very source of endless suffering and ignorance -- desires for immortality , unlimited wealth and unending romance , all without having to struggle or make effort in any way ....
Rather than recognizing spiritual transformation as an ultimately demanding endeavor , as taught by the greatest sages , Chopra popularises the notion of an easy , feel - good spirituality , with no mention of the perennial spiritual imperatives of renunciation and one - pointed dedication .
And rather than emphasizing that true spiritual life is and has always been about the death of the ego , Chopra teaches us to bend the power of the infinite to our own will ....
Chopra 's brand of spirituality is like fast food ; while it seems to satisfy , it actually numbs the very hunger that inspires the spiritual quest in the first place . "

16 . With regard to two of the " most famous " spiritual centers , the Esalen Institute ( located at Big Sur , California , United States ) and Findhorn ( based in northeast Scotland -- the Findhorn Foundation ) , Heelas noted that since its founding , " the emphasis [ at Findhorn ] has tended to shift from counter - cultural Self actualization to a more harmonial relationship with prosperity .
... Turning to the United States , Esalen , founded in the same year ( 1962 ) as Findhorn , appears to have followed much the same trajectory " .
For example , Heelas cites a 1990 Fortune magazine article that reported how Laurance Rockefeller donated " $ 250,000 to convert the Big House ... into a corporate retreat " .
( p. 65 ) Later Heelas writes how " material from a variety of sources ( including interviews , magazine articles and TV programmes ) strongly suggests that the New Age is -- in measure -- drawn upon to restore the self of the go - getting individualist . " ( p. 147 ) In later 2008 he argues that " To overemphasize the case , I now argue that by and large commodification does not matter ( much ) . "
Adding that such commodification " does not invalidate the point that non-capitalist counter - currents are operative . " ( p.210 )

In addition to the aforementioned example of Deepak Chopra , other leading proponents of " spiritual capitalism " identified by Carrette and King are Osho Rajneesh , Jesper Kunde ( author of Corporate Religion ) , Rene Carayol and David Firth ( who co-wrote Corporate Voodoo ) and John Grant ( the author of The New Marketing Manifesto . ) ( p. 20 ) ( back )
18 . " One of the key thinkers to set the agenda for the psychology of religion was undoubtedly William James ( 1842-1910 ) , " however , Carrette and King acknowledge that : " While James can not be held responsible for the later utilisation of his thinking , the approach he adopted was captured by later generations enjoying the benefits of free - market spirituality , which celebrated the individual . "
They continue : " After James and the spiritualists , the focus on states of consciousness came to dominate the psychology of religion and paved the way for a spirituality of inner consciousness .
James , of course , did not bring about this transformation single - handedly , it was the development of his work by his followers , such as James Pratt ( 1875 - 1944 ) and , more specifically , a later generation of scholars including Gordon Allport ( 1897 - 1967 ) and Abraham Maslow ( 1908 - 70 ) , who propagated an individualised understanding of religion within North American culture .
It would be wrong to assume that these thinkers deliberately developed a psychology of religion for capitalism .
It is rather the case that their psychology emerged in a context of a North American economic climate that celebrated the individual pursuit of wealth .
Psychological ideologies flourished in such conditions .
Maslow 's psychology , for instance , did not reflect the Two - Thirds World or the land of his parents in Eastern Europe .
Rather , it was the psychology of an affluent society that could separate out a hierarchy of needs where ' spirituality ' could be separated from the basic needs of finding food , shelter and water to live .
The cumulative effect of this was the emergence of a religious experience tailored for wealthy individuals rather than for social justice . " ( pp. 69 - 71 ) ( back )

According to his official online biography : " Dr Mack 's efforts to bridge psychiatry and spirituality was compared by The New York Times to that of former Harvard professor William James .
Dr. Mack advocated that Western culture requires a shift away from a purely materialist worldview -- which he believed was largely responsible for the Cold War , the global ecological crisis , ethnonationalism and regional conflict -- towards a transpersonal worldview which could embrace some elements of Eastern spiritual and philosophical traditions which hold that we are all connected to one another . "
In an interview carried out by Joe Eich - Bonni , Mack noted : " In the critical , scientific world I think that slowly there are clinicians coming to see these people -- and there are many types of anomalous experiences -- near death , telekinesis , hauntings ; a whole realm of spooky paranormal and supernatural events that are increasingly being seen as part of the natural world -- as part of our basic reality .
By avoiding [ studying these anomalous events ] we do endless harm to our planet .
In a sense we have rid the planet of the entire spirit world and thereby have turned the whole earth into a marketplace of resources to be commandeered by the more aggressive among us . "

However , it should be noted that the promotion of these ideas by elite funders serves to distract attention from the real corporate powerbrokers .
Indeed , many people who are distrustful of their government ( and elites more generally ) spend years of their lives engaged in extraterrestrial research ( or readings ) often to the neglect of the terrestrial realm and worldly geopolitics -- that is , the events they can actually influence ( physically not just metaphysically ) .

Girardet 's first major environmental project was undertaken with self - sufficiency guru John Seymour , and after three years they produced a BBC series and the book Far From Paradise ( BBC Publications , 1986 ) , which examined the history of human impact on the environment .
The following year they both co-authored Blueprint for a Green Planet ( Dorling Kindersley , 1987 ) , which Girardet recalls was " one of the first books emphasising personal responsibility for countering environmental destruction through green consumerism . "
Given the natural sympathies of free - market environmentalism and the green consumerism propagated by this book , it is fitting to note that Girardet observed how the " publishers refused to include our final chapter , which linked personal decisions and the need for collective action . " ( back )

Of course , Chomsky is entitled to support causes that promote privacy , but he might reconsider uncritically allying himself alongside such groups that have clear connections to global democracy - manipulators .
 The head of Open The Government , Patrice McDermott , came to this position after serving as the deputy director of the Office of Government Relations for the American Library Association -- an association whose former president , Nancy Kranich , is the treasurer of both the aforementioned Center for National Security Studies and the National Security Archive .
However , before working in this position at the American Library Association McDermott served for eight years as the senior information policy analyst for OMB Watch .
The vice chair of OMB Watch , Ellen Miller , is the co-founder and executive director of the Sunlight Foundation , and like Anne Zill is a board member of Earth Action .
 The Project on Government Oversight ( POGO ) has a number of interesting environmental connections as David Hunter , the chair of their board is also a board member of EarthRights International ( a group whose Secretary is linked to those " humanitarian " warriors calling for an intervention in Darfur ) , while another POGO board member , Lisa Baumgartner Bonds , formerly served as vice president for communications for the free - market environmental group the World Wildlife Fund .
Finally , the most notable connection of the Government Accountability Project is their tie to One World Trust ( which was formed in 1951 as the " charitable arm " of the All - Party Parliamentary Group on World Government ) -- which lists them alongside groups like the World Federalist Movement and George Soros 's Open Society Institute as one of their partner organizations .

30 . Given the Charles Steward Mott Foundation 's tie to the National Endowment for Democracy it is noteworthy that Anne Zill is a board member of Women for Women International , a group that in 2003 obtained a single grant from the Endowment to promote ( rather manipulate ) democracy in Iraq .
( back )
31 . Ellen Miller is the co-founder and executive director of the Sunlight Foundation , a philanthropic body that aims to support groups that highlight government corruption .
Miller is the vice - chair of OMB Watch -- a group that " was formed in 1983 to lift the veil of secrecy shrouding the White House Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) " and is funded by numerous liberal foundations including the Ford Foundation , the Stewart R. Mott Charitable Trust , and the Open Society Institute .
Heather Hamilton a former manager of the Community Education Center at OMB Watch recently served as executive vice president of Citizens for Global Solutions .
Ellen Miller is also a board member of another reformist Ford Foundation funded nonprofit called Center for Responsive Politics .

32 . Liberal foundations have quietly insinuated their way into the heart of the global social justice movement , and played a key role in founding the World Social Forum ( WSF ) .
As a result of the lack of critical inquiry in to the influence of liberal philanthropy on progressive organizations it is not surprising that , when critiques of the WSF are made , they tend to be met with a resounding silence by progressive activists and their media ( most of which have been founded and funded by liberal foundations ) .
Writing in 2007 in a special issue of the journal Critical Sociology , the Research Unit for Political Economy astutely observes , the WSF " constitutes an important intervention by foundations in social movements internationally " because ( 1 ) many of the NGO 's attending the WSF obtain state and / or foundation funding , and ( 2 ) " the WSF 's material base -- the funding for its activity -- is heavily dependent on foundations . "
It is perhaps stating the obvious to note that more attention should be paid to such important critiques ; however , if further critical investigations then determined that such claims were unsubstantiated then the WSF could only be strengthened .
On the other hand , if activists collectively decided that the receipt of liberal foundation funding is problematic -- as happened at the 2004 WSF in Mumbai -- then further steps must be immediately taken to address the issue .
While Jackie Smith is loathe to personally mention the detrimental impact of liberal foundations on progressive social change , in a book she edited with Joe Bandy ( in 2005 ) , they include a chapter by Daniel Faber that explores this subject in depth .
He writes : " Foundation support plays a fundamental role in sustaining the environmental movement .
It is estimated that 5.4 percent , or $ 1.23 billion , of total foundation giving ( $ 22.8 billion ) went to the environment in 1999 .
The bulk of foundation funding , however , goes to a handful of the more politically moderate national environmental organizations .
...
In short , the foundation community is throwing its financial weight behind a sector of the movement governed largely by white , middle - to upper - class advocacy organizations without active memberships . "
Faber then continues by observing that : " In contrast , the foundation community as a whole neglects environmental justice .
In fact , given the high number of organizations and the large size of the constituencies being served , the environmental justice movement is currently one of the most underfunded major social movements in the country . "
However , rather than counsel environmental groups to remedy this problem by seeking more support from the public ( rather than elite foundations ) , Faber maintains that : " The long - term success of the ecology movement in general , and EJM in particular , depends on the reorientation of foundation priorities to support grassroots organizing and base - building strategies that democratically incorporate people into problem solving around the social and environmental ills that plague communities . "
Consequently given his resignation to the need for foundation support , Faber concludes by observing how : " The recent creation of the progressive - oriented Funders Network on Trade and Globalization and other foundation entities is beginning to address the disparities and assist the EJM in developing these capacities . "
How progressive the Funders Network on Trade and Globalization is from regular liberal foundation is debatable considering that it is a project of the Rockefeller Family Fund 's Environmental Grantmakers Association , and has a steering committee which is home to representatives from the major liberal foundations , i.e. , Lisa Jordan , who is the deputy director of the Global and Civil Society Unit at the Ford Foundation .

Intriguingly , in 1955 Immanuel Wallerstein obtained a Ford Foundation African Fellowship to complete " a dissertation that would compare the Gold Coast ( Ghana ) and the Ivory Coast in terms of the role voluntary associations played in the rise of the nationalist movements in the two countries . "
Furthermore , it is interesting that Wallerstein 's work was strongly influenced by the French historian Fernand Braudel , whose own research was well supported by the Ford Foundation funding .
These connections certainly deserve closer scrutiny , especially considering the strong historic ties that exist between the Ford Foundation and US foreign policy elites .
Indeed , now that more is known about the close alliances that existed between the leading liberal foundations and the CIA it would be interesting to revisit previous critiques of Wallerstein 's theories .
For example , in 1981 James Petras penned " Dependency and World System Theory : A Critique and New Directions , " Latin American Perspectives , 8 ( 3 - 4 ) , 1981 , pp. 148-155 .
In recent years , Petras has subjected the work of leading Leftist academics ( including Wallerstein ) to criticism , see his 2003 article " The Responsibility of the Intellectuals : Cuba , the U.S. and Human Rights . " ( back )
34 . Smith and Karides write : " Although some scholars and activists contend that global democracy requires the abolition of global governance institutions , others call for restructuring them , and possibly even forming a true world government in order to regulate the international economy so that it better responds to public needs .
...
While there have been a number of criticisms made of the WSF by activists , many see the WSF as an important instrument for preparing the public to participate actively within , and influence the decisions of , such institutions .
... Heikki Patomaki and Teivo Teivainen suggest that the WSF ' forms a loosely defined party of opinion ' from which global parties could emerge and wield influence on world politics .
Desire to create a more democratic global political economy could lead to greater support for global party formation at the WSF , despite many activists ' reservations about political parties . "
Later they report that : " According to the survey of participants at the 2005 WSF , the majority of respondents ( 68 percent ) think that a democratic world government would be a good idea , although only 29 percent of these think this is actually plausible . "
That said , they note how " although there is strong support for creating democratic global governance institutions among WSF participants , most activists prioritized local strategies for social change over global ones .
Sixty percent of all survey respondents indicated that the best approach to solving the problems created by global capitalism was to strengthen local communities , rather than strengthening nation - states or creating democratic global institutions . "

At this meeting John Hoyt was representing Earth Charter in the United States . ( back )
37 . With Mikhail Gorbachev acting as its founding president , Green Cross International was launched in April 1993 .
Green Cross 's current president and CEO , Alexander Likhotal , had previously worked at the Gorbachev Foundation as their international and media director .
Another notable member of Green Cross 's five - person - strong board of directors is the former president and prime minister of Portugal , Mario Soares , who is also a former president of the European Movement , serves as an honorary president of Socialist International , and sits on the international advisory committee of the NED 's Journal of Democracy .
Honorary board members of Green Cross represent environment elites from across the world , but their US representatives include Diane Meyer Simon ( see next ) , the actor Robert Redford ( who is a trustee of the free - market Natural Resources Defense Council ) , media mogul Ted Turner , and the former CEO of PBS , Pat Mitchell ( who is presently a board member of two NED - connected groups , Human Rights Watch and Internews ) .
Mitchell also served as the founding president of Global Green USA ( the American Arm of Green Cross International ) , while Diane Meyer Simon also helped found this group and is currently their president emerita .
In addition , Global Green USA includes a highly regarded Hollywood celebrity on their board , Leonardo DiCaprio , and so it is fitting that like Redford , DiCaprio is a trustee of the elitist Natural Resources Defense Council .
Maurice Strong 's Earth Council ( US ) was founded in 1990 , and their current president is Jan Hartke , who also acts as the chair of the Earth Restoration Corps ( which is run by Maurice 's wife , Hanne Strong ) .
On top of this , Hartke is the executive director of EarthVoice -- which is an affiliate of the Humane Society of the U.S. -- which was launched in 1991 by John Hoyt ( who then served as president of the Human Society ) .
Hoyt presently serves as vice - chair of Earth Restoration Corps , and is a commissioner of Earth Charter International .

38 . Earth Charter International 's council has three co-chairs : Steven Rockefeller ( United States ) , Razeena Wagiet ( South Africa ) , and Brendan Mackey ( Australia ) .
The son of the former vice president of the United States , Nelson Rockefeller , Steven Rockefeller is professor emeritus of religion at Middlebury College , and has served as a trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund for twenty - five years ( chairing the Fund 's board of trustees from 1998 to 2006 ) .
Steven is also a member of the World Commission on Global Consciousness and Spirituality 's Global Council on Planetary Ethics and Values , which is home to notables like Ervin Laszlo and Vaclav Havel .
The other two co-chairs of the Earth Charter council , like Steven , have similarly elitist backgrounds , as Wagiet has previously worked for WWF South Africa , and thereafter was " appointed as environmental adviser to the previous National Minister of Education , Professor Kader Asmal for four years ( 1999 -2003 ) " ; while Mackey co-chairs the World Conservation Union Ethics Specialist Group .

This section draws upon William I. Robinson 's recent lecture , " The Crisis of Global Capitalism , " January 28 , 2009 , The University of California , Santa Barbara .
In the online lecture , the five alternative scenarios for possible responses to the current crisis are discussed from minutes 38 until 53 .

40 . Robinson notes : " A forth response to the global crisis , and again I am not saying this is taking place , and this is not predictive , is what I call a 21st century fascism .
The confusion here when I raised this in discussion with colleagues and with critics is that when I say the term fascism they imagine that it has to look like 20th century fascism ...
We do n't go backwards in history , we are not going to see a new Nazism or Mussolinism : 21st century fascism would look very different , it is already looking very different where there are signs of this as a response as a project ...
The need for widespread organized systems of social control gives an impulse to the fascist response to this crisis . "

41 . Here it is important to recall the critical role that liberal foundations played in formulating the initial " New Deal . "
Joan Roelofs writes : " A major social analysis and program for reform , Recent Social Trends in the United States , was published in 1933 ( President 's Research Committee ) , initiated by President Hoover , organized by the SSRC , and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation .
It advocated metropolitan government and regional planning to replace obsolete local government structures , and new governance institutions , such as quasi - governmental and mixed public - private corporations .
Economic and social planning was proposed to cure the Depression , and the Social Science Research Council was deemed the appropriate planning institution .
The ' New Deal ' was largely created with such help , although '...
Roosevelt preferred to conceal the fact that so many of his major advisers on policy and some of his major programmes [ sic ] in social reform were the result of support by one or more of the private foundations ... ' "
Joan Roelofs , " Foundations and Collaboration , " Critical Sociology , 33 , 2007 , pp. 492-3 .
Similarly , the new " New Deal " that William I. Robinson refers to is likely to be influenced by so - called " green Keynesianism . "
This green Keynesianism is currently being promoted by the George Soros - funded Center for American Progress and the British - based New Economics Foundation -- the group that " led the first Other Economic Summit -- a fore - runner to the World Social Forum . "
Noted eco-socialist , John Bellamy
Foster is critical of such endeavours and he says that his " take on green Keynesianism is that it is much too limited in nature , and too technologically driven , to constitute the nucleus of a full economic recovery .
In fact , we are faced with a deep , long - lasting problem of economic stagnation and the crisis of financialization , as discussed in The Great Financial Crisis , which Keynesianism by its nature can do little to address ... [ W ] hat is currently needed is not an economic recovery plan or faster economic growth , but an ecological revolution .
This would necessarily be a social revolution , on a far more massive scale than anything yet imagined . " ( back )

On Obama ’s 100th day in office the House passed the budget with absolutely zero yes Republican votes , continuing their run as the party of NO .
In addition , John McCain boasted about voting against the confirmation of Kathleen Sebelius to be Secretary of Health and Human services on Twitter :
voted against Sebelius – already moving toward socialized car companies , we do n’t need socialized medicine !
What ’s ironic about this is that one of the things that is killing the US auto industry is the cost of providing health benefits for their retirees .
So if we had fixed our out - of - control and insanely expensive health insurance system , maybe the car companies would n’t have needed to get bailed out in the first place .
But what makes this even more ironic is McCain saying “ WE do n’t need socialized medicine ” .
McCain has been the beneficiary of this kind of health coverage all of his life .
He was born , after all , in a military hospital ( in Panama no less , but do any wing - nuts question his presidential qualifications ? ) , grew up getting all his care on military bases , then switched to getting Congressional health care from the government .
Gee , that “ socialized medicine ” must really be terrible !
I also need to point out the repeated false characterization of Obama ’s health care proposal as “ socialized medicine ” .
This is another case where the Republicans figure if they repeat something often enough , people will believe it .
Nobody is proposing socializing doctors or hospitals .
Obama is n’t even proposing a “ single - payer government - run system ” ( like they have in Canada or England ) .
So when McCain says “ WE ” he really means is “ I ’ve got mine ; the rest of you peasants can just rot . ”
Who needs a secretary of Health and Human services ?
I already get my free flu medicine from the government , who cares about you ?
Incidentally , I ’m very impressed that McCain is actually using Twitter .
Welcome to the innertubes !
And there is absolutely no truth to the rumor that his Twitter status is “ still a loser ” .
MUNICH — John Demjanjuk , the suspected Nazi death camp guard deported from the United States to face accusations of being accessory to the murder of 29,000 Jews and others , was transferred to a German prison today .
The retired Ohio autoworker arrived at Munich 's airport from Cleveland about 9:15 a.m. local time , 3:15 a.m. EST , aboard a private jet .
The plane taxied directly into a hangar , accompanied by police vehicles and an ambulance .
From there he was transported by ambulance , under police escort , to a special medical unit of the Stadelheim prison , where the 89 - year - old Demjanjuk , who is allegedly in poor health , will be examined by a doctor and formally arrested .
Previous coverage
If he is found fit to stand trial , it could bring to an end a more than three - decade saga of efforts to prosecute the Ukrainian - born Demjanjuk , who says he was a Red Army soldier , spent the war as a Nazi POW and never hurt anyone .
But Nazi-era documents obtained by U.S. justice authorities and shared with German prosecutors suggest otherwise .
They include a photo ID identifying Demjanjuk as a guard at the Sobibor death camp and saying he was trained at an SS facility for Nazi guards at Trawniki .
Both sites were in Nazi- occupied Poland .
Reached at his office in Jerusalem , Efraim Zuroff , director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Israel , praised U.S. and German authorities for bringing Demjanjuk in .
" I think this is an extremely important day for justice and the fact that Demjanjuk , who actively participated in the mass murder of 29,000 Jews at Sobibor , will be put to trial is of great significance and reinforces the message that the passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the murders , " he said .
Yet , the key to Demjanjuk 's fate may lie not with the evidence but rather with a German court 's decision about whether he is medically fit to stand trial .
In any case , Demjanjuk , who has been without a country since the U.S. stripped him of his citizenship in 2002 , is likely to spend the rest of his life here .
Germany 's main Jewish leader urged authorities to act quickly .
" It is a race against time , " Charlotte Knobloch , a Holocaust survivor , said in a statement .
" For survivors of the Shoa it is intolerable to watch how a suspected Nazi war criminal , who knew no mercy for his victims , seeks sympathy and compares his deportation to torture . "
Demjanjuk insists he is innocent and bitterly fought his deportation for nearly four years .
His case is a clear example of how difficult it has become to bring alleged Nazi war criminals to trial more than six decades since the end of World War II .
One of Demjanjuk 's German lawyers , Guenther Maull , told AP Television News on Monday that at Stadelheim , a judge will read a 21 - page arrest warrant to him .
Demjanjuk will have the opportunity to respond , but is not expected to say anything .
" I will put pressure on him not to say anything , because we need to talk in peace first and digest everything that is in the arrest warrant , " Maull said .
A doctor will examine Demjanjuk and decide whether he should remain at Stadelheim or be sent to an area hospital .
Dramatic photos last month showed Demjanjuk ( pronounced dem - YAHN ' - yuk ) wincing in apparent pain as he was removed by immigration agents from his home in Seven Hills , Ohio , in an earlier attempt to deport him to Germany .
However , images taken only days earlier and released by the U.S. government showed him entering his car unaided outside a medical office .
Demjanjuk 's son , John Demjanjuk Jr. , said Monday that his father is dying of leukemic bone marrow disease and had maintained that he would not survive a trans -Atlantic flight .
The deportation came four days after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider Demjanjuk 's request to block deportation .
Among the documents obtained by the Munich prosecutors is an SS identity card that features a photo of a young , round - faced Demjanjuk along with his height and weight , and says he worked at Sobibor .
German prosecutors also have a transfer roster that lists Demjanjuk by his name and birthday and also says he was at Sobibor , and statements from former guards who remembered him being there .
The case dates to 1977 , when the Justice Department moved to revoke Demjanjuk 's U.S. citizenship , alleging he hid his past as a Nazi death camp guard .
Demjanjuk had been tried in Israel after accusations surfaced that he was the notorious " Ivan the Terrible " at the Treblinka death camp in Poland .
He was found guilty in 1988 of war crimes and crimes against humanity but the conviction was overturned by the Israeli Supreme Court .
A U.S. judge revoked his citizenship in 2002 based on U.S. Justice Department evidence showing he concealed his service at Sobibor and other Nazi-run death and forced - labor camps .
An immigration judge ruled in 2005 he could be deported to Germany , Poland or Ukraine .
Munich prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for him in March .
We 're only a day away from the release of the Fallout 3 Broken Steel downloadable content , and this launch trailer shows how much of a liar Ron Perlman is .
War seems to have changed quite a bit between Fallout 3's original ending and this new content .
There 're more giant robots , for instance .
The orbital strike seems like a new thing as well , considering that my personal Fallout 3 character was so hideously evil that had orbital strike technology been available they definitely would have used it on me .

Perhaps Ron Pearlman is just talking about the word " war " , which definitely has n't changed in awhile .
In that case , I say we all start spelling it " whar " just to take him down a notch .
He 's been getting all uppity ever since they gave him a giant stone arm .
Broken Steel will be available tomorrow on Games for Windows and Xbox Live for 800 Microsoft points .
I love books .
There is some truly fantastic knowledge and information hidden out there in hard to find , rare , and not commercially viable books .
I find that I want my books with me everywhere .
But that 's where the problems begin .
Buying , moving , storing , and preserving books means environmental costs ... and when I loan a book to a friend , I no longer have access to it .
Digital books change the landscape .
After suffering through scanning many of my old , rare , and government issue books , I decided to create a book scanner that anybody could make , for around $ 300 .
And that 's what this instructable is all about .
A greener future with more books rather than fewer books .
More access to information , rather than less access to information .
And maybe , years from now , a reformed publishing / distribution model ( but I 'm not holding my breath ... ) .
UPDATE : We 've outgrown the Instructables commenting system .
There 's a new place to discuss book scanner building -- please join us at DIYBOOKSCANNER .ORG -- and BTW , you do n't need to register to get a PDF of these instructions .
UPDATE:9/16/2011 - Instructables has kindly made the PDF download public for everyone .
Thanks , Eric .
UPDATE : If you 're actually planning to build one of these things , you really should visit DIYBookScanner.org .
I have a new set of plans there that is much simpler than these ones .
I 've built two of these things now , and this instructable covers the best parts of both of them .
You can build a book scanner using only hand tools plus a drill .
I realized that not everyone is comfortable with using all the different hand tools you might need to make it .
So I scanned a book on using hand tools that should answer all your questions . ;)
Download a sample here .
Download the entire book ( 115 mb ) here .
I may have to remove this if there are too many downloads .
Please note that these were taken before the scanner and software were complete .
Scans from the final system are much nicer .
We have written some open - source , free software to convert the images from your scanner into PDFs .
It 's currently in a rough alpha stage , and needs a pretty fast computer to get things done .
It works on Macs and PCs .
Help us improve it !
This software is covered on step ( 78 - 79 ) .
EDIT : Many people have commented that an automatic page flipper would be faster .
I think this system is pretty fast .
I made a comparison video if you 'd like to see how this compares to an automatic scanning system .
And you can watch a movie while you work on my system .
Let 's get to it !

The development community behind the open source Compiz window manager is undergoing a major reorganization effort that will converge disparate branches of the project and help it overcome its recent lack of direction .
Compiz is responsible for bringing rich visual effects such as cube rotation , transparency , shadows , and wobbly windows to the Linux desktop .
It includes a powerful compositing engine that leverages hardware - accelerated 3D graphics and the latest features of Xorg .
It is shipped with several popular Linux distributions and is extremely popular among Linux enthusiasts .
The project originally began at Novell as the work of David Reveman , but it was forked by an independent community of developers who were dissatisfied with the lack of inclusiveness and the manner in which it was being managed by Novell .
The fork , which was called Beryl , was eventually reunited with upstream Compiz when it merged with Compiz Extras and became Compiz Fusion .
Reveman 's declining participation in the effort left Compiz without any leadership or direction .
Several active contributors began making massive architectural changes to Compiz in their own branches outside of the project .
This fragmentation weakened the project and created a lot of uncertainty about how it would move forward .
In response to these issues , developer Kristian Lyngstol posted a message on the Compiz mailing list in December urging the community to come together and build a consensus around a new direction , consolidate its development tools , and improve technical documentation so that Compiz would be more accessible to new contributors .
Compiz developers participated in several conference calls in order to address the issues raised by Lyngstol .
They made several important decisions which were announced in a mailing list post .
The project will be led collectively by members of its new community council , which consists of five key members of the Compiz community .
They have laid out a roadmap that will allow the project to move forward .
The somewhat arbitrary distinction between Compiz and Compiz Fusion will be dropped entirely .
The project will simply be called Compiz and all of the development infrastructure -— such as bug report systems and mailing lists — will be converged .
They are also planning to begin the process of preparing for an official 0.8 release , which will include the latest stable components .
Following the stable release , they intend to adopt the major architectural changes that have been prototyped by Dennis Kasprzyk in his Compiz ++ branch .
These changes include migrating the entire code base to C++ with an object - oriented design .
His work will also provide support for tiled textures , improved ABI stability , support for pluggable rendering backends , and reparented window decorations .
A 0.9 release is planned after Compiz ++ has been fully integrated .
According to the new roadmap , Novell 's Nomad enhancements could also potentially be merged into Compiz after the 0.9 release .
Nomad is a project that aims to bring improved remote desktop capabilities to the Linux platform , including support for client - side compositing .
This features some significant modifications to Compiz that are n't yet fully mature .
There are also plans to conduct a complete code review and improve documentation throughout Compiz .
The new plan is ambitious but very promising .
Compiz is becoming an important part of the Linux desktop stack and it has the potential to bring a lot of very rich aesthetic and usability improvements to the platform .
The lack of momentum behind the project in recent months has been very troubling and the renewed efforts to break away from the current malaise of stagnation are a good sign that the developers are still committed to making Compiz shine .

Hysterical fund raising letter from Michael Steele charges MN's ' Democrat ' Senator - elect 's apparent victory a ' tragic injustice , ' ' outrageous power grab ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/3/2009 , 2:40 pm PT
The " one and only true party of the people " hoping to " rebuild ... from the grassroots up , " according to an email from its new chairman Michael Steele , seems to be having trouble doing anything differently from the old GOP party .
At least if the latest fund raising letter from Steele , charging " liberal Democrat comedian Al Franken " as " stealing Norm Coleman 's U.S. Senate seat in Minnesota , " is any indication .
On the same day that former Senator Coleman rested his so - far failed case in his election contest in St. Paul against apparent Senator - elect Al Franken , the new GOP chair sent a missive to supporters , begging for money , using the same old failed tactics of the RNC of old ; namely , lying to supporters about facts , offering specious , unsupported allegations of Democrats " stealing " elections ( despite all evidence to the contrary ) , making liberal use of the word " liberal , " and referring to Democratic party members as " Democrat " party members .
Steele 's shameless email ( posted in full at the end of this article ) echoes the RNC 's so - far failed conspiracy - theory strategy to " win " the Senate seat , as previously used by the Coleman camp , the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee ( RSCC ) , the Republican National Lawyer 's Association ( RNLA ) , and GOP propagandists from Hannity to Rush to the wingnut blogosphere which dutifully repeat all of their tin-foil hattery , and / or supply it to them in the first place ...
Steele now joins the nation 's most prominent Rightwing whacko sore - losers who have been flogging baseless conspiracy theories and fully - debunked claims about Franken 's victory , ever since it became apparent last year that their man was likely voted the loser in his bid to retain the U.S. Senate seat in MN .
The RSCC itself created a conspiracy blog last year after the election , specifically to repost unsupported propaganda , and allegations from around the web , charging that Franken was in the process of " stealing " the MN election .
That embarrassing website , once found at MinnesotaRecount.com has been replaced with a page claiming the site to be " Temporary Unavailable " for the last several months , ever since Coleman 's contest began .
Last month , on the same day that Franken saw a major victory in the trial , the previously - respectable - ish RNLA said goodbye to any remaining shred of credibility it may have once had , and sent out an hysterical fund raising email , similar to Steele 's , alleging Franken had faced a " major setback in the courts " and was now " desperate ... to steal a seat in the United States Senate . "
All of that , even as Coleman 's own team was busted by the election contest court for having doctored evidence on Day 1 of the trial , withholding notes from Franken 's team and , just last Friday , having been discovered to have hidden both emails and a witness from the opposition in gross violation of all basic litigation tenets .
" As you may know , Norm Coleman won re-election on November 4th by 215 votes , " writes Steele , with a straight face , in yesterday 's email , referring to the uncertified , incomplete Election Night machine tabulation of MN 's ballots .
" But a subsequent recount --- tainted with inconsistencies and improperly counted ballots --- awarded a temporary 225 - vote margin to Franken . "
He fails to mention what the " tainted inconsistencies " and " improperly counted ballots " were in the state 's extraordinarily transparent post-election hand - count of some 2.9 paper ballots , the accurate counting of which was as agreed to by both Coleman and Franken 's own legal teams before the trial phase began .
According to the GOP 's Wingnut - in - Chief Steele ( if you do n't count Limbaugh ) , the election results , following an orderly , fully - transparent hand - count ( presided over by 5 multi- partisan state officials ) , and the subsequent election contest ( presided over by three bi-partisan judges selected by the Republican Supreme Court chief justice in MN ) , amounts to little more than an " outrageous power grab by Al Franken and Harry Reid , " which " must not stand . "
The democratic process of the majority of voters having apparently selected Franken over Coleman is a " tragic injustice , " charges Steele , as he begs for money for the GOP , before describing the " gutter campaign tactics and shady legal maneuverings of the Left Wing " who " do n't fight fair , and [ will ] stop at nothing to consolidate the power they crave . "
The irony , as usual with these guys , speaks for itself .

Unfinished Business Dear [ retracted for privacy ] ,
As you know , my mission as the new Chairman of the Republican National Committee is to rebuild our party from the grassroots up - using new technology to spread our conservative message and remind voters that our party is the one and only true party of the people .
But before we get too far down that road , we 've got some unfinished business to attend to .
Specifically , we 've got to stop liberal Democrat comedian Al Franken from stealing Norm Coleman 's U.S. Senate seat in Minnesota .
As you may know , Norm Coleman won re-election on November 4th by 215 votes .
But a subsequent recount --- tainted with inconsistencies and improperly counted ballots --- awarded a temporary 225 - vote margin to Franken .
As I write to you , Franken and his allies are working feverishly to persuade a panel of judges in Minnesota that certain un-counted ballots must remain un-counted … and deny the one - person , one - vote principle which is the very foundation of our democratic process .
Your immediate financial support of the Coleman for Senate Recount Fund will help us stop this tragic injustice , and I urge you to click here now to help .
As the former Lieutenant Governor of Maryland and candidate for the U.S. Senate , I 'm no stranger to the gutter campaign tactics and shady legal maneuverings of the Left Wing .
They do n't fight fair , and they 'll stop at nothing to consolidate the power they crave .
This outrageous power grab by Al Franken and Harry Reid must not stand .
With Norm Coleman in the Senate protecting taxpayers , it would have been much more difficult for Obama and Reid to get the 60 votes they needed to pass their outrageous , pork - laden stimulus package .
And with Norm in the Senate protecting workers , it will be much more difficult for the Democrats to pass " Card - Check " legislation that will prevent the right of workers to cast secret ballots in union elections .
These are but just a few of the reasons why I 'm counting on you to support Norm Coleman 's recount fund with the most generous contribution you can make .
Click here to contribute $ 15 , $ 25 or $ 35 .
If you can contribute $ 50 , $ 100 , $ 500 or more - up to the legal maximum of $ 2,300 per person - please do so now .
Whatever the amount , we need your help to keep a good man doing a fine job for the conservative principles you and I share .
Republicans must once again assert that the opportunities this nation has to offer rests not in government , but in the hands of individuals .
Through both our words and our deeds , our party will do just that in the elections to come .
But first , we 've got some unfinished business from 2008 .
The power to return Norm Coleman to the U.S. Senate rests in your hands right now , through the click of a mouse and your contribution to the Coleman for Senate Recount Fund .
I look forward to your reply .
Help me help Norm , and begin the process of rebuilding our party for 2010 and beyond .
Thanks so much ,
Michael Steele
Chairman , Republican National Committee

The US District Court for the District of Colorado has just granted a motion for summary judgment in Golan v. Holder you will want to know about .
It is a very big deal .
Anthony Falzone , Executive Director of the Fair Use Project at Stanford 's Center for Internet and Society , who led this effort , says , " It is the first time a court has held any part of the Copyright Act violates the First Amendment and the first time any court has placed specific constitutional limits on the government 's ability to erode the public domain . "
I read it as saying that nothing , not any treaty , not even the Berne Convention , can trump the US Constitution .
That 's what I love about it .
Attorney Ben Sheffner 's Copyrights & Campaigns Blog :
This is major : a Federal District Court in Colorado has held unconstitutional a portion of the Copyright Act , holding that 17 U.S.C. § 104A , which restored copyright in certain foreign works that had previously fallen into the public domain , cannot survive First Amendment scrutiny .
The government defended the statute by arguing that such restoration was required by Article 18 of the Berne Convention , the international copyright treaty that the US joined in 1988 , but the court in Golan v. Holder today held that the First Amendment trumps such treaty obligations , and that the statute impermissibly interferes with the free speech rights of the plaintiffs , " artisans and businesses that rely upon works in the public domain for their trade . "
The same District Court had previously upheld Section 104A against First Amendment challenge , but was ordered to reconsider by the Tenth Circuit in Golan v. Gonzales , 501 F.3d 1179 ( 10th Cir. 2007 ) , which held that the removal of works from the public domain " must be subject to First Amendment review " because " § 514 has altered the traditional contours of copyright protection in a manner that implicates plaintiffs  right to free expression . "
Here 's the decision [ pdf ] from the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit , that sent the case , then called Golan v. Gonzales , back to the District Court in September of 2007 .
Yes .
It 's the same appeals court that will hear SCO 's appeal in SCO v. Novell .
Sheffner predicts this is not the end , that the government will feel it must try to overturn this decision and will take this to the Supreme Court if necessary .
But for now , those that fought hard for this are happy indeed .
Larry Lessig : I am very happy and very very proud to report a big victory in Golan v. Holder .
As you may recall , Golan was filed at the time Eldred v. Ashcroft was in the Supreme Court .
The case challenged the URAA , which restored the copyright to works in the public domain .
We lost in the district court , but then the CA10 reversed that decision , holding ( for the first time ever ) that the First Amendment restrained Congress when it changed the " traditional contours of copyright " beyond those explicitly mentioned in Eldred ( idea / expression dichotomy and fair use ) .
The CA10 sent the case back down to the district court , and Friday , Judge Babcock granted our motion for summary judgment , holding that the URAA violated the First Amendment to the extent it restored copyright against parties who had relied on works in the public domain .
Falzone :
We 're thrilled to report the Court has upheld our challenge to the constitutionality of the URAA 's restoration of copyrights in public domain works .
Today , the Court granted our summary judgment motion , holding the URAA violates the First Amendment insofar as it suppresses parties ' rights to keep using works they exploited when those works were in the public domain .
Needless to say , this is a big deal .
It is the first time a court has held any part of the Copyright Act violates the First Amendment and the first time any court has placed specific constitutional limits on the government 's ability to erode the public domain .
It is also the culmination of a lot of hard work by a lot of CIS lawyers dating back to 2001 , including myself , Larry Lessig , Chris Sprigman , Edward Lee , Jennifer Granick , Lauren Gelman , Colette Vogele , Julie Ahrens , Chris Ridder , Sarah Pearson and others .
I expect there will be more to come , including a return to the Tenth Circuit .
Look for updates here .
In the meantime , Judge Babcock 's order is attached below .
[ Attachment . ]
Of course , this is a complex area of law .
Stanford has an entire page on Public Domain Trouble Spots , and here 's the one on the list that applies to this case : 6 . Works First Published Outside the U.S. Some works first published outside the United States have been resurrected from the public domain .
As a result of international treaties signed in the 1990s , public domain works that meet certain qualifications are now protected .
Not any more !
Well , we 'll have to stay tuned for the final chapter .
People write entire books about public domain .
And this is a victory , but not necessarily the final word .
[ Update : I see some comments asking why this is such an important decision .
So , here 's a bit of background from Christopher Sprigman of the U. of Virginia Law School , as well as why he sees it as significant : Some background .
The Golan case challenges the constitutionality of the Uruguay Round Agreements
Act , by which , among other things , Congress removed thousands of books , films , songs , and other creative works from the public domain and " restored " them to copyright .
The Golan plaintiffs , a group of conductors and film distributors who used these public domain works , challenged Congress 's depredation of the public domain .
The primary ground for the challenge was that Congress , by removing works from the public domain , departed from the " traditional contours of copyright protection " in a way that limited free speech in violation of the First Amendment .
Limited how ?
By making the use of the former public domain works subject to the approval of the owners of the " restored " copyrights .
By , in short , imposing copyright burdens on free speech where none had existed before .
The Golan plaintiffs ' First Amendment theory was built on something the Supreme Court said in Eldred v. Ashcroft .
Eldred , of course , was the case where the Supreme Court affirmed Congress 's 20 - year extension of already - existing copyrights .
The Court rejected a First Amendment challenge to that change to copyright , holding that a long history of copyright extensions meant that Congress 's latest extension was constitutional .
But the Court issued an important caveat .
Where Congress does not act in accordance with history , but instead alters copyright 's " traditional contours " , courts must conduct a more searching First Amendment review to ensure that whatever Congress has done to the copyright law -- which is , of course , a regulation of speech -- does not burden speech in ways that can not be justified .
Until today , we have n't known very much about what the " traditional contours " test meant .
Now we have some data , and it 's possible -- not likely , mind you , but tantalizingly possible ! -- that we 've seen the first indication that courts will take a more active role in ensuring that Congress 's copyright lawmaking respects free speech .
The 10th Circuit ruled in Golan that Congress 's removal of works from the public domain departed from copyright 's traditional contours , and imposed significant burdens on free speech .
I wo n't get into every detail of the opinion in this blog post -- but suffice to say that the 10th Circuit understood the very important issues at stake , and resolved them in a way that will with luck start to bring copyright into line with all other forms of speech regulation -- i.e. , when Congress legislates , it had better think hard about the Constitution .
You can find the historical documents from Golan v. Ashcroft here and information about Eldred v. Ashcroft here and the filings here , if you 'd like to dig a bit deeper .
And here 's another view from Jack Balkin , that the case could have implications for the DMCA , although he presents a possible counterargument :
This decision is quite important because it builds out from Eldred -- a case that most people saw as a loss -- the beginnings of a first amendment jurisprudence that would limit copyright .
Larry Lessig , who represented plaintiffs in the case , is quite right that this is a very big deal .
The court 's decision and its reasoning are a significant breakthrough .
Everyone who cares about freedom of speech -- and free culture -- should be happy about this decision .
At the same time , we should be wary of some possible future pitfalls .
The first potential pitfall comes from the fact that the court had to use a test of tradition taken from Eldred .
At first glance , that test -- the " traditional contours of copyright law " -- might seem to be of great help to critics of expansive copyright law .
That is because copyright law has become far more expansive than it was at the founding in almost every area .
The problem is that if we interpret the " traditional contours of copyright law " to require only that copyright laws basically resemble previous versions , only with longer terms and more constricted exemptions , the " traditional contours " test will not do much work .
...
The best cases for using Golan 's analysis are those where , as in Golan itself , material is taken out of the public domain , or cases like the DMCA , where Congress creates a brand new set of rights that have no analogy to a pre-digital world .
...
Defenders of paracopyright laws like the DMCA could argue that the very fact that statutes like the DMCA have no analogy in a pre-digital world means that there no " traditional contours of copyright " have been violated by such statutes .
In short , it matters if you think copyright law has gone overboard , and it matters if you think Congress et al need to give some thought to the Constitution when passing laws and signing treaties .
If you 'd like to see some who were appalled or puzzled by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision , probably the best source would be William Patry 's comment , back when he was still blogging .
End update . ]
Here is the decision as text .
As always , this is to help you easily read it , search it by keyword , and use speech readers , but it 's not official .

____________________
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER ____________________
Babcock , J. This case -- as now presented -- concerns the validity of Section 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act ( " URAA " ) , 17 U.S.C. § 104A .
Section 514 restores the United States copyrights of foreign authors who lost those rights to the public domain for any reason other than the expiration of a copyright term .
Plaintiffs filed this suit in September 2001 , asserting claims challenging Section 514-- as well as the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 - - under the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment .
This Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Government or dismissal as to each of those claims .
[ Docket # # 28 , 109 ] .
On appeal , the Tenth Circuit affirmed this Court 's rulings as to Plaintiffs ' Copyright Term Extension Act claims and Plaintiffs ' Copyright Clause claims , but reversed this Court 's rulings as to Plaintiff 's First Amendment challenge to Section 514 .
See Golan v. Gonzales , 501 F.3d 1179 ( 10th Cir. 2007 ) .
The Tenth Circuit remanded to this Court with instructions to assess whether Section 514 -- which the Tenth Circuit determined interfered with Plaintiffs ' " First Amendment interest in using works in the public domain " -- passed First Amendment scrutiny .
The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment on this issue [ Docket ## 147 , 148 ] as well as responses / replies [ Docket ## 154 , 155 ] .
An amicus brief was filed in support of the Government [ Docket # 152 ] .
The motions are adequately briefed and oral argument would not materially assist their determination .
After consideration of the motions , the papers , and the case file , and for the reasons stated below , I GRANT Plaintiffs ' motion [ Docket # 148 ] and DENY the Government 's motion [ Docket # 147 ] .
I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs in this case represent a broad range of artisans and businesses that rely upon works in the public domain for their trade .
As relevant to the issue presented here , these works were produced by foreign authors and , for varying reasons -- including the authors ' failure to renew the copyrights with the Copyright Office , or failure to include a notice of copyright on the copyrighted works -- did not enjoy copyright protection in the United States prior to the enactment of the URAA in 1994 .
Section 514 of the URAA ostensibly implements Article 18 of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works -- an international treaty first enacted in 1886 , but not joined by the United States until 1988 .
Article 18 requires member nations to provide copyright protection to works by foreign authors so long as the term of copyright protection in the country of origin has not expired as to a specific work .
See Berne Convention , Art. 18 . Section 514 of the URAA -- by granting copyright protection to these 2 foreign authors -- removed from the public domain the works upon which Plaintiffs relied .
As the subject works are now protected by United States copyright laws , Plaintiffs find themselves in the position of having to either pay for their previously royalty - free use , or cease using the works altogether .
Plaintiffs argue their First Amendment rights were violated by Congress when these works were removed from the public domain .
On April 20 , 2005 , I granted summary judgment to the Government on Plaintiffs ' First Amendment claims , holding : " I see no need to expand upon the settled rule that private censorship via copyright enforcement does not implicate First Amendment concerns . "
[ Docket # 109 ] .
On appeal , the Tenth Circuit reversed , holding : " since § 514 has altered the traditional contours of copyright protection in a manner that implicates plaintiffs ' right to free expression , it must be subject to First Amendment review . "
Golan , 501 F.3d at 1197 .
II .
TENTH CIRCUIT OPINION
The Tenth Circuit began its review with an outline of basic principles of copyright law and how those principles interconnect with the First Amendment : Under the Copyright Clause , Congress may " promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to their [ respective ] Writings . "
U.S. CONST . art .
I , § 8 , cl. 8 . . . . " [ O ] nce the . . . copyright monopoly has expired , the public may use the . . . work at will and without attribution . "
Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. , 539 U.S. 23 , 3334 ( 2003 ) .
These imaginative works inspire new creations , which in turn inspire others , hopefully , ad infinitum .
This cycle is what makes copyright " the engine of free expression . "
Harper & Row Publishers , Inc. v. Nation Enters. , 471 U.S. 539 , 558 ( 1985 ) .
Congress 's power to bestow copyrights is broad .
See Eldred v. Ashcroft , 537 U.S. 186 , 205 ( 2003 ) ( " [ I ]t is Congress that has been assigned the task of defining the scope of the limited monopoly that should be granted to authors . . . in order to give the public appropriate access to their work product . " ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
But it is not boundless .
. . .
The Supreme Court has recognized that the First Amendment can limit Congress 's power under the Copyright 3 Clause .
Id. at 21921 ( indicating that copyright acts are not " categorically immune from challenges under the First Amendment " ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
The Court has emphasized , however , that " copyright 's built - in First Amendment accommodations " -- the idea / expression dichotomy and the fair use defense -- generally protect the public 's First Amendment interest in copyrighted works .
Id. at 21920 .
Although these built - in free speech safeguards will ordinarily insulate legislation from First Amendment review , the Eldred Court indicated that such review is warranted when an act of Congress has " altered the traditional contours of copyright protection . "
Id. at 221 .
The Court did not define the " traditional contours of copyright protection . "
However , as we discuss in detail below , one of these traditional contours is the principle that once a work enters the public domain , no individual -- not even the creator - - may copyright it .
Golan , 501 F.3d at 118384 .
In reaching its conclusion that Section 514 - - by removing works from the public domain --" altered the traditional contours of copyright protection , " the court first noted " the bedrock principle of copyright law that works in the public domain remain there . "
See Golan , 501 F.3d at 1187 .
Indeed , the primary purpose of the Copyright Clause is to incentivize authors to produce works to benefit the public good .
See id. at 1188 .
Once a work is created , a copyright attaches that allows the author to restrict the use of the work for the duration of the copyright period -- at which point the work enters the public domain for the free use of anyone .
See id. at 1189 .
This incentive drives " the engine of free expression " enshrined in the First Amendment .
See id. at 1188 .
Section 514 altered the traditional copyright scheme such that " the copyright sequence no longer necessarily ends with the public domain : indeed , it may begin there . "
See id. at 1189 .
Such an alteration is inconsistent with the copyright scheme as designed by the Framers and as implemented by Congress in the ensuing years .
See id. at 119092 .
Accordingly , " [ Section ] 514 deviates from the time - honored tradition of allowing works in the public domain to stay there . "
4 Id. at 1192 .
Having established that Section 514 " altered the traditional contours of copyright protection " -- therefore requiring First Amendment review , see Eldred v. Ashcroft , 537 U.S. 186 , 221 ( 2003 ) -- the Tenth Circuit turned to the question of how the alteration affected the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs .
The court first noted that Plaintiffs had , subject to constitutionally permissible restraints , a non-exclusive right to " unrestrained artistic use of these works " that was protected by the First Amendment .
See Golan , 501 F.3d at 1193 .
Section 514 interfered with this right by making the cost of using the works prohibitive .
See id .
Distinguishing Plaintiffs ' case from that at issue in Eldred , the court noted that the Eldred plaintiffs did not have a right to copy the works at issue .
See id .
( " As the Eldred Court observed , the most the Eldred plaintiffs could show was a weak interest in ' making other people 's speeches . '
By contrast , the speech at issue here belonged to plaintiffs when it entered the public domain . " ) .
The court concluded " that once the works at issue became free for anyone to copy , plaintiffs in this case had vested First Amendment interests in the expressions , and § 514's interference with plaintiff 's rights is subject to First Amendment scrutiny . "
Id. at 1194 .
Finally , the Tenth Circuit considered whether " copyright 's built - in First Amendment accommodations " -- the idea / expression dichotomy and the fair use defense -- were , when combined with the additional protections explicitly included in Section 514 , adequate to protect Plaintiffs '
First Amendment interests .
Addressing the idea / expression dichotomy , the court found the rule to be inapplicable to Plaintiffs ' case because Plaintiffs ' interest was in the expressions themselves , not merely the underlying ideas .
See id. at 1194 .
Addressing the fair use doctrine , the court found the doctrine to be an insufficient substitute for the unlimited use 5 allowed once a work was in the public domain .
See id. at 1195 .
The court then held Section 514's " supplemental protections " -- which include a one - year safe harbor provision and a provision allowing the continued use of derivative works , if a reasonable royalty is paid -- inadequate to insulate Section 514 from a First Amendment challenge .
See id. at 1196 ; see also Eldred , 537 U.S. at 221 .
The court remanded with instructions to apply a First Amendment analysis .
III .
STANDARD OF REVIEW A. First Amendment Review
As mandated by the Tenth Circuit , the initial inquiry in my First Amendment analysis is " whether § 514 is content - based or content - neutral . "
See Golan , 501 F.3d at 1196 .
Content - based restrictions on speech are those which " suppress , disadvantage , or impose differential burdens upon speech because of its content . "
Grace United Methodist Church v. City of Cheyenne , 451 F.3d 643 , 657 ( 10th Cir. 2006 ) ( internal citations and quotations omitted ) .
These restrictions " are subject to the most exacting scrutiny . "
See id .
If Section 514 is a content - based restriction , I must consider whether the Government 's interest in promulgating the restriction is truly " compelling " and whether the Government might achieve the same ends through alternative means that have less of an effect on protected expression .
See United States v. Playboy Entm't Group , Inc. , 529 U.S. 803 , 813 ( 2000 ) .
By contrast , " [ a ] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral , even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others . "
Ward v. Rock Against Racism , 491 U.S. 781 , 791 ( 1989 ) .
A content - neutral restriction must be " narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest . "
Id. ( quoting Clark v. Cmty . for Creative Non-Violence , 468 U.S. 288 , 6 293 ( 1984 ) ) .
The parties both argue Section 514 is content - neutral .
I agree .
A restriction will be considered content - neutral when it can be justified without reference to the content of the speech restricted .
See Boos v. Barry , 485 U.S. 312 , 320 ( 1988 ) ( citing City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres , Inc. , 475 U.S. 41 , 48 ( 1986 ) ; Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council , Inc. , 425 U.S. 748 , 771 ( 1976 ) ) .
Here , the speech restricted is a general category of speech -- namely , speech created by foreign authors .
The justification for the restriction lies in the protection of the authors ' interests in the expressions themselves , not the ideas the works encompass .
Accordingly , Section 514 must be reviewed under the " content - neutral " standard .
See Turner Broad .
Sys. , Inc. v. F.C.C. , 512 U.S. 622 , 643 ( 1994 ) ( " Turner I " ) .
" A content - neutral regulation [ of speech ] will be sustained under the First Amendment if it advances important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests . "
Turner Broad .
Sys. , Inc. v. F.C.C. , 520 U.S. 180 , 189 ( 1997 ) ( " Turner II " ) .
While a content - neutral restriction must be " narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest " unrelated to the suppression of free speech , it " need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so . "
See Ward , 491 U.S. at 791 , 798 .
The requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the restriction promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the restriction .
See id. at 79899 .
7 Review of Congress 's judgment is deferential ; the only relevant question is whether , in formulating its judgment , Congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence .
See Turner I , 520 U.S. at 195 .
" So long as the means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government 's interest , " the restriction will not be invalid simply because " the government 's interest could be adequately served by some less - speech - restrictive alternative . "
Ward , 491 U.S. at 800 .
When determining whether a regulation of speech is " substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government 's interest , " the Court asks whether the regulation suppresses a substantial amount of protected speech judged in relation to the Government 's legitimate interest .
See Virginia v. Hicks , 539 U.S. 113 , 11819 , 12223 ( 2003 ) .
This requires a balancing of Plaintiffs ' interests with those of the Government .
See United States v. Williams , 128 S. Ct. 1830 , 1838 ( 2008 ) .
The first step is to construe the challenged statute to determine the scope of the speech the statute affects .
See id .
The second step is to determine the scope of protected expressive activity necessarily suppressed by the statute 's terms .
See id. at 1841 .
If the statute " leaves unprotected a substantial amount of speech not tied to the Government 's interest . . . it is overbroad and unconstitutional . "
Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition , 535 U.S. 234 , 256 ( 2002 ) .
B. Summary Judgment
In a motion for summary judgment , the moving party " always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion , and identifying those portions of ' the pleadings , depositions , answers to interrogatories , and admissions on file , together with the affidavits , if any , ' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue 8 of material fact . "
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317 , 323 ( 1986 ) ( quoting FED .
R. CIV . P. 56 ( c ) ) .
If this burden is met , then the non-moving party has the burden of showing there are genuine issues of material fact to be determined .
See id. at 322 .
It is not enough that the evidence be merely colorable ; the non-moving party must come forward with specific facts showing a genuine issue remains .
See id. ; Matsushita Elec. Indus .
Co. , Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp. , 475 U.S. 574 , 587 ( 1986 ) .
A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing substantive law .
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby , Inc. , 477 U.S. 242 , 255 ( 1986 ) .
I shall grant summary judgment , therefore , only if the pleadings , depositions , answers to interrogatories , admissions , or affidavits -- construed viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party 's favor -- show there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law .
Mares v. ConAgra Poultry Co. , Inc. , 971 F.2d 492 , 494 ( 10th Cir. 1992 ) ; Lucas v. Mountain States Tel. & Tel. , 909 F.2d 419 , 420 ( 10th Cir. 1990 ) ; FED .
R. CIV . P. 56 ( c ) .
In a motion for summary judgment , I view the evidence " through the prism of the substantive evidentiary burden . "
Liberty Lobby , supra , 477 U.S. at 254 .
The inquiry is based on " the quality and quantity of evidence required by the governing law " and " the criteria governing what evidence would enable the jury to find for either the plaintiff or the defendant . "
Id .
Where -- as here -- the parties file cross-motions for summary judgment , I am entitled to assume that no evidence needs to be considered other than that filed by the parties .
See Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Farm Credit Bank of Wichita , 226 F.3d 1138 , 1148 ( 10th Cir. 2000 ) .
Nonetheless -- as cross-motions for summary judgment are to be treated separately -- the denial of 9 one does not necessarily require the grant of the other .
See id .
Although this case is presented in the light of summary judgment , the Court must still accord substantial deference to the predictive judgment of Congress .
See Turner I , 512 U.S. at 666 .
In this context , the question is whether Congress based its decision on reasonable inferences and substantial evidence .
See id .
As long as there is no material dispute that there is substantial evidence from which Congress could have drawn a reasonable inference , then the government is entitled to summary judgment even if the evidence could reasonably lead to an inconsistent conclusion .
See Turner II , 520 U.S. at 1196 .
If , however , Plaintiffs show the Government is unable to proffer such evidence , Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment .
See Edenfield v. Fane , 507 U.S. 761 , 77071 ( 1993 ) ; Sable Commc'ns of California , Inc. v. F.C.C. , 492 U.S. 115 , 12930 ( 1989 ) .

ANALYSIS
The burden is on the Government to show it has a significant interest that is protected by limiting Plaintiffs ' speech and that Section 514 does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further the Government 's interest .
See Turner I , 512 U.S. at 66465 .
The Government proffers three interests allegedly served by Section 514 : ( 1 ) Section 514 brings the United States into substantial compliance with its international treaty obligations under the Berne Convention ; ( 2 ) Section 514 helps protect the copyright interests of United States authors abroad ; and ( 3 ) Section 514 corrects for historic inequities wrought on foreign authors who lost their United States copyrights through no fault of their own .
A. Compliance with the Berne Convention
It is not disputed that the Berne Convention requires the restoration of copyrights to 10 foreign authors .
While compliance with international treaty obligations represents an important governmental interest , " [ a] t the same time , it is well established that ' no agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress , or on any other branch of Government , which is free from the restraints of the Constitution . ' "
Boos , 485 U.S. at 324 ( quoting Reid v. Covert , 354 U.S. 1 , 16 ( 1957 ) ) ; see Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal , 546 U.S. 418 , 438 ( 2006 ) .
Accordingly , I must ask whether Section 514 meets the requirements of the Berne Convention in a manner that is not " substantially broader that necessary to achieve the government 's interest . "
See Ward , 491 U.S. at 800 .
In determining whether Section 514 is " substantially broader than necessary , " I must balance the Government 's interest against that of Plaintiffs .
See Williams , 128 S. Ct. at 1838 .
As noted by the Tenth Circuit , Section 514 was inconsistent with the United States copyright scheme as designed by the Framers and as implemented by Congress in the ensuing years .
See Golan , 501 F.3d at 119092 .
Moreover , Section 514 interfered with Plaintiffs ' vested First Amendment rights to unrestrained use of the restored works .
See id. at 119394 .
The Government argues under Eldred that Plaintiffs have a diminished interest in the restored works because Plaintiffs were not the original authors .
See Eldred , 537 U.S. at 221 ( " The First Amendment securely protects the freedom to make -- or decline to make - - one 's own speech ; it bears less heavily when speakers assert the right to make other people 's speeches . " ) .
The Tenth Circuit , however , was not persuaded by this argument and distinguished Plaintiffs ' case from that at issue in Eldred , holding : " plaintiffs '
First Amendment interests in public domain works are greater than the interests of the Eldred plaintiffs .
The Eldred plaintiffs did not -- nor had they ever -- possessed unfettered access to any of the works at issue there .
. . .
By contrast , the speech 11 at issue here belonged to plaintiffs when it entered the public domain . "
See Golan , 501 F.3d at 1193 .
Unlike the plaintiffs in Eldred , therefore , Plaintiffs here did not have an amorphous and prospective " trivial interest " in property that belonged to someone else , but instead had " vested First Amendment interests in the expressions " contained in the works themselves .
See id. at 1188 , 1194 .
The Tenth Circuit considered Plaintiffs ' interests " near the core of the First Amendment . "
See id. at 1193 .
The impact of removing the restored works without accommodating Plaintiff 's reliance interests is substantial .
See Golan , 501 F.3d at 1182 ( noting the added expense to Plaintiffs of complying with Section 514 made the exercise of their First Amendment rights costs prohibitive ) .
Accordingly , I do not find the Government 's argument persuasive and conclude Plaintiffs ' interests in copying the works at issue is deserving of full First Amendment protection .
Having determined the scope of the Government 's interest and Plaintiffs ' interest , I now turn to the question whether Section 514 " leaves unprotected a substantial amount of speech not tied to the Government 's interest . "
See Ashcroft , 535 U.S. at 256 .
As noted by the Government , Plaintiffs ' First Amendment speech is not entirely unprotected under Section 514 .
Plaintiffs -- in addition to the protections afforded under the " traditional contours of copyright protection " -- are immunized from liability for acts of copying occurring before restoration and are entitled to continue copying so long as the original author does not file notice of intent to enforce his or her copyrights .
Plaintiffs are also entitled to sell or otherwise use copies of restored works for one year , and may continue to exploit derivative works forever , so long as a reasonable royalty is paid .
What speech remains unprotected under Section 514 , therefore , is any speech that involves copying more than one year after notice has been filed , and any derivative works made after 12 notice is filed and without payment of a royalty .
When compared to the limited amount of speech that remains protected under Section 514 , other than speech already protected by the idea / expression dichotomy and the fair use doctrine -- speech that the Government concedes cannot be limited by its interest in complying with the Berne Convention -- the amount unprotected is clearly " a substantial amount . "
See Ashcroft , 535 U.S. at 256 .
I therefore ask whether the unprotected speech is " not tied to the Government 's interest " in complying with the Berne Convention .
See id .
I begin by noting that the Berne Convention does not provide any direct reference to the question at issue here : whether or how member nations should accommodate " reliance parties " -- namely , those persons with a vested interest in previously public - domain works -- once the affected works are removed from the public domain and placed into the domain of copyright protection .
To the extent Berne addresses this issue at all , the determination is left to the member nations : " respective countries shall determine , each in so far as it is concerned , the conditions of application of this principle . "
See Berne Convention , Art. 18( 3 ) .
I read Article 18 , Section 3 , as a grant of discretion to member nations to implement the Berne Convention 's directive -- that the copyrights of foreign authors be restored so long as the term of copyright protection in the country of origin has not expired -- in light of each member nation 's established corpus of copyright law .
Such discretion is not limited by Article 18 , Section 3 , so long as the directive is applied within the bounds of existing law .
See Fiscor Report , Part E [ Docket # 147 -4 ] .
In the United States , for example , it is not disputed that the restored copyrights must still be subject to the well - established First Amendment exceptions afforded by the fair - use doctrine and the idea / expression dichotomy .
See Golan , 501 F.3d at 13 119495 .
While the Government proffers an expert opinion stating that Article 18 , Section 3 , requires such accommodations be temporary in nature -- see Fiscor Report , Part E [ Docket # 147-4 ] -- nothing in the Berne Convention indicates this is necessarily the case .
Several member nations -- including Germany , Hungary , the United Kingdom , Australia , and New Zealand -- provide accommodations that are temporally permanent so long as certain conditions are met .
See Ficsor Report , Part F [ Docket # 147 - 4 ] .
While these member nations imposed various schemes limiting the rights of reliance parties , none of these nations restored copyrights in the subject works in a manner that was equivalent -- either in force or in time -- to copyrights in those works that had not fallen into the public domain .
See Ficsor Report , Part F [ Docket # 147-4 ] .
Congress itself -- by affording reliance parties certain protections in Section 514 that went beyond those normally required to accommodate copyright law and First Amendment concerns -- implicitly recognized that Article 18 , Section 3 , does not require the full restoration of equivalent copyrights .
See 17 U.S.C. § 104A ( d ) .
Some of these protections -- such as allowing reliance parties to use restored works for an unlimited period of time if the author fails to file a notice of intent to enforce his copyright , and allowing reliance parties to use derivative works for so long as a reasonable royalty is paid to the original author -- are temporally permanent in nature .
Although , as noted by the Tenth Circuit , none of these provisions are adequate to fully protect Plaintiffs '
First Amendment interests , they provide some protection beyond that which a normal copyright would allow .
See Golan , 501 F.3d at 119394 .
By enacting such protections , Congress demonstrated it understood the broad latitude provided 14 member nations to protect reliance parties -- even for an unlimited amount of time .
In light of the discretion afforded it by Article 18 , Section 3 , Congress could have complied with the Berne Convention without interfering with a substantial amount of protected speech -- for example , by permanently " excepting parties , such as plaintiffs , who have relied upon works in the public domain , " see Golan , 501 F.3d at 1196 ; see also Ridder Dec. Ex. A [ Docket # 150 - 9 ] .
Accordingly -- to the extent Section 514 suppresses the right of reliance parties to use works they exploited while the works were in the public domain -- Section 514 is " not tied to the Government 's interest " in complying with the Berne Convention .
See Ashcroft , 535 U.S. at 256 .
Section 514 is therefore " substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government 's interest . "
See Ward , 491 U.S. at 800 .
Resolution of this question of law shows summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against the Government is appropriate on this issue .
See Mares , 971 F.2d at 494 ; FED .
R. CIV . P. 56 ( c ) .
B. Protection of United States Authors ' Copyrights Abroad Although the Government argues Section 514 serves the additional important Government interest of protecting the copyrights of United States authors abroad , this justification is largely intertwined with its argument regarding compliance with Article 18 of the Berne Convention -- a justification which has been rejected as insufficient to justify the infringement of Plaintiffs '
First Amendment rights above .
It is unnecessary to readdress these concerns here .
In addition to Article 18 , however , the Government also argues Section 514 is necessary to protect United States authors from reprisal under Article 6 .
Article 6 states :
Where any country outside the Union fails to protect in an adequate manner the works of authors who are nationals of one of the countries of the Union , the latter 15 country may restrict the protection given to the works of authors who are , at the date of the first publication thereof , nationals of the other country and are not habitually resident in one of the countries of the Union .
If the country of first publication avails itself of this right , the other countries of the Union shall not be required to grant to works thus subjected to special treatment a wider protection than that granted to them in the country of first publication .
By its own terms , Article 6 allows sanctions only against a " country outside the Union [ that ] fails to protect in an adequate manner the works of authors who are nationals of one of the countries of the Union . " ( emphasis added ) .
As the United States is " one of the countries of the Union , " Article 6 provides no basis for sanctions to be levied against United States authors .
Accordingly , compliance with Article 6 cannot provide an important Government interest .
See Turner I , 512 U.S. at 664 ( " when the Government defends a regulation on speech as a means to . . . prevent anticipated harms , it must . . . demonstrate that the recited harms are real , not merely conjectural " ) .
The Government next appears to argue that Section 514 -- to the extent it suppresses the right of reliance parties to use works they exploited while the works were in the public domain -- serves an important Government interest because it protects American authors whose works had entered the public domain of other countries from having those public domain works exploited by reliance parties in those countries .
Although the precise contours are not clear , the essence of this argument appears to be an assumption that Section 514 will encourage other countries to limit the rights of reliance parties , despite -- as held above -- having no obligation to do so under the Berne Convention .
In support of its argument , the Government proffers evidence of the economic impact caused by foreign piracy of copyrighted United States works .
The Government 's evidence , however , focuses on the prior reluctance of foreign nations to protect American works unless the 16 United States implemented Article 18 of the Berne Convention .
The Government proffers no evidence showing how suppression of reliance parties '
First Amendment rights will lead to suppression of reliance parties ' rights in foreign nations , or how such suppression will provide a " direct and material " benefit to United States authors .
See Turner I , 512 U.S. at 664 .
The Supreme Court teaches that -- while Congress 's predictive judgments are entitled to substantial deference - - a court must " assure that , in formulating its judgments , Congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence . "
See id. at 66566 .
When Congress " trench[es ] on first amendment interests , even incidentally , the government must be able to adduce either empirical support or at least sound reasoning on behalf of its measures . "
See id. at 666 ( quoting Century Commc'ns Corp. v. FCC , 835 F.2d 292 , 304 ( D.C. Cir. 1987 ) ) .
This requires an analysis of evidence speaking to the precise question at issue .
See id. at 66667 .
Without the benefit of specific factual data supporting Congress 's reasoning , a court " cannot determine whether the threat is real enough " to constitute an important Government interest , or whether the remedy chosen is sufficiently narrow to overcome a First Amendment challenge .
See id. at 66567 .
In order to properly pursue a motion for summary judgment , the Government " bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion , and identifying those portions of ' the pleadings , depositions , answers to interrogatories , and admissions on file , together with the affidavits , if any , ' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact . "
Celotex , 477 U.S. at 323 .
The Government 's evidence is inadequate to meet this initial threshold inquiry .
Accordingly -- as the evidence presented is inadequate to support the Government 's motion in the first instance -- summary judgment in favor of the Government 17 on this issue is inappropriate .
See id .
Denial of the Government 's summary judgment motion on this issue does not necessarily require me to grant Plaintiffs ' cross-motion on the same question .
See Atlantic Richfield Co. , 226 F.3d at 1148 .
Plaintiffs are still required to point to evidence they believe demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact .
See Celotex , 477 U.S. at 323 .
Plaintiffs meet this threshold inquiry by their proffer of testimony before Congress speaking to the precise issue raised -- testimony that stated suppression of reliance parties '
First Amendment rights in the United States was unlikely to lead to suppression of foreign reliance parties ' rights as they concern United States works in foreign nations .
See Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiffs ' Motion for Summary Judgment , Part III .
B.2 [ Docket # 150 ] .
Although the Government had the opportunity to present evidence that was contrary to Plaintiffs ' supported position , it did not do so .
I therefore assume , for purposes of Plaintiffs ' motion , that no such evidence exists .
See Atlantic Richfield Co. , 226 F.3d at 1148 .
As the burden remains on the Government to present specific evidence showing it has a significant interest that is protected by limiting Plaintiffs ' speech and that Section 514 does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further the Government 's interest , the Government 's failure to muster such evidence shows no question of material fact remains to be determined on this issue .
See Turner I , 512 U.S. at 66465 ; Celotex , 477 U.S. at 323 ; Matsushita Elec. Indus . Co. , 475 U.S. at 587 . Summary judgment in Plaintiffs ' favor on this issue is therefore appropriate .
C. Correction of Historic Inequities
The Government 's third proffered justification is that Section 514 " serves an important 18 equitable interest -- the restoration of copyright protection to authors of foreign origin who lost their United States copyrights through no fault of their own , either because they failed to comply with United States copyright formalities , or because the United States did not have copyright relations with their nations at the time they created their works . "
Although neither party argues this point in any detail , the amicus brief filed in support of the Government 's position [ Docket # 152 ] concedes an important point raised by Plaintiffs - - namely , that Section 514 extends protections to foreign authors that are not afforded United States authors , even in their own country .
Rather than correct an historic inequity , Section 514 appears to create an inequity where one formerly did not exist .
The Government proffers no evidence showing how granting foreign authors copyrights in the United States -- yet denying similar protections to United States authors -- could constitute an important Government interest .
Indeed , this rationale appears inconsistent with the Government 's overarching argument that restoring copyrights to foreign authors is an important Government interest for the simple reason that it will afford United States authors more copyright protection .
As Plaintiffs ' position remains unrebutted by the Government , summary judgment in Plaintiffs ' favor is also appropriate on this issue .
V. CONCLUSION Congress has a legitimate interest in complying with the terms of the Berne Convention .
The Berne Convention , however , affords each member nation discretion to restore the copyrights of foreign authors in a manner consistent with that member nation 's own body of copyright law .
In the United States , that body of law includes the bedrock principle that works in the public domain remain in the public domain .
Removing works from the public domain violated 19 Plaintiffs ' vested First Amendment interests .
In light of the discretion afforded it by the Berne Convention , Congress could have complied with the Convention without interfering with Plaintiffs ' protected speech .
Accordingly -- to the extent Section 514 suppresses the right of reliance parties to use works they exploited while the works were in the public domain -- Section 514 is substantially broader than necessary to achieve the Government 's interest .
On the basis of the record before the Court , I conclude no evidence exists showing whether the Government 's two additional justifications for implementing Section 514-- Section 514 helps protect the copyright interests of United States authors abroad ; and Section 514 corrects for historic inequities wrought on foreign authors who lost their United States copyrights through no fault of their own -- constitute important Government interests , or whether Section 514 is narrowly tailored to meet those interests .
Accordingly , the Government 's motion [ Docket # 147 ] is DENIED ; Plaintiffs ' motion [ Docket # 148 ] is GRANTED .

SUMAPAZ , Colombia ( Reuters ) - Facing a lake covered by low - lying clouds , spiritual leader Arwa Viku burns leaves hoping that the smoke will carry his message , his voice mixing with the sound of waves lapping the grass - lined shore .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Here in mountainous central Colombia , Viku ’s Arhuaca Indian tribe is concerned that the country ’s water supply is being threatened by an expanding unregulated agricultural sector .
They also worry about a four - decade - old guerrilla war in which leftist rebels plant landmines and military counterstrikes disrupt the ecosystem .
Viku looks up at the smoke and prays for a restoration of the water supply .
The ritual is focused on this country ’s “ paramos ” , or flat zones found on mountain ranges .
The areas , located at heights over 9,800 feet , are filled with grass , shrubs and other vegetation that absorb water and feed Colombia ’s rivers .
“ More than half the planet has already been destroyed , ” the mustachioed Viku says , his eyes peering out from under his traditional white conical hat .
“ Our Mother earth has been violated and mistreated .
So please help us to take care of what is left .
Besides being good to us every day , the planet gives us warnings and makes more demands on us , because we ’ve turned against it , ” he added .
Colombia is known for its ample supplies of fresh water .
But the war -- which began in the 1960s with the birth of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , rebel movement -- has combined with global warming to damage the environment .
The chemical - heavy process of making the cocaine that finances the FARC has also taken its toll on Colombia ’s ecosystems .
A U.S. - backed security campaign has pushed the guerrillas into remote rural areas , where violence , cocaine production and related environmental damage goes unchecked .
Viku and a handful of other Arhuaca members scratch stones together , sparking fire to burn dried leaves and send smoke from this paramo to others around the country where water supplies are at risk .
They wear white pants and robes cinched at the waist by decorated belts .
“ We sing to the water because it is alive , it hears , it has feelings .
It is a living thing , ” female tribe member Ati Quigua told Reuters .
“ We are drops from the same river , part of the same water cycle . ”
The paramos are crucial to maintaining the Magdalena River , which , like the Mississippi in the United States , cuts through the heart of the country .
They also feed the Orinoco River , which connects Colombia to neighboring Venezuela and Brazil .
State environmental official Emilio Rodriguez agrees that the situation in the paramos is “ worrying ” , considering that they are a key water source for capital city Bogota .
“ A lot of the problems ( confronting the paramos ) are structural problems having to do with land care and colonizers who arrive in nearby areas , some of which are protected , ” Rodriguez said .
Poor Colombians , some displaced by war , regularly arrive in national parks looking for fertile land to build subsistence farms , larger plantations and cattle ranches .
These illegal operations go unregulated and can do extensive environmental damage .
“ This area should be declared sacred territory , a water sanctuary , ” Quigua said .
Windows 95 is twenty today .
It 's hard to imagine it now , but the launch was greeted with the sort of hype that only Apple generates today : the Empire State Building lit in Windows colours , midnight queues outside PC shops , wall - to - wall news coverage and that Rolling Stones riff .
To some , the arrival of Windows 95 heralded a brave new world of personal computing ; to others , it was the beginning of a long period of stagnation for the PC platform .
There 's no doubt that if you were running Windows 3.1 or 3.11 , Windows 95 was like a visitor from the planet Groovy .
No , really .
It looked great , and provided you treated the system requirements - a 386 with 4MB of RAM and 120 MB of disk space - with the contempt they deserved then it ran great too .
Heavily targeted towards home users as well as the more traditional corporate users , it was the first stand - alone Windows ( MS - DOS was part of it rather than a separate OS ) .
It had an exciting new interface that 's still visible in Windows 7 , and it even had Microsoft 's first go at a Web browser - albeit one that was initially tucked away on the optional - extra Plus pack .
The beginning of the big boots
Critics , however , would argue that Windows 95 was when Microsoft started throwing its weight around .
They argue that by bundling MS - DOS inside Windows , Microsoft killed the market for MS - DOS rivals ; the arrival of Internet Explorer would become the Netscape - crushing browser war ; and the US Department of Justice found that it used the " Windows Tax " - that is , offering manufacturers discounted prices if they promised to limit the number of non-Windows PCs they sold - to stifle competition .
In 1998 consumer advocate Ralph Nader wrote a devastating critique that accused Microsoft of " suffocating " the PC industry and argued that " the victims of Microsoft 's monopolistic activities are n't just the companies that go belly - up ; they are the consumers who pay high prices to use mediocre and unreliable products . "
It 's bleakly amusing to note that when the ( then ) Microsoft - owned Slate magazine responded to Nader , it argued that " in the browser wars , Microsoft faces a formidable array of opponents -- Sun and Oracle , to name just two -- and , after two years , it still lags behind Netscape even though IE generally gets better reviews than Navigator . "
A force for good
Let 's concentrate on the product itself , though , because when you do that Windows 95 was clearly a force for good too .
It was a vast improvement over its predecessors .
It revolutionised PC gaming .
It made using computers - computers that we could actually afford to build or buy - much easier than before .
You may mock its primitive graphics ( its press - Start - to - stop interface , its increasingly demented product names - Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 , anyone ? - and its postie - crippling pile of installation floppies ) but twenty years ago , Windows 95 was as cool as computing got .
Microsoft may never be as cool again as it was back then and while Android and iOS now dominate the OS landscape , Windows 95 was the milestone that saw Microsoft become a true technology giant .
... the news headlines include a number of stories that reflect the persistence of a past that is everlasting and does not wish to pass ...

Sorry folks you can't take youron board !
Picture taken by our local partner at Nairobi Wilson Airport .
From the ' read the fine print ' files :
Microsoft put out their monthly Patch Tuesday update yesterday , including several updates for Internet Explorer ( IE ) , but none for IE 8 .
This surprised me .
After all , was n't a flaw found in IE 8 last month at the PWN2OWN hacking contest ?
In fact , Safari , IE 8 and Firefox 3 were all hit with a vulnerability at PWN2OWN .
Mozilla has already patched Firefox .
So what about IE 8 ?
As it turns out , the release of IE 8 that is now available is not vulnerable after all .
" The build of Internet Explorer 8 used in the Pwn2 Own contest was not the RTW build released on March 19 , 2009 to customers , " Microsoft wrote in an email to me .
Nils ( the hacker who cracked IE 8 ) AT PWN2OWN did not use the final version of IE 8 and apparently there were some fixes in the final build .
So technically speaking then , IE 8 ( the final release version ) to date has not yet been hit with any public vulnerabilities and has not been publicly cracked / hacked either .
With Microsoft pushing IE 8 to its users now via the Automatic Update process , the fact that IE 8 remains secure and un-cracked ( publicly ) is a great thing .
Microsoft though it takes more than its fair share of blame for all IT security problems ( can you say Conficker ? ) is doing the right thing with IE 8 , so far at least .
Time will tell , whether I 'm wrong and in fact Nils , or someone else can still exploit IE 8 .
It 's likely just a matter of time , but for now at least , new IE 8 users do n't need to worry that some known flaw is out there waiting to get them .
Psychologists Told CIA Waterboarding Was Safe Despite red flags , CIA followed the program of Bruce Jessen and Jim Mitchell .
May 1 , 2009  --
There is new scrutiny into the role of two psychologists who made an estimated $ 1,000 a day to oversee and advise the CIA 's interrogation of captured terrorists .
Both men , doctors Jim Mitchell and Bruce Jessen , assured the CIA that their methods could ' break ' a terrorist and would be safe , according to two former high - ranking CIA officials and a collection of recently declassified Bush administration memos .
The major problem , according to those who knew the two retired military psychologists , was that neither Mitchell nor Jessen had ever conducted a real interrogation , or been involved in an intelligence operation .
When they became involved in interrogations for the CIA , " that was their first step into the world of intelligence , " says Air Force Colonel Steve Kleinman , a career military interrogator and former colleague of both Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen .
" That was their very first experience with it .
Everything else was role - play . "
Kleinman and two other former colleagues tell ABC News that neither Mitchell nor Jessen had any experience with al Qaeda , Islamic extremists or battlefield interrogations .
And yet , more than anyone else , Mitchell and Jessen , long - time friends and colleagues , shaped the CIA 's interrogation program , according to the two former CIA officials .
The debate over the CIA 's so called " Enhanced Interrogation Techniques " has picked up in recent weeks after the Obama administration released a set of legal memos written during the Bush presidency , and a Senate committee report that details the origins of interrogation policy during the Bush administration .
" If the psychologists told the CIA or the Office of Legal Counsel that these methods would n't amount to torture as a matter of science , I think those psychologists were essentially aiding in torture , " says Jameel Jaffer , who directed the American Civil Liberties Union 's fight to secure the memos ' release .
In addition to questions of legality investigations have begun in Congress into the effectiveness of Mitchell and Jessen 's program .
According to Sen. Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , chair of the Armed Services Committee , whose report identifies Mitchell and Jessen as important to the creation of interrogation policies , little could have been gained by the harsh methods .
" These tactics are more likely to produce unreliable evidence than they are to produce any reliable information , " he told ABC News .
" The use of these tactics tends to increase resistance on the part of the detainee to cooperating with us .
So they have the exact opposite effect of what [ the U.S. would ] want . "
Declassified Memos Contradict 2007 ABC
News Interview with John Kiriakou
The memos also revealed that waterboarding was used " with far greater frequency that initially indicated , " according to an excerpt from a report by the CIA Inspector General .
Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded at least 83 times and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times , according to the memos .
The new figures sharply contradict an interview with former CIA intelligence officer John Kiriakou who told ABC News in December , 2007 that Zubaydah had only been waterboarded once and talked freely afterwards .
Kiriakou , who led the capture of Zubaydah and was the first from inside the CIA to publicly confirm the use of waterboarding , now says he , too , was unaware of the many times Zubaydah was waterboarded .
Kiriakou told ABC
News , " When I spoke to ABC News in December 2007 I was aware of Abu Zubaydah being waterboarded on one occasion .
It was after this one occasion that he revealed information related to a planned terrorist attack .
As I said in the original interview , my information was second - hand .
I never participated in the use of enhanced techniques on Abu Zubaydah or on any other prisoner , nor did I witness the use of such techniques . "
As to the private contractors used by the CIA to create and oversee the 10 - step brutal interrogation program , two former high - ranking CIA officials confirm to ABC News that Mitchell and Jessen were the architects of the CIA 's interrogation program , and were hired as independent contractors to administer and direct the so - called " high value detainee " interrogation .
Based on their suggestions and ideas , submitted by the CIA , the Justice Department approved a set of 10 techniques in August , 2002 , that would be used on Abu Zubaydah and subsequent al Qaeda captures .
Both are said to have been present in multiple CIA secret prisons , sources tell ABC News , regulating everything from sleep deprivation and stress positions to forced nudity and placing insects in a " confinement box . "
Sources tell ABC News that the pair traveled the world for the CIA .
For their services , they told friends that they were paid $ 1,000 per day overseas , tax - free , plus expenses .
Mitchell recently built a dream home in Florida , purchased a Lexus and BMW .
And as early as 2002 , Mitchell and Jessen opened a consulting business that employed as many as 60 people .
Neither would answer questions posed by ABC News , saying they were upholding confidentiality agreements with the U.S. government .

Colleagues of Mitchell and Jessen Raised Red Flags
Although Mitchell and Jessen had been previously identified as being CIA contractors who influenced the CIA 's controversial interrogation techniques , the recently released government documents reveal how deeply the pair were involved in developing an interrogation program based on their expertise as psychologists in classified military training regimen intended to help U.S. soldiers and pilots resist coercion and torture in the event of capture , called SERE .
The classified program , which stands for Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape , was a legacy of the Cold War , when U.S. soldiers captured by Communist regimes were brutalized and used as propaganda trophies .
SERE was also designed to cope with the tactics of countries and governments that did not abide by the Geneva Convention , which prohibits torture and governs the rules of war .
An obscure Department of Defense unit , called the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency ( JPRA ) , for which Dr. Jessen served as a psychological expert and trainer , is assigned the task of overseeing all SERE training giving to the various special forces in the U.S. military .
Dr. Mitchell , though assigned to the special operations unit of the Air Force , worked closely with Dr. Jessen for nearly two decades at Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane , WA .
The Senate Armed Services Committee recently released a study of interrogation policies in the military after 9/11 .
The report describes the influence Dr. Jessen had as chief psychologist of JPRA , and his colleague , Dr. Mitchell on the role of SERE tactics in shaping interrogation policy .
According to the report , Mitchell and Jessen 's SERE expertise , " lies in training U.S. military personnel who are at risk for capture , how to respond and resist interrogations ( a defensive mission ) , not in how to conduct interrogations ( an offensive mission ) . "
Despite a flurry of red flags from Mitchell and Jessen 's colleagues , senior Pentagon and CIA officials agreed to adopt their program .
Col .
Kleinman says Mitchell and Jessen were way out their league advocating and creating an interrogation model .
" What they failed to understand was they were stepping out of their area of expertise , " he says .
" There was nobody , apparently , at the decision - making level that had enough expertise and experience in the area of interrogation to quickly see the disconnect between the SERE model , a resistance model , and an actual interrogation for intelligence purposes . "
CIA : Interrogation Program Guided by Legal Opinions from DOJ
Now , investigators will look to see if the harsh techniques worked and the ACLU and Jameel Jaffer are interested in determining if Mitchell and Jessen misled the U.S. government about the intensity of their interrogation program .
Jaffer points out that according to a CIA Inspector General report , the " expertise of the SERE psychologists / interrogators on the waterboard was probably misrepresented . "
As a result , the IG report continued , there is no reason to believe that the technique was effective , or " medically safe . "
So how did it happen that the CIA and the U.S. government came to rely so heavily on two inexperienced interrogators for the nations more important interrogations ?
Kleinman is dumbfounded .
" The best I can come up with was the people doing the hiring did not even understand the challenge in front of them . "
The CIA told ABC News that the " agency 's terrorist interrogation program was guided by legal opinions from the Department of Justice . "

A multi-agency task force arrested 42 alleged taggers across Los Angeles County today in an early morning sweep of probationers .
The anti-graffiti task force nabbed 23 probation violators and found 15 firearms as officers searched the homes of dozens of taggers on probation .
" This eyesore of graffiti is something no one respects and desires , " Sheriff Lee Baca said .
Among those detained was a tagger who uses the names Asko and Sloter and is believed responsible for vandalizing 88 buses , Baca said .
" This man has tagged more things than everyone else combined , " Baca said .

The editor of some Gannett paper issued a memo asking reporters to " reserve social networking ... for your private time , " since it 's not like you can find sources on Facebook and Twitter .
The editor , not named , said spending " a lot of time " on Facebook on Twitter was inappropriate .
Employees quickly responded in the comments section of Gannett Blog .
It turns out USA Today is among multiple other Gannett papers were reporters are being encouraged to spend more time on social networking — just the opposite of the anonymous editor 's orders .
Company Vice President Tara Connell , meanwhile , seems to connect with plenty of co-workers using her Facebook account .
As one reporter put it , " Facebook is a modern day Rolodex . "
Exactly , and if those infernal tele - phones had never been given out like candy to individual reporters , maybe newspapers would be in better shape today !

I ’ve been reading Kitchen gardening in America : a history / by David M. Tucker .
It ’s a really fascinating overview of who grew personal vegetable gardens , what they grew , the techniques they used , and their philosophical outlook on gardening from colonial times through about 1980 .
After the cut , I shall ramble on endlessly about three main points :
How “ Three Sisters ” gardens were actually planted
The fact that from 1941 - 1943 , personal vegetable plots were labeled “ UNPATRIOTIC ” by the US Government ( yeah , this one made me stand on my head … )
Why I found this book much more inspiring than Patricia Klindienst ’s The Earth Knows My Name
Three Sisters Gardening
Finally – FINALLY – I find a description based on actual observations of how an Iroquois - style “ three sisters ” garden was laid out .
Corn was planted in hills 3′ apart .
Four kernels of corn were placed in each hill .
The presence of fish is debatable ; it ’s quite possible Squanto learned this trick when he was in England .
In any case , the fish in question would have been alewife or other small fish that spawn upstream in huge masses .
The beans were * not* planted at the same time – the corn was given a good head start .
Squash was planted last , either between the hills , or on any hills that did n’t sprout their corn .
Additionally , a fourth sister , sunflower , was planted at the edges of the field .
Victory Gardens
Holy cow .
I ’m looking at “ victory gardens ” a whole new way now .
I ’ll try to be succinct .
During WWI , people planted “ war gardens ” to ensure they would have enough to eat .
A non-government - affiliated civilian , Charles Pack , created the National Emergency Food Garden Commission .
The government got rather ticked off at him for rallying such support , especially with a name that implied federal endorsement .
However , once war was declared in 1917 , the government did endorse War Gardens and put one in on the White House lawn .
When WWII came around , the USDA went on the offensive to ensure no Charles Packs would emerge .
Why ?
The official line was that no amateur gardener could harvest enough food to make it worth the expenditure of seeds and chemical fertilizer , which was now preferred over manure .
( Keep in mind chemical fertilizer and bombs are made of the same stuff . )
My hunch is also that large farmers did n’t want the competition and the government wanted the illusion of normalcy .
Within a couple weeks of Pearl Harbor , they were letting the country know that there should be NO repeat of the war garden effort , and in fact said that home gardening was unpatriotic .
Eleanor Roosevelt was told there was no suitable place to plant a garden near the White House when she asked in 1941 .
Tearing out part of the Rose Garden was expressly forbidden , as that would be completely at odds with the “ official ” message of the day – that digging up ornamentals was a rash , panicky action and we ’ll be having none of that , thank you .
For two years , local Victory Garden boards fought this government slander and continued their efforts to plow up parks , create community gardens , give away seeds , and help folks garden .
Finally , in 1943 , the USDA admitted there might be shortages of certain foods ( mostly veggies ) because large commercial farmers were being asked to focus on staples like wheat .
Canned goods were rationed for the first time .
The number of Victory Gardens skyrocketed , Eleanor got her Victory Garden , and finally the USDA started putting out all those pretty posters implying that gardening was a good thing to do to help the war effort .
In 1944 , rationing of canned goods ended , and 30 % of the victory gardens shut down .
The Victory Garden campaign continued to the end of the war , but numbers of gardens kept decreasing .
( Though curiously , sales of seeds never fell off .
So what do we learn from this ?
The People have always led the gardening movement .
Whenever we feel our food system is insecure , we grab shovels and plant gardens .
When food is plentiful and cheap , gardening slacks off .
Government gardening propaganda has little effect on numbers of gardens .
Giving people space , dirt , compost , seeds , and tools has an astounding effect on local food production .
Why I found this book so inspiring
I can relate to this book .
One of the amazing things is shows is the cycles American kitchen gardening has gone through over time .
The boom - and - bust of Victory Gardens is one ; the move from manure to chemicals and back to manure is another .
Ideas that I thought were fairly new turned out to be decades or centuries old : double - dug raised beds ; teaching troubled kids to garden ; the interdependence of plants , worms , and fungi in good soil .
I like feeling connected to a history of gardeners .
And it turns out , people from many backgrounds , ethnicities , and socioeconomic strata all garden for similar reasons I do : because they want a sure supply of healthy food ; because they like working outdoors with living plants ; and because they love to tinker and see what they can accomplish with their own two hands .
When times get tough , we plant more gardens .
They may not last , but maybe they do n’t need to .
They ’ll come back when the need comes back .
I found Kitchen Gardening in America by accident when I went to pick up The Earth Knows My Name .
Klindienst profiles a number of gardeners of different ethnicities .
The profiles are interesting , but they very much “ someone else ’s garden . ”
I do n’t come from a strong gardening tradition , unlike all the folks in her book .
My family members have always had gardens , but I did n’t learn rituals of corn planting at my grandmother ’s knee .
All these folks talk about the legacy they ’re leaving their own children , and as kids are not likely in my future , that put a little more distance between me and these gardeners .
I * could * see myself in Tucker ’s book – not only in my own garden , but as part of several larger gardening movements .
So – both are worth a read , but Kitchen Gardening in America is the book that made me want to redouble the size of my garden this weekend .

AWARE , a 25 - year - old Singaporean women 's right organization , recently found itself in turmoil after a coup orchestrated by conservative fundamentalist Christians who signed up in large numbers just before the annual general meeting , then elected a new executive that immediately purged the organization of all its traditional leadership down to the subcommittee chairs .
AWARE held its annual general meeting ( AGM ) on 28 March 2009 .
There were over 100 people present .
Of them , about 80 had only joined the organisation between January and March , one to three months before the meeting .
Nine out of 12 executive committee ( EXCO ) places , including four Office Bearer positions , went to newcomers , who were voted in by wide majorities .
There are wide - ranging suspicions that this " leadership grab " has been orchestrated by a well - organised group who do not share AWARE 's values and who are seeking to use the name and the resources of a well - respected institution to further their own agenda .
These concerns have been expressed not only by onlookers , but by older members of Aware …
# The new president , Josie Lau and 5 other Exco members belong to the same church , Church of Our Saviour .
Given this , it is very likely , in our view , that they have acted in concert to take over AWARE .
We do not know why as they have refused to disclose their reasons to either members of AWARE or to the press and this makes us even more worried .
They , or persons whom they have been associated with , have written homophobic letters to the press .
While that is their personal conviction to which they are entitled , we do not want AWARE to be made into a vehicle for any hidden agenda .
# Josie Lau , was in charge of the DBS Charity Drive in support of Focus On The Family , US - based Christian organisation that is opposed to abortion and equal rights for sexual minorities .
This created a controversy last year which was well - documented .
# 160 members , including former AWARE committee members and founder members , petitioned for an extraordinary general meeting to consider a vote of no confidence in the New Exco on the basis that the New Exco has not acted and is not acting in the best interest of AWARE ; does not appreciate or share the values of AWARE and does not have the requisite experience of carrying out AWARE 's work or is otherwise inadequate to further AWARE 's objectives .
An EGM will be held on 2 May 2009 .
Mr Lutsenko admitted he had drunk a beer before the flight to Seoul Ukraine 's interior minister has offered to resign after being detained at Frankfurt airport after an altercation with police while apparently drunk .
Yuri Lutsenko said he was the victim of a banal situation that had been turned into a scandal for political reasons .
Mr Lutsenko's resignation has to be approved by the Ukrainian parliament .
German reports said the minister and his son had reacted angrily to being prevented from boarding a flight and thrown their mobile phones at officers .
Four policemen were injured in the incident , German media cited police as saying .
' Apology '
At a news conference in Kiev on Tuesday , Mr Lutsenko said he had asked Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and the speaker of parliament to consider his offer of resignation at the earliest opportunity .
" I have become the victim of a banal situation blown up into a political scandal because of domestic squabbles inside Ukraine , " he said .
Mr Lutsenko denied that he had been drunk and disorderly , although admitted that he had consumed a beer before attempting to board the flight to Seoul .
He said police had surrounded members of the Ukrainian delegation and that he had become angry when his 19 - year - old son , whom he claimed had recently undergone an operation and therefore would not have been allowed to consume alcohol , was handcuffed .
The minister said the head of police in the state of Hessen had apologised to him for the incident before the delegation was booked onto another flight .
He also said he would sue the German newspaper , Bild , for libel .
If Mr Lutsenko 's resignation is approved , it will leave the country without three key ministers .
Finance Minister Viktor Pynzenyk resigned in February after clashing with Ms Tymoshenko , while Foreign Minister Volodymyr Ohryzko was dismissed by MPs in March for his handling of government policy .
Ukraine has been hamstrung by a deep rift between parties supporting Ms Tymoshenko and President Viktor Yushchenko , which has crippled many of the normal functions of government .

Haxe 2.03 has just been released on http://haxe.org
SWC Support
This new release includes some still experimental SWC output feature .
SWC is the library format used by Flash .
Haxe only supports SWC for Flash9 +.
The idea is that a lot of people that write AS3 libraries would really love to use
Haxe because of the language and its performances , but can't because their users are using AS3 .
So far it was already possible to generate AS3 code from Haxe code , but at this time you were losing all Haxe compiler performances improvements .
Now since SWC contains the bytecode as it was compiled by Haxe , you can write your library in Haxe and distribute the SWC for AS3 users .
Read http://haxe.org/doc/advanced/swc for more informations on SWC output .
Once we are sure it works well , I guess the next step will be to add SWC input to Haxe , so you can reuse existing AS3 libraries directly ( it 's currently possible to do so by using -- gen - hx - classes but it has some issues as well ) .
More Optimizations
Haxe 2.03 also adds new optimizations , including a strong constant expression optimizer .
In fact , it often happens after doing some inlining that some expressions are useless .
Takes the following example :
class
Test { static inline function foo ( max , callb , flag ) { for ( i in 0 ... max * 3 ) callb ( flag ?
i : - i ) ; } static function main ( ) { var x = 0 ; foo ( 50 , function ( i ) x += i, true ) ; } }
Since we inline the function , it 's the same as writing the following :
var x = 0 ; for ( i in 0 ...50 * 3 ) ( function ( i ) x += i ) ( true ?
i : - i ) ;
With new Haxe constant expression optimizer , it will reduce the expression to the following :
var x = 0 ; for ( i in 0 ... 150 ) x += i ;
The constant expression optimizer can handle the following patterns :
Wow .
That 's all I can say after transcribing Green Leader Jane Sterk 's comments on crime in today 's televised debate .
Whereas B.C. Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell and NDP Leader Carole James kept trying to outdo one another with their Republican law - and - order banter , Sterk stood out in stark contrast by emphasizing her opposition to prohibition .
“ If more police , more prisons and more prosecutors was a solution to safer streets , the United States and China would be the safest countries on the planet , and they ’re not , " Sterk said in her opening comment on the issue .
" We believe that the root cause of the gang violence that we see in the Lower Mainland and elsewhere in British Columbia is directly related to prohibition of substances .
The last time we saw this kind of gang violence — this kind of murderous gang violence — was when there was prohibition against alcohol in the 20s and 30s .
When that ended , the gang violence ended .
So we need to get into prevention . "
Sterk also said on more than one occasion that we " cannot police ourselves out of social problems " .
" So we need to create the social infrastructure to take care of people so we prevent them from getting into gangs , " she said .
The NDP 's James , on the other hand , said her party has put forward a plan for putting more police on the streets and creating a dedicated team of Crown prosecutors .
" We ’ve doubled the number of police that are put forward in the Liberal plan , " James said .
" We ’re making sure our streets are safe .
And we ’re also going to make sure we focus on prevention to make sure we keep young people out of gangs . ”
Campbell responded that his government has hired more than 1,100 additional police officers since it was elected in 2001 — and this year , another 168 officers have been added .
" Gangs are not welcome in British Columbia , " Campbell said .
" We ’re going to go after them with additional police officers .
We ’re going after them with additional prosecutors .
We ’re working with the federal government to make sure that they toughen the Criminal Code so we make sure our police officers actually have the tools they need .
But you know , I think we should recognize the integrated task force we have are doing a great job on behalf of all of us .
Over a dozen gang leaders have been put behind bars in the last few weeks alone .
And that ’s a real tribute to our police forces . ”
James and Campbell then debated the meaning of the provincial budget , which called for a $ 10 - million reduction in courts and prosecutors .
That prompted Sterk to say that she felt she was n't present in the debate because Campbell and James kept perpetuating an argument that we can police our way out of social problems .
" It costs $ 55,000 to keep someone in poverty in this province , " Sterk said .
" It costs $ 140,000 to hire a police officer .
At some point in time , we have to look at the way we ’re spending our money so that we start to have different choices and make different choices .
We have to deal with prohibition .
Get these substances out of the hands of the bad guys , and control the supply and distribution . ”

上記のように先日予告した通り 、The Economist 「企業 IT 」 特集ペー ジ " Let it rise " のエッセンスをまとめたメモを作成した。もともと自分用にまとめてあったものをブログに上げるために修正したのだが、原文の章のタイトルなどで、雲（cloud）、雨雲（nimbus）など、気象現象を使った比喩が多く使われており、英文の意味をきちんと扱えているか自信がない。しかも自分用と言うことで多少バイアスがかかっているだろう。だがクラウド・コンピューティングを取り巻く環境を眺めるには手頃な長さのメモだと思うので、このブログに掲載することにする。（以下では、図をクリックすると、The Economist の原文に飛ぶようになっている。）
歴史上、コンピュータは新技術とニーズによって、その姿と場所をいろいろと変え、その変化はプラットフォーム・シフトなどと呼ばれてきた。この特集ではさらに新たな形態をとりつつあるコンピューティングを議論する。それは一度は分散化されたコンピュータが再び集中化してデータセンターに置かれていく形態である。重要なことは、それが「クラウド」（雲）あるいは「クラウド」の集合（" cloud " or collections of clouds ）と呼ばれるものになっていることである。そこではコンピューティング・パワーの実体がなくなり（disembodied）、必要なところで必要なときに消費されるようになっている。
クラウドの登場 （the rise of the cloud）は、単にもう一つのプラットフォーム・シフトというだけでなく、情報技術（IT）産業、さらには業務や企業運営を変えていく可能性がある。経済の隅々までデジタル技術が浸透することになり、政治的な問題も生み出すことになる。
Promise of heaven
「 クラウド・コンピューティング 」 （" cloud computing " ）という言葉 が IT 分野で登場して１年、流行語となっていたが、実は既にそのピークを迎えている（図1 : Cumulonimbus（積乱雲））。言葉自体は時代遅れになりつつも、クラウドそのものは存在し成長し続けている。安くパワフルなプロセッサ、広く行き渡った高速ネットワーク。これにより産業規模で、データセンターがコンピューティング・サービスの工場となり、より多くのソフトウェアがオンラインのサービスとして配信され、無線ネットワークにたくさんの機器がつながって、そのサービスを受けられるようになりつつある。
そこではコンピューティングが IT 用語でいうところの 「 サービス」という部品に分解され、「サービスのインターネット 」 （" internet of services " ）を形成する 。PC を使って物理的なネットワーク経由でインターネットにアクセスするのがクラウドの主要な使い方であるが、一方クラウドのアプリケーションは、あらゆる種類のデバイスが、何10億という数で無線でつながって利用される。クラウドのアプリケーションは「 もののインターネット 」 （" internet of things " ）につながっていくのである。
クラウドはまずは消費者向けに空に浮かんでいる。米国インターネット利用者の
69 % が何らかの形で 「 クラウド・サービス 」 （" cloud service " ）、つま り
Web メールやオンライン・ストレージなどを利用している
。Google がよい例で、オンラインのワープロや表計算を提供している（図2 : A young cloud） 。
Learning to float
かなり用心深く、ではあるものの、企業もクラウドへ動きつつある。金融機関は時間をかけて
" computing grids " を構築してきた。法人向けにインターネット経由でソフトウェアを提供する
SaaS ( Software as a Service ) 企業 、Salesforce.com や NetSuite は着実に成長している。
今後数年間でさらに多くの会社が思い切ってクラウドに取り組んでくるだろう。それには二つの理由がある。
Amazon や Google のようなクラウド・コンピューティングのオペレータが、クラウドにより
IT システムをかなり効率的に動かすことを示してきた。 多くの企業にとって他の選択肢がないと考えられる。企業内データセンターはフルに使われていない計算機の置き場所と化し、さらに多くのスペース、電力、人間を必要としてきている。景気減速の中、より効率的な運営が求められ、クラウド・コンピューティングが有望な選択肢になりつつある。
この特集では、クラウド・コンピューティングの夜明け（rise of the cloud）を年代記として書き留め、今後クラウドがどこに向かうのかを予測したい。以下の三つの観点を見て行く。
インフラストラクチ ャ
アプリケーショ ン
周辺 --- 現実世界と出合うところ
クラウドが IT 産業や経済全体に与えるインパクト：
IBM の技術ビジョナリーである Irving Wladawsky - Berger は、クラウド・コンピューティングをカンブリア紀の大爆発にたとえている。細胞が完成し標準的になったことにより生物進化のスピードが加速されたように、コンピューティングの基本コンポーネントが完成し標準化された今、もっと大きくて複雑な高次のシステムが現れることが可能になったのである。
Where the cloud meets the ground （雲が地面と出合う場所 ）
データセンターがサービスの工場へと短期間で進化している
13メートル長のコンテナに 2,500台ものサーバが詰め込まれ、ビルに運び込まれる。電力・ネットワークにつなぎ、冷却用の水道が提供される。必要なソフトウェアはダウンロードされ、4日もかからずに企業顧客向けにデータセンターの準備ができる。これが可能な
Microsoft がシカゴ近郊に作った新しいデータセンターは、46,000平米の敷地に
40万台のサーバが入れられ、5億ドルのコストがかかっている。
一方、大きな企業も自前でデータセンターを持っていて、その数はアメリカだけで
7,000 に上ると見られている。しかしその中で平均してわずか 6 % のサーバだけが使われており、30 % は既に使われなくなっているという調査報告もある。新しいアプリケーションが作られるたびに、新しいサーバを貪欲に追加してきたからである（図3 : Voracious）。サーバが安く、上がり続ける電気代が
IT ではなく建物にチャージされる時代には、それでもよかった。
このデータセンター産業で必要とされている技術が「仮想化 」（" virtualisation " ）である。仮想化により、物理的に分かれたコンピュータを、一つのコンピュータとして動かすことが可能となる。
Virtually new
VMware は1960年代からある仮想化技術をデータセンター内にあるコモディティとなった計算機に応用したソフトウェア会社である。ハイパーバイザー（hypervisor）と呼ばれるプログラムがプロセッサやメモリへのアクセスを制御して交通整理を行う。これにより、サーバを複数の「仮想マシン 」（" virtual machine " ）に分割し、それぞれの仮想マシン上で独立して
OS やアプリケーションを動かすことができる。このように計算能力をハードウェアから独立させるのが仮想化である。仮想マシンは数分で立ち上がり、実行中も他のサーバに移動させることができる。電力をセーブするために一つのサーバで集中して動かすこともできれば、複数のサーバで二重化して故障に備えることもできる。
VMware やそのライバル会社（今や Microsoft もその一つ）は、一つあるいは複数のデータセンターを、一つのコンピューティング資源、ストレージ（記憶）、ネットワーク資源のプールに変えてしまおうとしている。計算資源を、必要な時に必要なだけ割り当てることが可能になる。VMware の「 仮想データセンター OS 」 （" virtual data - centre OS " ）はそれを狙ったものだ 。
おそらく驚く人が多いだろうが、この世界の開拓者は世界最大のオンライン小売業者である
Amazon である。2006 年から Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) というコンピューティング・ユーテリティを提供している。クレジットカードさえ持っていれば誰でも、Amazon が持つ大規模な計算機システム上の仮想マシンを起動して、Web サービスのようなアプリケーションを動かすことができる。Elastic Computing Cloud ( EC2 ) の名の通り、必要なだけ仮想マシンを追加したり減らしたりできる。そしてこのサービスは安い。仮想マシン一台あたり
1時間 10セントから使える。
Amazon だけではない 。Google も世界規模に 3 ダースものデータセンターを持ち 、200万台以上のサーバを動かしていると言われている（Google は正式には認めないだろうが） 。Microsoft は 1ヶ月 に 35,000台ものサーバを追加するために 10億もの投資を行っているし、Yahoo!
も大規模なサーバファームを構築中である。
ますます計算機能力が求められる一方で、企業の
IT 予算は削られている。サーバのためのスペース、冷却、データセンターの電力・電気代などが今後、データセンター構築の大きな制約になってくる。
Fewer , bigger , better
今後データセンターは効率のために集約されていくと思われる。HP
は 19,000人の IT スタッフで 85 ものデータセンターを世界中で運営していたが、2008年末までに
8,000 人、米国内 6つの施設に集約する。それにより IT 予算を売上の 4 % から 2 % まで削減することが期待されている。
BT は VMware を使って 、57 のデータセンターにあったサーバを 16,000 から 10,000 まで減らした。このように企業は、自社内に「プライベートな」クラウドを構築し始めている。景気悪化の中、効率的な運営が求められるために、さらにこの傾向はスピードアップすると考えられる。
企業の内部クラウドを 、Amazon のような 「パブリックな」クラウドにアウトソースすることは、どの程度までできるだろうか？IT
予算が厳しい小さい企業はそうせざるを得ないし、クラウド提供者（クラウド・プロバイダ）はデータセンター運営の専門家でもある。しかしながら、多くの企業は自社データを誰の手に渡るかわからないパブリック・クラウドに持ってはいかないだろうと考えられている。サービスの継続性、安全性といった
SLA ( service - level agreement ) を保証しているクラウドはほとんどない。
結果的に、クラウド・コンピューティングは、まだ early - adopter の段階にとどまっていると、ある調査会社は言う。大きな企業が、まだミッション・クリティカルでないプロジェクトに使っているだけであると。たとえばワシントン・ポストがヒラリー・クリントンのホワイトハウスでの日程表を
AWS に置いたり 、NASDAQ が Market Replay と呼ばれる過去の株式市場の情報を載せたり、といった具合である。
BT の IT インフラ責任者は、パブリック・クラウドの中で、壁を仕切った「 仮想的なプライベート・クラウド 」 （" virtual private clouds " ）が提供されるべきだと考えている。また
BT 自身がそういうサービスを提供する計画である。
何種類ものクラウドが出現するだろう。プライベートかパブリックか、という区別の他に、汎用か特別な目的のためか、という軸もある。Cisco はさまざまなクラウドを連合させる「インタークラウド 」 （" intercloud " ）の考えについて言及し始めている。そして、これらすべてのクラウドは、アプリケーションとサービスでいっぱいに満たされることになるだろう。

現実はそう単純なものではないが、プログラミングの知識がなくても簡単なアプリケーションは作ることができる。この「プログラミングの民主化」の流れは、ソフトウェアの本質が根本的に変わってきていることに基づいている。それはソフトウェアが大きな一つの塊ではなく、電子サービスの組み合わせ・結合により作られるということである。この新しいアプリケーション構築方法は「サービス指向アーキテクチャ 」（" serivce - oriented architecture " , SOA ） として知られている 。

Iceberg のようなツールを使って、さまざまなサービスを組み合わせて、自分用のクラウド（雲）を作ることができる。

→ ミニコン → PC と利用者の手元にデータを置くのがよかった。しかし今は安価で高速なネットワークがあり、しかもそれがどんどんワイヤレス（無線)になっている。モジュール化されたサブルーチンが、インターネットを超えて別の計算機にあるのが「 Web サービス 」 （" web services " ）の世界である 。
SOA を企業向けに前面に出した最初の会社は 、SAP である 。IBM もまたしかり。複雑になり続ける企業 IT システムの統合に SOA を利用している 。SOA には何百万ドルものマーケティング投資がされているものの、実際にはまだ離陸はしていない。
しかし消費者向け の Web アプリケーションの多くは 、SOA のコンセプトに基づいている。よい例が Google Maps だ。地図上にさまざまなソースからの情報を組み合わせて表示させることがすぐにできる。Housingmaps.com
や Craigslist はそういう組み合わせ、 「 マッシュアップ 」 （" mash - ups " ）の最初の一例だ 。
本格的なマッシュアップ（mash-up）は、Salesforce.com と Google が 2008年4月に発表した、それぞれの持つサービスの統合である。これ以外にも、数々のサービスのネットワークを形成する小さな会社がある。SaaS 企業のために基本的なサービスを提供する
OpSource 、Web アプリケーションのための認証を行う TriCipher、サービスに音声コミュニケーションを追加する Ribbit（日本語による解説記事）などである。
一般にソフトウェア市場は成熟するにつれ、次の二つの大きなグループができる。Web サービス ・SaaS の世界もそうなっている 。
アプリケーションの統合スイート：
プログラムを作るプラットフォーム：
消費者向けサービスのプラットフォーム化も進んでいる。
Never say die
今ある OS のように、いくつかの大きなクラウド・プラットフォームが残って、その上で多くのアプリケーションは書かれることになるだろう。よくわからないのは、どれだけのビジネス用・消費者用ソフトウェアがクラウドに移行するのか、そしてその移行はどれだけ速く進むのか、ということである。
Salesforce の Marc Benioff に聞けば 、Web アプリケーションがすべてのソフトウェアの形になると言うだろうし、そんなことはない、クライアント上でもソフトウェアが動く、「 ソフトウェア＋サービス 」 （" software plus services " ）、つまり従来のソフトウェアと新しい
Web サービスが共存すると 、Microsoft の Ray Ozzie は言う。歴史を振り返れば Ray Ozzie の見方が当を得ていそうである 。
ハードウェア同様、ソフトウェア・クラウドも多様に広がることになるだろう。その時、人々はこのコンピューティングをどのように活用するのだろうか？
1.6億台も売れた iPod ほどではないが 、Amazon の Kindle は本の世界の iPod である。iPod ほどの社会現象を起こすかは今後見ていく必要があるが、確実に言えることがある。ひとたび次世代の無線ネットワークが開始されたら、Kindle のように最初から無線機能がついた端末がこれから多数出てくるだろうということである（図5 : Chatterboxes）。デジタルカメラは自動的に写真をアップロードし、メーターは消費電力を送信し、あらゆるセンサーがメッセージを送出するようになるだろう。
クラウド・コンピューティングにおいて、データセンターとアプリケーションが形成するクラウドに対して、それと接続する無線機器のハードウェアとソフトウェアは、現実の世界とつながっている意味で「周辺（periphery）」に相当する。IT
用語では、 「 フロント・エンド 」 （" front end " ）ないし は 「 クライアント・サイド 」 （" client side " ）と言う 。
この周辺の層において、端末はその用途に応じてさまざまな形と大きさのものになる。。端末本体で多くの計算がなされるだろう。情報を分散させるだけではなく、情報を集める役割を果たす。
As you like it
コンピューティングと共にユーザインタフェースは進化した。メインフレームのダム端末に始まって、PC
が出現したことにより、ユーザインタフェースはよりインテリジェントに、また視覚的になった。最初の
Web ではそれがテキストベースに一歩後戻りしたが、最近になって事情は変わった。AJAX と呼ばれ る Web 開発技術 、Flash 、Silverlight といったマルチメディアソフトウェアが、 「 リッチなインターネット・アプリケーション 」 （" rich internet applications " ）すなわち RIA を作ることを可能にしたのである 。
もはやサーバは簡単な HTML （" hypertext markup language " ）を扱うのではない 。Web2.0 のサイトで 「ソースを表示」させてみると、何千行ものプログラム・コードを見ることになる。
そして最近では、ブラウザが OS のようなソフトウェア・プラットフォームになった。それを推し進めているメインのプレーヤーは
Google だ。次の二つをリリースした ：
Gears : Web アプリケーションのオフライン利用を可能にする。
Google Chrome : 複数の Web アプリケーションを同時に動かせる高速ブラウザ。
ブラウザだけではない。さらに 「 ウィジェット 」 （" widget " ）と呼ばれる PC のデスクトップに置かれる小さなプログラムも、クラウドとのインタフェースになっている。ウィジェット上では、パーソナライズされたデータをすばやく見ることができる。
そしてさらに重要なことは、クラウドにアクセスするハードウェアの種類が数多く増えていることである。小さく安価なラップトップ
" Eee " に始まり、スマート・モバイルフォン、2009年には800万台、2012年には5000万台売れると予測されているミニ・ノートブック（" mini-notebooks"）などがある。その指標は
Intel になるだろう 。2008 年6 月に出された
Atom チップによって、ネットブック （" netbooks " ）やモバイル・インターネット・デバイス
MID （" mobile internet devices " ）は駆動される 。WiMAX という無線ブロードバンド方式のチップを推進しているのも
Intel である 。PC だけでなく Kindle のような特別な機器にも WiMAX を導入しようとしている 。
i Phone と App Store が、クラウドにとって無線デバイスがいかに重要になるかを示している。App
Store では、わず か2ヶ月でアプリケーションの 1億ダウンロードを達成した。iTunes store での音楽配信よりも立ち上がりがずっと速い。多くのプログラムがクラウドにつながり、ニュースをフィードしたり、多人数でゲームをしたり、大統領選の最新の世論を追いかけていたりする。
You can take it with you
無線デバイスがインターネットにつながることにより、" device-centric " から " information - centric " な世界にシフトしていると言える。個人の情報は、使っているデバイスの中に留め置かれず、クラウドに置かれることにより、生涯を通してアクセスできるようになる。そこではサーバの仮想化ではなく、クライアントの仮想化が可能になる。企業のデスクトップ
PC 上では OS が動かずに、データセンター上の仮想マシンへのアクセスに置き換わる。理論的には全世界にあるどんな
PC からでも仮想マシンを使うことができる。遅かれ早かれモバイルデバイスも仮想化され、手元にどんなガジェット（" gadget"）を持っていたとしても、自分用のアプリケーションとデータを使えるだろう。
クラウドのインタフェースは、情報を提供するだけでなく情報を集めるためにも設計されている。「未来のアプリケーションには、利用者である人間、もしくは人間以外のセンサーから提供される情報にリアルタイムに応答する『生きたアプリケーション』（" live applications " ）が出てくるだろう 」 と、" Web 2.0 " ということばを作った Tim O'Reilly は予測する 。
その最初の例は Google の検索サービスである 。Google の検索対象となるページは、重要なページからリンクされるほど重要と判断されるアルゴリズムに基づいている。さらに、Web ユーザから提供される検索履歴からの情報に対してデータマイニングを行い、関連性が高い検索結果を出したり、効果的なターゲット広告を出したりする。
利用者と直接つながっている Google のような会社は、伝統的なソフトウェア会社と違って継続的にインタフェースを改良することができる。したがって
Web アプリケーションは技術ドリヴンというよりは利用者志向であると言える。現実世界で起こっていることが
Web アプリケーションへのヒントになる。たくさんの会社が利用者を観察し、利用者を人間センサーとすることによりビジネスを作ろうとしている。
Wesabe という新興企業 （O'Reilly が投資している）が運営しているサイトは、一見普通の個人向けファイナンスサイトで、銀行口座とクレジットカードの情報を一箇所で見ることができる。しかしその背後では、匿名化した会員データの中からパターンを探して（たとえばある特定の利用者がスーパーマーケットで通常いくら使っているか）、将来の取引を推奨しているのだ（CNET
の Wesabe CEO へのインタビュー記事） 。
無線デバイスもまた、ますますセンサーの役目を果たしてクラウドに新しい情報を提供するようになるだろう。Nokia はあらゆる種類のセンサーを、携帯電話から動作モニター、温度計などに埋め込むことを計画している。センサーは人の活動を記録することができ、「ライフ・ログ 」（" lifelog " ）を作ることが可能となる 。
無線技術が進歩して安価になるにつれ、さまざまなもの（objects）が直接クラウドにつながるようになる。" The Internet of Things " というプロジェクトのもと 、" Future Factory " で工場の生産をより適応的に効率的にするために知的タグを利用することが研究されている。
こうやってクラウドに集まる無数のデータを、どのように収益・利益に変えていくのか。これが大きな挑戦である。
1993 年の IBM。世界最大のコンピュータ・メーカーが、メインフレームからミニコン、PC
への大きなプラットフォームのシフトについていけずあわや倒産の危機にあった。クラウド・コンピューティングはそこまで生死にかかわるような変化をもたらすことはないだろうが、IT
産業と経済に少なからず影響を与える。ひとたび雲が空を覆えば、各企業のグローバルな
IT 予算構成もシフトするだろう（図6 : Follow the money ）。
1980年代半ばに始まった分散コンピューティングは、垂直統合されていた
IT 産業を、いくつかの水平な層（レイヤー）からなる積み重ね（IT スタック）へ変えた：ハードウェア、ネットワーク、OS やデータベースのようなインフラストラクチャとなるソフトウェア（基盤ソフトウェア）、エンタープライズ・アプリケーション、そして
IT サービスである。ここでは OS が鍵となる層で 、IT システムが従うことになる標準を設定し 、Microsoft を新時代の IBM へと押し上げることとなった 。
クラウド・コンピューティングはそこまでの劇的なシフトをもたらしはしないだろうが、分散コンピューティングをさらに一歩進め、IT
スタックにいくつかの層を付け加えることになる。ハードウェアとソフトウェアの境が曖昧になり、かつてのように層が明瞭に分かれるものではないが、一つは
Amazon や Google に代表される 「 クラウド・プロバイダ（提供者）」であり、もう一つは企業の
IT 基盤をその企業用のクラウドに変えるソフトウェア、「 データセンター用仮想
OS 」 （" virtual operating system for data centres " ）という層が加わる 。
Mix and match（組み合わせ ）
IT スタックそのものは大きく変わらなかったとしても、異なる層の間で認められる価値がシフトしていき、その価値によって
IT 企業は収益を得ることができる。誰が勝ち誰が負けるかは、結局のところコンピューティングがクラウドの中にどれだけ入っていけるかにかかっている。
最初のラウンドはクラウドの構築段階である。そこでの勝者はハードウェア・メーカーになりそうだ。
しかしより長いレンジで考えると、ハードウェアビジネスは負け組になっていく。クラウドが成熟するにつれ、利益は圧縮される。なぜならば購買力を持った顧客がほとんど少なくなっていくからだ。大きなクラウド・プロバイダがサーバの価格を決めることになる。
まずクラウドの波に飛び乗るのは、ハードウェア・メーカーである。既存の製品を「クラウド」と称して（" cloud-washing " と揶揄される）顧客に柔軟な IT 基盤をひとまずは提供する。それと同時に本格的なクラウド構築がなされる時に向けて、IBM や HP は他の企業や大学と組んで、新しいクラウド・アーキテクチャの設計を行っている。
Which side of the fence ?
長い目で見れば、ハードウェア・メーカーはクラウド・プロバイダへのサプライヤーになるか、自らがクラウド・プロバイダになるかのどちらかに分かれていく可能性がある。Dell は前者、Sun は後者の候補で、Network.com と呼ばれるクラウドのようなサービスを提供している。HP
と IBM はハードウェア売りと IT サービス提供のバランスをとっており、どちらもやろうとしている。
伝統的なソフトウェア・メーカーは厳しい状況に立たされている。オープンソース・ソフトウェア、特に
Linux の出現により OS は利益が出ないビジネスになった。OS がコモディティ化するのは 、Microsoft にとっては悪いニュースである。多くのビジネス・アプリケーションは汎用のサーバ
OS は必要とせず、安価でスペシャライズされた OS で十分である。一方クライアントでは、特定の OS を必要としない、ブラウザ上で動くアプリケーションがますます増えていっている。
ビジネス・アプリケーションのメーカーも守りの体制である。従来の初期費とアップグレードで大きな収益を上げていたビジネスモデルはかなりのプレッシャーを受けている。サービスは他のマシンに使われるので、ユーザ数課金も難しくなっている。もっと重要なことに、企業はソフトウェアにお金を払わなくなりつつある。米国の公開ソフトウェア企業はその利益の多くを、メンテナンス、その他のサービスから得ている（図7 : Serving up a treat） 。
ソフトウェア会社にとって最も大きなチャレンジは、自らがオンライン・サービスの提供者（プロバイダ）になることである。SaaS への移行はゆっくりと進んでいる。一つには顧客がまだそれほど熱心ではないからだ。しかしもっと重要なことは、ソフトウェア会社が古いビジネスモデルと深く結びついていることにある。SaaS だと大きな初期費は入らず、サブスクリプション・フィー（サービス課金）のみが収入となる。
Salesfoce と NetSuite が、SaaS モデルはうまく機能することを示したのを受け、既存のソフトウェア会社の動きも速くなった。2007年9月には
SAP が小規模ビジネス向けに " Business ByDesign " という Web ベースの企業アプリケーションのパッケージを発表した。その成功は利益が出るほど安価に運営できるかにかかっている。
伝統的なソフトウェア会社ほどには、純粋な
SaaS プロバイダは儲かってはいない 。Salesforce は生まれて 約
10 年の会社だが、儲かり出したのは2006年からだ。それまでに顧客を惹きつけるためにマーケティングへ大きく投資する必要があった。しかし今は
100万人もの利用者を獲得して 10億ドル以上の収益を上げ、さらにコストも下がっているという。
クラウドから収益を得るチャンスがあるのは、クラウドへ接続しそれを顧客のコンピューティング環境とうまく適合させられる会社である。たとえば売上の
80 % を基盤ソフトウェアと IT サービスから上げている IBM。そして HP、EDS 、Microsoft 、SAP
などが候補となる。
あまり言及されることはないが 、Cisco や EMC などネットワークやストレージ機器の会社もその競争参入者である。データセンターの
OS を押さえるプレーヤーも勝者となるだろう。VMware は仮想化のリーダであり 、EMC が 86 % 所有している。競争はますます激しさを増すだろう。
かつての IBM や Microsoft のように一社がグローバルなクラウドを独占することは考えにくい。クラウドはベンダー間で乗り換えることが相対的に容易であるからである。
ただしロック・イン（lock-in） という現象は今まで同様、重要な概念である。企業や開発者は、クラウドのプラットフォーム、アプリケーションにますます依存してロック・インするようになるだろう。Facebook がそのプラットフォームを変更したとき、開発者はそれに追随するしかなかった。あるプラットフォームから別のプラットフォームへ、アプリケーションの移行を簡単にするための「標準化」、W3C ( the World Wide Web Consortium ) のような 「 クラウド・コンピューティング・コンソーシアム 」
（" Cloud Computing Consortium " ）が一部の間では求められている。また標準化の一つの例が
OpenSocial である。
標準化の動きがあるとはいえ、一つの会社がクラウドの標準以外で重要なパートを独占する恐れもある。皮肉なことに、Microsoft は
Google によるオンライン広告の独占を心配している
。Google CEO の Eric Schmidt は Google がクラウドをコントロールするつもりもないし、そんなことは困難だと主張している。オープンな標準に則っている以上、顧客のロックインは緩やかになるというのがその理由だ。Schmidt いわく 「 自分たちの強みは顧客をロックインすることではない。データセンターをどのように構築し、また検索アルゴリズムのように真似されないソフトウェアをどう作るか。そういう特別な知識が
Google の競争優位の源であり、そこでお金を儲けている。」Google は規制の影響により、かつての Microsoft ほど強力になる可能性はないように思われる。
クラウドの経済はいまだに流動的だが、ビジネスや社会全体に広範囲に影響することは既に明確である。
経済悪化の影響の中、クラウドがビジネス・経済をどう変えるのか予測するのは難しいが、一つのテーマが明らかになりつつある。それはビジネスは技術のようになるということだ。すなわち、ビジネスは技術のように、より適応可能・柔軟（adaptable）で、より複雑に組み合わさって（interwoven）、より特殊化・専門化（specialised）されていく。特に新しい傾向ではないかもしれないが、クラウドがそれを加速する。
企業 IT は既にビジネスを機敏なものにしている 。1990 年代に ERP ( Enterprise - resource Planning ) というソフトウェアが導入され、財務面・人材面のマネジメントをサポートしている。一度このような大規模なソフトウェア・パッケージが使われだすと、それをスイッチするのは難しい。情報システム部と事業部がずっと仲たがいしてきているのはそのためだ。ビジネス側は変化し続ける市場・規制に取り組まなければならないにもかかわらず、情報システム部門の
IT 予算は削られ、莫大なバックログを抱え込んでいることになる。
このような状況を受けて、クラウド・コンピューティングに対する関心が高まっている。クラウドは資産への支出（capital expenditure）を、オペレーションでの支出（operational expenditure）に変えてしまい、ものごとを容易で安価なものにしてしまう。アプリケーションをテストするサーバを準備するために大きなお金、期間をしぶしぶ用意する必要はない。クレジットカードを取り出して、Amazon Web Service ( AWS ) に口座を作り、数ドルで仮想マシンを起動すればよいのである。研究開発ツール、シミュレーション（製薬会社）、ブレーンストーミングなどに
AWS や IBM のクラウドが活用されつつある。
新興企業（スタートアップ）でクラウドは大きな成功をおさめている。スタートアップにとってクラウドがないと生きていけなくなりつつある。Animoto は人工知能の技術で写真を音楽ビデオに変換するスタートアップであるが、Facebook でサービスを開始、たった３日の間に 50 から 3,500 まで AWS の仮想マシンを増強することになった。
標準に則ったサービス群、SOA は組み合わせによるイノベーションを容易にするが、SOA は既存企業にとっても重要である。それは ERP に拘束された 「 ビジネス・プロセス 」 （" business processes " ）を自由に解放するからである。しかし今のところ、SOA の普及は遅く、多くのプロジェクトが失敗に終わっている。その理由は技術的なものではなく、たとえばデータを共有することに慣れていないといった文化的なものである。クラウド・コンピューティングはこういった問題を解決するだろう。多くの
Web ベースのサービスは、既存のビジネスプロセスの中に統合されていくことになる。
Do n't do it yourself
IT システムにより、会社の機能のモジュール性が高く（モジュラーで）柔軟になるならば、ビジネスはより特殊化・専門化されていく。競争優位でないビジネス・プロセスのアウトソーシングが容易にできるようになる。企業はますます「コア 」（" core " ）に集中し 、 「 コンテキスト 」 （" context " ）から離れていく 。
このことは企業は、他社が提供するサービスにより依存度を高めるようになることを意味している。これにより、「プロセス・ネットワーク 」（" process networks " ）が徐々に形成されている。これは専門化された会社が緩やかにつながったネットワークを表す語である。香港の会社では衣料関連で
10,000社近くのグローバルなプロセス・ネットワークが形成されている。
これは 「 産業のオペレーティングシステム 」 （" industry operating systems " ）とも呼ぶべき巨大なクラウドが、財務・物流といったセクター別の基本サービスを提供することを意味する。このシステム上に、専門化して相互に結びついた会社群が存在するようになる。それはコンピューティング・プラットフォームの上にアプリケーションが存在するのと同様の構図である。しかも「トランザクション層 」（" transactional layer " ）だけでなく 「 インタラクション層 」 （" interactional layer " ）もそうなる。つまりこのシステムの上で取引するだけでなく、組織内・組織間でビジネスパートナーと積極的な対話が行われるようになる。
職場での人々の対話（インタラクション）は、技術によってあまり変わっていない。PC
により個人の生産性はあがったが、コラボレーションはそうでもない。企業よりもむしろ消費者の方が、よりよいコラボレーションをめざして、クラウド・ベースのサービス（ブログ、Wiki、SNS
など）を使っている。こういうツールを使い慣れた最初の世代の人たちがオフィスで働き始めている。情報を自由に共有する文化に慣れた、こういう「デジタル・ネイティブ 」 （" digital natives " ）は、伝統的な企業 IT が課す規則にずっと我慢したりはしないだろう。
したがって企業 は Web 2.0 技術への取り組みを始めるのがよいだろう（Enterprise 2.0）。2013年までに全世界で 46億ドル、コラボレーション・ツールに投資されるという予測もある。ただし企業間コラボレーションのトレードオフとして、機密情報漏洩のリスクがあり、それに見合う成果を上げるためにコラボレーションが有効であるかはよくわかっていない。多くの企業がセキュリティへの懸念から
Facebook のようなサイトへのアクセスを禁止・ブロックしている（図8 : Dangers within） 。
企業はオープンになって行かざるを得ない。企業ファイアウォールを超えるニーズが高まりつつある。20年前は仕事をする上で必要な
80 % の知識が同じ企業内にあったが、今は 20 % しかない。
従業員は、企業内・企業外の IT サービスを組み合わせて、繰り返し作業を自動化するような簡単なアプリケーションを構築するようになる可能性がある。Serena Softwareの Mashup Composer と呼ばれるソフトウェアがその先鞭をつけている。視覚的なインターフェースを通して、出張申請や承認文書を扱うサービスを組み合わせることができる（Serena Software CEO へのインタビュー記事）。
クラウドの影響はマクロ経済のレベルでも感じ取れる。クラウドは小さな企業をより競争優位にするため、開発途上経済をより前進させる。クラウド・サービスの戦略を担当する
HP の CTO は次のように述べている。 「 クラウドが約束する最大のものは、コンピューティングが安く簡単に使えるようになることで、それにより新市場に入れるようになることである。」
Hop , skip and jump
途上国では、固定電話の普及を飛ばして、携帯電話がつながった。途上国でのクラウド・コンピューティングは携帯電話と同様、一足飛びの技術になるかもしれない。途上国の人は、既存の使いにくい
IT 基盤を使わずに、最初からシリコン・バレーに住む人と同じプラットフォーム上でアプリケーションを使うことができるからである。
インドから、グローバルなクラウド・サービスの一角を占める会社が出てきている。Zoho という Web ベースの統合アプリケーションはインドの
AdventNet という会社が運営している。この技術を使って、インドの病院、保険会社がサービスを提供している。ここからわかるのは、クラウドの影響は
IT 産業だけにとどまるものではないということだ。インターネットは音楽ビジネスを破壊した。Google はメディアを破壊した。クラウド企業は、あまり効率的でない産業の破壊者になる可能性がある。それは
Health Care 2.0 、Banking 2.0 、Education 2.0 といった流行語で今は語られているが、そのうち現実味を帯びてくるだろう。
クラウドが本質的に地球規模のものだとしたら、どうやってそれを規制できるのだろう。この特集の最後は、この問いに対する答えで締めくくることになる。
アイスランドは涼しい気候、豊富な地熱エネルギー、安全な遠隔地にあるといったことから、データ・アーカイヴの主要な場所となりつつある。その一つが
Data Islandia という会社で、規制・規則を遵守するために保持しなければならないデータを企業から預かっている。Data Islandia はクラウドの中に国境を作って、欧州の規制にしたがって欧州のデータを、米国の規則にしたがって米国のデータを格納している。さらには輸送中のデータの保全のために、" data scooter " （ディスクドライブのコンテナ）を、アイスランドまで空輸している。
これは今後クラウドで起こるであろう政治的な緊張を表している。ある面で、クラウドはグローバリゼーションの究極の形であり、巨大な仮想化されたコンピュータシステムと電子サービスには国境がない。しかしその一方で各国政府はそれらに対するコントロールを失いたくない。
インターネットが主流になりつつあった 1990年代後半では、リバタリアンはサイバー空間は独自の法律や法制度が機能する空間であるべきだと主張した。しかし中国が
" great firewall " （ファイアウォールの万里の長城）を作ったように、各国政府は攻撃的だと思われるコンテンツをブロックする方法をすぐに見出した。
データがどこに記憶され、どのように処理されるかをコントロールするのは非常に難しい。なぜなら情報はクラウドの中を自由に流れるからだ。しかも国の数と同じだけデータに関する規制があるので、規制を守るとしたら 95 ものデータセンターが必要になるという技術者もいる。
この問題に対する技術的な解決策として、Amazon のストレージサービスでは、データを保持する場所をアメリカにするのか、欧州にするのかを顧客が指定することができる。将来、クラウド・プロバイダはどこにデータを保持し、どのように保護するのかを指定するたくさんのオプションを持つようになるだろう。
コンピュータが仮想化されるにより事態はますます複雑になる。電力が安い国、規制が緩い国へデータを移動したらどうなるのか？異なる司法制度に従うよう組み合わさるサービスができた場合、何かまずいことが起きた時、誰が責任をとるのか？
クラウドの持つ潜在的な政治的・社会的影響については、ようやく公共の場で議論が始まったばかりである。IT
産業のリーダたちは、各国政府はクラウドに関心を持ち始めたばかりだという。雇用創出のためにデータセンターを作る国もあるだろう。法規制について懸念する国もあるだろう。多くの規制により、データセンターの数を必要以上に増やさなければならなくなるとしたら問題である。共通の規則を適用する「自由貿易ゾーン」にデータセンターを置くようなアイディアも議論されている。
プライバシーの保護となると、さらに事態は複雑化する。消費者はクラウド上にある情報も、自分の家にある
PC の中の情報と同じように扱われることを期待している。センサーやカメラのようなデバイスは、人々の生活に侵入することがあるだろう。Google の " StreetView " の写真は、たまたまそこを通った人たちにとって困った状況を作り出した。Google は個人を同定しないよう、顔やライセンスプレートを消している。
Hands off my data
オープンになるのは個人情報に限定されない。企業にとってもプライバシーは心配の種だ。犯罪者やスパイがそのデータを横取りするからだけではない。いったんクラウドに企業データが置かれると、政府は簡単にそのデータに手を伸ばすことができる。国際間の銀行取引を行う
SWIFT という組織は、データセンターを中立なスイスに作ることを計画している。Web ベースのメールも安全ではない。アメリカ法の執行者はメールのメッセージを読むことが認められているのである。
あまりに多くの規制があり過ぎると、雲（クラウド）は高く立ち上らないかもしれない。しかしさまざまなただし書きがつくにもかかわらず、雲（クラウド）がもたらす雨の量はとても莫大なものになるだろう。
本ブログのクラウド・コンピューティングに関するエントリ
For years , Joan Burke has had to battle the fact that homelessness , for most Americans , is an invisible scourge .
Recently , however , invisibility has n't exactly been the problem .
Ten minutes ' walk from where she works , at the homelessness charity Loaves and Fishes , in Sacramento , California , lies an all - too - visible " tent city " - a shanty town , built on wasteground beside railway tracks , that has become one of the most prominent symbols of the recession .
Tent cities reminiscent of the " Hoovervilles " of the Great Depression have been springing up in cities across the United States - from Reno in Nevada to Tampa in Florida - as foreclosures and redundancies force middle - class families from their homes .
" Where the tent city is now is literally a toxic waste dump , it 's unsafe , but these people are very resourceful , " Burke said .
" Some people are living in squalor , with just a tarp tied to a chainlink fence .
But then you 'll see someone with several tents :
The tent they live in , plus some outbuilding tents .
And they could n't be more neat and more tidy .
They 're working hard to create a sense of home . "
Many of the 200 residents of Sacramento 's Tent City , as with those around the country , are not recent victims of the downturn :
They are the chronically homeless , some of them mentally ill .
But the encampment seized national attention after Oprah Winfrey featured it on her daytime television show , part of a series of reports she has been running on the " new faces " of homelessness .
Embarrassed by an influx of television crews , Arnold Schwarzenegger this week announced plans to house the tent - dwellers in a nearby convention centre until a $ 1 m ( £ 690,000 ) plan for more permanent shelter can be implemented .
The California governor told reporters he had " personally delivered a letter to President Barack Obama last week , to request that economic stimulus funds for the homeless be fast - tracked " .
Obama grappled with the phenomenon on Tuesday , when a reporter at his primetime news conference asked him about the " tent cities sprouting up across the country " .
The president said he was " heartbroken that any child in America is homeless " , adding : " The most important thing I can do on their behalf is to make sure their parents have a job . "
In both the number and types of inhabitants , the new tent cities do not equate to the homelessness of the 1930s .
But the symbolism is powerful , and may have significant political consequences .
It was not all that far from Sacramento , or from Fresno - home to another Californian tent city - that the celebrated Depression - era photographer Dorothea Lange took her haunting photos of families living in makeshift camps , forced west by the collapsed economy and the Dust Bowl further east .
" We all take care of each other , " Michelle Holbrook , a 34 - year - old resident of the Sacramento camp who lost her job as a carer , told the San Jose Mercury News .
" I 've become the camp mother : I do most of the cooking , and make hot water for coffee . "
A resident of Reno 's tent city , Tammy , said : " We eat things that other people throw out , or whatever ...
It 's really embarrassing to say , but that 's the way it sometimes is out here . "
Another Reno tent - dweller , Jim , told one of Oprah 's reporters it was " like learning how to live all over again " .
Obama 's stimulus package includes $ 1.5 bn for emergency shelters , and , if passed , his budget should significantly expand funding for affordable housing .
Philip Mangano , director of the US Interagency Council on Homelessness , has called the stimulus funds " manna from heaven " , saying they would boost his two - pronged strategy of preventing homelessness while rapidly re-housing those who fall victim to it .
Last year , the US government reported that homelessness in America had declined by 30 % between 2005 and 2007 .
Burke , whose organisation provides food and shower facilities for Sacramento 's Tent City residents , has mixed feelings about the national media exposure .
It may help build support for addressing the problem , she said , but also threatens to reinforce a distinction between the " deserving " victims of the recession and those who have been homeless for longer , and for other reasons .
" It 's an oddity of human nature that we are more about people who have suffered for a short time , rather than people who have suffered for a long time , " she said .
" When we can identify with somebody 's situation , obviously , our empathy is engaged quickly :
You can look at someone and say , ' You know , goodness , they owned their own home , they look like I do . '
But if someone 's been homeless for a while , they no longer look like we think we look .
If you 're living in a tent , it does n't take long before you 're somewhat unkempt and dirty , because you 're living in the dirt . "
The changing economy has , accordingly , thrown very different kinds of people into close quarters with one another .
In Fresno , freelance electricians and truck drivers , employed until months ago , rub shoulders with crack addicts and those with serious psychological problems .
There have been reports of violence in one part of Fresno 's encampment , known as New Jack City , but Burke said what really impressed her in Sacramento was the degree of cooperation .
" There is a sort of very pure democracy and self - governance at play .
People are making up the rules of their cluster of tents , deciding what 's permitted , just as in any sort of community , " she said .
" You do n't want to romanticise this - it is n't camping - but there is a community , and there is a sense of helping others .
We 've had a series of storms here recently , and if there 's somebody new who does n't have a tent , people will take them in .
It 's that understanding that , you know , there 's somebody worse off than I am . "

The drive to bring good manners back to football has reached new heights after a referee issued a yellow card to a player for " breaking wind " as a penalty was being taken .
The official deemed the act " ungentlemanly conduct " and booked the player responsible .
However Chorlton Villa , who conceded a goal on the second take , went on to win the match 6 - 4 against local rivals International Manchester FC at Turn Moss in Stretford , Manchester , last Sunday .
Ian Treadwell , manager of Chorlton Villa for the past eight years , said his team had learnt lessons from the game in which three players were dismissed and two were booked .
" The other player had the penalty saved because it was a bad penalty it was nothing to do with any noise .
Not one of their team remonstrated with the referee when the first penalty was taken .
" They were as shocked as we were as to why .
We are waiting for the Football Association to contact us after they have received the report . "
Treadwell added that his players ' behaviour was " normally exemplary " .
" We are not a dirty team and we like to play football .
While I wo n't condone the actions of the players it is an emotive game and some of the players were sent off for entering into conversation with the referee .
" This has come at a bad time in the season as we do n't have sponsor and we are looking for a new sponsor for next season . "
Pauline Riley , secretary and treasurer of International Manchester FC , said : " Both teams are very friendly .
There 's no animosity .
It was just hilarious . "
Being an obsessive reader can be a real pain : eye strain , for one thing , but also that reading list I can always sense hanging over my head , growing longer year by year .
I tend to become briefly obsessed with the idea of reading a certain book , only to get discouraged when I ca n’t get through it before the next one catches my eye .
Such was the case with The Diaries of Samuel Pepys .
Written in the 1660s by a gossipy , endlessly curious government official , they are probably the most perceptive and wide - ranging record of life in Restoration London .
In his diaries we have the mundanities of his job and marriage , but also reviews of the first Shakespeare productions in nearly 20 years ( the Puritans closed the theaters in 1642 ) and his account of traveling with Charles II back to England to be crowned .
It ’s one of the classics of British literature , but it ’s also about 10 volumes long — even the abridged Penguin version is over 1000 pages .
I had given up hope of ever getting through Pepys ’ diaries when , strangely enough , I found his blog .
On January 1 , 2003 the website posted Pepys ’ first entry from January 1 , 1660 , and has posted the corresponding entry for every day since ( today we ’re on Tuesday , February 20 , 1666 ) .
It ’s a simple but brilliant idea — rather than face down a discouraging brick of a book , I read an entry a day on my RSS reader alongside Politico and Ars Technica .
Now , the chatty diaries are available in a correspondingly approachable format .
But Pepys is n’t the only long - dead literary figure who ’s blogging : you can also read George Orwell ’s diary , with entries posted 70 years to the day after he wrote them .
Unlike Pepys ’ , Orwell ’s diary is not widely available in print .
Besides , it ’s gratifying to realize the great man ’s life was frequently as mundane as my own .
Sometimes more so : there ’s a week when he recorded only the number of eggs his hens had laid ( 1/11/1939 : “ One egg . ”
1/12/1939 : “ Three eggs . ” ) .
While these entries are less than riveting , his keen attention to detail in his diary shows the private side of the acute mind behind his novels and essays .
The Internet has a fantastic potential to literally re-present cultural works and figures in a more approachable way .
These new presentations range from enlightening — one blog exclusively focuses on prominent figures ’ daily routines ( Churchill did n’t get out of bed until 11 , and only then to have a cocktail ) — to silly .
Jane Austen ’s Pride and Prejudice has been re-imagined as a series of Facebook updates , and Orwell also has a Twitter feed with a , um , contrasting design scheme .
But seriously , I would love to see Darwin ’s Voyage of the Beagle journals redone as a blog , or writers ’ correspondence formatted like Gmail .
Originally serialized novels by Dickens could be serialized again online , with the month - long wait between installments recreating the suspense Victorian readers felt .
Bleak House would make one hell of a series of Facebook updates — a whole social network unto itself .
Blogs like Pepys ’ and Orwell ’s are great evidence against socially conservative suspicions about the Internet ’s dire implications for culture .
They look very different , but the content is available , for free , to more people than ever before .
It ’s seriously nerdy , but I can wait to read Pepys ’ blog in September : the Great Fire of 1666 is coming , and there ’s no better firsthand account .

We have received a complaint from solicitors acting for Trafigura about this article .
Read Trafigura 's statement here
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday 18 May 2009
The article below about the dumping of toxic waste off Ivory Coast named a Dutch Greenpeace campaigner as Marietta Harjo .
That was meant to be Harjono .
Yesterday 's courtroom moves are the latest aspect of a remarkable damage limitation campaign that oil traders Trafigura have been fighting across the globe , ever since its toxic waste was dumped on the Ivory Coast in 2006 .
From the outset , in a two - pronged approach , Trafigura 's directors simultaneously hired lawyers and lobbyists to threaten the media , and public relations men to paint the firm in more benign colours .
They repeatedly and flatly denied the key allegation in the case : that they had dumped toxic waste containing poisonous hydrogen sulphide .
They went on TV and wrote letters to newspapers claiming the waste was nothing more than routine tank - washings and little worse than dirty water .
Meanwhile , whenever journalists tried to write critically about Trafigura , they received pressure from Carter - Ruck , which trades on its reputation as London 's most aggressive libel lawyers .
The £ 500 - an - hour firm bombarded the Times and the BBC with complaints , sources there say .
One programme maker at BBC2's Newsnight said : " We received a blizzard of paper before transmitting a programme last year .
They rapidly seek to escalate complaints to our higher management . "
Libel proceedings were even formally issued against the lawyer , Martyn Day , senior partner at Leigh Day & Co , who is representing more than 30,000 African claimants who say they were made ill by the toxic waste .
Adam Tudor , the partner concerned at Carter - Ruck , admitted to the Dutch paper Volkskrant : " It is indeed the case that we have on Trafigura 's behalf written to a number of other media outlets round the world .
Trafigura values its reputation and cannot simply allow irresponsible , inaccurate and defamatory publications to go unchallenged . "
The Norwegian TV channel NRK was subject to complaints from British lobbyists Bell Pottinger when it transmitted a programme exposing Trafigura 's links to a similar toxic waste tank explosion in Norway .
The lawyers appear not to have been very successful .
Carter - Ruck cannot point to a single libel case it has successfully prosecuted against Trafigura 's critics , or an article that has been withdrawn .
However , there has been a chilling effect .
Dutch Greenpeace campaigner Marietta Harjo says : " My strong impression is that some media have simply stopped writing about Trafigura .
I was supposed to do an interview on British radio the day that the court in Abidjan had come to a decision and had sent two people to jail .
I was told that I should in no way mention Trafigura because of possible libel claims . "
Trafigura , meanwhile , devised a PR blitz .
The firm announced it would help fund this summer 's British Lions rugby tour of South Africa and launched the charitable Trafigura Foundation , which is donating to a UK helpline for sufferers from autism and to an arts centre for hurricane - stricken New Orleans .
Perhaps Trafigura 's boldest public relations stroke was to tell the world in 2006 it would hire a former
Tory minister at its own expense to conduct an " independent inquiry " into the dumping .
QC Peter Fraser , the former Scottish lord advocate , Lord Fraser of Carrmyllie , took the job and then pronounced himself a " frustrated bunny " because of impending litigation .
As a result , he published an " interim report " in May 2008 , which contained little information of value .
What do bloggers and a 1918 newspaper syndicate have in common ?
According to the Associated Press , both are wretched hives of scum and villainy — parasites , if you will , sucking a healthy living from the AP 's expensive newsgathering operations .
And the AP means to do something about it , reviving a legal doctrine it helped to create back during World War I : the concept of " hot news . "
Here 's what you need to know about facts and the quasi- property rights that news organizations can exert over them ... sometimes .
Read and rewrite
1918 — the US was at war , pandemic influenza was on the loose , and the AP was complaining about being ripped off .
Sound familiar ?
Back then , AP competitor International News Service resorted to all sorts of underhanded tricks to stay competitive , up to and including outright bribery .
INS paid workers at AP newspapers , who would pass along stories before they were published .
This was a plainly illegal way of getting the news , but what happened next was more interesting : INS simply rewrote the AP stories , then zipped them across the telegraph wires to papers across the country .
And , in many cases , it did n't even use bribery ; INS simply grabbed early copies of AP newspapers and went to work .
The Supreme Court , which eventually dealt with the lawsuit brought by the AP over this issue , described the effects of the INS practice :
Most of the foreign news reaches this country at the Atlantic seaboard , principally at the city of New York , and because of this , and of time differentials due to the earth 's rotation , the distribution of news matter throughout the country is principally from east to west ; and , since in speed the telegraph and telephone easily outstrip the rotation of the earth , it is a simple matter for defendant [ INS ] to take complainant 's news from bulletins or early editions of complainant 's members in the eastern cities and at the mere cost of telegraphic transmission cause it to be published in western papers issued at least as early as those served by complainant .
Sometimes , in fact , INS papers in places like California could actually publish the news before the local AP paper , making it look as though INS had the scoop .
The reason for the whole absurd state of affairs was censorship .
US and British forces implemented tough restrictions on war correspondents in 1917 - 18 , making them post bonds and otherwise operate on " good behavior " that kept them from publishing accurate accounts of the war .
Those who irritated the military had their permission to serve as war correspondents revoked .
INS was not able to secure a correspondent slot in the UK , which meant that it had no direct access to the single biggest story of the day — European war news .
Hence the skullduggery , bribery , and rewriting .
But , leaving aside the issue of the bribery , were INS 's other practices actually illegal ?
It 's a tougher question than it might at first appear .
The issue was n't about copyright , as the Supreme Court made clear .
No direct plagiarism was involved , and copyright has never given someone control over facts about the world .
Or , as the justices put it , " It is not to be supposed that the framers of the Constitution , when they empowered Congress ' to promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ' ( Const. art .
1 , 8 , par. 8 ) , intended to confer upon one who might happen to be the first to report a historic event the exclusive right for any period to spread the knowledge of it . "
And yet there was a common - sense intuition that expending no real expense and only limited effort to simply rewrite wholesale the work of another person for purposes of profit — well , surely something must be wrong with that .
" Stripped of all disguises , " said the justices , " the process amounts to an unauthorized interference with the normal operation of complainant 's legitimate business precisely at the point where the profit is to be reaped , in order to divert a material portion of the profit from those who have earned it to those who have not . "
The Court ruling created the " hot news " doctrine , in which groups like the AP are granted a pseudo - property right to breaking news stories .
The right is quite limited , generally applying just in situations where another party rewrites the news " without independent investigation and verification . "
Hot news , like the flu , is still with us
The principle , in somewhat changed form , is still recognized .
Patent blog The Prior Art digs up the Second Circuit 's criteria for " hot news , " which now consists of five points ( in New York , anyway ; thanks to further rulings , the original case is no longer binding federal law ) :
A plaintiff generates or gathers information at a cost
The information is time - sensitive
A defendant 's use of the information constitutes free riding on the plaintiff 's efforts
The defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs
The ability of other parties to free - ride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened .
The issue has come up repeatedly in court cases .
Could a company market a small pager - type device that would display real - time sports scores and stats while games were in progress ?
Could a company simply copy all the listings in a competitors ' phone book , even though they had taken tremendous effort to assemble the data ?
Both cases were real , and both tested the limits of " reporting facts . "
The AP recently sued All Headline News over the same issues it raised back in 1918 , claiming that AHN simply employed people to rewrite AP content and headlines ( at least INS employed actual reporters on non-war stories ) .
Earlier this year , the judge overseeing the case allowed it to go forward and included a lengthy discussion of " hot news " and the INS case of 1918 in doing so .
But the " hot news " case has always been contentious , since it does appear to grant some organizations control over facts in certain narrow circumstances .
In 1918 , Justice Holmes objected to the majority decision .
" When an uncopyrighted combination of words is published there is no general right to forbid other people repeating them — in other words there is no property in the combination or in the thoughts or facts that the words express , " he wrote .
Holmes said that INS was wrong to operate the way that it did , but that the only legal remedy should be a requirement that INS identify the AP as the source of the story .
" I think that within the limits recognized by the decision of the Court the defendant should be enjoined from publishing news obtained from the Associated Press for hours after publication by the plaintiff unless it gives express credit to the Associated Press , " he wrote , " the number of hours and the form of acknowledgment to be settled by the District Court . "
Justice Brandeis was also concerned about creating a quasi - property right over facts .
" No question of statutory copyright is involved , " he said .
" The sole question for our consideration is this : was the International News Service properly enjoined from using , or causing to be used gainfully , news of which it acquired knowledge by lawful means ( namely , by reading publicly posted bulletins or papers purchased by it in the open market ) merely because the news had been originally gathered by the Associated Press and continued to be of value to some of its members , or because it did not reveal the source from which it was acquired ? "
He concluded that " the knowledge for which protection is sought in the case at bar is not of a kind upon which the law has heretofore conferred the attributes of property ; nor is the manner of its acquisition or use nor the purpose to which it is applied , such as has heretofore been recognized as entitling a plaintiff to relief . "
Similar doubts have been raised in most cases litigated since .
Our messy modern world
It all sounds a bit archaic , but the debate is back in the news today in a big way .
The AP has n't just gone after operations like All Headline News ; it has made dark pronouncements about bloggers and aggregators , too , implying that even its headlines might be protected content .
Depending on how hard it pushes the " hot news " idea , the AP ( and similar services ) could spark a new war over the quasi- ownership of facts .
Fair use , which applies in copyright cases , would not be a defense against a property claim , and most journalists arguably violate all five of the " hot news " tenets listed above .
The issue turns on the last item — whether the free - riding disincentivizes the news collector .
Given the " link ethos " of the Web , this would seem to be the point at which a clear distinction could be made between much modern practice and the INS case of 1918 .
While INS purposely stripped out byline information and refused to credit the AP as a source , most such digesting and rewriting of news today is accompanied by a link to the story in question .
The AP might claim that it 's being harmed , but the linkers might claim that they actually drive more traffic the AP 's way .
As journalistic revenues dry up , expect to see battle lines drawn once the issue begins to feel like a question of actual survival .
But news is broken everywhere today ; small niche blogs are better at bringing technical stories to light than are groups like the AP , and groups like the AP and Reuters consistently write up stories even when they are scooped by a rival ( look for clues like , " According to the Wall Street Journal ... " in news stories ) .
Unlike some of the other " hot news " cases that helped to establish the doctrine , today 's vibrant , chaotic media landscape means that no one is simply out there " breaking news " that others rip off , rewrite , or comment upon .
Everything is mixed , blended , messy , and pushing too hard on " hot news " could easily backfire .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Despite the Roman Catholic Church 's official opposition to abortion and embryonic stem - cell research , a Gallup analysis finds almost no difference between rank - and - file American Catholics and American non-Catholics in terms of finding the two issues morally acceptable .
The stance of the Catholic church on moral issues has come into the spotlight in recent days with the announcement that President Barack Obama will be giving the commencement address and receiving an honorary degree at the University of Notre Dame in May .
Notre Dame is one of the largest Catholic universities in the United States , and some Catholic officials , students , alumni , and others have objected publicly to Obama 's appearance , pointing to the fact that Obama 's positions on embryonic stem - cell research and abortion are at odds with the church's .
Some of those objecting have argued further , for example , that there is " great concern among Catholics nationwide about President Obama 's future impact on American society , the family , and the Catholic church . "
The argument of those who protest the extension of the invitation to Obama is that Catholics have a distinctly conservative position on these moral issues .
That is certainly the case as far as official church doctrine is concerned , but not when it comes to average American Catholics .
The new Gallup analysis , based on aggregated data from Gallup 's 2006 - 2008 Values and Beliefs surveys , indicates that Catholics in the United States today are actually more liberal than the non-Catholic population on a number of moral issues , and on others , Catholics have generally the same attitudes .
The accompanying chart shows the percentage of Catholics and non-Catholics who find each of nine moral issues morally acceptable .
Catholics are at least slightly more liberal than non-Catholics on the issues of gambling ( an issue to which the Catholic church is not totally opposed ) , sex between an unmarried man and woman , homosexual relations , and having a baby out of wedlock .
Catholics are essentially tied with non-Catholics on the moral acceptability of abortion , divorce , and stem - cell research using human embryos .
Only on the death penalty are Catholics slightly less likely than non-Catholics to find the issue morally acceptable .
Committed Catholics
In general , Americans who are the most religious also tend to be the most conservative on moral issues .
Catholics are no exception .
Regular churchgoing Catholics ( defined as those who attend church weekly or almost every week ) are significantly less likely to find most issues measured in this research morally acceptable than are Catholics who do not attend church regularly .
These committed Catholics ' views on all these issues are much more in line with the church 's teachings than are the views of non-practicing Catholics .
However , even among committed Catholics , a slim majority seem to be at odds with the church 's positions on premarital sex , embryonic stem - cell research , divorce , and the death penalty .
The data show that regular churchgoing non-Catholics also have very conservative positions on moral issues .
In fact , on most of the issues tested , regular churchgoers who are not Catholic are more conservative ( i.e. , less likely to find a given practice morally acceptable ) than Catholic churchgoers .
The accompanying table shows that regular churchgoers who are Catholic are significantly more liberal than churchgoing non-Catholics on gambling , sex before marriage , homosexual relations , having a baby out of wedlock , and divorce .
Committed Catholics are at least slightly more likely than devout non-Catholics to say that abortion and embryonic stem - cell research -- the two key issues highlighted by those protesting Obama 's appearance at Notre Dame -- are morally acceptable .
Only on the death penalty are committed Catholics more conservative than regular churchgoers who are not Catholic .
Religious non-Catholics are certainly not adopting these positions because of official Catholic doctrine .
It appears that the underlying dimension of religiosity -- as measured in this analysis by church attendance -- is most predictive of conservative positions on moral issues , not whether an individual is Catholic .
Implications
It is no doubt heartening to the Catholic hierarchy that devout Catholics , defined as those who attend church very frequently , are more likely than non-devout Catholics to adhere to the church 's position on moral issues .
But the data make it less clear whether practicing Catholics have adopted their positions as a result of adherence to church doctrine , or as a more natural function of their basic religiousness .
More generally , the data do not suggest that there is a uniquely conservative component to attitudes on moral issues based on the simple fact of being Catholic .
These data on the attitudes of rank - and - file Catholics in and of themselves do not speak directly to the issue of Notre Dame 's invitation to President Obama .
It is possible that Catholics who themselves do not adhere to Catholic church positions on moral issues could still object to Obama 's being honored by Notre Dame .
And Catholic leaders ' objections to the Obama situation could themselves be at least partly a reflection of the leaders ' awareness of and concern over the fact that in today 's contemporary American culture , there is little differentiation between Catholics and non-Catholics in terms of adherence to conservative Catholic church positions on moral issues .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with an aggregated sample of 3,022 national adults , aged 18 and older , interviewed in polls conducted in May 2006 , May 2007 , and May 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
It had all the signs of a good meeting .
And I hate meetings .
We were :
Talking about a product we loved
In great shape from a feature , quality , and schedule standpoint
A group that historically did not kick ass
A group that was kicking ass .
The slides looked great and the dry - run was flawless , so why had n’t I slept in two nights ?
I could n’t sleep because I could n’t see the Screw - Me .
You Might Be Lying
There ’s an article to be written about the different kinds of meetings you ’re going to be exposed to , but for now I want to talk about the executive cross-pollination communication clusterfuck .
The point of this meeting is alignment .
Big alignment .
You ’ve likely got several different groups who do n’t normally spend a lot of time together being forced to sit in the same room so the execs can compare stories , measure reality , and figure out who is lying .
Before I explain how to get your head around this meeting , I want to talk about intent .
Intent starts with a question : “ Why does this meeting exist ? ”
If you ’re responsible for the presentation in this meeting , it exists because someone hates you .
It ’s not personal hate .
It ’s professional hate and it ’s exacerbated by a simple fact of organization : different groups speak different languages .
Marketing speaks marketing , Legal speaks legal , and Engineering speaks engineering .
There ’s a fundamental communication breakdown somewhere in the building and someone is feeling wronged .
They ’re feeling bullied and since they do n’t speak your dialect , they ’re complaining up rather than across .
Normally , we deal with these Tower of Babel situations with the direct application of middle management , program managers , and other folks we pay big bucks to sit in meetings and translate between organizations .
However , translation has not worked in this case .
Someone high up on the org chart is hearing two very different stories and wondering which is true .
Story reconciliation is certainly on the top of your list of items to resolve in this meeting , but job # 1 is to figure out who hates you .
A Rubber Stamp Affair
For these critical meetings , your goal is to make them a rubber stamp affair .
In the week before the meeting , you will have personally vetted your slides with each of the meeting invitees .
You will have heard their concerns and made the appropriate adjustments to your deck .
When the cross-pollination meeting arrives , your goal is an utter lack of drama and the finishing pronouncement of , “ Yeah , we should do that and you know how . ”
It never happens like this .
We ’re “ busy ” and we have “ things to do ” , but mostly we ’re “ looking forward to blindsiding you with a Screw - Me at the least convenient moment in front of your executive team . ”
It ’s a disappointing trait of human nature that folks who feel wronged like to exact their revenge by flaunting their knowledge and dishing out the Screw - Me at the worst possible time , but , roll with it , you ’re already a step ahead just expecting to be screwed .
Besides , your enemy is working more with emotion than content and that will turn into their own personal Screw - Me Scenario at a later date .
Right now , your job is data .
No Guilt , No Doubts , No Fear
Ideas get better with eyeballs and before this meeting goes down , your job is to get as many eyeballs on your presentation as possible .
You ’re not going to get everyone in the meeting , but that ’s not the point .
The task is cross-pollination .
Casting the information net as wide as possible and incessantly asking :
Does this make sense ?
What is missing ?
How am I going to get screwed ?
I ’ve got the Russian Lit Major for vetting my strategy ; who do you have ?
I ’m not talking about your boss or your co-worker , I ’m talking about the person who can objectively look at your presentation and start poking holes .
These people are rare because it ’s another disappointing trait of human nature that we often think we ’re doing each other a favor by listening well , but then tell each other what we want to hear .
You lose yourself in any significant project .
You ’ve long forgotten your strategic initial assumptions , but , more importantly , you ’ve forgotten what other people need because you ’re furiously worrying about the daily tactical fire drills .
A fresh perspective is a chance to test your entire idea and find the Screw - Me .
You need someone to poke holes .
You need to find and fill the gaps , and as each gap is filled , you ’re going to build confidence around your pitch because , well , that ’s one less potential Screw - Me entry point .
You ’re not going to find them all .
That ’s ok , because in the process of constantly refining your pitch , you ’re mentally refining yourself .
You ’re preparing yourself by seeing each of the different perspectives in your deck , .
That improves the chances that you ’ll know what to do when someone starts dishing out the hate .
Game On
The meeting ’s on .
You ’re walking in with a head full of data and my hope is that through your constant cross-pollination you are legitimately the most informed person on this particular topic in the room .
There ’s still work to do .
Size the room .
Who is here ?
What groups do they represent ?
What do they want ?
Any unexpected visitors ?
Really ?
Why would they randomly show up ?
Who brought them ?
What possible Screw - Mes could they represent ?
Ok , let ’s get started .
Carry the room .
Start your deck .
You ’ve got it memorized , right ?
They can tell this is the 32nd time you ’ve done it , right ?
Good .
It ’s smooth .
You ’ve already diffused two Screw - Mes by slide 12 .
Really well done there .
Amanda , you have a question ?
Manage the room .
Questions are n’t Screw -mes .
You can clarify and stay on track .
You know that Amanda is going to ask about hard data , right ?
Do n’t let her take over the conversation .
Say , “ I ’ve got your data in the appendix , but let me get through this first , ok ? ” Yeah , you just shut down a Senior VP .
Nicely done .
No way you can do that without serious confidence in your preparation .
Yes , Tim ?
Tim ’s got the Screw - Me and you did n’t see it coming .
Total left field .
Completely valid strategic observation and you do n’t have a clue how to answer .
Shit .
You will recognize the Screw - Me by the complete silence that fills both the room and your head .
That ’s the realization everyone is having that you ’re Screwed .
First , let ’s not make it worse …
The Unforgivable Spin
Tim : “ Rands , what about THIS ? ”
I ’m a poker player and an experienced meeting surfer , so the room will not immediately know from the look on my face that This has Screwed me , but what I choose to do next will define my ongoing relationship with the room .
There are two options when you are cornered by This .
Your animal brain , when cornered , will try to find a way out .
You can taste this approach even before you begin .
I am going to spin .
I am going to talk quickly and confidently about This and I am going to hope that in my furious verbal scurrying they are going to believe I ’ve got This handled .
That ’s not what they ’re seeing or hearing .
This is not your staff meeting where a little verbal soft shoe is going to entertain and delight .
These are the execs and no matter how many meetings you ’ve surfed , they see straight through spin , they know this dance , and the longer you sit there spinning , the longer you give your boss an opportunity to step in , try to make the diving save , and make you look like a blithering fool .
It takes a little practice to make the correct move when you feel the spin coming .
You are going to do three things :
Acknowledge the Screw - Me. Admit “ I do n’t know . ”
Concretely explain the steps you ’re going to take to find out and give yourself a deadline .
You have completely defused Tim .
See , Tim was pissed which is why he waited until precisely the wrong moment to throw down the Screw - Me .
He wanted to see you spin and make a fool of yourself in front of your management team and what you did with the instant acknowledgement was crush emotion with structured sanity .
You can get lucky with spin sometimes .
There are times when you spin so hard that you actually talk yourself into a Screw - Me solution that actually makes sense .
But this is rare and unreliable and in my experience this frenetic verbal journey erodes confidence and wastes time .
The only question on everyone ’s mind during the cross-pollination clusterfuck is , “ Do you know what you ’re talking about ? ”
It ’s lame that Tim does n’t speak engineer and waited until precisely the wrong moment to Screw you , but my hope is that through your incessant vetting of your slides that you can deliver the “ I do n’t know ” with confidence .
Tim just knows what he ’s pissed about and you , through your preparation , can see the entire picture .
A Screw - Me Detection Policy
An aggressive Screw - Me detection policy is , I believe , essential to navigating groups of people .
It ’s not just constantly knowing the potential worst case scenario in any situation , it ’s that you are instinctively always looking for it .
When I am looking at any situation , I ’m always trying to figure out what sequence of events could occur that will screw me .
This strategy sounds a lot like paranoia and yes , an unchecked Screw - Me detection policy can result in a conspiracy theory lifestyle where THEY are out to GET YOU .
Yes , only the paranoid survive , but paranoia is a lot of work .
You can burn a lot of calories worrying about all possibilities , but this is not an approach I recommend .
What I ’m asking is that you look at specific key events strategically .
Step back and look at the whole board .
Ask “ What sequence of moves is going to benefit me ?
Can I see what is coming ?
And how could I get screwed ? ” because teams which kick ass are n’t just ones that deliver , it ’s that they deliver when they ’re screwed .
May 18 , 1980 : Mount St. Helens , a volcano located in the Cascade Range in the state of Washington , erupted at 8:32:17 am , causing the entire weakened north face to slide away , suddenly exposing the partly molten , gas - and - steam - rich rock in the volcano to lower pressure .
The rock responded by exploding a very hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock toward Spirit Lake so quickly that it avoided the avalanching north face .
The explosion caused over a billion U.S. dollars in damage and resulted in 57 human deaths .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
Three milligrams of melatonin at bedtime can effectively treat sleep problems in children with autistic spectrum disorder , fragile X syndrome , or both , according to a study reported in the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine .

“ Melatonin can be considered a safe and effective pharmacologic treatment in addition to behavior therapies and sleep hygiene practices for the management of sleep problems in children with autistic spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome , ” the study team concludes .
Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone , derived from the amino acid tryptophan .
The hormone is important in regulating circadian rhythms , or the “ sleep wake ” cycle , and the reproduction cycle in mammals .
Fragile X syndrome is an inherited form of mental impairment resulting from a “ fragile , ” or broken site , on the X chromosome .
The syndrome affects 2 to 5 percent of those with autism spectrum disorder , and symptoms of autism are common in children with fragile X .
Sleep problems are reported in up to 89 percent of children with autism and 77 percent of children with fragile X syndrome , Dr. Beth L. Goodlin - Jones , of the Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders ( M.I.N.D. )
Institute at the University of California Davis Health System in Sacramento , and colleagues note in their report .
In a 4 - week study , 18 children , ranging in age from 2 to 15 years , with autistic spectrum disorder and / or fragile X syndrome received either melatonin ( 3 milligrams ) or placebo each night for 2 weeks .
The children then “ crossed over ” to the other treatment group for 2 weeks .
Data from 12 children who completed the study showed that treatment with melatonin was associated with significant improvements in total night sleep durations , sleep latency times and sleep - onset times .
Specifically , Goodlin - Jones and colleagues report that the average night sleep duration was 21 minutes longer with melatonin than with placebo , the sleep - onset latency was 28 minutes shorter , and the sleep - onset time was 42 minutes earlier .
“ Sleep onset problems at the beginning of the night are very troublesome for children and their families , ” Goodlin - Jones noted in a prepared statement accompanying the study .
“ Sometimes children may take one to two hours to fall asleep and often they disrupt the household during this time . ”
“ The results of this study , ” she and her colleagues conclude , “ suggest that melatonin is an effective treatment for sleep problems in children with autistic spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome , a finding that is consistent with previous studies of children with autistic spectrum disorder and developmental disabilities . ”

These are the best BBQ pork ribs you will ever eat .
They are so good you would ask for them as your " last meal " .
We 're talking classic Southern barbecue ribs here , the barbecue ribs that win barbecue championships .
They are a melange of flavors :
A complex spice rub , elegant hardwood smoke , tangy sweet sauce , all underpinned and held together by the distinct flavor of pork .
They are juicy and tender and they tug cleanly off the bone but do n't fall off the bone .
Their smoked scent clings to your fingers for hours .
Here 's a short video that shows the whole process , followed by the recipe , and then a whole bunch of info that will help you up your game .

Preparation time .
15 minutes to skin ' n ' trim and rub
Cooking time .
4 to 7 hours depending on the cut you choose , how thick it is , and how well you regulate temperature .
We will be cooking low and slow at about 225 °F , so allow 5 to 7 hours for St. Louis Cut ( SLC ) Ribs or Spare Ribs , and 3 to 5 hours for Baby Back Ribs .
Thicker , meatier slabs take longer , and if you use rib holders so they are crammed close to each other , add another hour .
Total time .
A maximum of 5 to 6 hours for Spare Ribs and St. Louis Cut Ribs , 4 hours for Baby Back ribs .
1 slab baby back ribs or St. Louis cut ribs or spareribs
4 tablespoons of Meathead 's Memphis Dust
1 teaspoon Morton ’s kosher salt ( 1/4 teaspoon per pound of meat )
1 cup of barbecue sauce ( optional )
About the ribs .
The jargon butchers use to name different rib cuts can be confusing .
Baby backs lie near the spine .
Spareribs attach to them and run all the way down to the chest .
St. Louis Cut Ribs are the meatiest and most flavorful ribs .
They are spareribs with the tips removed so they form a nice rectangular rack .
I sometimes call the " center cut ribs " .
You can use Baby Back Ribs for this recipe if you prefer .
They are a bit leaner , smaller , and cook faster .
Country ribs are really not ribs , they are chops and should be cooked very differently , so do n't use them for this recipe .

About the salt .
Remember , kosher salt is half the concentration of table salt so if you use table salt , use half as much .
Click here to read more about salt and how it works .
Also .
8 ounces by weight of hardwood chunks , chips , or pellets .
It does n't matter how many slabs you are cooking , 8 ounces should be enough .
You do n't have to be precise , just measure it in some fashion so you have a baseline for your next cook .
Then you can add or subtract if you wish .
I prefer chunks of apple , oak , or hickory for pork .
Never use any kind of pine unless you want meat that tastes like turpentine .
Never use construction lumber because it is often treated with poisonous chemicals to discourage rot and termites .
You do not need to soak the wood because wood does not absorb much water .
That 's why they make boats with it .

Method
1 ) Rinse .
Rinse the ribs in cool water to remove any bone bits from the butchering .
2 ) Skin 'n ' trim .
If the butcher has not removed the membrane from the under side , do it yourself .
It gets leathery and hard to chew , it keeps fat in , and it keeps sauce out .
Insert a butter knife under the membrane , then your fingers , work a section loose , grip it with a paper towel , and peel it off .
Finally , trim the excess fat from both sides .
If you can't get the skin off , with a sharp knife , cut slashes through it every inch so some of the fat will render out during the cooking .

3 ) Salt .
Salt is important .
It penetrates deep and amplifies flavor .
It helps proteins retain moisture .
And it helps with bark , the desired crust on the top formation .
Click here to read more about how salt works .
It is truly the magic rock .
If you can , give the salt 1 to 2 hours to be absorbed .
The process of salting in advance is called dry brining .
The rule of thumb is 1 /2 teaspoon of kosher salt per pound of meat , but ribs are about 50 % bone , so use about 1 / 4 teaspoon per pound .
You can simply eyeball it by sprinkling on the same amount of salt you would sprinkle on the ribs if they were served to you unsalted .
If you are watching your salt intake , let 's do some math .
We recommend about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt per pound of meat .
That 's equivalent to 1/4 teaspoon of table salt .
Table salt weights 5.69 grams per teaspoon .
But most of us do n't eat a whole pound of meat .
Say you eat 1 / 2 pound , that 's 1/8 teaspoon of table salt or 0.711 grams or 711 milligrams , or less than 1/3 of your recommended daily intake .
Beware of double salt jeopardy !
Rubs and spice blends are a great way to add flavor to meat .
Commercial rubs almost always contain salt because salt amps up flavor and helps form a crust .
Brines are also a great way to add flavor as well as moisture ( click here to read about The Science of Brines ) .
Meat that is labeled " enhanced " or " flavor enhanced " or " self - basting " or " basted " has been injected with a brine at the packing plant .
You can use a rub on brined ribs , but beware of double salt jeopardy .
A salty rub on top of brined or kosher meat can make it unbearably salty .
If you use brined or kosher meat and then a rub , you should make your own rub and leave the salt out of the blend .
Remember , you can always add salt , but you can't take it away .
4 ) Rub .
Some folks insist on putting the barbecue rub on the night before , but it is n't necessary .
The molecules in spices are too large to penetrate more than a tiny fraction of an inch .
Read this for the science .
Anytime before cooking time , just coat the meat with a thin layer of water .
The water helps dissolve the spices .
Then sprinkle enough Meathead 's Memphis Dust , an award wining barbecue rub spice blend , to coat all surfaces but not so much that the meat does n't show through .
That is about 2 tablespoons per side depending on the size of the slab .
Spread the Memphis Dust on the meat and rub it in .
A lot of cooks like to use mustard under the rub as a form of glue .
Mustard is water , vinegar , and maybe white wine ( all mostly water ) with mustard powder mixed in .
The amount of mustard powder is so small that by the time the water steams off and drips away , the mustard powder remaining is miniscule .
My experience is that using a mustard slather makes little or no difference in the final outcome .
If you want a mustard flavor , you will do much better by simply sprinkling it on the meat .
5 ) Fire up your barbecue smoker or set up your grill for 2 - zone or indirect cooking .
2 - zone cooking on a grill is the secret to keeping the temp down so you do n't shrink the proteins and make the meat tough .
Adjust the temp .
Preheat your cooker to about 225 °F and try to keep it there throughout the cook .
This is crucial :
You can absolutely positively noway nohow rely on bi-metal dial thermometers .
Even if you spent a fortune on your grill they mount unreliable thermometers on them .
If you are not monitoring your cooker with a good digital oven thermometer , you are setting yourself up for disappointment .
Using a dial thermometer is like trying to send email with a typewriter .
Click here to read my buyer 's guide to thermometers .
On a charcoal grill , adjust the air intake dampers at the bottom to control heat on charcoal grills .
Intake dampers are more effective than exhaust dampers for controlling the temp because they reduce the supply of oxygen to the coals .
Take your time getting the temp right .
Cooking at 225 °F will allow the meat to roast low and slow , liquefying the collagen in connective tissues and melting fats without getting the proteins knotted in a bunch .
It 's a magic temp that creates silky texture , adds moisture , and keeps the meat tender .
If you can't hit 225 °F , get as close as you can .
Do n't go under 200 °F and try not to go over 250 °F .

6 ) Smoke .
Add about 4 ounces of dry wood at this time .
Do not soak the wood !
This is a myth .
Put the wood as close to the flame as possible .
7 ) Relax .
Put the slabs in the cooker in indirect heat , meaty side up , close the lid , go drink a beer , read a book , or make love .
8 ) More smoke .
When the smoke dwindles after 20 to 30 minutes , add another 4 ounces of wood .
That 's it .
Stop adding wood .
On your first attempt , resist the temptation .
Nothing will ruin a meal faster and waste money better than oversmoked meat .
You can always add more the next time you cook , but you can not take it away if you oversmoke .
If you have more than one slab on , halfway through the cook you will need to move the ribs closest to the fire away from the heat , and the slabs farthest from the flame in closer .
Leave the meat side up .
There is no need to flip the slabs .
You can peek if you must , but do n't leave the lid open for long .
9 ) The Texas Crutch .
This optional trick involves wrapping the slab in foil with about an ounce of water for up to an hour to speed cooking and tenderize a bit .
Almost all barbecue ribs competition cooks use the Texas Crutch to get an edge .
But the improvement is really slight and I never bother for backyard cooking .
If you crutch too long you can turn the meat to mush and time in foil can soften the bark and remove a lot of rub .
I recommend it only for barbecue competitions when the tiniest improvement can mean thousands of dollars .
Skip it and you 'll still have killer ribs .
But if you 've seen it on TV and must try it , click here to learn more about The Texas Crutch .
The Texas Crutch is it is baked into a popular technique called the 3 - 2 - 1 method which I do not recommend .
Two hours in foil or butcher paper is far too long and can make the meat mushy .
Try the Texas Crutch after you master the basics .
10 ) The bend test .
Although I insist that you buy a good digital meat thermometer for most smoking and grilling , this is one of the few meats on which you cannot use a meat thermometer because the bones have an impact on the meat temp and because the meat is so thin .
Allow 5 to 7 hours for St. Louis Cut ( SLC ) Ribs or Spare Ribs , and 3 to 5 hours for Baby Back Ribs .
Thicker , meatier slabs take longer , and if you use rib holders so they are crammed close to each other , add another hour .
The exact time will depend on how thick the slabs are and how steady you have kept the temp .
If you use rib holders so they are crammed close to each other , add another hour .
Then check to see if they are ready .
I use the bend test ( a.k.a. the bounce test ) .
Pick up the slab with tongs and bounce it gently .
If the surface cracks as in the picture above , it is ready .
Here are some other tricks to tell when ribs are ready .
11 ) Sauce .
Some folks serve ribs without barbecue sauce , but most folks love their sauce .
Just go easy .
Let the meat shine through .
When the meat is done , paint both sides with your favorite home made barbecue sauce or store - bought barbecue sauce and cook for another 15 minutes or so .
Do n't put the sauce on earlier than then .
It has sugar and there is a risk it can burn .
Now here 's a trick I like : Sizzle on the sauce .
Put the ribs with sauce directly over the hottest part of a grill in order to caramelize and crisp the sauce .
On a charcoal grill , just move the slab over the coals .
On a gas grill , crank up all the burners .
On a water smoker , remove the water pan and move the meat close to the coals .
On an offset smoker , put a grate over the coals in the firebox and put the meat there .
With the lid open so you do n't roast the meat from above , sizzle the sauce on one side and then the other .
The sauce will actually sizzle and bubble .
Stand by your grill and watch because sweet sauce can go from caramelized to carbonized in less than a minute !
One coat of a thick sauce should be enough , but if you need two , go ahead , but do n't hide all the fabulous flavors under too much sauce .
If you think you 'll want more sauce , put some in a bowl on the table .
If you 've done all this right , you will notice that there is a thin pink layer beneath the surface of the meat .
This does not mean it is undercooked !
It is the highly prized smoke ring caused by the combustion gases and the smoke .
It is a sign of Amazing Ribs .
Now be ready to take a bow when the applause swells from the audience .
Video : Making Last Meal Ribs
Here 's a video from our fan Jason King that shows the whole process .
Fair Use advocates , take notice .
Circuit City is apparently putting its neck on the line to provide customers with DVD transfer services .
The company is offering a " DVD video transfer service " that for all intents and purposes is illegal .
The company will take commercial DVDs and rip them for use on portable devices for $ 10 for 1 DVD , $ 20 for 3 DVDs or $ 30 for 5 DVDs .
That is , until their legal department hears what 's happening .
The DMCA , of course , makes this illegal .
Even if fair use clearly provides users the " right " to make backup and private transformative copies of works that they have purchased , the DMCA itself makes it illegal to circumvent encrypted access controls for any reason not allowed for by the Library of Congress .
If Circuit City has n't received a cease and desist , they will soon .
It 's a real shame , too , because this should be a viable market .
Software and services are losing out to draconian digital rights management philosophies and anti-consumer technologies aimed at increasing revenues stemming from double - dipping what I call the industry 's penchant for charging twice for the same thing .
While charging $ 10 to rip a single DVD is pricey , if there was a market for DVD copying software , there would be competition , too .
But since 321 Studios ' DVD X Copy and DVD Copy Plus software was found to violate the DMCA , such software has been effectively banned from US retailers .
A plethora of software is available for copying DVDs online , but all of it is technically illegal to use the United States .
The situation is especially frustrating because challenging the status quo in court has been difficult .
When 321 Studios had their day in court , we hoped that DVD copying would be affirmed .
Sadly , it was n't .
Judge Susan Illston put aside the questions of fair use and instead focused on the legality of 321 Studios ' actions .
" Legal downstream use of the copyrighted material by customers is not a defense to the software manufacturer 's violation of the provisions ( of copyright law ) , " she wrote .
According to a promotional plaque photographed by a Consumerist reader , Circuit City requires that transfers come " from an original copy of your DVD collection , " but they have no way of verifying that .
Even if they could , we do n't expect the MPAA to care .
We all know that as far as the MPAA and its members are concerned , the best solution is the one in which customers buy separate copies of movies for their TVs and their portable media players .
Circuit City 's moves are welcome , but unfortunately doomed unless the retailer decides to stick to its guns .
Update : Bill Cimino from Circuit City ?s corporate offices has confirmed to Ars Technica that this service was actually not offered by Circuit City officially , and that the signage was not accurate nor was it authorized .
