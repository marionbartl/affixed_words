Advertisement Security forces are battling to retake a police academy in eastern Pakistan after a group of gunmen attacked it with grenades and assault rifles .
A senior Pakistani official told the BBC that 40 people had been killed and 80 injured in the attack on the outskirts of Lahore .
But amid the confusion , other officials have given lower figures .
Firing was continuing more than seven hours after it began with about 30 - 40 people thought to be trapped inside .
The attack comes less than a month after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore .
Officials said they had arrested two suspects carrying explosives
In that attack , six policemen were killed , while up to 14 gunmen escaped .
Pakistani officials say it is too early to say who is responsible for Monday 's assault in Lahore .
Escalating militant violence in Pakistan has been concentrated in the country 's north - west near the border with Afghanistan .
But insurgents have increasingly targeted big cities in recent months .
Compound surrounded The Lahore academy has been named by local media as the Manawan police training school .
It is on the outskirts of the city , on a road to the border with India .

I am on a rooftop quite close to the compound with a lot of people who have gathered to watch .
There does seem to have been an intensification in the fighting around the compound .
We saw helicopters circling low and firing into the compound and then there was a series of explosions - I counted at least four within a few minutes .
We can hear quite a lot of gunfire inside the compound .
One of the hostages who emerged said he was the son of a police officer .
He was tearful but uninjured .

One official said the gunmen had attacked from four sides .
Another said they had thrown grenades before starting to fire .
Several hundred trainees were said to be inside when they struck .
Hours later , 30 - 40 hostages were thought to remain trapped as elite troops battled militants holed up there .
Some 10 - 12 gunmen carried out the attack , officials said .
They said they had arrested two men carrying explosives and communications equipment .
It was not immediately clear whether the men had been inside the compound .
TV footage showed a slim bearded man in bloodstained clothes being dragged off by plainclothes security personnel .
Security forces blew up sections of the compound wall to get better access .
The BBC's Jill McGivering , in Lahore , said that some hours into the attack there were a series of explosions as security forces apparently tried to force their way into the main building .
Helicopters were sweeping low over the compound , she said , as they tried to move the battle into a final , critical stage .
At one point , several hostages were seen coming out .
' Dressed as police '
The scene is chaotic , our correspondent says , with roads around the site clogged with vehicles and people .

Then I saw a man firing a Kalashnikov running towards us .
" He had a beard and his face was partially covered by a bandanna .
Three of my colleagues fell down in the burst of firing .
I just turned and ran . "

( CNN ) -- A 17 - year - old Louisiana man faces first - degree murder and aggravated rape charges in the beating death of his girlfriend 's 8 - month - old son , police said .
Arnold T. Ross , 17 , is facing murder charges for the death of an 8 - month - old in his care , police say .
Authorities responding to a call of an unresponsive infant Saturday found the body of 8 - month - old Da-Von Lonzo in an apartment near Gretna , Louisiana , the Jefferson Parish Sheriff 's Office said in a statement .
The baby was taken to a local hospital , where he was pronounced dead .
The medical examiner ruled the boy 's death a homicide , noting that his body had multiple fractures consistent with being beaten .
The child also had tears in his rectum , police said .
In an interview , the teen , Arnold T. Ross , initially told authorities Da-Von fell down the stairs and stopped breathing while he was baby - sitting him .
But a neighbor reported hearing loud noises coming from the apartment , and investigators noted inconsistencies in Ross 's statement , according to the sheriff 's office .
Ross later admitted that Da - Von began to cry while he was watching him , police said , and " confessed to beating the infant repeatedly .
According to Ross , the child began to defecate on himself .
Ross claims he placed his fingers inside the infant 's rectum in an attempt to clean up the child . "
Under Louisiana law , a 17 - year - old can be charged as an adult , according to Col. John Fortunato , spokesman for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff 's Office .
The New Orleans Times - Picayune reported Sunday that people charged with first - degree murder cannot receive a bond .
Ross has a lengthy criminal history , police said , including arrests on drug possession charges ; obscenity ; battery on a correctional officer ; three counts of battery on a school teacher ; theft ; weapons charges ; and assault .
It was unclear Sunday if Ross had been convicted of any of those charges .

She poured a cup of hot cereal into his mouth without cooling it , burning Myers ' lip , tongue , and the inside of his mouth .
Thompson also did not report the incident for several hours , delaying a trip to the hospital , the prosecutor said .
There are plenty of things you should n't do at 17 , and some the fun police wo n't allow you to do , but there are few things of which you should be theoretically incapable .
Federico Macheda 's debut goal was one .
This was not some meaty long - range hit or an adrenaline - fuelled solo run , but a goal so aware and accomplished that it evoked the absolute pomp of a master finisher such as Jean - Pierre Papin .
( Or , more pertinently , his reserve - team coach Ole Solskjaer , who scored many similar goals . )
Six weeks on , it still blows the mind that a 17 - year - old , on debut , could do such a thing at such a critical time .
A day earlier , at Fulham , Liverpool had coolly presented a straight flush in the shape of Yossi Benayoun 's injury - time winner ; now United , and Macheda , showed them a royal flush , sending the title race decisively back in their favour .
And it was all done by a kid .
Not a fresh - faced one , admittedly – not since Arjen Robben became a man has there been an older - looking 17 - year - old – but a kid nonetheless .
In an increasingly cynical sport , this was , at the risk of assuming the position atop the Guardian Pomposity & Pontification Throne , a reminder of why we fell in love with football in the first place .
Even Sky's Martin Tyler , a calm man who has seen pretty much everything in his commentary career , lost it .
There is a glib assumption that Macheda is heading right for the top , but the cases of others who have scored famous goals at a young age or on debut – Mark Robins , Josimar , even Michael Owen – suggest that might not be the case .
Yet whether Macheda plays seven games for Manchester United or 700 , he will always be an Old Trafford legend .
Sir Alex Ferguson can talk until he 's blue in the face , or red in the nose , about how this scoreline was unjust , but he doth protest far too much .
Ferguson , like everyone else involved , knows that when it comes to contests as tribal as Manchester United versus Liverpool , everything but the scoreline is superfluous .
This was an absolute tousing , one that neither side will ever forget .
Seeing Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic , a pair who ordinarily ooze certainty , reduced to nervous wrecks by Liverpool 's devastating counter - attacks was surreal enough , like watching a bomb disposal expert with the shakes , but that had nothing on the shambling joke that is Andrea Dossena outpacing John O'Shea in the snail race to lob the fourth .
It was the final straw on a day of numbing indignity for United – a day that you suspect , behind closed doors at least , turned Ferguson the deepest shade of purple .
There have been umpteen outstanding goals this season – Carlton Cole 's winner at Wigan for one – but none had the sheer majesty of Abou Diaby 's strike at Villa Park , which fused sublime skill , 21st‑century athleticism and Zen - like calm .
It began with a Redondo turn on Curtis Davies and , after the sort of imperious , leggy and deceptively quick stride that could make grown men go weak at the knees , ended with a coolly emphatic clip into the net .
We 're not exactly sure what else he did all season , apart from another regal finish at Newcastle , but when he scores goals this good we 'll let him off .
Many a tackle has turned the course of a game , but Phil Neville 's on Cristiano Ronaldo turned a whole season .
It 's easy to forget , so adroitly and unobtrusively did this most admirable of teams regroup after the blessing in disguise of an early European elimination , but Everton were a desperate mess at the start of the season : short on players ( look at their foetal bench for the first Premier League game ) and haemorrhaging goals .
In the eight games before they faced United , they took eight points and conceded 18 goals .
That 's the same number they have conceded in the 28 games since Neville 's tackle , a zesty , calculated , ball - and - man reducer for which he was booked , catalysed a rousing 1 - 1 draw against the champions that enabled Everton to stop the bleeding .
At that stage they were 14th in the table , but within a week they were seventh and have not dropped out of the top half since .
The tackle even has its own Facebook group , and enabled Neville to win over a genuinely sceptical home crowd .
But it was the effect on the collective rather than the personal that was most important .
Rafael Benítez facting up against Sir Alex Ferguson was entertainingly hamfisted stuff , but Liverpool 's storming end to the season means that the final verdict on whether it was a success – and if you go after the king , you best not miss – has been postponed until the end of next season .
Not so with Joe Kinnear 's legendary rant at the press in October , which famously contained 52 cusswords in five minutes .
At one stage he was rattling along so well that you thought Joe 90 might soon have a new meaning .
The verdict may not be in as to whether the Daily Mirror 's Simon Bird is indeed " a cunt " , as Kinnear suggested in the best opening gambit in history , but we do now know that he was more than justified in railing against the widespread sniggering that followed his appointment as Newcastle 's interim manager , when he was belittled by almost everybody as a dinosaur with what looked dangerously like a bleach rinse gone wrong .
Kinnear often wore the befuddled look of a man who pressed the wrong button in the DeLorean , and the Charles Insomnia episode was a gem , but he knows how to manage football teams .
While he was in charge , Newcastle took 20 points from 18 league games ( a safety - securing 42 points pro rata ) ; without him they have managed 14 from 19 ( or 28 from 38 games ) .
More than that , however , his outburst was gloriously funny , in a way that only someone completely misplacing their rag can be .
Everyone will have their favourite bit ; ours is a pause that Jack Benny could not have judged better between " What are you , my personal secretary ? " and the devastatingly subtle punchline : " Fuck off " .
Who would n't want to be Brian Clough ?
He was a genius , he was immensely charismatic , and he played who - blinks - first with booze on a daily basis .
Most of us realise that we can't be Brian Clough , however , and so concentrate on that last bit .
Phil Brown , does things the other way round .
The problem with that is that Clough managed on instinct , a privilege afforded a blessed few , whereas Brown comes across as a phony who has spent too much time with his £ 2.99 " How To Be Like Brian Clough " set from Woolworths .
Holden Caulfield would have had a field day with him .
Brown 's desire to be a maverick manager has manifested itself in umpteen displays of ostentatious eccentricity throughout the season , most notably and infamously at Eastlands on Boxing Day when , with his side 4 - 0 down at half - time , he decided that you did n't need a dressing room for a dressing - down and instead kept the players on the pitch .
It backfired spectacularly , and the perception was that Brown lost the dressing room without even being in it .
Some people are on the pitch , they think it 's all over ...
Hull 's season pretty much was : they were sixth at the time , but have won only a single game since .
One other thing : whether for charity or not , Clough would never , ever have worn that beard .
Apple on Monday released iTunes 8.2 , an update to its music jukebox software and online store interface for the Mac and Windows .
It 's available for download through the Software Update system preference .
Apple notes that iTunes 8.2 now supports iPhones and iPod touches equipped with the iPhone 3.0 software update .
Other accessibility improvements and bug fixes have also been made .
Apple also improved security in iTunes 8.2 .
According to a notice , Apple has improved bounds checking in 8.2 to prevent a stack buffer overflow problem that could lead to unexpected app termination or arbitrary code execution .
What makes this remarkable it that iPhone 3.0 software update is not yet available ; in fact , Apple has not stated a hard release date for the software , though it 's expected to take center stage at Apple 's Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) , which takes place next week -- June 8 - 12 , 2009 -- in San Francisco , Calif .
i Phone OS 3.0 , current in beta , features more than 1,000 Application Programming Interfaces ( APIs ) , exposing new features and functionality in the iPhone .
Features include the ability to purchase downloadable content in applications , " Push " notification , peer - to - peer connectivity based on Bluetooth , rather than Wi -fi , accessory support , iPod library and Map Kit access and much more .
This story , " In Preparation of IPhone 3.0 , Apple Posts ITunes 8.2 " was originally published by Macworld .
The implanted telescope holds much promise for patients , typically elderly , who suffer from end - stage , age - related macular degeneration , or A.M.D. , said Janet P. Szlyk , a member of the advisory panel .
Dr. Szlyk is executive director of the Chicago Lighthouse for People Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired , a social services agency .
The device does not cure the disease , but it does improve visual acuity , she said .
For example , a person who might usually see a blur when looking at a friend ’s face might , with the help of the magnified image , see a blur only in the area of the person ’s nose or mouth .
“ People can use it to recognize faces in a social setting , ” she said .
‘ That ’s a huge advance . ”
The telescope is implanted in one eye for jobs like reading and facial recognition .
The other eye , unaltered , is used for peripheral vision during other activities like walking .
After implantation , extensive therapy is crucial , she said , to learn to deal with the different abilities of the eyes .
Ruth A. Boocks , 86 , of Alpharetta , Ga. , who received an implant of the device in March 2003 during clinical trials , said her brain learned to adapt quickly .
Mrs. Boocks uses her new visual abilities in various ways  for instance , to read e-mail and the messages that scroll across the bottom of the screen when she ’s watching television .
“ My goal was to read to the bottom of the eye charts , ” she said .
“ But I did n’t quite make it . ”
( She has gotten to the third line from the bottom . )
“ I feel like a young woman , ” she added .
“ It ’s opened a lot of opportunities for me . ”
Henry L. Hudson , a retina specialist in Tucson , Ariz. , and lead author of two papers on the telescope published in peer - reviewed journals , said the device was not for everyone with A.M.D.
“ Maybe only 20 out of every 100 candidates will get the telescope , ” he said .
“ They may not be eligible because of the shape of their eyes , ” or they may have another problem , like maintaining balance , that precludes their selection , he added .

Marines Under Investigation After Autistic Man Allowed to Enlist Court documents say Joshua
Fry was put through boot camp despite diagnosis .
July 17 , 2009  -- Joshua
Fry 's career as a Marine never should have been .
Now his recruiter and other military personnel who pushed the autistic 20 - year - old through boot camp could face criminal charges .
Fry , who has a history of being abused and neglected and has a criminal record , is sitting in a cell at Camp Pendleton on disciplinary charges as the military investigates why a Marine recruiter picked Fry up from a California group home for the mentally disabled and drove him to a recruitment center to sign him up .
" An investigation into the circumstances of Private Fry 's accession in the Corps , could lead to subsequent administrative or criminal proceedings against those directly involved , if warranted , " a high - ranking Marine based at the Pentagon told ABCNews.com .
The Marine , who is familiar with the Fry case , requested not to be identified , but said the Marines are prepared to hold accountable anyone who may have acted improperly during Fry 's time with the military .
" The American people rightfully expect a lot of their Marine Corps , " he said .
" If there is a perception that something is afoul , we will aggressively root out the truth . "
Experts say the case of Joshua Fry , who will face court marial on July 20 on charges of possessing child pornography and unauthorized absences , highlights a disconcerting trend of the military accepting candidates that never would have been considered a few years earlier as the forces struggle to supply the manpower for the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" It 's hard work being a recruiter anyway , " said Beth Asch , a senior economist at Rand Corporation , the Santa Monica , Calif . - based non-profit think tank .
" And when you 're not a successful one , it 's an issue . "
Asch , who is working on a study relating to recruiter impropriety and fraudulent enlistment , said failure to meet recruiting quotas , called " goals " or " missions " by the military , can result in recruiters working weekends and late hours and coming under the glare of a disapproving supervisor which , in the military , can be " demoralizing . "
If recruiters miss a quota , she said , " life sucks . "
U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez , D - Calif. , a 13 - year member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee , told ABCNews.com that she had heard of the Fry case and that it might be worth a House investigation .
" I 'd say that was a pretty desperate recruiter , " she said .
Sanchez said it 's typically the Army , not the Marines , that have had significant problems meeting beits recruiting numbers since about two years after the wars began .
But now , as the Army begins its pullout in Iraq , more Marines are being called to quell rising tensons in Afghanistan .
" We certainly have put a closer look on the recruiting tactics of the recruiters during this time , " Sanchez said .
As the wars drag on , Asch agreed , more soldiers , sailors and Marines are being admitted into the military service with medical and character flaws that can run the gamut from disqualifying surgeries to felonies .
" It 's harder to make missions and quality has declined , " Asch said .
Sanchez said her subcommittee has recommended stricter guidelines for the recruiters and set aside funds for bigger incentive bonuses to attract higher quality recruits .
Both Sanchez and Asch said the recession has actually played a helpful role in the business of recruiting , attracting well - educated yet unemployed men and women to the military .
But then the stories come in , Sanchez said , about how recruiters have been known to tell potential enlistees who have failed a drug test to stay clean for a few days and try again .
" We 've seen more of a drug problem in our military , " she said .
But the story of Fry 's enlistment , she said , was unlike anything she 's heard .
Fry was born in 1988 to a crack addicted father and a mother on heroin according to his lawyer 's 35 - page court motion to dismiss the charges , which was later rejected .
The document details a downtrodden life that included physical and possible sexual abuse all while Fry slipped further behind in his developmental progress .
By the age of 3 , according to the motion , he tested as having an IQ of 70 and was found to be anti-social and self - abusive .
He was diagnosed with autism when he was 3 and then again as a teenager .
Enlistment of Autistic Marine May Have Violated Several Recruitment Standards
While in high school Fry was arrested for suspected larceny of iPods and found to have a knife .
The charges were eventually dismissed and Fry was sent to what the motion describes as a " lockdown facility for youths " in Colorado to finish high school and receive treatment and counseling .
It was during this time that his legal guardian , grandmother Mary Beth Fry applied for and was granted temporary conservatorship over her grandson , the court noting that Fry , then 18 , lacked the capacity to fully care for himself or enter into contracts on his own behalf .
After leaving the Colorado facility , Fry took up residence at a group home in Irvine , Calif. , where he was living until his enlistment .
An assessment in 2006 by a licensed psychiatrist who treated Fry for two years noted that while the young man was high - functioning for a person with autism " he appears quite limited in his ability to think ahead of possible consequences . "
That foreshadowing seemed to come true once Fry got to boot camp on Jan. 14 , 2008 .
" Immediately it was clear to Fry that he could not keep up with the day - to - day pace of boot camp , " the motion argued .
" Several times
Fry informed his staff that he did not want to be a Marine .
Each time he was told that was not an option . "
But what was surprising to some after the fact is how he even got there in the first place .
While the words " autism " and " developmental disability " are never mentioned in the medical evaluation checklist , a Pentagon official said the disorder is considered included in section E1.25.26 , which states " current or history of other mental disorders … that in the opinion of the civilian or military provider shall interfere with , or prevent satisfactory performance of military duty are disqualifying . "
Other prohibited behaviors that could have disqualified Fry from the start include :
Having a perceptual or learning disorder
Inpatient treatment in a hospital or residential facility
Recurrent encounters with law enforcement agencies , anti-social attitudes or behaviors
History of " immaturity , instability , personality inadequacy , impulsiveness or dependency . "
According to the document , Fry struck up a friendship with Marine Gunnery Sgt. Matthew Teson , then a recruiter , while participating in the Young Marines Program in high school .
The two had spoken about Fry 's possible enlistment , a discussion put on hold when he was sent to the Colorado facility .
Not knowing Fry was in Colorado , Teson called his house and spoke with Mary Beth Fry , who claims according to the court document , that she told the recruiter her grandson was autistic and had " extreme behavioral problems . "
" He is not Marine material .
Please take him off the list , " the grandmother told Teson , according to the document .
But when Fry contacted Teson about enlistment on Jan. 4 , 2008 , just a few months after returning to California , Teson allegedly drove to pick up Fry from the group home for the mentally disabled where Fry was living .
The motion indicates Fry told Teson that he was autistic and asthmatic and that his grandmother had limited conservatorship over him .
" While assisting Fry in filing out the paperwork Teson instructed Fry that ' if we do n't put yes , then they do n't know , ' " the document states regarding Teson 's alleged knowledge of Fry 's medical and legal complication .
Ten days later Fry was at boot camp .
On Day 13 , he was caught repeatedly stealing peanut butter from the chow hall despite being admonished for doing so earlier and urinated in his canteen .
He was also found to be disrespectful to his drill instructors and refused to shave or follow orders .
On Day 14 , according to the motion , Fry told his senior drill instructor and staff that he had both autism and asthma and he no longer wished to be a Marine .
After the Marines confirmed Fry 's claims with Mary Beth Fry , she was told her grandson would be kicked out of boot camp and sent home .
But Fry was n't sent home .
Instead , he was graduated from boot camp on April 11 , 2008 , and sent for combat training at Camp Pendleton near San Diego .
Marines ' Target a Very Specific Individual '
Though the Marines have a reputation for being the most stringent of the Armed Forces , Maj .
Christopher Logan , director of public affairs for the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and spokesman for the Western recruiting region , said the Marines are simply looking for a very specific type of recruit .
" We target a very specific individual , " he said .
" We 're looking for the very driven individual to live up to the challenge . "
Logan said he was not allowed to comment on the specifics of Fry 's performance , but he did note that Fry was able to graduate from boot camp and " our training is extremely difficult . "
But if Fry 's time at boot camp was rough , his stint at Pendleton was even worse .
On May 26 , according to the court document , Fry was found to have inappropriate images on his cell phone .
The court document said Fry was subjected to five hours of interrogation and verbally ordered not to possess any similar images .
But more inappropriate images -- deemed to be child pornography from the charges leveled by military court -- were found again on July 18 , 2008 and July 26 , 2008 on his computer and cell phone , court documents state .
That along with two instances of Fry allegedly going " UA , " Marine shorthand for taking an unauthorized absence from his command , resulted in his arrest .
An additional charge of deliberate concealment was added in February , claiming fraudulent enlistment based on Fry 's failure to disclose prior psychiatric treatment for a desire to look at child pornography .
Mary Beth
Fry declined to comment on her grandson 's enlistment or imprisonment , saying she had been advised by his lawyer , Michael Studenka , not to talk about the case .
A woman who answered the phone at Studenka 's office said there would be no comment on Fry 's case .
But Mary Beth
Fry told the Los Angeles Times that her grandson was not doing well while being held at Camp Pendleton and that she wants him released so he can get the medical treatment he needs .
" He 's had a lot of problems being locked up , " she said .
" He 's on psychotropic drugs .
He 's been diagnosed as bipolar and is having trouble holding it together . "
Teson could not be reached for comment and is now stationed in North Carolina , no longer working as a recruiter .
Logan said Teson 's reassignment had nothing to do with the Fry case and was part of an ongoing rotation where recruiters work in three - year stints .
Logan said that everything relating to Fry 's activities as a recruit and a Marine was under investigation , including Teson 's conduct .
While criminal background checks are done on every recruit , medical records are not pulled unless for a specific reason .
That 's why , Logan said , " disclosure is very , very important . "
Non-disclosure on the part of the recruit or the recruiter , he said , is grounds for dismissal from the Marines or being court - martialed .
Citing the ongoing investigation , military superiors have declined to allow comment from Maj .
Michael Stehle , Teson 's commanding officer during his time as a recruiter in Orange County , Calif. , and from the Naval battalion corpsman identified in the court document as " HM1 Sutherland " who allegedly knew of Fry 's autism at boot camp .
Numbers from the Department of Defense show 2,426 claims of recruiter misconduct across the Armed Forces in 2007 , the most recent data available .
Of those , 593 were substantiated .
Though those figures were lower in 2007 than the previous year , data from the Army and Marines show a reversed trend , with the number of both claims and substantiated claims rising slightly from 2006 to 2007 .
In the Army there were 357 substantiated claims of recruiter misconduct , up from 333 in 2006 .
Those figures for the Marines were 118 substantiated claims in 2007 , compared to 102 the previous year .
But the number of claims compared to the number of recruitments remains very low -- .20 percent for the Army and .27 percent for the Marines in 2007 .
Non-Disclosure Risks Dismissal , Court Martial
Asch said that most Marines who enlist with a medical or criminal history that does n't mesh with the ideals of military policy do so with a waiver .
Studies have shown that the dissemination of waivers has increased in all branches of the armed services .
A quality study done each year by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense showed that the Army had been particularly hard hit in the area of high school graduates , with the number of recruits with a diploma dropping from 92 percent in 2003 to 83 percent in 2008 .
The Marines , by comparison , dropped from 98 percent to 96 percent during the same time period .
Fry , Logan said , never got a waiver .
And unless Teson would have brought concerns about Fry 's history to his commanding officer -- Maj .
Stehle in this case -- Teson 's supervisors would have had no reason to question this recruit out of thousands that come through each year .
Dr. Wayne Fisher , director of the Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders and professor of behavioral research at the University of Nebraska Medical Center 's Monroe - Meyer Institute , has been studying autism since 1976 .
He would n't go so far as to say a high - functioning autistic person should be precluded from the military on that diagnosis alone -- he know of some high - functioning people who became college professors -- but admitted the number of recruits with autism that would do well in that capacity would be in the minority .
Fisher has not treated Fry and could not comment on his case specifically .
Some people with autism function well in a tightly regimented life , he said , " but if they 're not able to function alone and they 're in a facility where they 're not taking care of themselves , that would be a flag . "
In general autistic adults lack the ability to handle unique situations and have few friends .
They are typically incapable of living a fully independent life .
Many ,
Fisher said , find a niche working in jobs that require little social interaction such as working with machines or stocking shelves .
But for now , Fry will remain at Camp Pendleton , waiting as a judge rules on his fate and the Marines figure out why he was even there to begin with .

I Hacked Amazon -- Sorry
Alright , everyone .
I confess .
I hacked Amazon and delisted books about gays and lesbians , mainly because statistically speaking , I figured gays and lesbians would be the most irate about being targeted for being " obscene , " and Americans would rally to the defense of gays and lesbians faster than to the aid of S&M enthusiasts , pedophiles , straight pervs , or puppet - fetishists .
There are many gays who are also powerful white males and who are unashamed of their sexual preference .
I rolled the dice .
I also rerouted all queries from publishers with Amazon Advance accounts about the hack to my private email address ( I started doing this back in February in my spare time ) .
I 've had a grudge against Amazon for years .
Finding the motivation was easy .
What you want to know , now that Amazon 's stock has taken a nice little jab , now that they 've lost massive amounts of consumer confidence , and now that everyone is questioning Amazon 's politics and allegiances , is WHY ?
Why would I do this ?
Simple .
I wanted to teach you all a lesson about power .
Power is a quality that you are born into and that you give away over the course of your life until you have none left .
The wise give their power to love or to freedom .
The more power you give away to a company or government ( even a benevolent company or government ) , the greater the possibility for abuse if things ever change inside that company , because a company or government does not inherently possess power , and must acquire it through serpentine methods .
Additionally , crass , spineless submissiveness to an entity like Amazon does n't just make a powerful agent ABLE to hurt you , it actually creates the desire .
They do not respect you ; they decide you actually need to be manipulated and controlled .
As everyone knows , Amazon would never willingly target gays and lesbians as filthy , obscene individuals .
But that 's beside the point : the point is , what do we do when Amazon decides to target ANYONE ?
We have given Amazon too much power over America 's publishing apparatus , and -- as they seek to acquire more by creating and controlling an ebook market that depends solely on an incredibly expensive proprietary device -- we need to start asking ourselves : is Amazon a neutral agent when it comes to publishing ?
Even if they are , what then ?
A publicly - traded , profit - motivated company should not run the publishing world and grow from the artistic creations of others while risking nothing , helping no one , and only standing up for causes when financially convenient .
They receive the penumbra effect of standing up for literature while simultaneously doing no work to cultivate talent or take risks on controversial ideas .
A publishing company ( which Amazon has become ) must work for its writers .
Publishers and writers must be chained together to provide risky products for booksellers if we want to continue to have new ideas .
For this reason , it is time to move past the convenience of Amazon ( all ebook providers provide equally instantaneous products ) -- and try to find companies who make it a company PROMISE -- a keystone of their business model -- to never censor or sort content based on any racial , sexual , political , or criminal reasons .
A company that can't be hacked like I hacked Amazon , because the idea that they would censor content would be as absurd as an independent bookstore hosting bonfires of its stock in the parking lot .
It did n't take you very long to believe that Amazon could be capable of such a massive , evil , Orwellian censorship campaign , did it ?
And yet you will keep trusting them now ?
I feel pretty safe about confessing my crime , because I know Amazon is going to tell you that this was an " internal glitch that they are working to fix . "
Their stockholders would sell , sell , sell , fucking sell , if they knew how easy it was for a third party to hack Amazon to rearrange sales data in order to influence a particular agenda .
I deleted ranks and delisted books , but it 's much easier to keep the sales data on books low or hack the reviews to bury a controversial novel or political text .
Amazon 's sudden success has made it trivially easy for them to influence the reading habits of the entire world , which is a power that tyrants have been clamoring for since the dawn of civilization .
To assume things will be different now is desperately naive .
You could choke the Tigris and Euphrates dry with the bodies of all the people who have been killed by powerful organizations ( governments , companies , religions , mafias ) for speaking their mind .
I also hacked Amazon to show you how easy it is to build a virtual ghetto based upon arbitrary political opinions .
First , you make sure that the only way people can publish ( and make money ) is through your apparatus .
You become both publisher and bookstore , perhaps the most insidious monopoly cobbled together since oil company and car manufacturer .
Then you TAG , IDENTIFY , AND INDEX -- delisting and " burning " the authors with whom you disagree , or with whom you have been paid to disagree by private interest .
You will see outrage from some sources , but you will also find those who defend your practice .
Next , you mark those who stand up in opposition to you .
You TAG , IDENTIFY , INDEX , and DELIST them next .
You also mark those who stand up in support of your practice .
Using the same power to control sales and attention , you raise them in stature and make sure their voices are heard more loudly .
So easy .
The lazy work of an afternoon .
Do you wish to keep giving Amazon your power ?
Or are you convinced that it is time to start busting up these publisher - seller monopolies ( Amazon , Google , Sony , Apple ) before things become a nightmare incommensurate with our ability to unplug and restart ?
At least we must recognize them for what they are : monstrosities that must be challenged with all the wit and guile that writers can muster .
The only thing that saved the world 's literature from being burned up forever by barbarians and bigots during the fall of Rome and the ensuing dark ages was the physical difficulty of locating each and every book and consigning them each to the INDEX and the FLAME .
That physical difficulty has been eliminated by companies like Amazon and Google who seek to centralize power and authority over the maintenance and dissemination of your right to information .
The potential for abuse is worse than any government has ever dreamed , and even if these companies stay sane and good , what is to stop anyone from taking these companies over and paring down their available books to only a few select titles ?
We have given Amazon and Google enormous power over literature without saddling them with the enormous responsibility that ought to follow .
We need to make laws that establish powerful checks and balances that limit those who both sell books and publish them ( unidirectional powerhouses like Amazon ) from abusing their hideous strength .
More than anything , we individually need to think about the possibilities for abuse before we do deals with companies that have no interest in protecting our intellectual property and make no promises to do so .
I am sorry I hacked Amazon to delist your books and mark them as obscene .
But do n't you see that it is the possibility that is the problem and not the crime itself ?
Congress has voted to condemn the actions of the Iranian government , and as Reason points out , Ron Paul in typical contrarian fashion is the sole “ no ” vote :
I rise in reluctant opposition to H Res 560 , which condemns the Iranian government for its recent actions during the unrest in that country .
While I never condone violence , much less the violence that governments are only too willing to mete out to their own citizens , I am always very cautious about “ condemning ” the actions of governments overseas .
As an elected member of the United States House of Representatives , I have always questioned our constitutional authority to sit in judgment of the actions of foreign governments of which we are not representatives .
I have always hesitated when my colleagues rush to pronounce final judgment on events thousands of miles away about which we know very little .
And we know very little beyond limited press reports about what is happening in Iran .
I applaud Ron Paul for taking his usual principled stand .
Our Congress does not need to be spending their time issuing Resolutions toothless moralistic statements about America , much less other countries .
Even if I were to retreat from my cautious anarchist tendencies and accept that Congress actually deserves real responsibilities , that responsibility is to legislate , not preach .
But a part of those anarchist tendencies is Heinlein ’s rational anarchy .
All actions are ultimately morally within the hands of individuals .
Immaterial of laws or society , it is the individual who is morally responsible for acting rightly or wrongly .
So I do n’t ask Congress to speak on Iran .
Taking a chance to personalize H Res 560 , let me do it myself :
Resolved , That Brad Warbiany — expresses his support for all Iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties , and rule of law ; condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators by the Government of Iran and pro-government militias , as well as the ongoing government suppression of independent electronic communication through interference with the Internet and cellphones ; and affirms the universality of individual rights and considers any government which infringes upon those individual rights to be illegitimate .
Iran is at a very important point .
In a mere matter of hours , this may come to a head .
The mullahs have signaled that they will resort to violence with a call that any who continue protesting “ will be held responsible for the consequences and chaos . ”
Many people in Iran have said that they ’re going to protest anyway .
As I write this in California , it is 10:15 AM in Iran .
Much will happen in the next few hours .
To those Iranians who are not sure what will happen next , I can only wish you safety and success .
I ’m not sure you ’ll have the former , but if you do n’t I at least hope you achieve the latter .
If getting into the magical “ The Beatles : Rock Band Content Club ” was n’t enough to get you to pre-order The Beatles : Rock Band , maybe this is -- free additional songs .
GameStop has upped its pre-order ante by offering three free additional game songs by The Beatles , presumably via post release downloadable content .
The pre-order information does n’t specifically mention which tracks you ’ll get ; Harmonix and MTV Games have already confirmed “ All You Need Is Love ” and the classic Abbey Road in its entirety as DLC .
As if that was n’t enough , you ’ll also receive an unlock code for an “ in - game photo book album . ”
Something tells us that particular piece of content will already be on the game disc , and GameStop will simply bestow upon you a “ cheat code ” to unlock it with little effort .
However , the potential for never - before - seen images of the Fab Four should pique more than a few fan ’s interest .
Has anyone already thrown down their pre-order dollars , or is this the deal that ’ll put you over the edge ?
Patron : A Simpler Ruby HTTP Client for Ruby
By Ric Roberts
Until recently , I had been using the Curb library for making HTTP requests with Ruby , and I must say I was fairly happy with it .
Phillip Toland , on the other hand , was n't satisfied with Curb's API and the fact that it is tricky to modify ( being implemented mainly in C ) .
So , he came up with an alternative called Patron , written as much as possible in Ruby .
Patron is based on libcurl , just like Curb , but it aims to provide a simpler interface whilst still taking advantage of libcurl 's strengths .
To use Patron you can instantiate a Session object with your desired options :
sess = Patron :: Session.new sess.base_url = " http://search.twitter.com/ "
... and then call methods against that session to perform your GET , HEAD , PUT , POST or DELETE operations .
For example :
response = sess.get " search.json?q=ruby "
I really like the way that Patron lets you can send custom headers with your request , as I found this a bit fiddly in Curb .
sess.post ( " / foo/stuff " , " some data " , {" Content - Type " => " text / plain " } )
Phillip provides more background about his design choices on his blog .
You can find Patron on Github or install it as a gem .
| C vs Perl | Perl vs Python | POGL vs SDL | Windows vs Linux | POGL Benchmarks - C vs Perl Google digg it !
Stumbled on It ! del.icio.us reddit Slashdot It !
This is a benchmark implemented in C and Perl , using animated FBOs and a fragment shader .
Platforms
These benchmarks were performed on the same multi- boot system :
3 Ghz Intel Pentium D
1G Memory
n Vidia GeForce 6800 GT / AGP / SSE2
Matched nVidia drivers ( as of March , 15 , 2007 ) :
Linux : v97.55 Vista : v100.65
The tests were run using portable , non-OOP C and Perl code on :
Vista
Fedora 6 Ubuntu / Dapper
The C benchmarks require an OpenGL installation and GLUT .
The Perl benchmarks also require Perl , POGL and the Time : : HiRes module .
These tests were also run on a similar XP system , with similar results ; however , since it was not possible to install XP after Vista and Linux were already installed on this benchmark system , those results were not included in this report .
Summary
No statistical difference in overall performance between C and Perl
Perl outperformed C on FBO operations ; C beat Perl on Shader ops
On Vista , Perl occasionally / often ran faster than C
Fedora and Ubuntu were comparable in performance Linux was generally 60 % faster than Vista Results Vista Fedora 6 Ubuntu / Dapper PROFILE C Perl C Perl C Perl FBO Texture Rendering FPS 117.296043 137.680194 190.628178 192.675391 193.914733 194.749544 Teapot Shader FPS 267.217852 284.675682 479.408799 472.232557 472.171695 477.404038

There are a number of factors explaining the lack of significant difference between C and Perl OpenGL performance :
POGL is a compiled C module
Most of the work is performed by the GPU POGL leverages OpenGL : : Array ( OGA ) objects OGA stores data in typed C arrays , eliminating the need for conversion / copy / casting when passing array data to OpenGL APIs .
Perl OpenGL provides a number of other advantages :
Completely portable , with no compiling ; faster prototyping

Backs against the wall , Cavs win Game 5
Facing elimination , the Cleveland Cavaliers did what they needed to do tonight by winning Game 5 , 112-102 .
It was n’t always pretty , but a quick start put the Magic in the hole and a brilliant fourth quarter from LeBron James put Orlando away .
He posted 37 points , 15 rebounds and 12 assists , and was directly responsible ( either by making the bucket or the assist ) for 32 straight points spanning from the late third quarter to the late fourth .
The Cavs started out the game on fire , scoring 26 points in the first six minutes , while holding the Magic to just eight points during the same time frame .
To put that lead into perspective , at that point the Cavs were on pace to win the game by a score of 208 - 64 .
Wow .
But the Magic are nothing if not resilient , and a terrific second quarter trimmed the lead to one at halftime .
It looked like the Magic would once again take the game down to the wire , but Lebron ’s wonderful performance in the fourth quarter gave control back to the Cavs .
Mo Williams ’ fine play in the first half ( 18 points ) allowed LeBron to conserve his energy somewhat for the stretch run .
He broke out of his shooting slump , hitting 6 of 9 three pointers and finishing with 24 points .
The Cavs also enjoyed some good play from Zydrunas Ilgauskas ( 6 - 8 , 16 points ) , Delonte West ( 6 - 13 , 13 points ) and Daniel Gibson ( 3 - 5 , 11 points ) .
The Cavs shot 50 % from the field and 50 % from long range .
What ’s scary for the Cavs is that it took this kind of performance from LeBron and most of his supporting cast and the game was still close late in the fourth quarter .
Dwight Howard ( 24 points ) and Hedo Turkoglu ( 29 points ) played well , but Rashard Lewis ( 15 points ) and Rafer Alston ( 3 points ) combined to shoot just 5 of 23 from the field .
With the win , the pressure is back on the Magic .
Nobody really expects the Cavs to come back from a 3 - 1 deficit to win the series ( that ’s not to say it ca n’t be done ) , but with a potential Game 7 back in Cleveland , the Magic will definitely want to wrap things up in Orlando .
Game 6 is Saturday at 5:30 PM ET .
Leon , N.Y. ( AP ) -- Police cracking down on rowdy Amish youths ticketed a teenager for having beer in his horse - drawn buggy when they pulled him over on a western New York road .
They say 17 - year - old Chris Slabaugh , of Conewango , was charged with underage possession of alcohol after he was stopped by Cattaraugus County deputies late Monday night in the town of Leon , 40 miles south of Buffalo .
Detective Nathan
Root says the teen admitted drinking beer , but passed a field sobriety test .
Root says another Amish man in the buggy , 22 - year - old Emanuel Miller of Conewango Valley , was charged with providing the beer .
Both are scheduled to be arraigned June 22 .
Patrols were stepped up after an Amish elder 's property was vandalized when he confronted youths about their drinking and listening to radios .
Labels : Constitution , Henry Waxman , Washington , washington D.C. , Waxman
To be ready , the Democrats hired -- apparently , only temporarily -- a speed - reader onto the committee 's clerk staff .
As it turned out , he was n't needed : after days of seeing their amendments defeated , Republicans agreed Wednesday that they would not ask for the reading .
But Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Tex . ) , the ranking Republican , said he was curious .
So , when he introduced a new amendment this afternoon , he requested that Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman ( D - Calif . ) have it read as a demonstration .
" The speed - reader clerk will read the bill , " Waxman said , giving in .
" Now , I want him to read in a Texas accent , " added Barton .
The speed - reader , who gave his name as " Douglas Wilder " ( committee staff would not make him available for an interview ) , gamely started in a kind of speed - drawl .
The room broke up .
" Let 's have order ! " Waxman said .
With the way Washington ignores us and the Constitution it is not surprising that many people have and will find this recent Washington Post article upsetting if not infuriating .
Maybe it is just me , but does it seem that a nine - hundred page bill might just be indicative of the problems in Washington ?
What I mean is that the bureaucracy has grown so much and modern day legislation encompasses so much as a result , that Washington has gotten out of the habit of reading the bills because what they right is so extensive that they do n't have the time to read their own bills or find it rather boring to do so .
If its not being upset at the lack of Constitutional scrutiny of a nine - hundred page bill , I also completely understand those who think a government hired speed reader is a slap in the face .
Ultimately we can expect our elected officials to foist on us some atrocious bill , of which , not one jot or tittle will be Constitutional .
And Washington throws another shovel full of dirt on the American dream .

As many as 25 state parks within an hour of San Francisco , including redwood forests , beaches , coastal woodlands and historical sites , could be closed in a desperate attempt to reduce the state 's giant budget deficit .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's latest proposal to tackle the state 's $ 24.3 billion shortfall includes the elimination of all general fund contributions to California 's 279 parks within two years .
It is a nightmare scenario that would mean the public could be barred from visiting 223 parks - that 's 80 percent of the state - owned parks , according to park officials .
" That 's just horrendous , " said Elizabeth Goldstein , president of the California State Parks Foundation .
" It could impact these environmental and cultural resources for decades and decades . "
The proposal , which will no doubt be subject to intense lobbying in the Legislature between now and July 1 , when the fiscal year starts , is to cut $ 70 million of the $ 150 million the park system receives from the state 's general fund in fiscal year 2009 - 10 .
The remainder would be cut out in the 2010 - 11 budget .
Eliminating state contributions , most of which go toward paying staff , would mean maintenance workers , office technicians , park superintendents , landscapers , rangers , environmental scientists , administrative officers and bookkeepers would have to be laid off .
Camping , boating and day use fees would also have to be raised , said Roy Stearns , the parks spokesman .
Parks that would close
Stearns said parks that cannot be operated with minimal staffing or become self - sustaining through fees or other sources of revenue would have to be closed .
If Schwarzenegger 's cuts are adopted by the Legislature , they would be enacted July 1 , but park officials said that they would keep the parks open at least through Labor Day to collect user fees throughout the summer .
Stearns said camping reservations have been sold through November .
The governor also has proposed deep cuts to public education , health and human services , and prisons .
The latest proposal is far more severe than last year 's budget proposal , which would have cost California parks 129 jobs and closed as many as 48 state parks , including nine in the Bay Area , saving the state close to $ 14 million .
Based on that list , the Bay Area parks that are most threatened by closure include Henry W. Coe State Park near Morgan Hill , which , at 87,000 acres , is the largest state park in Northern California .
Forest near Guerneville
Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve , a foggy primeval forest near Guerneville in Sonoma County , is one of at least four stands of giant redwoods that the public could be blocked from visiting .
Visitors to quiet , leafy Tomales Bay State Park and windswept , 170 - acre Candlestick Point State Recreation Area could be stopped at the entrance gates .
Even the old governor 's mansion in Sacramento could be shuttered under the proposed budget .
" That is a good starting place , but it is going to be a much , much bigger list than that , " said Goldstein .
Among the iconic locations that could potentially see campgrounds or facilities closed , she said , are Mount Tamalpais , China Camp and Samuel P. Taylor State Park in Marin County , Mount Diablo , Angel Island and several coastal beaches along the Peninsula .
The parklands of the East Bay Regional Park District and Golden Gate National Recreation Area would not be affected .
Reasons behind the cuts
Drastic cuts are necessary , the governor said , because of the slipping economy , declining revenues and a deficit that deepened after voters rejected five budget measures designed to help close the gap .
Goldstein argued , however , that the savings derived from cutting the parks out of the budget would amount to 0.26 percent of the $ 24.3 billion budget gap .
" It 's a very , very tiny portion of the financial need , but the impacts would be draconian to say the least , " Goldstein said .
" Not only is this bad for people who are relying on state parks more than they ever have for recreation and vacation , but it is also bad for the communities surrounding these parks . "
Stearns said 79.6 million people visited state parks last year .
A huge number of reservations for campgrounds have already been made throughout the summer and into November , he said .
Analysts estimate park visitors spend roughly $ 2.6 billion a year in and around the parks .
Goldstein said for every dollar spent , the state parks generate $ 2.35 in tax revenue from economic activity in the local communities surrounding the parks .
That means the state could potentially see a reduction in revenue by closing the parks .
That 's not even counting the loss of day - use fees and the cost of patrolling the closed parks to make sure arsonists , vandals , transients , hunters and marijuana growers do n't move in , she said .
Yet another blow to parks
The latest proposed cuts are yet another blow to the largest state park system in the nation .
California state parks cover 1.5 million acres .
Already , they were operating on little more than a shoestring budget , having absorbed years of cost cutting and staff reductions .
As it is , the state parks have $ 1.2 billion in deferred maintenance on the books , said Stearns and others , who contend that the proposed cuts would cause that number to increase .
" We really reject the basic premise that this is an appropriate way to close the budget gap , " Goldstein said .
" The potential implications for the state park system are very dire . "
State parks in danger
The governor 's proposal to cut funding to state parks could result in closures of as many as 25 properties within an hour 's drive of San Francisco .
Among parks officials said could be closed : -- Henry W. Coe State Park , near Morgan Hill , the largest state park in Northern California -- Candlestick Point State Recreation Area -- Austin Creek State Recreation Area and Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve near Guerneville -- Tomales Bay State Park in Inverness -- Petaluma Adobe State Historic Park -- Portola Redwoods State Park , near Cupertino -- Benicia Capitol State Historic Park -- Benicia State Recreation Area --

Democrats Reach Agreement on War Funding Bill
By Perry Bacon Jr .
Congressional Democrats today reached agreement on a war - funding bill that had been stalled , as the Obama administration dropped its request for a provision that would bar the release of photos that show abuse of detainees in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The agreement was reached only after a letter from President Obama to a congressional committee saying that his administration would appeal to the Supreme Court to keep the photos from becoming public , rather than try for a Congressional ban as part of the war funding bill .
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Thursday stayed an earlier order that the photos be released immediately , so the government will now have time to appeal .
The photos , which the American Civil Liberties Union sued to release , had become a subject of contention between House Democrats and the president , who has said they would inflame anti-American opinion if they were released .
The war funding bill now appears on its way to passage next week .
Congressional Democrats earlier in the day reached an agreement to allow detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , to be held in the United States for trial .
The bill includes more than $ 90 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .

A driver told a blind cancer sufferer to get off his bus when a woman and her children became hysterical at the sight of his guide dog .
George Herridge , 71 , told how the mum flew into a rage and shouted at him in a foreign language .
A passenger explained she wanted him to get off the bus during the incident on May 20 .
Mr Herridge , from Tern Close , Tilehurst , said : “ Her child was kicking and screaming and someone off the bus told me her child was frightened of my dog .
The driver said , ‘ Look mate , ca n’t you get off ? ’
“ I stood my ground .
I had not done anything , my dog had not done anything and I was getting off the bus for no one . ”
The retired NHS worker claimed he was forced off a bus by a driver after a similar encounter last summer .
And a day after the latest bus incident an lady began screaming “ I do n’t like dirty dogs ” at Mr Herridge at the Royal Berkshire Hospital .
A week earlier he faced further animosity from a couple at Asda in The Meadway , he said .
He is unsure what has provoked outbursts but said he thinks some have come from Asian people and that it may be due to religious or cultural differences .
If the people who were upset were Muslim , they consider dogs to be ritually unclean .
Some may have them as pets but keep them in a separate living area .
Anything coming into contact with its saliva , such as clothes , must be washed seven times if they intend to pray in those clothes .
Mr Herridge said : “ I do not expect any special treatment but just to be left in peace and live my life the best I can . ”
Reading Buses accepted the driver was wrong but had been placed in an “ impossible situation ” .
Drivers have been re-instructed to convey the blind and the bus company has sought advice from the Royal National Institute for the Blind and hopes to speak with Muslim leaders .
As part of a Muslim Council of Britain project , Mufti Zubair Butt , Shar’ia advisor to Muslim Spiritual Care Provision in the NHS , admitted Muslims “ require some education ” on guide dogs .
In response to concerns raised about guide dogs in mid-2008 , he said : “ It is important that one does not impose one ’s own understanding upon others , but one shows understanding and compassion for others , their needs and their views , especially in an open communal space and in a country where Muslims are living as a minority . ”
Blue whales were hunted out of existence in the northern Pacific ( Image : Brandon Cole / Visuals Unlimited / Getty )
Blue whales have begun reappearing in Pacific waters off the coast of Canada and Alaska for the first time since whaling ceased in 1965 .
Fifteen of the world ’s largest creatures have visited the waters off British Columbia and Alaska since 1997 , and four of them were individuals also photographed in Californian waters .
Whalers formerly caught hundreds of blue whales in the northern zones , landing 1300 between 1908 and 1965 .
Yet despite the ban , they seemed not to recover there , suggesting to some researchers that the cultural knowledge of the area had been lost .

By contrast , large numbers of blue whales began collecting off California in the 1970s .
Since the 1990s , though , their numbers have begun dwindling off California – the increased sightings to the north suggest they may be migrating there instead .
Food shortage ?
“ Whales are being seen again in the Gulf of Alaska and off British Columbia but also , for the first time , we can say those are the same whales that have been seen feeding off California , ” says John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia , Washington , and head of the project to photograph the whales , in collaboration with the US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) and Canada ’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans .
“ Prior to this , we did n’t know if whales killed previously off British Columbia were part of the same population as in California , ” says Calambokidis .
The big question is , why are the whales migrating north again ?
The optimistic scenario is that blue whales have multiplied since the whaling ban , and some are now migrating north because there is not now enough krill to sustain them in California alone .
The pessimistic scenario is that numbers have scarcely increased , but factors including climate change are reducing the amount of krill available to whales off California , so they are forced to forage elsewhere .
Calambokidis says there is evidence that krill - feeding birds living off California have bred less well in recent years , backing up the theory that there is less food available .
Sea cycles
Another , more prosaic , explanation is that the whales move north or south every few decades in tandem with a natural cycle called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation .
This makes the temperature of north and south Pacific zones alternate between warm and cool every 20 to 30 years , and blue whales tend to do better in the cooler water where krill thrive .
Hunting records over the past century tally with this , says Calambokidis , showing that more whales were landed in oceanic zones going through the “ cool ” phase of the oscillation .
The favourable cycles of the oscillation also tally with the increase in whale numbers off California in the 1970s through to the 1990s .
However , the researchers do n’t have enough data yet to say which factors dominate in sealing the whales ’ fate .
“ It ’s potentially a combination of all factors , ” he says .
Slow recovery
The biggest worry is that climate change is reducing krill populations , as has happened in Arctic waters , resulting in depleted resources for the whales and other top predators , such as polar bears .
Currently , there are an estimated 2000 blue whales along the west coast of North America , the largest population in the world .
Globally there are an estimated 5000 to 12,000 .
Prior to whaling , the global population was thought to be as high as 200,000 .
Recovery will be slow , though , as the massive cetaceans breed slowly , calving once every two to three years , and taking a decade to reach adulthood .
Another possibility is that because the northern zone was so hunted - out , knowledge of the richness of the region for food was temporarily lost .
“ It is feasible that whales lost the cultural memory of the Alaska and British Columbia feeding destinations as a result of the intensive whaling there , ” says co-researcher , Jay Barlow of the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla , California .
“ That could explain why it took so long for blue whales to rediscover this rich feeding area . ”

And now that it ’s all said and done , what do we know ?
About James W. von Brunn ?
The 88 - year - old racist who still has n’t given up on hate after all these years and decided to attack the Holocaust Museum ?
Yeah , OK .
He says blacks and Jews run the court system , but that only lets us know he ’s crazy .
Because brother if black people ran the court system I seriously doubt we ’d still be having all these discussions at this late date about why so many of us are stuck behind bars .
As for us being partners with the Jews in running the court system … ?
Right .
So anyway .
And then there ’s the part about him being an artist .
And a well - known terrorist who ’s been on the radar for quite some time .
And twice - divorced .
And this and that and on and on .
But what do we know ?
We know nothing .
Because in the end , when you really examine all the hastily assembled data thrown together by hasty reporters up against a hastydeadline to provide as much data as possible and more than the other guy in a competitive attempt to create the definitive Sketch of an American Terrorist , all we really have is that this MF was crazy .
The end .
And except for like - minded crazies whose twisted , tortured gray matter happens to be processing the world on the same wave - length from another dimension , most of the rest of us ca n’t even begin to fathom how this really works .
Inside the mind of a James W. von Brunn .
Because most of us are essentially normal , or at least that ’s how we would be classified by this , our classification obsessed society ( what do you do ?
where do you belong ?
what do we call you ? ) .
And so we do n’t know how to do crazy real well because we just ai n’t wired that way .
So was this the beginning of the Race War brought on by the election of an African American president ?
Not to mention the pollution of the pristinely white gene pool and the negro- phication of the courts ?
Or was this simply one elderly , deranged lunatic howling at the moon ?

Once , sitting on a bench by the Taj Mahal while waiting for the sunset to kick in , hanba dissected the experience she was busy having .
The monument and the landscape surrounding it were spectacular indeed .
Sharing the monument with thousands of people , however , was not entirely pleasant .
Endless touts pushing expensive paraphrenalia .
Pickpockets , classes of school children , numerous khaki - wearing tourists , gold - diggers .
Hundreds of people queuing to get the shot of the Taj with the lake in the foreground .
Walking around the area and sitting on the bench , waiting for the sunset , hanba wished the “ Taj crowd ” would disappear for just ten minutes .
It was hard to concentrate , to meditate on the building , amongst all the hustle .
This made hanba wonder if the people in the future may prefer a virtual tour of the Taj instead ?
Here I do not mean just a computer - screen experience ; maybe we can create a “ 3D - helmet ” that gives us a complete spatial experience together with smells and sounds .
Or maybe , in the future , we can look at the Taj on a Star Trek style holodeck ?
Many people would automatically give the real experience more value than the virtual .
However , it can be questioned if the tout - laden business venture the monument has become can be defined as “ real ” either .
Perhaps the solemnity of this tombstone monument can be better appreciated alone , without the hustle ?
Given the chance , we would probably want to see the monument in a natural state .
This , however , is impossible .
The world has an ever growing number of citizens , many of whom want to travel to the great monuments of civilization .
A single individual cannot see the monuments in an entirely natural state .
In both the “ real ” and virtual cases , we are bound to be fed an experience provided by business entrepreneurs .
It is best to drop the illusion of a “ natural state ” and make the best of it .
Be it the tout - laden reality or the calm but virtual experience .
Hanba is big on lists .
Here ’s yet another , comparing the benefits of a “ real ” vs virtual Taj experience :
“ Real ”
The chance gets a greater role .
Perhaps you talk to a stranger and end up having an interesting conversation .
You get to experience the culture around the monument , not just the building .
You get to see the aging of the monument , which is an important part of the real experience .
You get the latest decay update .
The weather conditions will vary ; you will get a unique experience based on the weather .
You support the local enterprises .
The real experience is the “ default ” .
It is hard to say you have experienced the monument in today ’s world if you have not been there physically .
Virtual
You will not be disturbed , you will be able to focus .
It is cheaper than traveling all the way to the monument ( this is also better for the environment ) .
While with the virtual tour may not give you a the cultural experience , your architectural experience may be stronger .
You will skip the ugly feeling of being exploited by the touts .
The net generation is accustomed to seeing virtual , 3D images since childhood .
A virtual tour of the Taj can hardly be considered revolutionary for this generation .
Furthermore , this generation may not have the same predilection for “ real ” things that the previous generations have had .
In the future , virtual may be the default over the “ real ” .
When the sun finally set behind the Taj , the wind was soft .
The clouds covered most of the vivid colors , but it was still a very beautiful sunset .
Flashlights were busy , and the surrounding tourists were chattering .
Tea and bisquits were being sold .
Afterwards , all the tourists all headed out to the city at once .
In February , Congress gave the FCC a big homework assignment – create a national broadband plan that the government can use as a diagram to turn the country into a paradise of universal , cheap and productive broadband .
This week , telecoms , interest groups , internet companies and citizens ( Wired.com readers included ) filed thousands of pages of comments in an attempt to help the FCC write its report .
The deluge is understandable .
Big money is at stake .
So too might be the future of the economy .
The Obama administration is hungry for a change .
So are net - neutrality groups whose members were influential supporters of Obama .
And Google is finally exercising its muscle in D.C. , an area where telecoms are used to getting their way , thanks to tens of millions annually in contributions and lobbying efforts .
A desk - thumping , but largely conservative broadband plan would suit the current crop of telecom companies well – ensuring that they'd get some grants for laying new cable to areas they 've decided are currently not worth the effort , while keeping the comfortable cable and telephone duopoly in place – ensuring continued high profits for all – even in the midst of a crippling recession .
Others would like to see a much bigger change , where federal regulators hound the incumbents – holding them to speed and access promises – as well as allowing citizens to use whatever devices or services they like , regardless of whether they are using a wireless or a wired net connection .
They also want the government to encourage and fund cooperatives , municipal operations and non-profit networks .
Google , which ISPs resent for making huge profits over their networks , is one of these .
Congress and President Obama have already authorized $ 7 billion in grants for rural and inner-city broadband expansion , but that could amount to just a down payment on a broader project that could rival the scope of the Rural Electrification project from the New Deal , which eventually led to programs to bring phone service to all Americans .
Until now , the feds have largely left the building of the nation 's broadband infrastructure to private companies – namely the nation 's cable companies , incumbent phone companies and satellite providers .
Despite the promise of cheap , fast , city - owned fiber networks and free wireless projects in the nation 's metropolises , such projects are rare – in no little part , thanks to lawsuits and lobbying by the nation 's largest ISPs .
Despite the 1996 telecom de-regulation attempt to force big providers to rent access to their lines for a fair fee , the FCC essentially killed off small competition by freeing cable and DSL providers from those obligations .
Now , when citizens have a choice of providers , it 's usually a choice between a cable provider and a telephone company .
But while the internet 's backbone started in the United States and still carries a huge chunk of the world 's IP traffic , consumers are stuck with expensive and slow connections to that backbone , at least when compared to other developed countries like Japan , Sweden and Korea .
In other words , U.S. net users are riding Amtrak , while across the ocean , they are zipping around the net on 300 mph bullet trains that cost less than a ticket on a diesel - powered train in the States .
The United States is now 15th in the world when it comes to broadband ( .pdf ) , according to ITIF , taking into account speed , price and the percentage of citizens subscribing .
Other models exist .
Australia just announced that it would build a comprehensive fiber optic and wireless network that would reach every Australian , with service provided by companies that rent access to the public and privately owned network .
Japan works closely with its dominant telecom to set policies .
Other countries require phone and cable companies to lease their lines at fair prices to competitors – a trade - off for being able to run wires through public right - of - ways .
The question now becomes what factions will have the most influence with the Obama - appointed FCC .
The Senate is just finally getting around to processing four nominations , two Democrat and two Republicans , to the five - member committee that will be 3 - 2 in the Dems ' favor .
Julius Genachowski , an Obama - campaign tech advisor , is set to head the FCC , while the well - regarded but not - appointed Blair Levin , known as the brains behind the 1996 Telecom Act , will be in charge of the Broadband Plan .
There are a lot of voices to be heard .
For instance , the American Farm Bureau Federation wants price supports for internet service ( .pdf ) , calling broadband " beyond the financial means of many residents of their communities . "
While it might seem silly for this group to weigh in on fiber optics , rural areas are likely to receive the bulk of dollars – in no small part since nearly everyone agrees the boonies needs better access and the telecoms think they can get government money to subsidize it .
Comcast , one of the nation 's largest ISPs , explicitly called for subsidies for the poor in its filing this week , and went on to add that the government should add more digital services in order to convince Luddite citizens that they need broadband .
In fact , Comcast says the Luddite problem is four times as big a problem as meager , expensive or non-existent broadband and deserves as much attention from the feds .
Presumably , " promoting use of broadband Internet service by addressing barriers to adoption , including government policies that have failed to encourage all Americans to use broadband services , " means telling people to subscribe to broadband ( hopefully Comcast 's ) or they can't get their tax refund .
Comcast also announced this week it was rolling out a speed upgrade to its cable service in Washington , D.C.
We take it the timing was purely coincidental .
Not surprisingly , the Fiber - to - the - Home Council sees in the National Broadband Plan , an opportunity ( .pdf ) to , well , " set forth a grand plan . "
Namely , laying fiber optic cable to citizens ' homes with a combination of federal dollars and private enterprise .
AT&T , another fan of the government subsidizing its customers , sees the national broadband plan as a way to create a new smart network that is n't just a set of dumb pipes connecting users to users and web services .
That 's every telecom executive 's worst nightmare – though utility companies do seem to make fine profits from useful , but unglamorous services .
" As broadband becomes more ingrained in our everyday lives — from web surfing to video conferencing to smart grids to e-commerce and e-government to telemedicine and beyond — networks will need to dynamically provide the performance capabilities required by the increasingly diverse array of services , applications , and content traveling over them , " the company wrote .
Also , AT&T advises that " proposals ... intended to address theoretical concerns about potential behavior that may never occur , should have no place in the Plan . "
That means no net neutrality , openness or non-discrimination rules should be attached to federal money — for those of you not accustomed to telecom speak .
Google 's interests are far different from the carriers , and the search and online advertising giant suggests that the government should lay fiber optic cable as it works on any road project , connect the nation 's libraries and public schools with fiber , and encourage companies to lay more fiber than they need to rent or sell to others .
But more importantly , they want the feds to think of broadband as infrastructure , not the internet .
" Broadband constitutes the lower layer network activities provided by carriers , while ' the Internet ' is the upper layer activities supplied by users such as applications and content providers , " Google notes .
" In other words , broadband is the physical connective pathway that allows consumers to reach the Internet and utilize its capabilities . "
In other words , force the carriers to build an open set of pipes , and Google , not the ISPs , will figure out the best way to use them .
By contrast , the Free Press — a net neutrality advocacy group — in a 307 - page filing , sees the broadband plan as an opportunity for the FCC to radically " shift from viewing broadband as a commercial service to a critical infrastructure . "
That means oversight to make sure the nation 's ISPs do n't collapse like the banks did , rules to make sure there are cheap rates for the poor ( like with phones ) and regulations to make sure the pipe owners do n't mess with the content flowing through the pipe .
In short , the broadband plan is an opportunity for the FCC to reject its last decade and embrace a new activist , watchdog role , according to the Free Press 's filing .
That suspiciously sounds like making the Free Press into the FCC , or vice versa .
Verizon — one of the nation 's top ISPs — touted the usefulness of broadband and explained how much money it had invested in capital expenditures ( more than $ 80 billion in the last four years ) .
It also emphasized its view that a light regulatory regime has led to great advances in broadband in the United States , despite the country 's dismal standings in world connectivity rankings .
" Policymakers should ensure this continued positive evolution by continuing to support the stimulative , pro-growth regulatory policies that have unleashed this torrent of private innovation and investment and created millions of jobs , " Verizon wrote , all but saying a national broadband plan was unnecessary .
Time Warner Cable , still reeling from the PR nightmare of its ham - handed attempt to charge users per GB of use , says the National Broadband Plan should not create " additional barriers to investment , such as [...] additional privacy regulations .
That 's because " providers of such services do not track usage or bill customers based on individual ' calls ' ( or Internet sessions ) , and therefore do not even possess the types of information that the Commission has focused on safeguarding . "
That 's odd to hear because Time Warner Cable will need to track usage to bill by usage and two ISPs would n't tell Wired.com if they did keep logs of where users travel on the net .
Oh , and TWC thinks free laptops for the poor would be good , too .
The wireless industry 's trade group , the CTIA ( .pdf ) , sees the national broadband plan as needing to be technology - neutral — meaning that wireless counts too and is eligible for federal dollars .
But , the CTIA argues , broadband rules should not be applied to wireless .
For instance , the rules that consumers can use any device or service they like ?
That 's fine for DSL and cable , but not for wireless companies ' tender networks .
Or as the CTIA writes , the FCC " should neither extend application of its Broadband Policy Statement to wireless networks , nor should it adopt a non-discrimination principle .... "
The Onion once published an article entitled " All of Family 's Neuroses Projected Onto Dog . "
Reading the submissions from the nation 's telecoms , interest groups and ISPs to the FCC about its upcoming , first - ever national broadband plan , one sympathizes with the Tobin family dog , Woofers .
The Onion concluded its article noting that Woofers must be an amazing specimen , noting that a " lesser dog would have cracked under the strain of so many mutually contradictory projections long ago . "
One can only hope the FCC 's national broadband plan will do as well with the country 's broadband dreams .
But we 're guessing the FCC 's mutt wo n't please nearly so many as Woofers did .

What would we be doing now if we took ­climate change seriously ?
Last week the ­government ­released a ­report on the likely temperature changes in the UK .
It shows that life at the end of this century will bear no relationship to life at the beginning .
It should have dominated the news for days .
But it was too far away , too remote from current problems , too big to see .
Over the past few months Lord ­Giddens , one of the architects of New Labour , has been touting the ­hypothesis that people are reluctant to act on ­climate change until it becomes ­visible to them , by which time it will be too late .
This thought , which has been ­common currency within the environment movement for at least 20 years , has been christened by this shrinking violet the " Giddens Paradox " .
It ranks among his other major discoveries , like the Giddens Postulate ( people wear fewer clothes when temperatures rise ) and the Giddens Effect ( the Earth goes round the Sun ) .
But despite his outrageous expropriation , the point remains a valid one .
We will resist taking radical action until we have no choice , whereupon it will have no effect .
Our resistance to change is not ­peculiar to environmental issues .
Even when confronted by crisis , we try to stick to the script .
As the coaching ­theorist David Rock and the research psychiatrist Jeffrey Schwartz note , just one in nine people who have had coronary bypass surgery take their ­doctor 's advice to lose weight and ­exercise more .
Part of the problem , they show , is that confronting change means making use of parts of the brain which require more energy to engage .
When you drive along familiar roads , for instance , the brain 's basal ganglia function as a kind of autopilot , ­performing routine functions without the need for conscious thought .
When you go abroad , and have to drive on the other side of the road , you must make use of the prefrontal cortex , which burns more energy than the basal ­ganglia .
We perceive high levels of energy use much as we perceive pain .
For good biological reasons we seek to avoid them .
We engage with change only when we have to .
That 's a horribly simplified account of some very complex processes , but you get the general idea .
Change is pain , a change for the worse is double pain .
We pretend it 's not there , up to – often beyond – the point at which it starts hammering on the door .
So environmentalists seek to ­persuade us that we 'll love the green transition .
Downshifting , voluntary ­simplicity , alternative hedonism – whatever they call it , it 's presented as a change for the better .
A new green deal will save the planet , the workforce and the economy .
Energy efficiency will ­protect the bottom line as well as the biosphere .
A less frantic life will allow us to enjoy the small wonders that surround us .
There is both exaggeration and truth in all this , but effective action also involves a change for the worse : ­regulation , rationing , austerity , state spending .
" Little by little , " the Roman historian Livy wrote 2,000 years ago , " we have been brought into the present condition in which we are able neither to tolerate the evils from which we suffer , nor the remedies we need to cure them . "
Everything we need to do has been made harder by debt .
Net state debt now exceeds £ 700 bn .
The RBS and Lloyds shambles will add between £ 1 trillion and 1.5tn .
National debt is likely to reach 150 % of GDP next year : well beyond the point at which the IMF declares developing countries basket cases .
This introduces two environmental problems .
The first is that there is no money left with which to fund a green new deal .
The second is that we 'll be able to pay off these debts only by resuming economic growth .
Greenhouse gases grow because the economy grows .
The UK 's liabilities make the transition to a steady state economy , let alone a managed contraction , much harder to achieve .
They appear to ­commit us to either growth or default for at least a generation .
The debt crisis is an environmental disaster .
So we are left with only painful choices .
We should be spending tens of billions a year to prevent climate ­breakdown , but how ?
Borrow the money and exacerbate the crisis ?
Raise taxes ?
Cut the health and education budgets ?
Any of the above would enhance public resistance to change .
The least painful approach is to cut ­services that are of no use to anyone .
There are plenty of them .
The prison building programme would yield a ­couple of hundred million a year if it were replaced with non-custodial schemes .
The government could trim a billion or two from the Olympics budget without much tearing of cloth .
The ­identity card scheme would be unmourned to the tune of half a billion a year .
Nor would we be deafened by the gnashing of teeth if , as I suggested in May , the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform were scrapped , saving £ 1.8 bn a year .
But this is still the wrong order of magnitude .
Scanning the government 's departmental spending limits , one figure jumps out .
It accounts for 12 % of state spending ; a bigger budget than any department has except health and schools .
Of the £ 38bn this office spends every year , almost all is wasted .
At the end of 2003 , the Ministry of Defence observed that " there are currently no major conventional military threats to the UK or Nato … it is now clear that we no longer need to retain a capability against the re-emergence of a direct conventional strategic threat " .
So why is most of this ministry 's budget spent on retaining a capability against the emergence of a direct conventional strategic threat ?
To read the MoD 's ­spending stats is to read the accounts of a lost world : a faraway land where threats and funds are unlimited .
Its ­private finance initiative service charges ( £ 1.3 bn ) exceed the entire budget of the ­department of energy and climate change .
The ­department for international ­development could be funded twice over from the MoD 's budget for ­capital charges and depreciation ( £ 9.6bn ) .
Property management sucks up £ 1.5 bn a year , consultants and lawyers £ 470 m , bullets , bombs and the like , £ 650 m .
What does it give us ?
Our wars make us less safe .
We would be better protected from terrorism and global instability if the UK 's armed forces stopped going abroad to make trouble .
No one in office can produce a coherent account of why this money is needed : the ­ministry 's budget is sustained by the greed of contractors and nostalgia for imperium long passed .
We could cut defence spending by 90 % and ­suffer no loss to our national security .
Instead , the MoD has just dropped its spending on climate change research .
This accounted for a quarter of the Met Office 's climate programme .
The last time we faced a crisis on the scale of the global climate crash , the rational solution was to build tanks .
Now the rational , least painful solution is to stop building tanks , and use the money to address a real threat .

Finite State Automata , Binary Decision Diagrams and Presburger Arithmetic
On the power of finite state automata
Mike Sipser is a complexity theorist who has done important research into questions surrounding the P=NP question .
He is on my short list of people who might one day make a breakthrough on P=NP , partly because of the “ rumor ” that he does “ think ” about this famous problem .
Partly because he is very strong problem solver .
( An observation : if you do not think about a problem ever , it is really hard to solve it . )
At conferences people talk about P=NP and for years the answer to the question : “ but who is really thinking about P=NP ? ” was Mike .
I hope so .
Mike is also the author of one of the best books on classic complexity theory .
Well written , nice coverage , and some terrific extras that make for a great textbook .
Actually one of his exercises is today ’s subject .
I feel that I had something to do with that exercise .
I have the pleasure of knowing Mike since he was a graduate student at Berkeley .
I believe I can say that I have taught some of what Mike knows–he took my complexity class at Berkeley .
I certainly did not teach him all he knows .
But I will take credit for teaching him something .
When I say finite automata you probably do not think “ powerful ” .
Everything about them is easy .
Their languages are closed under just about any reasonable operation .
Most questions about them are decidable , and they cannot recognize even as simple a language as But they are very powerful when used properly .
In future posts I will expand on this theme and show how understanding them better could be the key to solving open questions in theory .
More on that in the future .
Today I want to show that we can use finite state automata to prove that Presburger arithmetic is decidable .
Presburger arithmetic is the first - order theory of the natural numbers with addition .
It consists of all the true sentences about the natural numbers that only involve addition .
Mojzesz Presburger , a student of the famous logician Alfred Tarski , showed in his master thesis of 1928 that there was a decision procedure for his theory .
While Presburger ’s proof was not that difficult , afterall it used a method pioneered by his advisor , the result is of great significance today .
It is believed , by many , that he should have gotten a Ph.D. for it , but Tarski apparently did not think it was enough .
Presburger Arithmetic
Presburger arithmetic is , as I said already , the first order theory of addition .
Sentences in this theory can be placed into the following form by standard methods of logic :
where the quantifiers range over the natural numbers .
The formula can be assumed to consist of boolean combinations of equations : note the formula has no quantifers .
Each equation can involve variables and only the operation of addition .
Thus ,
is a legal equation .
For example , the theory can define the order relation by
The following true sentence says that there are an infinite number of natural numbers :
It really says that for any there is a that is strictly larger than .
The problem that Presburger solved is given a sentence from his theory determine whether or not it is true .
He did this by using what is called quantifer elimination , we will present a completely different proof that uses finite state automata .
The Decision Procedure
The proof depends on the following critical insight : finite state automata can do addition .
What exactly do I mean by this ?
Let ’s try to write down a language that represents “ addition ” : a natural approach is the following ,
where are strings that encode numbers in the usual way .
Thus , stands for the number
The trouble with this language is that no finite state automata can recognize it .
The issue , of course , is that the automata cannot “ remember ” the value of exactly after it reads the symbol .
The key is to select a clever representation so that a finite automata can recognize the language .
To do this let ’s consider the following language :
where is defined to be the string
Note , if one string is longer than another then just use ‘s to pad them out to the same length .
Then ,
Lemma 1
The language is accepted by a finite state automata .
The reason this can be done is the automata now only has to remember the value of the “ carry ” from the last triple of bits .
This is bounded independent of the length of the numbers .
Using clever representations is what Binary Decision Diagrams ( BDD ’s ) –invented by Randy Bryant–are all about .
BDDs use clever representations –just like we do .
Bryant ’s work has revolutionized the world of digital logic , and I will definitely devote a post to this in the future .
However , lets get back to the proof that Presburger arithmetic is decidable .
As usual call a set recognized by some finite state automata regular .
All of our finite state automata will be deterministic .
Consider , again , the example sentence :
I will show you how to check this sentence .
The general case will follow in the same manner .
The plan is this .
Let be the following language :
We will show that it is regular .
Then , we will consider the language
We will again show that this language is regular .
Finally , consider the language
this will also be shown to be regular .
Finally , we will check that this set is empty .
The key point is that if is empty , then the sentence must be true .
Note , the last step is easy , since deciding if a finite state automata accepts any string is doable in polynomial time ( in the number of states ) .
It remains only to show why are all regular .
Why is regular ?
The answer is that we make critical use of the power of nondeterminism .
We know that the following language is regular :
Let the deterministic automata that accepts this language be .
We will construct a new nondeterministic finite state automata for by simulating .
Note , gets as input , but gets as input .
So how does simulate , since it does not have ?
The answer is that just guesses values for the missing ‘s .
It accepts provided the guesses are correct ; otherwise , it rejects .
The machine shows that is regular .
Of course that means that the language has a deterministic finite state automata .
The same trick handles the other set .
The set is just the complement of and is even easier : recall that regular sets are closed under complements .
Note , this uses that the finite state automata for is deterministic .
This a is critical point :
The machine that we get for the set is nondeterministic , so we must convert it to a deterministic finite state automata to satisfy our “ induction ” .
This follows by the famous power set construction .
However , the price that we pay is that for each quantifier we increase the number of states by an exponential .
Open Questions
The decision procedure we outlined here has both good and bad features .
On the positive side , I think its simple and shows the power of finite automata in a way that you may not have known .
Also it can prove more .
For example , suppose we add to the theory of addition the predicate “ is a power of ” .
Then , the new theory is still decidable .
The point is that checking whether or not a binary number is a power of two can easily be done by a finite automata .
Indeed we can add any predicate that can be checked by a finite automata in our representation .
A more complex example is “ disjointness ” : two numbers and are disjoint if for each , either or is .
On the negative side the procedure we have outlined is not very efficient .
Not even close .
It uses the power set construct over and over .
Thus , the running time is a stack of two ’s : to the to a number of times that is dependent on the number of quantifiers .
This is a much worse running time than the best known upper bound .
I mention in passing that Mike Fischer and Michael Rabin ( 1974 ) proved that is a lower bound on the running time .
I will get back to this beautiful and important result in the future .
There are two types of interesting open questions .
The first concerns extensions to Presburger arithmetic .
What happens if we add to Presburger predicates like “ is a prime ” .
Does this still have a decidable theory ?
The conventional wisdom is no , since the theory can easily encode the twin - prime conjecture : are the an infinite number of so that and are both prime .
I believe that it remains open whether adding this predicate makes Presburger undecidable .
See this for a fuller discussion .
There are other extensions that would also be interesting .
It is known that if one adds too powerful a new predicate , then Presburger becomes undecidable .
The second class of questions concern sub - theories of Presburger arithmetic .
In modern compiler theory there are often questions about linear expressions that one needs to check .
Often they can be expressed in Presburger arithmetic , but they use only a small part of the theory .
Thus , an open question is to find fragments of Presburger arithmetic that have efficient decision procedures .
This is an active area , but I not say anymore about it today .

Labour MP
Shahid Malik has stepped down as justice minister pending an inquiry into claims about his expenses made in the Daily Telegraph .
Standards chief Sir Philip Mawer will investigate claims he failed to declare a subsidised rent .
Mr Malik insists he did not breach the ministerial code and he was " pleased " to have the chance to clear his name .
The MP - who is the biggest casualty yet of the expenses scandal - called for the media " bloodfest " to stop .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has asked Sir Philip , his official adviser on ministerial interests , to investigate the claims as quickly as possible and his report could come within days .
Mr Brown 's spokesman stressed the expectation would be that Mr Malik would return to office if he was cleared and said no replacement was being appointed in the meantime .
Conservative leader David Cameron said MPs from all parties had made unjustifiable expenses claims and politicians must display leadership if Parliament was to regain the trust of the people .
' Financial benefit '
There is no suggestion Mr Malik broke Parliamentary rules on expenses , but his conduct as a minister is under scrutiny .
The Daily Telegraph alleges he claimed the maximum amount allowable - £ 66,827 over three years - on his second home in London - but obtained a discounted rent of £ 100 a week on his main family home in his Dewsbury constituency , which he paid out of his own pocket .
Mr Malik has described the claim about his rent as a " fabrication " .
But Mr Brown 's spokesman said it had to be investigated because , if true , it would represent a " potential financial benefit " that had not been part of Mr Malik 's ministerial declaration and " this could represent a breach of the ministerial code " .
It comes amid a rising tide of public anger at MPs from all parties , with former police chief Ray Mallon , now independent mayor of Middlesbrough , making a formal complaint to the Metropolitan Police and the Daily Mail launching a campaign to mount private prosecutions for fraud .
The scandal claimed its first victims on Thursday , with Labour former minister Elliot Morley being suspended pending an investigation into his expenses and Tory Parliamentary aide Andrew McKay quitting his post .
Writing on his Twitter page , Mr Morley said : " Dreadful day .
Ca n't wait to put my side of the story .
Now gone away for a few days . "
Transport Secretary Geoff Hoon said Gordon Brown had acted " decisively " in dealing with Labour MPs who had question marks surrounding their behaviour .
' Decimating democracy '
But opinion polling - and the barracking of MPs in the street and on BBC One 's Question Time - suggest politicians face an uphill struggle to restore trust .
Conservative MP
David Davies said he believed many MPs are considering quitting even if they have done nothing wrong as they feared they would be seen as " a thief on the make " .

" This whole thing has completely undermined the reputation generally of every single MP , " the Monmouth MP told BBC Radio Wales .
" A lot of people are saying ' What 's it all about , should we get out , have I had enough ? '
" And I think a lot of them will find the public will be helpful in pushing them in that direction anyway . "
Less than an hour before he announced he was stepping down , Mr Malik went on the offensive to claim endless media stories about expenses were in danger of " decimating " democracy .
' Angry and horrified '
Speaking from his Dewsbury constituency , he insisted he was " as straight as they come " , and said he had asked the fees office for guidance before submitting claims and had stuck to the rules .
He said : " I have absolutely nothing to apologise for .
I have done nothing wrong .
" I have not been at the periphery of the rules .
I have n't abused the rules , I have been absolutely at the core of the rules . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
Traditionally , I do n't think many people had much trust in politicians .
Since the scandal of the expenses abuse , that trust has all but vanished .
Phil Edwards , Connah's Quay
He said nearly every other MP in the country - including Tory leader David Cameron - had spent the same amount as him and the Tory - supporting Telegraph 's reporting was politically motivated .
He pledged to donate £ 1,050 he claimed for a television to worthy local causes in his constituency .
But he added : " I am not doing it because I have done anything wrong ... if I had done anything wrong I would be paying it back to the Parliamentary authorities . "
He said the public " had a right to be angry and horrified " about what had emerged on expenses but he also rounded on the media , saying : " I think it 's really important that we try to draw a line behind this ... the thirst for blood from some elements of the media just seems like it 's unstoppable . "
' Honest mistake '
The Telegraph also singles out former cabinet minister Clare Short , who it says was paid £ 8,000 too much after she claimed on her second home for her full mortgage payments rather than just the interest .
The Birmingham Ladywood MP , who quit Labour over the Iraq war and now sits as an independent , said it was " an honest mistake " , she repaid the sum in 2006 and said the paper was trying to " smear " all MPs .
Parliament is held in scorn
David Cameron
Addressing the latest revelations , Conservative leader David Cameron said all parties needed to act swiftly to stop Parliament from sliding further into " ridicule and contempt " .
" Our politics is reviled .
Parliament is held in scorn .
Our people have had enough , " he told party activists in Perth .
From now on , all Tory MPs will have to publish their expense claims online the moment they make them and those found to have made excessive claims will have to repay the money or face expulsion , Mr Cameron said .
" The decisions that we make and the actions that we take over the coming weeks and months will make all the difference in terms of whether we 're going to have politics of despair and a parliament of disrepute or whether we can build a politics of hope , " he added .
There 's quite a lot of military accommodation in central London , most of it unused because the occupants are elsewhere at the moment

Your expense reform ideas
Mr Malik 's troubles came as Labour slumped to its lowest ever opinion poll rating .
A YouGov poll of 1,814 people for The Sun newspaper suggests Labour support at a general election would be 22 % , with the Conservatives on 41 % and the Liberal Democrats on 19 % .
If repeated at a general election , the Conservatives would win with a Commons majority of 152 .
Asked about voting intentions at next month 's European elections the big gainers appear to be the UK Independence Party , with support at 15 % - with the Lib Dems on 19 % , Labour on 20 % and the Conservatives on 29 % .
The Greens are on 6 % and the BNP on 3 % .
A ROUND -UP OF LOCAL PAPERS ' REPORTS ON MPs ' EXPENSES
MPs are going back to their constituencies for the first time since the expenses row broke out .
We look at what they are facing from their local papers .
The local newspaper in Phil Hope 's Corby and East Northants constituency , the Evening Telegraph , has been running a campaign to get him to repay his expenses .
He agreed to pay back £ 41,709 .
Now it asks if voters can ever trust politicians again :
Political columnist for the Liverpool Daily Post , Rob Merrick , thinks this will have an effect on Labour in the next election but stands up for his local MPs :
William Green in the Journal says the Newcastle area's only Tory MP , Peter Atkinson , has revealed his expenses claims exclusively to the paper - mainly getting his chimney cleaned - and hopes it should put pressure on the other MPs there :
The Leicester Mercury was n't so lucky .
It asked all its MPs what they think should happen about expenses but got no response from Keith Vaz :
The Leicester Mercury also show a video of a campaigner digging a pound sign into Alan Duncan 's garden :
At the news Hazel Blears would pay back £ 13,000 , the The Salford Advertiser in Hazel Blears ' constituency declared :
The Irish Times looks at how MPs ' expenses affect Northern Irish politics :
Lindy McDowell in the Belfast Telegraph says there does n't seem to be a party untouched by what she calls a feeding frenzy :
Research scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB in Stuttgart working in conjunction with their colleagues from the company Logos Innovationen have found a way of converting this air humidity autonomously and decentrally into drinkable water .
Even in deserts the air contains water and the research scientists have found a way of obtaining drinking water from air humidity using a system is based completely on renewable energy , making it autonomous .
Even in places with no lakes , rivers or groundwater , considerable quantities of water are stored in the air .
In the Negev desert in Israel , for example , annual average relative air humidity is 64 percent – in every cubic meter of air there are 11.5 milliliters of water .
Plants producing large quantities of drinking water from moisture in the air could look like this .

“ The process we have developed is based exclusively on renewable energy sources such as thermal solar collectors and photovoltaic cells , which makes this method completely energy - autonomous .
It will therefore function in regions where there is no electrical infrastructure , ” says Siegfried Egner , head of department at the IGB .
The principle of the process is as follows : hygroscopic brine – saline solution which absorbs moisture – runs down a tower - shaped unit and absorbs water from the air .
It is then sucked into a tank a few meters off the ground in which a vacuum prevails .
Energy from solar collectors heats up the brine , which is diluted by the water it has absorbed .
Because of the vacuum , the boiling point of the liquid is lower than it would be under normal atmospheric pressure .
This effect is known from the mountains : as the atmospheric pressure there is lower than in the valley , water boils at temperatures distinctly below 100 degrees Celsius .
The evaporated , non-saline water is condensed and runs down through a completely filled tube in a controlled manner .
The gravity of this water column continuously produces the vacuum and so a vacuum pump is not needed .
The reconcentrated brine runs down the tower surface again to absorb moisture from the air .
“ The concept is suitable for various sizes of installation .
Single - person units and plants supplying water to entire hotels are conceivable , ” says Egner .
Prototypes have been built for both system components – air moisture absorption and vacuum evaporation – and the research scientists have already tested their interplay on a laboratory scale .
In a further step the researchers intend to develop a demonstration facility .

LAWS against drink - driving have been getting tougher recently in many countries and more places are making use of them .
Over 170 countries now impose drink - driving limits , according to a new report by the World Health Organisation , although the amount of alcohol allowed varies considerably .
Only 88 countries have a legal limit of 0.05 grams of alcohol ( or less ) per 100 ml of blood , the maximum recommended by the WHO .
Some of these countries , such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan , forbid any alcohol in the blood .
Britain and Ireland are more lenient than other countries in Europe , with a legal limit of 0.08 g/dl .
Burundi , Palau and Lesotho have the highest limits in the world , at 0.1g / dl .

Clarification : Pakistan , Mauritania and the Comoros forbid alcohol , but are labelled by the WHO as " No limit stipulated " because there is no specific legislation governing blood alcohol concentration .
Description :
Bites and stings from animals , venomous and non-venomous , cause an unknown number of injuries per year , but statistics from a few key groups of venomous animals indicate that there are millions of cases annually , with at least 125,000 deaths .
While in most cases of venomous animal injury , the primary problem is direct venom toxicity effects , there may also be significant local tissue injury and non-venomous animals will principally cause direct trauma .
Because of the global magnitude of human injury , morbidity and mortality from venomous animal bites and stings , this area will be dealt with in some detail , even though it encompasses more than just primary physical trauma .
Venomous animals Venomous animals are found in most groups or classes of the Animal Kingdom and in most habitats , both terrestrial and marine , reflecting the selective advantage venom may bestow , in both acquiring prey and deterring predators .
In this section of the chapter , the types of animals , the types of venoms , clinical effects and general comments on management will be covered .
This is followed by a more detailed look at individual types of animals and their effects on humans .
Overview of venomous animals
Of the approximately 26 Phyla of animals , at least 6 contain species that use venom or internal poison , as either pure defense , or both for offence and defense ( Figure 1 ) .
A few groups , however , account for the vast majority of cases of human envenoming or poisoning by animals : • Venomous snakes – > 125,000 deaths / year .
• Scorpions – approximately 5,000 deaths / year .
• Stinging insects – hundreds of deaths / year due to anaphylactic reactions to venom .
•
Puffer fish – several hundred deaths / year .
• Jellyfish – possibly scores of deaths / year .
• Spiders – perhaps 10 - 50 deaths / year .
• Stinging fish – perhaps 1 - 10 deaths / year .
• Venomous molluscs – perhaps 1 - 10 deaths / year .
Taxonomy considerations Fundamental to the understanding of trauma from venomous animals is a knowledge of the taxonomy of these animals , for without a reliable way of identifying an animal , it will not be possible to accurately record cause and effect , essential in elucidating epidemiology , etiology , pathophysiology , and clinical management .
It is beyond the scope of this chapter to detail the taxonomy of all venomous animals .
A simplified scheme is outlined in Figure 1 .
Overview of venoms Venoms are nearly always complex mixtures of varied biologically active substances ( toxins ) which may work independently or synergystically and each of which may have one or more quite distinct target sites and actions .
In many venoms a single component or group of closely related components may be responsible for most or all major effects in envenomed humans , but in other venoms , particularly snake venoms , a multitude of diverse components may each cause distinct major effects , resulting in a complex , multisystem disease process .
Venoms have evolved principally because they benefit the venomous animal , giving it some competitive advantage over related non-venomous species .
In many species the venom has evolved from digestive juices , especially enzymes , the venom gland being a highly evolved digestive gland .
It is not surprising therefore that many venomous animals use their venom principally to aid digestion , explaining many of the rather unpleasant effects on envenomed humans .
At some point in evolution some venomous animals have evolved venom with rather different effects , designed to assist acquiring prey or as a defense against predators .
It is this latter group of venom toxins that often cause the major systemic effects of envenoming in humans .
Often these toxins may have evolved from digestive enzymes , but their principal action is not related to enzymic activity .
Indeed , there may be no significant residual enzymic activity , despite considerable sequence homology with the original enzyme .
Classic examples of this are t
After eight years , U.S. - led forces must show progress in Afghanistan by next summer to avoid the public perception that the conflict has become unwinnable , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said in a sharp critique of the war effort .
Gates said that victory was a “ long - term prospect ” under any scenario and that the U.S. would not win the war in a year ’s time .
However , U.S. forces must begin to turn the situation around in a year , he said , or face the likely loss of public support .
“ After the Iraq experience , nobody is prepared to have a long slog where it is not apparent we are making headway , ” Gates said in an interview .
“ The troops are tired ; the American people are pretty tired . ”
Deep public unhappiness with the war in Iraq helped sink President George W. Bush ’s approval ratings , making him the most unpopular president in recent history , according to some surveys .

While not predicting a parallel fate for the Obama administration , Gates emphasized the need for progress in Afghanistan during an interview aboard his plane as he returned to Washington after visiting sailors Friday at the Great Lakes Naval Station in Illinois .
Gates has spoken about the need for progress in Afghanistan and the public ’s fatigue of war .
But in this interview , he went further by offering a more specific time frame for needed progress as well as the consequences of failing to meet it .
Gates has overseen an overhaul in the administration ’s Afghanistan strategy in recent months , sending 21,000 additional troops and choosing a new commander to lead the international effort .
“ This is where we are really getting back into the fight , ” Gates said .

The strategy switch came after extremist attacks rose dramatically last year and U.S. and NATO troop casualties surpassed record levels .
A U.S. fighter jet crashed on Saturday , killing the two crew members and bringing the number of Western deaths in Afghanistan to at least 50 in July , the deadliest month yet .
President Obama said last week that he hoped to “ transition to a different phase ” after the Afghan presidential election Aug. 20 .
During the 2007 buildup of U.S. troops in Iraq , military leaders often mentioned the importance of adding time to “ the Washington clock ” to give their strategy a chance to work .
Gates said that Americans would have the patience to continue the war in Afghanistan only if the new military approach began to move the conflict out of deadlock .

“ If we can show progress , and we are headed in the right direction , and we are not in a stalemate where we are taking significant casualties , then you can put more time on the Washington clock , ” he said .
Gates , whom Bush named Defense secretary in 2006 , said he acted as soon as he could to overhaul the Afghanistan effort but was limited by the troop buildup in Iraq .
“ Within the framework of the surge . . . what I did in Afghanistan was about all I could do with the forces we had available . ”
With the new troop strategy in place , Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , and Gen. David H. Petraeus , head of U.S. forces in the Mideast , are due to provide their assessment of the U.S. - led effort in Afghanistan early next month .

Gates said the commanders were free to provide an honest assessment , but also cautioned that additional troops might not be approved .
“ I did not want either of them to feel constrained in making their recommendations , ” Gates said .
“ That is not to say we will accept all of their recommendations . ”
The war in Afghanistan officially is a NATO mission .
Gates said the alliance is facing the challenge of rising casualties just as the overall coalition war effort is beginning to function better .
Fifteen British troops were killed in action in Afghanistan this month , and Canada has lost five service members .
“ There has been an extraordinary amount of political courage as some of our partners have taken some really devastating causalities , ” Gates said .
“ The British have had a rough couple of weeks . ”

Gates is also locked in a budget fight with Congress over his drive to halt further production of the F - 22 fighter jet , cancel a new presidential helicopter and push more money into programs closely related to ongoing U.S. combat missions , like unmanned aerial drones .
As House and Senate committees have supported more money for the F - 22 , the helicopter and other programs , Gates has objected and the White House has threatened a veto if those funds are not cut .
In an address last week in Chicago , Gates delivered his toughest comments yet on the budget , attacking the funding for F - 22s as a “ business as usual ” approach that will siphon money from more important programs .
But in the interview , Gates adopted a more cordial tone , noting that Congress had agreed to most of the dozens of spending shifts he recommended .
“ We are only focused on three or four now .
They happen to be pretty important ones , but there has been a fair amount of buy - in , ” Gates said .
Advertisement
Gates has generally good relations with Congress and described budget negotiations as respectful .
“ They know where I am coming from and I know what their concerns are , ” Gates said .
“ There is no questioning of anyone ’s motives here .
It is figuring out the right direction . ”

This week is “ In The Event Of An Emergency ” week .
We ’re looking at things you can do to plan ahead for life ’s emergencies , both big and small .
The first post in the series looked at why you should have a safe deposit box or fire safe , and what you should be putting in it .
The second post looked at why you should put all of your important personal and financial information in one spot , and how to do back it up and keep it safe .
Today I want to look at a topic that is usually thought of as being boring , but is nonetheless an extremely important one .
Insurance .
Why Do I Need Insurance ?
Paying for insurance is one of those things that none of us likes doing , especially when things are going well and we do n’t feel like we need it .
Have just one health issue or car accident , however , and you ’ll be glad that you ’re paying for the insurance .
Paying for insurance is important because it transfers the monetary risk of a catastrophic event from you the insured , to the insurance company .
The insurance company banks on the fact that most people are n’t going to have a major event in any given period , and in fact , most people do n’t .
Because of that insurance companies make a lot of money .
On the other hand , if you do have a major event , you ’ll be extremely glad you ’ve been paying those premiums .
The insurance is your umbrella for your rainy day .
At our house we were blessed to have good health insurance last year when my wife found that she had a extremely dangerous blood clot in her left leg .
Her entire leg clotted up , and she ended up in the hospital for almost a month .
After all of her surgeries and treatments our total medical bill was in excess of $ 250,000 .
Because we had insurance we ended up only paying for about $ 2500 of that !
Without it we would most certainly have had to declare bankruptcy .
( read our story here )
I had a co-worker who ’s wife got into a car accident .
She also had almost $ 250,000 in medical debt , except that they had no insurance at the time she was in the wreck .
Because they had n’t been insured , they ended up having to declare bankruptcy .
What Types Of Insurance Should I Have ?
What types of insurance you carry is really up to you , your personal financial situation , and whether you ’re secure enough to self - insure .
If you ’re not to that point yet , here are some of the most important types of insurance to have :
health insurance
life insurance
homeowner ’s insurance
auto insurance
disability insurance
long term care insurance
Let ’s look a little more in - depth at each kind of insurance below .
Health Insurance
Health insurance is something that everyone needs to buy , in my opinion .
The risks of having an expensive major health issue are just too great to ignore .
If you do n’t believe me , just look at the stats .
Medical bills are the number one cause of bankruptcy !
I ’ve seen that stat bear out in my own personal experience , where we avoided bankruptcy by having good health insurance , and my co-worker filed bankruptcy because he was n’t covered and could n’t pay his bills .
( When paying your hospital bills , do n’t forget to ask for a discount ! )
Health insurance can be extremely expensive , but not having coverage can be even more expensive , so take that into account .
If your employer has good group health insurance coverage provided , and even pays part of the costs , take advantage of that plan .
You ’ll almost always get a good group discount , and end up paying less than if you found coverage on your own .
If you ’re looking to save costs and you ’re relatively healthy , another option that people can look intois Health Savings Accounts ( HSAs ) .
HSAs offer a lower premium and higher deductible , and allow you to save and spend money on health care related expenses tax free .
A good HSA acccount option to check out is Lively .
If you do n’t have insurance , and you ’d like to get some quotes to see what your options are , I recommend checking out eHealth Insurance .
The site will give you multiple quotes on coverage with your choice of hundreds of different plans .
Life Insurance
Having life insurance is n’t something that you do for yourself .
It ’s something you set up to ensure that the loved ones you leave behind are provided for when you ’re gone .
Only two things in life are guaranteed , death and taxes .
We know when our taxes are due , but we never know when our time on this earth is done .
Having life insurance allows you to plan for the sad scenario that you may not be around to help provide for your family during your prime earning years .
How much insurance should you have ?
A good rule of thumb is to have 8 - 10 times your annual salary in good 20 year term life insurance .
So if you ’re making 50,000 a year , get a policy for $ 500,000 .
Remember when buying policy that term life insurance is almost always a better idea than whole life or cash value insurance policies .
Life insurance policies do n’t make good investment vehicles .
Invest outside of your life insurance , and buy term life .
It costs a whole lot less , and you can save or invest the difference .
Homeowner ’s Insurance
You never know when a disaster will strike and you ’ll need good coverage .
The fire we had in our neighborhood last week goes to show that disasters can pop up out of nowhere , a single careless act can cause an entire area to burn to the ground .
Many in California can attest to the dangers of wildfires .
Other areas have different risks like earthquakes or hurricanes .
Make sure you ’re insured against the risks in your area , and that you ’re not underinsured .
Buy good homeowner ’s insurance with guaranteed replacement cost , a policy in which if something happened to your home everything would be replaced no matter what it cost .
Many companies did away with those types of policies a few years ago , so do n’t automatically assume that you already have it .
Many policies will only cover the cost of the home / possessions when you bought it , plus a maximum of 25 % .
If your home grows in value more than that , you ’re out of luck !
Make sure you ’re covered !
Also get the liability coverage added to your policy , even up to $ 500,000 .
It ’s usually cheap for the coverage you ’re getting .
When people sue you for something that happened in your home , you can be sure it wo n’t be for just $ 100,000 .
Check out Policy Genius for quotes on your homeowner ’s insurance .
They make the process of getting multiple quotes simple , and they can even continue checking for the best rates on a regular basis !
Auto Insurance
You ’re usually required to have auto insurance , so this one should pretty much be a no brainer .
Just make sure that you ’re shopping around for the best rates , and that you ’re covered for the things you think you ’re covered for .
Raise your deductibles to save some money , and if the car is older consider dropping collision coverage and just keeping liability .
If you ’ve had insurance for a while , try shopping around to lower your auto insurance costs .
Once you get enough assets , you may want to get an umbrella insurance policy to cover you above and beyond the coverage amounts on your auto insurance .
You can have an accident and easily have $ 500,000 in medical bills for the other party , which your insurance may not cover all of .
Once again , insurance can prevent that financial catastrophe .
Disability Insurance
Would you be able to continue providing for your family if you were to have an accident or be otherwise disabled ?
Disability Insurance is designed to replace income that is lost due to a short - term or permanent disability .
Having this type of insurance is usually a good idea .
If your workplace offers disability as a part of your employment , even at a reduced rate – you may want to consider it .
When buying your disability insurance , buy it for 65 % of your current income , and buy the policy with after tax dollars so your disability income is n’t taxed on the other end .
A good place to check out online for long term disability is Breeze .
They have quick and easy online quotes for disability insurance and the rates are affordable .
Definitely worth checking out !
Long Term Care Insurance
Long Term Care Insurance can be a good idea if you are 60 or older .
Any younger and you probably do n’t even need to consider it just yet .
After 60 , it ’s important because almost 7 out of 10 people over the age of 65 will require long term care at some point in their lives .
Are You Covered ?
Those are a few of the most important types of insurance that you should probably consider purchasing .
Having all of that coverage does carry a price tag , and it wo n’t be cheap .
But remember , buying insurance is like buying that umbrella for a rainy day .
You may not know when it will come , but for most people it DOES come .
Plan ahead , and have that umbrella ready .
Do you think having all of these types of insurance is a good idea ?
Are there other types of insurance you think people should have ?
What are your thoughts on the topic ?
Let us know in the comments !
This is the third part of a series “ All about types ” in Javascript .
Explicit type conversion
When I wrote about automatic type conversion I told my story of testing if “ 0 ” really converts to true , which I did by comparison to true .
That was wrong , as I found out , but what is the right way ?
One possibility is
if ( " 0 " ) { alert ( " true " ) ; } else { alert ( " false " ) ; }
which is ugly .
Furthermore , this technique can only be used to convert values to boolean .
How do I explicitly convert , for example , a boolean to a number ?
There are two ways to do so .
One is a more formal apporach , the other is somewhat hackish , though it is used commonly .
To every primitive type ( string , number and boolean ) there is a corresponding object constructor ( String , Number and Boolean ) .
If you call any of these as a function instead of a constructor , they perform type conversion .
Thus , to do explicit type conversion , you do this :
Number ( " 42 " ) ; // returns 42 String ( 42 ) ; // returns " 42 " Boolean ( 42 ) ; // returns true
The hackish way to do the same is this :
" 42 " - 0 ; // convert to number 42 + " " ; // convert to string !!
42 ; // convert to boolean
As stated in the first part , the minus operator – converts all operands to numbers , therefore by subtracting 0 , the string “ 42 ” is converted to the number 42 .
Alternatively you could multiply “ 42 ” by 1 .
If one operand is a string , the plus operator converts the other to a string as well .
So by concatenating one value to the empty string , that value is converted to a string .
The logical not operator !
converts its operand to a boolean .
Unfortunately to the opposite value .
If “ foo ” converts to true , !” foo ” converts to false .
Well , to convert it to the matching value simply add another not operator .
!!” foo ” then converts to true .
Hooray !
What ’s the use of this hackish type conversion ?
We have a nice way to do type conversion by explicitly using Number , String and Boolean , this is highly comprehensible , why on earth would you prefer something like !!” 42 ″ to Boolean ( “ 42 ″ ) ?
Speed , that is .
I did some performance tests to proof that , and yes , !!” 42 ” is faster than Boolean ( 42 ) .
About 17 times faster in Chrome 2 , about 5 times faster in IE 6 , about 8 times faster in Firefox 3 and so on .
Conversion to number is 1.25 ( Chrome ) to 3.5 times faster ( Firefox ) , to String is about 2.5 times faster in Firefox , but slightly slower in Opera .
But !
Let me repeat the mantra of code optimization : “ No premature optimization ” .
Again : “ No premature optimization ” !
The speed advantage for a single conversion is between 0.000116 milliseconds ( Chrome , to boolean ) and 0.000962 milliseconds ( IE 6 , to string ) .
Both is less than one microsecond .
That ’s imperceptible .
So what about parseInt ?
So , if you should use Number to convert a value to a number , what ’s the use of parseInt and parseFloat ?
Do n’t they do the same ?
No , they do n’t , not exactly .
Number accepts parameters , that are string representations of decimal , octal or hexadecimal numbers .
Number ( " 12 " ) ; // decimal , 12 Number ( " 0x12 " ) ; // hexadecimal , 18 Number ( " 012 " ) ; // octal , 10
While this is true for parseInt as well , parseInt goes further .
parseInt accepts parameters that start with a string representation of a number .
parseInt ( " 314abc " ) ; // 314 Number ( " 314abc " ) ; // NaN
Beyond that , there is a slight difference in handling octal numbers .
If the given string starts with “ 0 ” ( but not with “ 0 x ” ) , it is interpreted as an octal number , no matter what follows .
Thus
parseInt ( " 09 " ) ; // 0
Since “ 09 ” starts with a 0 , an octal number is assumed .
The next character , “ 9 ” is not a valid octal numeric character .
Remember , parseInt accepts values that start with a string representation .
Since “ 09 ” is not a valid octal number , the longest substring “ 0 ” is taken .
Number behaves differently .
Since “ 09 ” is not a valid octal number , a decimal number is assumed , and thus the leading “ 0 ” is ignored .
Number ( " 09 " ) ; // 9
This problem often occurs when parsing user data .
Imagine the user enters a date as a string in the format “ 2009 -06-09 ” .
var userString = " 2009-06-09 " ; var dateParts = userString.split( " - " ) ; // [ " 2009 " , " 06 " , " 09 " ] var year = parseInt ( dateParts [ 0 ] ) ; // 2009 var month = parseInt ( dateParts [ 1 ] ) ; // 6 var day = parseInt ( dateParts [ 2 ] ) ; // 0 , bang !
There are two ways to prevent errors like that .
The first is to use Number instead :
var userString = " 2009-06-09 " ; var dateParts = userString.split( " - " ) ; // [ " 2009 " , " 06 " , " 09 " ] var year = Number( dateParts [ 0 ] ) ; // 2009 var month = Number( dateParts [ 1 ] ) ; // 6 var day = Number( dateParts [ 2 ] ) ; // 9 , hurray !
The second is to explicitly denote a base :
var userString = " 2009-06-09 " ; var dateParts = userString.split( " - " ) ; // [ " 2009 " , " 06 " , " 09 " ] var year = parseInt ( dateParts [ 0 ] , 10 ) ; // 2009 var month = parseInt ( dateParts [ 1 ] , 10 ) ; // 6 var day = parseInt ( dateParts [ 2 ] , 10 ) ; // 9 , hurray !
Personally , I prefer the second way .
By the way , parseInt is the fastest way in Chrome and Firefox 3 to convert a string to number , while it ’s the slowest in all other browsers I tested .
Summary
To explicitly convert one value to a differnt type , use Boolean , String and Number .
You might use parseInt instead for converting user input , to only accept decimal numbers .

Recently I discussed run-length encoding and DEFLATE compression .
I never actually showed a Python implementation of a run-length encoder , so here ’s one now .
import itertools as its def ilen ( it ) : ''' Return the length of an iterable . >>> ilen ( range ( 7 ) ) 7 ''' return sum ( 1 for _ in it ) def runlength_enc ( xs ) : ''' Return a run-length encoded version of the stream , xs .
The resulting stream consists of ( count , x ) pairs . >>> ys = runlength_enc( ' AAABBCCC ' ) >>> next ( ys ) ( 3 , ' A ' ) >>> list ( ys ) [ ( 2 , ' B ' ) , ( 3 , ' C ' ) ] ''' return ( ( ilen ( gp ) , x ) for x , gp in its.groupby ( xs ) )
The decoder is equally simple .
Itertools .
repeat expands a ( count , value ) pair into an iterable which will generate count elements .
Itertools .chain flattens these iterables into a single stream .
def runlength_dec ( xs ) : ''' Expand a run-length encoded stream .
Each element of xs is a pair , ( count , x ) . >>> ys = runlength_dec ( ( ( 3 , ' A ' ) , ( 2 , ' B ' ) ) ) >>> next (ys ) ' A ' >>> ''.join(ys ) ' AABB ' ''' return its.chain.from_iterable(its.repeat(x , n ) for n , x in xs )
If you have n’t seen itertools.chain.from_iterable ( ) yet , it was introduced at Python 3.0 / 2.6 .
The important feature here is that it lazily works its way through a single iterable argument .
If instead we ’d written :
def runlength_dec ( xs ) : .... return its.chain ( *( its.repeat( x , n ) for n , x in xs ) )
then our run-length decoder would need to consume all of xs before yielding results ( which is why we must interrupt the interpreter ’s execution below ) .
>>> xs = its.cycle ( ( 3 , ' A ' ) , ( 2 , ' B ' ) ) >>> runlength_dec( xs ) C-c C-cTraceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module >
File " < string > " , line 25 , in runlength_dec File " < string > " , line 25 , in < genexpr > KeyboardInterrupt
Named tuples for clarity
Streams of pairs ( as shown above ) are perfectly Pythonic .
If we run-length encode a stream of numbers , clients will just have to read the manual and remember that item [ 0 ] is a repeat count and item [ 1 ] is a value .
If this seems fragile , a new - ish member of the collections module can give the pair more structure .
>>> from collections import namedtuple >>>
Run = namedtuple ( ' Run ' , ' count value ' ) >>> run1 = Run(count=10 , value=2 ) >>> run2 = Run(value=2 , count=10 ) >>> run1 Run(count=10 , value=2 ) >>> run2 Run(count=10 , value=2 ) >>> run1.count 10 >>> run1 [ 0 ] 10
Here ’s how we ’d change runlength_enc ( ) to use the new type .

California 's next source of renewable power could be an orbiting set of solar panels , high above the equator , that would beam electricity back to Earth via a receiving station in Fresno County .
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has agreed to buy power from a startup company that wants to tap the strong , unfiltered sunlight found in space to solve the growing demand for clean energy .
Sometime before 2016 , Solaren Corp. plans to launch the world 's first orbiting solar farm .
Unfurled in space , the panels would bask in near - constant sunshine and provide a steady flow of electricity day and night .
Receivers on the ground would take the energy - transmitted through a beam of electromagnetic waves - and feed it into California 's power grid .
The idea has been discussed for decades .
It appeared in science fiction as far back as 1941 and later received serious study by NASA and the Pentagon .
At times , it has been dismissed as fantasy .
But San Francisco's PG&E considers it realistic enough to support .
The company asked the California Public Utilities Commission on Friday for permission to buy 200 megawatts of electricity from Solaren 's orbiting power plant when and if it 's built .
That 's enough electricity for 150,000 homes .
" We 're convinced it 's a very serious possibility that they can make this work , " said PG&E spokesman Jonathan Marshall .
" It 's staggering how much power is potentially available in space .
And I say ' potentially ' because a lot remains unknown about the cost and other details . "
Many of the project 's details remain under wraps , and others have n't been decided yet , said Cal Boerman , Solaren 's director of energy services .
For example , Solaren still has n't decided whether to use crystalline silicon solar cells or newer , thin - film cells that weigh less than silicon but are n't as efficient .
But the young company , a collection of aerospace engineers based in Manhattan Beach ( Los Angeles County ) , has the technology and expertise to make it work , Boerman said .
" We 'd all read about it , thought about it , and it seemed to be a good , next challenging project for the space industry , " he said .
" The timing is right . "
Not a ' laser death ray '
He also dismissed fears , raised in the past , that the transmission beam could hurt birds or airline passengers who stray into its path .
The beam would be too diffuse for that .
" This is n't a laser death ray , " Boerman said .
" With an airplane flying at altitude , the sun is putting about four or five times more energy on the airplane than we would be . "
Placing solar panels in orbit would solve two of the biggest problems facing the solar industry .
Terrestrial large - scale solar farms only generate electricity during the day , and their output varies with the seasons .
They also require large tracts of land , often hundreds of acres for a single installation .
Those problems vanish in space .
The Solaren project would experience constant sunlight except for brief interruptions during the spring and fall equinox periods .
Obviously , land would n't be an issue .
And the sunlight hitting Solaren 's facility would be eight to 10 times more powerful than the light reaching Earth through the planet 's atmosphere .
Failure to launch
But orbiting solar installations face their own difficulties , problems that have kept the idea Earth - bound for decades .
Space is a harsh environment , and equipment sent there must be able to operate year after year without repairs .
Lifting the gear into orbit is expensive and a bit risky , since some rocket launches fail .
Boerman said the solar installation would require four rocket launches .
It would not , however , require assembly by astronauts , instead unfolding on its own in space .
" Obviously , there are going to be a lot of very hard questions , " said Ralph Cavanagh , head of the energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council .
" My prediction is this is going to be much more about economics than the environment . "
PG&E has not disclosed how much money it has agreed to spend on Solaren 's electricity , money that would come from the utility 's customers .
" I can say it will be comparable to other renewable energy that 's been approved recently by the California Public Utilities Commission , " Marshall said .
Global crunch
Like California 's other utilities , PG&E is under state orders to expand its use of renewable power as part of California 's fight against global warming .
By the end of 2010 , 20 percent of the electricity PG&E sells must come from renewable sources .
The utility has been signing contracts with companies planning wind farms and large solar arrays , but some of those projects have been stalled by the global credit crisis .
Mark Toney , head of The Utility Reform Network watchdog group , fears that the difficulty of meeting the state 's requirements has pushed PG&E into supporting an expensive distraction .
" It really seems like an act of desperation , " he said .
" We really think PG&E should be spending more time on proven technologies closer to home that we can really count on .
This just seems so remote , in more ways than one . "
Cavanagh said , however , that given the world 's problems of global warming and rising demand for energy , utilities need to explore some unconventional ideas .
" You want to encourage them to try lots of different things , " he said .
" But the caution is that some of these things wo n't work . "
A goat that produces spider 's web protein is about to revolutionise the materials industry .
Stronger and more flexible than steel , spider silk offers a lightweight alternative to carbon fibre .
Up to now it has been impossible to produce " spider fibre " on a commercial scale .
Unlike silk worms , spiders are too anti-social to farm successfully .
Now a Canadian company claims to be on the verge of producing unlimited quantities of spider silk - in goat 's milk .
Using techniques similar to those used to produce Dolly the sheep , scientists at Nexia Biotechnologies in Quebec have bred goats with spider genes .
New kids on the block
Called Webster and Pete , the world 's first " web kids " cannot dangle from the ceiling , nor do they have a taste for flies .
In fact they look like any other goat .
But when they mate , it is hoped they will sire nanny goats that produce milk that contains the spider silk protein .
This " silk milk " will be used to produce a web - like material called Biosteel .
Naturally occurring spider silk is widely recognised as the strongest , toughest fibre known to man .
Its tensile strength is greater than steel and it is 25 percent lighter than synthetic , petroleum - based polymers .
These qualities will allow BioSteel to be used in applications where strength and lightness are essential , such as aircraft , racing vehicles and bullet - proof clothing .
Kind to humans
Another advantage of spider silk is that it is compatible with the human body .
That means BioSteel could be used for strong , tough artificial tendons , ligaments and limbs .
The new material could also be used to help tissue repair , wound healing and to create super - thin , biodegradable sutures for eye- or neurosurgery .
" The medical need for super - strong , flexible and biodegradable materials is large , " said Costas Karatzas , Nexia 's Vice President of Research and Development .
" This breakthrough in goat nuclear transfer technology will move our BioSteel program into the clinical testing phases earlier than by using traditional strategies , " Cloning the future Nexia 's first transgenic goat , called Willow , was born in 1998 .
Willow 's genes had been engineered to produce a therapeutic human protein .
A year later Willow was followed by Clint , Arnold and Danny , the world 's first cloned goats .

Abstract
Computer Science Dept.Stony Brook University
Seven paper construction projects provide students with experience exploring properties and relationships of two - dimensional and three - dimensional geometric figures .
“ Slide - togethers ” based on squares , triangles , pentagons , and decagons
Introduction
“ Slide - togethers ” based on hexagons , decagrams , and pentagrams
Constructing the 30 - Squares “ Slide - Together ”
the squares are planar ; you will bend them temporarily during assembly but they should end up flat ; when two squares are slid completely into each other , two edges of one square intersect two edges of the other ( one crossing occurs at each end of the slit ) ; and each square will join to four squares of the four other colors , e.g. , a blue square never touches another blue square .
Constructing the other six “ slide - togethers ”
Classroom ideas from Middle Grades to Architectural Design

Shifting wealth :
Is the US dollar Empire falling ?
Helmut Reisen
If history is any guide , the Chinese renminbi will soon be due to overtake the US dollar , just as the dollar replaced the pound sterling last century .
But will the renminbi be ready for reserve currency status ?
This column discusses the issues at hand and explains why some experts would prefer the IMF ’s Special Drawing Rights as the next global reserve currency .
Just ahead of the G20 London Summit in April , Zhou Xiaochuan ( China 's central bank governor ) proposed replacing the US dollar as the international reserve currency with a new global system controlled by the IMF .
The main global reserve currency would be represented by a basket of significant currencies and commodities , an extended version of the Fund ’s Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) .
China 's call for an overhaul of the global currency reserve system has been echoed by Russia 's President Medvedev as an important building block of a new global financial architecture .
Major emerging economies , often net creditors to the rest of the world an with substantial holdings of US government debt , fear the potential inflationary risk of the US Federal Reserve printing money to finance bank bail outs .
Their fears may be based on the “ Triffin Dilemma ” that postulates the necessity of US external deficits as long as the US dollar is the only global reserve currency .
In a famous warning to Congress in 1960 , the Belgian Yale economist Robert Triffin explained that as the marginal supplier of the world ’s reserve currency , the US had no choice but to run persistent current account deficits .
As the global economy expanded , demand for reserve assets increased .
These could only be supplied to foreigners by America running a current account deficit and issuing dollar - denominated obligations to fund it .
If the US stopped running balance of payments deficits and supplying reserves , the resulting shortage of liquidity would pull the global economy into a contractionary spiral ( Triffin , 1961 ) .
Note that demand for foreign exchange reserves forces developing countries to transfer resources to the countries issuing those reserve currencies – a case of “ reverse aid ” .
China holds a huge official portfolio of US government bonds .
It has already suffered valuation losses on its sovereign wealth funds that invested heavily in US financial intermediaries .
But could China suffer valuation losses as a result of inflation and dollar devaluation , as is often maintained ?
Dollar weakness – against other key currencies – will not by itself inflict valuation losses on China 's central bank as there would be no change in the renminbi value on the dollar component of China 's huge FX reserves .
It is renminbi appreciation against those currencies held in the FX reserves – often claimed by the West – that would inflict valuation losses as measured in renminbi .
In the recent decade , the US has used ( and perhaps abused ) the privileges that its reserve currency status has conveyed to the host country .
To see this , look at Table 1 , which displays a matrix of the global functions of money often attributed to Peter Kenen ( Group of Thirty , 1983 ) .
Table 1 . Matrix of international currency use
Private use Official use Medium of exchange Vehicle currency Intervention currency Unit of account Quotation currency Anchor currency Store of value Investment , debt FX reserve currency
By enlarging the scope of issuers and investors , the reserve currency lowers borrowing costs and facilitates balance of payments financing ; Americans have outspent their national income by an accumulated 47.3 % of GDP since 2000 , depressing US treasury rates until 2005 up to 130 basis points as the world ( mostly Asia ) reinvested the corresponding surpluses mostly in US treasury bills ( Warnock & Warnock , 2006 ) .
The additional demand for money creates seigniorage revenues ; last year the US Fed made a net interest income of $ 43 billion , as the US dollar in circulation is , in effect , an interest - free loan by the public to the central bank ( Economist 2009 ) .
And , though its benefits are harder to quantify , currency use in key markets for commodities or trade invoicing shifts exchange rate risk to third countries , insulating the reserve currency host country .
In turn , the US dollar is providing ( microeconomic ) network benefits ; it has the attributes of a natural monopoly – like the English language these days .
( By contrast , the IMF 's Special Drawing Rights – SDRs – are no more than the equivalent of Esperanto ) .
Sixty - four percent of the world ’s official foreign exchange reserves are currently held in US dollars ; roughly 88 % of daily foreign exchange trades involve US dollars ( Humpage , 2009 ) .
Global trade is facilitated by the use of just one currency , liquid debt markets allow Central Banks to intervene in foreign exchange markets as to smooth currency fluctuations , savers can escape inflationary governments by deposit dollarization , and commodities can be priced homogenously wherever traded .
While the US has been enjoying the spoils of reserve currency status , this is by no means assured for the future .
As emphasised by Avinash Persaud ( 2004 ) :
“ … reserve currencies come and go .
They do n't last forever .
International currencies in the past have included the Chinese Liang and Greek drachma , coined in the fifth century B.C. , the silver punch - marked coins of fourth century India , the Roman denari , the Byzantine solidus and Islamic dinar of the middle - ages , the Venetian ducato of the Renaissance , the seventeenth century Dutch guilder and of course , more recently , sterling and the dollar . ”
Is the renminbi the next global reserve currency ?
If history of the last switch in reserve currency ( from pound sterling to the US dollar ) is any guide , the Chinese renminbi can be expected to replace the US dollar as a reserve currency around 2050 .
The UK lost its position to the US as the world ’s largest economy in 1872 and the largest exporter in 1915 .
The switch in net debtor / creditor positions started 1914 , and as the US dollar emerged as a convertible net creditor currency , its use in finance and trade widened .
By 1945 , the pound was dethroned ( Chinn and Frankel , 2008 ) .
Today , the US is in a net debtor position similar to Britain after the WWI , with China being the world ’s largest creditor .
In PPP terms at least , Angus Maddison predicts that China will surpass the US by 2015 ; China is on its way to becoming the world largest exporter .
So these historic parallels might imply a switch in the reserve currency by the mid-21st century .
Figure 1 . China ’s re-emerging supremacy
Source : Maddison ( 2007 )
Nowadays , the renminbi is far from ready to achieve reserve currency status .
China would first have to ease restrictions on money entering and leaving the country , make its currency fully convertible for such transactions , continue its domestic financial reforms , and make its bond markets more liquid .
Hong Kong has had the freest capital account for two decades , according to the Chinn - Ito index .
Moving from closely managing its currency to greater market determination , China ’s renminbi would appreciate against the US dollar and thus alleviate several concerns – the China - US imbalances would shrink and China could lower its risky exposure to dollar - denominated assets .
But it would incur renminbi valuation losses on its key currency assets .
Change is underway .
China has already flexed its muscle by setting up currency swaps with several countries ( including Argentina , Belarus and Indonesia ) and by letting institutions in Hong Kong issue bonds denominated in renminbi , a first step toward creating a deep domestic and international market for its currency .
Brazil and China are now working towards using their own currencies in trade transactions rather than the US dollar .
Invoice of more trade in emerging - market currencies suggests that the US will no longer enjoy full seller finance on its trade deficit .
Special drawing rights
The Commission of Experts of the UN General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System , led by Joseph E. Stiglitz , has suggested a gradual move from the US dollar to the SDR .
Following upon the G20 Summit in London , the IMF is issuing Special Drawing Rights worth $ 250 billion .
This will increase the share of SDRs in total international reserves to no more than 4 % .
So some specific steps are needed to improve the role of the SDR as a global reserve asset .
In order to make the SDR the principal reserve asset via allocation , close to $ 3 trillion in SDRs would need to be created .
Onno Wijnholds ( 2009 ) has thus suggested a so - called SDR Substitution Account .
The idea is to permit countries whose official dollar holdings are larger than they desire to convert dollars into Special Drawing Rights .
Conversion would occur outside the market and thus would not put downward pressure on the dollar .
This suggestion , however , requires settling who will bear the exchange ( dollar ) risk as the SDR Substitution Account is likely to mostly hold dollars as assets .
Another step to enhance the role of the SDR is to make its currency composition more neutral to global cycles and more representative of the shift in economic power witnessed over the last two decades .
This implies an increase in the commodity content and the inclusion of major emerging - market currencies .
Today , the SDR is constituted as a basket of four fiat monies .
To the extent that free convertibility is required for inclusion into the SDR composite , the Australian , Canadian , Chilean and Norwegian currencies could be included to give the SDR a link to the raw material cycles , as these currencies proxy price developments of copper , iron ore , gold , and oil .
Major emerging - country currencies would be included in the SDR mix as soon as they reach a predefined level of convertibility .
Other avenues to better the reach of the SDR as a reserve asset are to improve its trade invoice and vehicle functions .
Pilot programmes such as the Real / Renminbi deal mentioned above could be extended as could regional currency arrangements ; the proviso is that they should not introduce friction and higher transaction costs into regional and global trade .
IMF bonds issued in SDR are already much in demand , reflecting concerns about the dollar , and will enhance its store of value function .

DETROIT  Every little bit helps for Earlean White 's family .
GREEN SPACES : Cities cleaning , ' greening ' urban alleys
The neighborhood garden a block from her home was the source of fresh tomatoes , cucumbers and peppers for her family last summer .
So on a recent sunny Saturday , White , 48 , enlisted two of her kids — Katherine White , 9 , and David Smith , 13 — and her grandson Robert Puritan , 8 , to start planting for this year 's growing season .
White says the garden helps ease her grocery bill and " helps the community and makes it look better . "
With the help of Urban Farming , a Detroit - based non-profit group , this 20 - foot - by - 20 - foot lot and more than 600 others like it across the USA are being turned into gardens filled with fresh vegetables for hungry families .
Taja Sevelle , an R&B recording artist from Detroit , started the agency in 2005 with three gardens in the city .
That 's grown to gardens in seven other states as well as Jamaica , she says .
The group also operates gardens in New York , New Jersey , California , Minnesota , Missouri , North Carolina and Hawaii .
In each location , Urban Farming sponsors provide seeds and other needed materials , she says .
" The whole focus is getting rid of hunger , " Sevelle says .
" But it also beautifies the area and brings people together . "
In Los Angeles , Joyce Lapinsky - Lewis , program development consultant for Urban Farming 's West Coast operation , says one of the aims is to pass on the skills needed to farm independently .
" Everyone can learn enough to sustain their own program , " she says .
In New Jersey , James Kelly , who helped plant Newark 's first Urban Farming garden three years ago , is the director of the city 's program , which has eight gardens on two lots .
Last month , Kelly says , about 25 middle school kids came out to plant collard greens , squash , onions , tomatoes , watermelon and lettuce .
" We had one guy who came up and said , ' I ate off this garden last year , ' and he helped us all day , " Kelly says .
Sevelle says she has been helped by Wayne County and the city of Detroit , which have turned over tax foreclosed lots to the group to transform into gardens .
The land stays in the name of the city or the county , so if a developer comes along it can be returned , says Terrence Keith , Wayne County deputy treasurer .
In the past , the program was able to turn over about 50 % of the produce grown to food banks throughout the city , Sevelle says .
As the recession hit , that dropped to 5 % last year .
" That 's how badly people needed food , " Sevelle said .
" People were picking the gardens clean . "

I do n’t think it is any giant secret that the Democrats were complicit in the torture of detainees , but it is nice to have some names and dates ( I ’m assuming you all are not named Rosen , and as such , understand the value of facts mixed in with your assertions ) :
Intelligence officials released documents this evening saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) was briefed in September 2002 about the use of harsh interrogation tactics against al - Qaeda prisoners , seemingly contradicting her repeated statements over the past 18 months that she was never told that these techniques were actually being used .
In a 10 - page memo outlining an almost seven - year history of classified briefings , intelligence officials said that Pelosi and then - Rep. Porter Goss ( R - Fla . ) were the first two members of Congress ever briefed on the interrogation tactics .
Then the ranking member and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , respectively , Pelosi and Goss were briefed Sept. 4 , 2002 , one week before the first anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
According to the Note , Rockefeller and Harman as well as a couple Republicans were also named .
So now you know for sure why many Democrats are also unwilling to investigate the torture of the past few years , as their fingerprints are all over it .
Just disgraceful .
I guess it is the Washington way - you can get away with anything so long as you have enough conspirators .
*** Update ***
Via the comments , Scott Horton and Marcy Wheeler are both skeptical about the reporting from the Note .
Much more debunking here .
Mass immigration into Europe in the past 50 years has profoundly changed the continent and is likely to change it even more over the next half century .
Yet it is a subject so immersed in fear and wishful thinking that it often seems we still do n't have a proper language in which to discuss it .
It is partly for this reason that Christopher Caldwell 's new book , with the melodramatic title Reflections on the Revolution in Europe , will seem rather shocking to some readers of this newspaper .
For he asks some unusually direct questions : can you have the same Europe with different people ?
Why did mass immigration happen when so few people actually wanted it ?
Immigrants want a better life but how many of them want a European life ?
Why is minority ethnic pride a virtue and European nationalism a sickness ?
Is political correctness just fear masquerading as tolerance ?
As you can tell from those questions , the book is a sustained attack on the well - meaning liberalism that is still the dominant note in official immigration debates .
Yet although Caldwell , a conservative American , believes that European immigration has not been a success , at least for the host societies , he is not anti-immigrant and says that he is a great supporter of the American melting pot .
The book , or most of it , is written with the bemused but decent " native " European in mind .
Even if you disagree with his premises , Caldwell is worth persevering with because he is a bracing , clear - eyed analyst of European pieties .
And that is partly because , as an American , he knows that mass immigration is not only compatible with a strong , confident , patriotic society , but may even require it .
He can see Europe from the outside and has a genuinely pan-European view of the immigration issue , something rarely encountered in domestic commentary .
Caldwell cuts to shreds the conventional wisdom of the " immigrationist " ideology - the view that mass immigration is inevitable and in any case a necessary injection of youth into our ageing continent .
He shows , contrary to the immigrationists , that the flows of recent decades are unprecedented .
He also demolishes the economic and welfare - state arguments for mass immigration and points out that in most countries there was no desperate need for extra workers in the 1950s - in Britain 's case , Ireland still provided a reserve army of labour .
One of the most startling figures in the book is that the number of foreign residents in Germany rose from 3 million to 7.5 million between 1971 and 2000 but the number of employed foreigners stayed the same at 2 million .
Caldwell is at his best describing the confused cultural and intellectual condition of much of Europe at the time the first waves of immigrants were arriving .
It was hard , he points out , to follow Europe 's rules and embrace its values when Europeans themselves were rewriting those rules and reassessing those values .
After the brutal experiences of the first part of the 20th century - two world wars , the Holocaust and de-colonisation - European elites had embraced a liberal universalism that declared the moral equality of all people and implicitly questioned the legitimacy of most racial and gender hierarchies .
Liberal universalism could , in theory , have been compatible with confident nation states and national identities , but in practice it seldom was .
The idea of national traditions and solidarities came to be scorned by liberals in many European countries .
Caldwell reverses the conventional argument , which says that if immigration has been a relative failure it is because the host society has been too hostile and unaccommodating .
On the contrary , he argues , it is because most of the host societies were too weak and insecure to make newcomers an offer that was sufficiently confident to secure their loyalty and integration .
Most European countries , constrained by liberal universalism and the immigrationism ideology , were simply too laissez - faire towards migrants .
For the first time in modern history , European societies were set up to allow a big group of citizens to lead their lives as if in a foreign culture .
Caldwell somewhat overstates the case - surely the failures of European immigration can be attributed to both the hostility of the masses and the insecurity of the elites .
But then he is not seeking to be balanced and reasonable .
This is a declamatory , polemical work and no more so than in its treatment of Islam .
In fact , the book is really two essays - one an insightful probing of Europe 's confusion about postwar immigration ; the other a rather cartoonish polemic about the potential Islamic takeover of Europe .
There obviously have been , and are , particular problems associated with the arrival into an increasingly secular and liberal Europe of large numbers of Muslims with a strong , often illiberal religious world - view .
But Caldwell here abandons his clear - eyed reporting in favour of recycling a mild version of the neoconservative " Eurabia " thesis , which sees a decadent , irreligious Europe overrun by militant Islam .
He provocatively points out that there were fewer Bolsheviks in Russia in 1917 than there are Islamists in today 's Europe .
He also invites us to imagine that at the height of the cold war , Europe had received a mass inflow of immigrants from communist countries who were ambivalent about which side they supported .
Again , it is fine to square up to the issue of Muslim commitment to national citizenship ( one - third of British Muslims say they place their commitment to fellow Muslims before Britain ) but to equate the war on terror with the cold war is outlandish .
In other areas , too , Caldwell has a tendency to heckle from the sidelines , rather than grapple with dilemmas .
Yes , Europe did overestimate the need for migrants and underestimated the cultural and religious upheaval they would bring , especially those from outside Europe .
But does Caldwell want to reverse the postwar liberal universalism and its associated playing down of national identity , which was partly inspired by the US itself ?
How do we in today 's Europe nurture a sense of national belonging - and a sense of a collective " we " strong enough to sustain generous welfare states - that is compatible not only with mass immigration but also with the postmodern individualism that has been an even more striking feature of recent decades ?
Liberal nationalisms should not be built against the feelings of the majority , as elite - driven multiculturalism sometimes seems to be , but that in itself does not get us very far .
Moreover , Caldwell is far too sanguine about the US experience with race and immigration and does not seem aware that the idea of the " melting pot " has been under sustained attack in the US for decades .
He is also too pessimistic about the UK and ignores , for example , the great success of Indians and Africans in climbing the professional ladder .
And he is too ready to take official Jewish accounts of the return of anti-semitism at face value .
And yet , compared with most literature on migration , so often dull and cliché - ridden , this book pulsates with ideas : how the immigrationists cannot , logically , have both integration and their beloved diversity ; how it was easier for migrants to integrate into factory economies than the more intimate service economies of today ; how migrant disappointment can increase the less racist a country becomes as failure becomes more humiliating .
Caldwell even proposes the startling theory that in modern " libertine " Europe , in which the search for sexual pleasure is increasingly paramount , the gap between haves and have - nots is reinforced ( although this thesis could surely be reversed : beautiful , sexy poor people can now compete on more equal terms with ugly rich people - just do n't be both poor and ugly in the modern west ) .
Caldwell quotes the French political philosopher Raymond Aron saying that " with humanity on the way to unification , inequality between peoples takes on the significance that inequality between classes once had " .
This applies within as well as between nation states and is another reason why the fallout from decades of mass immigration is , as Caldwell says , the most important problem facing Europe .
And it is one which European democracy is handling with a striking lack of confidence .

A French investigator says that Air France Flight 447 plunged vertically into the Atlantic Ocean at a high rate of speed when it went down off the caost of Brazil on June 1 with 228 people on board .
LE BOURGET , France ( AP )  Brazil 's air force has released a recording it says proves it handed over control of Air France Flight 447 to Senegalese authorities before it crashed .
The audio has been posted on the air force website after a French official said air traffic controllers in Dakar , Senegal , never officially took control of the flight .
Lead French investigator Alain Bouillard made the accusation during the first public report on the June 1 crash in the Atlantic Ocean that killed 228 people .
But the Brazilian air force said Friday that the audio message proves it informed the Senegalese of the Air France flight 's plan and turned over control of the flight .
The cause of the crash has not been determined .
Searchers are looking for the plane 's black boxes .
On Thursday , Bouillard said Flight 447 plunged vertically into the Atlantic Ocean intact at a very high speed , adding that problems with the plane 's speed sensors were not the direct cause of the crash .
Bouillard says the sensors , called Pitot tubes , were " a factor but not the only one . "
" It is an element but not the cause , " Bouillard told a news conference in Le Bourget outside Paris .
" Today we are very far from establishing the causes of the accident . "
The Airbus A330 - 200 plane flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris went down with 228 people on board in a remote area of the Atlantic , 930 miles off Brazil 's mainland and far from radar coverage .
The BEA released its first preliminary findings on the crash Thursday , calling it one of history 's most challenging plane crash investigations .
One of the automatic messages emitted by the Air France plane indicates it was receiving incorrect speed information from the external monitoring instruments , which could destabilize the plane 's control systems .
Experts have suggested those external instruments might have iced over .
Bouillard said the plane " was not destroyed in flight . "
" The plane seems to have hit the surface of the water on its flight trajectory with a strong vertical acceleration , " he said , adding that investigators have found " neither traces of fire nor traces of explosives . "
Bouillard said life vests found among the wreckage were not inflated , suggesting the passengers were not prepared for a crash landing in the water .
The pilots apparently also did not send any mayday calls .
A burst of automated messages emitted by the plane before it fell gave rescuers only a vague location to begin their search , which has failed to locate the plane 's black boxes in the vast ocean expanse .
The chances of finding the flight recorders are falling daily as the signals they emit fade .
Without them , the full causes of the tragic accident may never be known .
He said the search for the plane 's black boxes has been extended by 10 days and will continue through July 10 .
The black boxes — which are in reality bright orange — are resting somewhere on an underwater mountain range filled with crevasses and rough , uneven terrain .
The remote location , combined with the mystery of what happened to the plane — the pilots had either no time or no radio frequency to make a mayday call — makes the inquiry exceptionally challenging .
Bouillard said French investigators have yet to receive any information from Brazilian authorities about the results of the autopsies on the 51 bodies recovered from the site .

The political fate of the prime minister dominates many front pages .
In the Observer , Communities Secretary Hazel Blears writes that Labour has taken a " titanic battering in recent weeks " and warns it must reconnect .
The Mail on Sunday describes the PM as " a dead man walking " and claims plotters want to replace him with the Health Secretary Alan Johnson .
Former minister Kate Hoey tells the Sunday Telegraph that Gordon Brown could be replaced within weeks .
The Independent on Sunday says disenchantment has spread through the cabinet over the issue of MPs ' expenses and settlement rights for the Gurkhas .
One minister it quotes says people are now operating " through gritted teeth " .
However , the Sunday Mirror believes Gordon Brown can breathe a sigh of relief , claiming Labour big guns have moved to crush a plot by rebel MPs .
It says former deputy PM John Prescott has warned them to rally behind the leadership or leave the party .
DNA profiles destroyed
The Sunday Times reports the government is preparing for a " full - scale retreat " over plans to privatise Royal Mail .
The paper also carries a report saying that ministers are to shake - up the human rights legislation stopping them from deporting foreign criminals .
The Observer says police are to destroy the DNA profiles of 800,000 innocent people in England and Wales as part of an overhaul of its national database .
Civil rights groups have given a cautious welcome to the move , it notes .
Beer mat collectors
The News of the World turns its attention to the travel arrangements of the foreign secretary .
Under the headline Airfarce One , it says David Miliband plans to use a private jet , instead of scheduled flights , for official trips abroad .
According to the Independent on Sunday , tegestologists - beer mat collectors - are up in arms after one of the biggest makers of coasters went bankrupt .
Germany - based Katz group has been hit by falling beer sales , it reports .
The security team for Foxconn , the company that manufactures the iPhone for Apple , is said to have subjected employee Sun Danyong to " unbearable interrogation techniques , " leading him to commit suicide .
He was under investigation for losing a prototype device .

The rumors and reports , collected and translated by ex-Gizmodian Elaine over at Shanghaist , tell a plausible story : Sun had been handling a shipment of sixteen iPhone prototype devices ( though it 's not clear when ) , one of which went missing .
In the following days , Sun told his friends that Foxconn 's Central Security Division had been incredibly severe , subjecting him to intense interrogations , harassment , and even " laying hands " on the worker .
Confiding in his friends was just a prelude — on the 16th of this month , Sun jumped from a 12 - story building .
Foxconn has issued a statement on the matter , which , though creditable in its honesty , is chilling .
The company is currently investigating a section chief of the Central Security Division for possibly using " inappropriate interrogation methods " in his investigation , including unannounced home searches , solitary confinement and physical violence .

Labor protections in China are minimal , a situation not helped by spotty enforcement and insular company cultures — especially at a manufacturing juggernaut like Foxconn .
The company has been dogged by allegations of poor working conditions over the years , such that hearing an employee may have been mistreated does n't come as much of a surprise , save for the fact that the mistreatment was so severe that it killed him .
That Sun killed himself does n't seem to be in question here , nor does the fact that Foxconn had at least some part in his death .
From a company spokeperson :
Regardless of the reason of Sun 's suicide , it is to some extent a reflection of Foxconn 's internal management deficiencies , especially in how to help young workers cope with the psychological pressures of working life at the company .
If it turns out the these " psychological pressures " include getting your head slammed against the floor , there 'd better be consequences for Foxconn , be it from the government , Apple , or both .
It goes without saying that Apple can't be held accountable for a tragic one - off event at a different company , but they absolutely should be held accountable for continuing to do business with a company that treats its employees like this .
We 'll have to see .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Honda Motor
Co said on Friday that it is recalling another 440,000 vehicles -- including some of its best - selling Accord and Civic models -- for a potentially lethal airbag defect .
Honda said that the airbag inflators in some of its top - selling sedans can rupture because of too much air pressure causing metal fragments to shoot through the airbag and strike vehicle occupants .
One fatality and a number of injuries have been linked to the defect , Honda spokesman Sage Marie said .
The recall covers certain 2001 and 2002 Accords , 2001 Civics and some 2002 and 2003 model Acura TL sedans .
The driver ’s side airbag is the defective component on the affected vehicles .
Honda said owners of those models can check to see if their vehicle is covered by the recall by checking the automaker ’s website at www.owners.honda.com/recalls.
The Japanese automaker said it was encouraging owners to wait until they received a recall notice to go to a dealership and have the inflator for the steering - wheel airbag replaced .
Honda had originally announced that it would recall some 2001 Accord and Civic sedans for the defect last November .
The notice issued on Friday added another 440,000 vehicles to the recall .
“ We ’ve been married nine months , ” she added .
“ And seven of those , David has been in captivity . ”
Both Mr. Keller and Mr. Rohde ’s family declined to discuss details of the efforts to free the captives , except to say that no ransom money was paid and no Taliban or other prisoners were released .
“ Kidnapping , tragically , is a flourishing industry in much of the world , ” Mr. Keller said .
“ As other victims have told us , discussing your strategy just offers guidance for future kidnappers . ”
Mr. Rohde , 41 , had traveled to Afghanistan in early November to work on a book about the history of American involvement there when he was invited to interview a Taliban commander in Logar Province outside Kabul .
Mr. Rohde , who years before had been taken prisoner while reporting in Bosnia , had instructed The Times ’s bureau in Kabul about whom to notify if he did not return .
He also indicated that he believed that the interview was important and that he would be all right .

His father , Harvey Rohde , said that while he regretted that his son had made the trip , he understood his motivation , “ to get both sides of the story , to have his book honestly portray not just the one side but the other side as well . ”
“ I guess that personifies my son , ” Mr. Rohde said .
As security has deteriorated in Afghanistan , kidnappers have increasingly singled out affluent Afghans as well as foreign contractors , aid workers , church members and journalists .
Last fall , Melissa Fung , a reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , was held captive in a dank underground hole for nearly a month until Afghan authorities pressured her kidnappers to release her .
Mr. Rohde ’s captivity was one of the longest in the country .
Mr. Rohde joined The Times 12 years ago after winning a Pulitzer Prize in international reporting in 1996 for documenting the massacre of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica .
PART of the recent optimism in world markets rests on the belief that China 's fiscal - stimulus package is boosting its economy and that GDP growth could come close to the government 's target of 8 % this year .
Some economists , however , suspect that the figures overstate the economy 's true growth rate and that Beijing would report 8 % regardless of the truth .
Is China cheating ?
Economists have long doubted the credibility of Chinese data and it is widely accepted that GDP growth was overstated during the previous two downturns .
In 1998 - 99 , during the Asian financial crisis , China 's GDP grew by an average of 7.7 % , according to official figures .
However , using alternative measures of activity , such as energy production , air travel and imports , Thomas Rawski of the University of Pittsburgh calculated that the growth rate was at best 2 % .
Other economists reckon that Mr Rawski was too pessimistic .
Arthur Kroeber of Dragonomics , a research firm in Beijing , estimates GDP growth was around 5 % in 1998 - 99 , for example .
The top chart , plotting the official growth rate against estimates by Dragonomics , clearly suggests that some massaging of the government statistics may have gone on .
The biggest adjustment seems to have been made in 1989 , the year of political protests in Tiananmen Square .
Officially , GDP grew by over 4 % ; Dragonomics reckons it actually declined by 1.5 % .
China 's growth in the first quarter of this year has led some to conclude that the government is up to the same old tricks .
According to official figures , GDP was 6.1 % higher than a year earlier .
Yet electricity production in the first quarter was 4 % lower than it had been a year earlier ; in comparison , production grew by 16 % in the year to the first quarter of 2008 .
In the past , GDP and electricity output have moved broadly together , although it is not a one - to - one relationship ( see bottom chart ) .
But the gap between the two lines is now wider than it has ever been .
Given that power statistics are less likely to have been tampered with than politically sensitive GDP figures , is this evidence that the latter have been fiddled ?
Probably not .
Paul Cavey , an economist at Macquarie Securities , argues that the discrepancy is explained by the fact that energy - guzzling heavy industries , such as steel and aluminium , bore the brunt of the slowdown last year .
Mr Cavey calculates that the metals industry accounted for 40 % of the growth in electricity consumption in 2001 - 07 , but only 16 % of the increase in industrial production .
Steel output fell by more than 10 % in the year to the fourth quarter , so it is hardly surprising that energy use dropped .
Distrust of the GDP numbers has prompted Capital Economics , a research firm based in London , to create its own proxy of economic activity , which includes electricity output , domestic freight volumes , cargo traffic at ports , passenger transport and floor area under construction .
It suggests that GDP growth slowed to only 4 % in the year to the first quarter .
However , it tracks mostly industrial activity , and thus excludes two - fifths of the economy , most notably services , which are growing faster .
Then there are government tax revenues .
These have fallen by 10 % over the past year , compared with a surge of 35 % in early 2008 , suggesting that incomes and output have tumbled .
But Stephen Green , an economist at Standard Chartered , says that revenues were inflated in early 2008 by a sharp rise in taxes from the boom in land sales , which has since subsided .
Another possible distortion is that local officials may be hiding tax revenue to make their finances appear worse , in order to get more money from Beijing to finance infrastructure projects .
Overall , Dragonomics 's Mr Kroeber thinks that GDP growth in the year to the first quarter of 2009 was not significantly overstated .
One reason why others are more suspicious is the fact that the National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) does not publish quarterly GDP figures as developed economies do ; its year - on - year changes give it more scope to smooth growth rates ( for example , output probably did stall over the past two quarters ) .
To be fair , many developing countries do this as well .
One reason is that seasonal adjustment is tricky in such countries where the shift from agriculture to industry changes the pattern of seasonality over time , says Mr Kroeber .
Cutting the fudge
And for all today 's misgivings , Beijing 's growth estimates consistently proved to be too low until recently .
One of the quirks of Chinese data has long been that the provinces reported higher numbers than the central government did — a phenomenon that was put down to the fact that local officials inflated growth rates in order to get promoted .
Yet the NBS GDP figures have almost always been revised upwards .
For example , growth in 2007 was first reported as 11.4 % , but in January it was marked up to 13 % .
The NBS has improved its data - gathering methods in recent years , by extending its coverage of services , for example .
This month Beijing also introduced new penalties for officials who falsify statistics .
But the real test is whether the government itself is prepared to publish politically embarrassing bad news .
There are encouraging signs that it is becoming more open .
On May 14th an essay on the NBS website by Xu Xianchun , the bureau 's deputy director , was surprisingly frank about some of the flaws in Chinese statistics .
Mr Xu admitted , for example , that the retail - sales numbers include some purchases by companies and the government , which should not be counted as consumption .
He estimated that consumer spending in the first quarter grew by 9 % , compared with the 15 % increase reported for retail sales .
Andy Rothman , an economist at CLSA , a regional broker , believes that Chinese statistics are much more trustworthy than they used to be .
This is partly because there are alternative numbers to go on ; CLSA , for example , produces its own purchasing - managers ' index .
There are also more private - sector economists keeping tabs on China than there were a decade ago .
The more eyes there are on China , and the more crucial its economic performance becomes for the rest of the world , the harder it is for officials to tamper with the speedometer .
A Mudflats reader went to work :
On a hunch , I reviewed online lists of all the men and women who ’ve been elected governor of their state since the year 1900 .
Pored over them for a few hours .
Over 1200 politicians have taken that first - term oath of office .
Some soon died in office .
Many resigned to accept other positions in government , including Spiro Agnew who was “ tapped ” by Nixon after being the Governor of Maryland for about five minutes .
On a handful of occasions , a first - termer was dragged off to the slammer or impeached .
One was incapacitated by a nervous breakdown and one left just as impeachment came knocking on his door .
Sohow many out of over 1200 just up and quit before the end of their term ?

HP is stripping down to scale out .
Today the company is launching a line of servers and services targeting the cloud computing market , which is accounting for a growing chunk of server sales .
HP 's Extreme Scale - Out ( ExSO ) portfolio is designed to appeal to cloud - builders ' focus on energy efficiency and cost , and be delivered by the rackload .
HP 's ambitions are built around the ProLiant SL server line , which features a " skinless " architecture with a lightweight rail and tray design .
The new servers are deployed in HP 's new ProLiant z6000 chassis , a 2U frame housing shared power supply and fans .
The common chassis allows customers to choose between three ProLiant SL configurations optimized for maximum memory , storage or processing power .
On each server , HP is mounting the disks on the side rather than the front , allowing better air flow through to the fans on the rear of the chassis .
The i/o cabling is on the front of the server , allowing it to be serviced from the cold aisle .
" We 've designed it for power efficiency and good airflow , " said Ed Turkel , manager of business development for HP Scalable Computing & Infrastructure .
" In this environment they typically do n't need a lot of management features .
We think of this as a lean and mean environment . "
“ Customers with scale out business models need solutions that make every dollar , watt and square foot in the data center count , ” said Christine Reischl , senior vice president and general manager of Industry Standard Servers , HP .
“ These customers are pioneering ‘ extreme ’ businesses and their extraordinary requirements are pushing beyond traditional architectures . "
HP is hardly alone chasing the cloud computing market , and enters a niche where rivals IBM ( iDataPlex ) , Dell ( CloudServer ) and Rackable ( MicroSlice / CloudRack ) have already introduced servers tailored for customers with scale - out data centers .
HP is touting the ProLiant SL 's ability to put data centers on a diet , both in terms of energy consumption and the actual weight of the racks .
The SL line with Intel Xeon 5520 processors uses 28 percent less power than the HP ProLiant DL160 Server , and its skinless design makes it lighter .
HP says the new SL2x170z is about half the weight of traditional rackmount servers , offering savings on shipping costs and allowing lower floor support requirements .
Here 's a comparison of the models and features :
HP ProLiant SL160z :
This server is optimized for workloads with large memory requirements , with 18 DDR3 DIMM sockets ( compared to 16 for the other SL models ) .
The SL160z also has two PCI slots to support large memory - cache apps .
HP ProLiant SL170z : Storage capacity is the focus of this configuration , which offers 6 large - form Serial ATA or serial - attached SCSI drives to support storage - intensive workloads like web search and database applciations .
HP ProLiant SL2x170z :
With two servers in each 1U tray , this model is designed with extra compute power for high - density HPC environments and web front - end applications .
HP says the ExSO portfolio is ideal as the inner workings of the HP POD data center container .
" We 're talking to some customers about deploying by the POD , " said Turkel .
" There 's a lot of interest in that .
But we expect most customers will want to deploy these servers in a traditional data center . "
HP is also introducing " Extreme Operational Support " for ExSO customers , which it says provides installation services specifically designed for data centers with thousands of servers .
ExSO customers can also opt for an on -site " seed inventory " of replacement parts to speed repairs .
While much of the scale - out focus is on cloud computing , HP's new product line was welcomed by the company 's partners targeting high - performance computing ( HPC ) , including Microsoft .
“ HP ’s new Extreme Scale - out portfolio directly addresses a number of key challenges faced in today ’s mega - data centers , such as efficiency in power and cooling , while maximizing performance and density per square foot , " said Vince Mendillo , director of HPC marketing for Microsoft .
New guidelines of " Unlock 5 " were released on Wednesday by the government which will ease more restrictions , including cinema halls and multiplexes which will be allowed to reopen with 50 per cent capacity from October 15 .
Schools and colleges will be allowed to reopen from October 15 , the centre said , adding the final decision on the matter will be taken by states and educational institutions .

大向さん：それをオフィシャルに出すかは悩ましい。ログ解析は今までは真剣に取り組んでいなかったが今後、中を見ていきたい。どの人が何を求めてCiNiiに来ているのか。その結果をAPIに出すと恐ろしいが・・・NIIオフィシャルとしては。「読まれているといい論文か」などの議論が起こるのは確実なので。アンオフィシャルに作ってやろうかな、とか。どういうデータがあると面白いかとか。
科学（ｒｙ：どの学会がIFが大きいかとかも揉めるけど、ぜひ裏でいいので。
岡本さん：NIIと共同研究／共同開発をすると、APIコンテストと別にそういう枠組みができれば。オープンハウスでも関連するテーマをやっている先生も出ているのでつかまえて何かやるといいのでは。また、NIIがこういうことをやってくれることで研究者の側でも「こういうデータを出せるよ」となってくれると面白い。CiNiiのデータを使うだけでは面白くない。NDLもJSTもYahoo!もGoogleもAmazonもAPIがあるのでその辺を如何にうまく組み合わせるか。
一橋大・小野さん：こんだけ人がいるんだから開発者コミュニティがなんかあるといい。ブログでもWikiでもメーリングリストでも。
大向さん：裏サイトで良ければ（笑） でもIDがあるのにAPIに入ってないとか、やってる途中にアップデートするとか、どんどんうまくいくようにしたい。MLでやるかTwitterでやるかはわからないがコミュニティづくりはやっていきたい。
岡本さん ；API提供元でコミュニティやるといろいろ面倒くさくなるので、皆さんの中に勝手に立ち上げてそこにNIIの人も勝手に参加するとかの方がいいのではないか。作る人みんなで回すコミュニティ。やる人がいればARGでちゃんと広報する。
農水・林さん：コンテストの中で実装についてのサンプル的なものも出てくればいいと思うがどうか？ それと農水のAPIも使ってほしい。あとMLはなんなら作ってもいいので興味のある人はコメントよろ。
岡本さん ：APIについて農水に触れなかったのは失態。かなり早くから公開されていた。あとメーリングリストはよろしく＞林さん。
国立教育政策研究所・江草さん：APIで今回Open Searchに対応とのことだがSRU/SRWとかも検討してほしい。
大向さん：こればかりはお約束できない。元のシステムで出来ることのうちOpenSearchで出来ないことがあれば伝えてほしいが、基本的にはシェアの大きいところからやっていく。ただNCIDを出すとか、国際標準規格になっていないけど日本独自のものをどう表現するかは・・・読みとか・・・何を出すかはご意見いただければ。
岡本さん：スピーカーから一言ずつ。
當山さん：私も応募するつもり。ネタの参考になった。
高久さん：コラボレーションのCiNiiとかで言い損ねたんだが、CiNiiがいろんなところに出るにつれて「CiNiiってなんだ？」となる。API使って新しいもの作れるのがAPIのいいところ。総合展でそういうのが出るといい。
山田さん：CiNiiは自分が仕事はじめたときはなかった。それができて、外部から検索できるようになって、APIまで公開された。驚かされる作品が今後出てくることに期待。自分でも作りたい。
嵯峨さん：今は想像もできないようなサービスがどんどん出てくると心底面白い。今回のコンテストが本当に使いやすいデザインを考えるきっかけになれば。日本のwebサイトのクオリティが変わるんじゃないかと本気で思う。少しずつでも変わっていけば岡本さんから手厳しく言われるようなサイトはなくなり、「日本も変わりましたね」と言われるようになるはず。
大向さん：１回コンテストをやるってのはこんなに大変なのかと知った。「APIと言えばAPIコンテストだよな」くらいの気持ちだったが・・・多くの方の責任を背負ってやっていきたい。「こういうこともあるよ」というのを多くの人に伝えてほしい。どれだけ違う種類の人にさらされるのがどんなサービスにとっても良くなるほとんどただ一つの方法だと思うのでみなさんよろしく。
・・・去年のワークショップ後の感想でも述べたけど、とりあえず、濃い・・・。
今回のメイン はAPIを用いたオープン化の話で、昨年以上に絞った話がされていたはずですが、にしても濃いなあ。
いやはや、いやはや 。
・・・個人的にはディスカッションで話題に上がった、CiNii側にデータを入れ込むようなことができないかということの方に興味があるわけですが・・・
なんだかんだいってあんだけ目立つ存在になると、逆にCiNiiにひっかからなければ論文とか読んでもらえない可能性が飛躍的に高まるわけで、もうGoogle八分とか他人事じゃないわけですよ。
たとえ ば" Library and Information Science " 誌の60号は理由はわかりませんがまだ雑誌記事索引に採録されておらずCiNiiにも入っていないので、目下自分の該当誌掲載論文はCiNii八分ですよ。
そこでCiNii由来のデータじゃないけど著者由来のデータも出せるよ、ってのはどうかという話はかなり興味しんしんでしたが・・・まあ、それはそれでまた別の話。
あとは自分としてはメタデータの利用の部分とか利用ログの分析とかかなり興味ありますが、それもさておき、まずは今の注目はAPIコンテストでしょう。
「 我こそは腕に覚えあり！」と言う方はぜひAPIコンテストに応募されてみるとなんか面白いことになるのではないでしょうか。
そんで便利なサービスができて公開してくれると自分も助かりますし皆助かっていいことづくめです。
・・・ディスカッションでアイディアが紹介されるたびに「これはライバルに対する牽制か？！」とびくびくしましたが・・・
ここに書かれてしまったことでさらにこれらのアイディアはそのままでは使いづらくなりましたね（爆）
まあ、NIIの方からもめったなことでなければ馬鹿やらかしてもＯＫのお墨付きも出ていることですし（ぇ）、なんか予想のはるか斜め上空を吹っ飛んで行くような作品とかが出てくることにぜひ期待したいところです。
On the heels of my Android Developer Experience article , Google released a major update to its Android mobile operating system in late April 2009 .
Version 1.5 corrected a number of shortcomings with the initial launch of the OS along with providing some exciting new enhancements .
A number of additions have been included in the 1.5 release to not only bring it to parity with its closest technical competitor , the Apple iPhone , but also to exceed the iPhone 's capabilities in key hardware feature sets .
Some of the most notable improvements include :
Onscreen soft - keyboard that rotates in both portrait and landscape mode , just like the iPhone 's touch screen keyboard .
A2DP support for high quality stereo Bluetooth audio reproduction .
Camcorder application and API for capturing 15 fps videos with the ability to save , email and directly upload to YouTube .
AppWidgets and its associated API designed to expose and extend dynamic application functionality to the Android desktop .
Live Folders provide dynamic shortcuts to application data like contact lists , video file inventory , emails , documents and more .
Additionally , there are a number of other improvements peppered throughout the existing API 's as well as the SDK and Eclipse plug-ins .
For example , the new SDK allows the easy creation of profiled Android devices , running a particular version of the OS ( 1.0 , 1.1 or 1.5 ) or allowing for the automatic creation of a virtual SD card up to 64 MB in size .
Such an operation in earlier SDK's was an error - prone chore but the 1.5 SDK release via the version 0.9.1.v200905011822-1621 Android Development Tools and Editors add - ons transform this into a simple painless dialog box .
Design - time form rendering is also now available
While one can still not ‘ paint ' a form by dragging and dropping controls onto a design surface , the updated Eclipse Android editor plug-ins accurately pre-render the layout XML code .
This considerably speeds up development time , though until a robust design - time layout editor is fully baked into the Eclipse plug-ins , an external designer like the free DroidDraw is still quite helpful and sometimes even necessary .
No More Root for You
Android Developer
Phone users will have an unfortunate surprise waiting for them after they download the 1.5 radio and system images from HTC .
For developers and their unlocked developer phones , Google also chose to bow to the pressures of the mobile telecoms by removing local root access .
As such , the section of my original article covering the ability to su to root - level file access no longer applies when running 1.5 .
The only legitimate way to gain root - level access to the file system in the 1.5 release is to tether the developer phone to a Apple OSX , Linux or Windows desktop running the Android SDK , executing the adb shell command from a terminal window and then su'ing from that connection .
While Google claims it removed root access on the phone for security reasons , it seems obvious to me that they did so in response to hacks that were appearing in the Android Marketplace ( like the WiFi Tether for Root Users application ) that effectively transformed the phone into a WiFi access point .
While I can understand the business reasons for Google appeasing the telecomms , this does prevent legitimate uses of root access ( i.e. , killing hidden and / or unauthorized background application processes ) .
It also backpedals on Google 's marketing of Android as a truly open , developer - friendly platform .
If Google wanted to advise secure practices while appeasing the developer community , it could have instead simply added a adb switch ( ex : tether the phone to a SDK - enabled PC , open a terminal window and execute something like a adb unlock command ) to open the phone 's root access back up if the developer required it .
Alas , at least for the 1.5 release , the only other way to obtain root access on the phone is to load a recompiled , unsigned and unsupported kernel such as the ‘ netfilter - enabled ' kernel the developers of the WiFi Tether for Root Users compiled , available Stickcam , Ustream , and others come to mind .
The following video might give us an idea as to what moving and re-sizing windows will be like in Snow Leopard .
The video is from a Snow Leopard build from June 2008 , so it should n’t be assumed that this video is reflective of what the final implementation will be like .
Either way , we like where Apple ’s going with this .
Meanwhile , a YouTube user by the name of “ LeopardOctober ” has posted a number of videos depicting some other featuers we can expect to see in Snow Leopard .
The videos ca n’t be embedded , but you can check them out over here .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp ’s market share of the U.S. Internet search market increased modestly in June , the first month that it fielded its new Bing search engine , according to the latest data from research firm ComScore .
Microsoft captured 8.4 percent of U.S. Internet searches in June , up from 8 percent the month before , largely at the expense of rival Yahoo Inc , whose market share fell to 19.6 percent in June from 20.1 percent in May .
Market leader Google Inc ’s share < GOOG.O was unchanged from the prior month at 65 percent .
“ Given all the publicity and advertising around Bing , we were expecting a month - on - month increase , ” said Citi analyst Mark Mahaney , in a research note issued soon after the figures were published .
“ But we think it ’s too early -- need three to four months to call a trend -- and the June move was n’t material enough to make any definitive statements as to whether Bing is a search market share game changer , ” said Mahaney .
“ We continue to view Bing as a very solid product , but one facing a very large uphill battle . ”
Microsoft has been pouring investment into its money - losing online services business in an attempt to counter Google ’s dominance in the Internet search market .
There is still a possibility that Microsoft will strike a partnership with Yahoo to combine their online advertising strengths , after Microsoft ’s aborted attempt to buy Yahoo outright last year .
Microsoft shares rose 3.1 percent to $ 23.83 on Nasdaq .
Yahoo and Google shares also rose .

Create design boundaries
While there is no limit to creativity , there does have to be a limit to the number of design iterations you produce for a client .
From both the client side and the production side , this is one of the most common areas for projects to run over budget — and we all know why .
Design is highly subjective , and often a very personal preference ; it is often difficult to intuit what a client will like .
The same applies for site architecture and the HTML / CSS / javascript layer of a web site .
Even if not quite as subjective as graphic design , your team still has to design and develop these layers for the web site to capture the interactive intentions of the designers .
This process can also take multiple iterations depending on the client ’s opinion , and the variety of browser compatibilities required , so make sure you build in safeguards against infinite tweaks during development .
There are a few things you can do to limit guesswork and keep the client constrained within your agreed upon time and budget :
Set a number on how many design rounds you will go through .
A good starting point is to provide two or three unique comps with three to view revisions for the selected comp .
While you may not always be able to stick to this , letting your client know there is a limit to the back and forth , or attaching a price tag to design round X through Y will require them to think more concretely about their design expectations .
Explain to your clients that the web site will look different depending on each users browser and settings .
Unlike print design , type - related issues such as word wrap , leading , orphans , widows , typefaces , etc , all have their limitations .
Explaining these nuances to a client will spare you from conversations that start with “ Our CEO is seeing the text differently and we need that fixed … can force the wrap after the words ‘ yada yada yada ’ to get rid of that widow ? ”
Require constructive feedback .
Clients often have a hard time speaking in design terms — “ they just know what they like and do n’t like . ”
But asking them to give specifics will not only make your job easier in providing the next round of designs , it will also help them identify what they are really looking for .
If specifics are too much to ask , a great starting exercise is to ask them for examples of sites they like and do n’t like .
This will usually give you enough information to get inside their heads and extract their ideas into web site designs .
Listen to your client , not your personal preferences .
While your company was most likely chosen for its design and development experience , ultimately your job is to provide the best possible design for your client .
Ideally , your style will be noted in the design , in the same way a record producer lends his sound to an album .
The end result is a truly collaborative and satisfactory effort from both you and the client , work that you are proud to include in your portfolio .
Be firm , but also know when to get out of the way of a disagreeable client .
Not all clients are willing to share your creative vision , and may insist on micromanaging the design process .
This happens more often than we ’d like , and often the micromanager does n’t reveal themselves until the project is later in the design phase .
If this is the case , choose your battles wisely .
Often times it is better to just get through a project , like a puppet gets through a show , and move on to the next project rather than dragging this one out over pride .
How Pelago learned this the hard way
Most designers I have ever met , including myself , graduate from design school with this naïve idea they are going to change the corporate landscape through good design .
The reality is most clients wo n’t understand ‘ good ’ design , nor will they want to .
They just want to ‘ like ’ how the site looks .
After a few years of frustration trying to convince clients of the expertise driving the design , I ’ve realized my goal as a designer is to compromise with clients when giving life to their vision .
I learned to read between the lines when interacting about design and present to them a blend of their ideas filtered through a designers lens .
The results may not be award - worthy , but nor is our audience a jury of our peers ; we are designing for our client and their customers .
In a joint venture with Buro Happold , the new project will link the holy cities of Mecca and Medina via Jeddah , Rabigh and King Abdullah Economic City on the Red Sea coast .
It will offer a faster service for the millions of pilgrims conducting the Haj and Umrah pilgrimages .
The Saudi Rail Organisation is the client for the project , which has an estimated project value of $ 6 billion .
Trains running on the 444 km line are expected to reach 300 km / h .
The project is due for completion by 2013 .
Mouzhan Majidi , Chief Executive of Foster +
Partners , said : ‘ The Haramain high - speed rail project represents a major investment in sustainable public transport by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , with potentially far - reaching social and economic consequences .
The project will foster new social and cultural connections across the Kingdom ’s western cities , and the design of the four new stations will support and symbolise this progressive approach . ’

In November last year the AJ revealed that Foster was in the running to take on one of the most high - profile projects on earth – the redevelopment of Mecca ’s central Haram mosque ( pictured ) .
I THOUGHT it was a little strange when I received separate e-mail messages from two people I knew only slightly asking me to click and see their photos on a social networking site called Tagged .
I ignored them at first , but then thought maybe I should check it out .
After all , I should keep up on what ’s hot in the social networking world , right ?
This could be the new Twitter .
That ’s when I started doing everything wrong .
I obligingly typed in my e-mail address and a password to see those photos .
Well , the photos did n’t exist , but I had unwittingly given the site “ permission ” to go through my entire e-mail contact list and send a message to everyone , inviting them to see my “ photos . ”
I found this out only when I started receiving e-mail back from people agreeing to be my friend .
I quickly realized what had happened and shot off an apologetic message explaining why I inadvertently spammed them .
Greenfield —
In these tough times , you do n't just throw stuff out .
Even if that stuff is a house .
So , when Al Emmons , 71 , needed to tear down an old two - story , four - bedroom place at the corner of W. 90th St. and Plainfield Ave. , he decided to " recycle " it .
" The contractor wanted $ 10,000 to demolish the place , " Emmons said .
" I figured there must be a better way .
Time to go green . "
With the help of his son , Emmons posted pictures of the house on Craigslist , an online advertising service .
He offered to let people come and take what they wanted .
You wo n't believe what happened next .
People lined up , sometimes 16 deep , picking the place cleaner than a Thanksgiving turkey .
They took shower curtains and piping , toilets and sinks , aluminum siding and truckloads of floorboards .
The City of Franklin claimed the rubble for fill on N. Cape Road .
Someone even dug up the onions in the backyard garden .
" One lady took the rose bush , " Emmons said .
" Someone else wanted that apple tree over there , but I think that 's too big to move . "
The house was built in 1937 .
Emmons bought it 18 months ago , hoping to fix it up .
But the place was in such bad shape that he could n't get an insurance company to cover it .
Without insurance , a bank would n't offer financing .
" Tearing it down was the only option , " Emmons said .
He sold $ 800 worth of windows but gave away everything else .
There were five layers covering that old house : wood , fake brick , aluminum siding , stucco and Lannon stone .
So there was plenty to take .
Shane Stewart , 30 , of Menomonee Falls hauled away a big pile of two - by - fours that he plans to use to build his cabin in Tomahawk .
" It 's saving me a lot of money , " Stewart said .
Rick Kusisto , 53 , of Greenfield filled five truckloads of wood siding that he plans to burn in his outdoor fire pit .
He spent hours pulling nails out of the boards and selling buckets of them at the dump .
" My kids think I 'm nuts , " Kusisto said .
" But you know what ?
We can't just throw everything away and watch all these landfills fill up .
It 's got to stop somewhere . "
That was precisely what Emmons thinks .
" My grandfather did the plaster at the Riverside Theater in 1905 , " he said .
" That 's still standing .
Things can last for a long time . "
Passing generations
Emmons , like his father , grandfather and two generations before that , became a plasterer .
Then he taught his trade to his son and grandson .
Zack , 19 , is helping his grandfather disassemble what is left of the old place .
He smiled as his grandfather pondered the scope of that old house and where a bit of it ended up .
" It makes me feel good to know that the wood planks will go to make a cabin up north , " he said .
A man named Rob Watson was so pleased with the Lannon stone that he got from Emmons ' house that he sent a picture showing how he used it to make a sculpted garden .
" It looks pretty good , " Watson said in his note .
Tim St. Pierre , who lives across the street , has been watching the parade of scavengers from a chair on his driveway .
" I think it 's fantastic , " said St. Pierre , beholding the hole that once was a house .
He got into the act , too , grabbing a piece of plastic that he plans to use as part of a telescope that he is making .
Two weeks later , all that 's left are a few floorboards , 15 bags of trash and some concrete blocks .
And many happy memories .
" I met some of the nicest people in these past few weeks , " Emmons said .
" We 'll probably be friends for life .
It 's been a delight . "
La Commission européenne a proposé , mardi 30 juin , d'interdire de fumer en 2012 dans les lieux publics , les lieux de travail et les transports .
" Chaque citoyen a le droit d'être protégé contre les méfaits du tabac " , a expliqué la commissaire à la santé , Androulla Vassiliou .
Le tabagisme passif a tué deux mille cinq cents personnes dans l'Union européenne en 2008 .
Sur la dizaine de pays de l'UE qui s'est déjà dotée d'une législation en la matière , les plus restrictifs sont l'Irlande et le Royaume - Uni , qui ont interdit de fumer dans tous les lieux publics , les bars et les restaurants .
La Bulgarie doit adopter une interdiction similaire en juin 2010 .
Sept autres pays – Italie , Malte , France , Suède , Finlande , Lettonie , Slovénie et Pays - Bas – ont autorisé la création de zones fumeurs dans les bars et restaurants .
La Grèce , championne du tabagisme avec 42 % de fumeurs , va imposer l'interdiction du tabac le 1er juillet dans les lieux publics , avec la possibilité d'espaces fumeurs .
En Autriche , l'interdiction est assortie de nombreuses possibilités de dérogation .
La Commission européenne ne se satisfait pas de ces dérogations .
Sa proposition va dans le sens d'une interdiction totale , que les ministres des pays de l'UE risquent de refuser lorsqu'ils l'examineront .
Le Monde avec AFP
What are you working on at the moment ?
There are many exciting things that keep me ( us ) busy at the Global Family Business Center .
For example , we have our open and custom programs that we are ...
Flames rise from a burning armoured vehicle .
Beijing residents confronting speechless soldiers .
The angry accusation , scrawled across the red walls of Communist party headquarters : " Down with the fascist government !
Deng is a murderer ! "
These imagescaptured near Tiananmen Square in the aftermath of the Beijing massacre , are now published for the first time by the Guardian .
Taken 20 years ago , following the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests , it is one of a number of images that have never been seen before save by friends and family of the photographer .
He now lives abroad but asked to remain anonymous in case he wishes to return to China .
The photographer who gave his pictures to the Guardian began recording the demonstrations as millions crowded Tiananmen Square pressing Chinese leaders including Deng Xiaoping for change .
" Most of the pictures I took were actually after the killings , on the morning of 4 June … I took as many as I could ; I wanted to show this to the world , " he said .
One , too graphic to be published , shows a body crushed by a tank .
Hundreds , perhaps thousands , died as the army forced its way into the city .
" To me , it was a very scary time .
Two tanks were passing on the street ; soldiers were accompanying them in a truck and one pointed a gun at me just a few metres away .
I stood there for ­several seconds .
Then they rolled on , " he recalled .
" On the first couple of days , every­thing was in chaos … they patrolled the main streets and just kept shooting .
" People were very angry … You can see civilians set fire to quite a few army vehicles . "
Not long after taking these images – on a " very , very cheap , very basic , point - and - shoot " – he left China .
But none of the news agencies he contacted wanted the photographs .
" One of them sent me a postcard to say they only used pictures taken by their staff , " he said .
He added : " I want as many people as possible to see them . "
JERUSALEM , July 19 ( Reuters ) - Legislation that Israel 's Arab citizens fear could limit their freedom of speech came a step closer on Sunday to becoming law .
The bill , proposed by a legislator from the ultranationalist Yisrael Beitenu party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman , would withhold government money from any state - supported institutions that fund activity deemed detrimental to the state .
Such activity includes " rejecting Israel 's existence as the state of the Jewish people " and supporting " armed struggle or terrorist acts " against Israel .
A ministerial committee approved the bill , clearing the way for its presentation to parliament for future debate and voting .
The legislation is a watered down version of a proposed law that would have made it a criminal offence to commemorate the " Nakba " on Israel 's independence day .
The term refers to what Palestinians describe as the catastrophe they suffered when Israel was created in 1948 .
About 1.5 million , or 20 percent , of the country 's citizens are Arabs of Palestinian origin .
Leaders of the Israeli Arab community have been outspoken in rejecting any definition of Israel as a Jewish state and in supporting their Palestinian brethren 's statehood aspirations in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Israeli Arab lawmaker Ahmed Tibi described the bill as " Lieberman 's thought police running amok and dragging the entire government with it . "
Tibi said " hatred of Arabs has caused the government to lose its mind " .
Criminal penalties in an earlier draft of the bill were removed at the request of several ministers .

The following quotations from Ben Bernanke , Chairman of the Federal Reserve are taken from the transcript of his June 3 speech to Congress .
All emphasis marks are mine .
The reader should be aware that I have very short fuse when dealing with Mr. Bernanke .
To discover why , please read “ Bernanke 's Great Lie – The “ Gold Standard ” and the Great Depression ( PART 2/2 ) ” for more details .
( emblem )
Bernanke begins :
“ The U.S. economy has contracted sharply since last fall , with real gross domestic product ( GDP ) having dropped at an average annual rate of about 6 percent during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of this year .
Among the enormous costs of the downturn is the loss of nearly 6 million jobs since the beginning of 2008 … .
According to the CBO 's estimates , by the end of 2010 , the stimulus package could boost the level of real GDP between about 1 percent and a little more than 3 percent and the level of employment by between roughly 1 million and 3 - 1/2 million jobs . ”
Nevermind the fact he is understating the actual number of job losses , but what he in effect is saying is :
“ We , the FED , have helped instigate a new Depression , and the Obama Stimulus Plan is going to fall flat on its face .
GDP dropped by way over 5 % for the past two quarters , and we would be lucky to get a 2 % increase from the Stimulus .
The economy shucked way over 6 million jobs , job losses are continuing to mount and the Obama Stimulus Plan will be lucky to get back a quarter of that .
Perhaps if the FED had not manipulated interest rates ( slide 40 ) , helped suppress the price of gold , and regulated OTC derivatives , this mess would be a lot less severe .
Sorry about that . ”
Bernanke :
“ Unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term , we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth …
Maintaining the confidence of the financial markets requires that we , as a nation , begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance . ”
My translation :
“ We are screwed because we are spending like drunken sailors !!
Those Austrian economists are right !!
Just look at the White House budget for the next ten years , and keep in mind the figures after 2011 are wildly optimistic . ”
“ See the $ 2 trillion deficit for 2009 and the $ 1 trillion deficit for 2010 and 2011 ?
That 's our doom staring back at us , although our rampant printing of money might ease the pain for the elite few a little bit .
See the tax increases in 2012 and 2013 ?
We are going to try to increase income taxes or implement carbon taxes or some other nonsense so we can jack up tax revenue by 25 % , but hopefully we can hold off on this until Obama is re-elected . ”
Source : Pages 26 - 27 of 344 in the White House 's FY 2010 budget
Bernanke : “ In this environment , we anticipate that inflation will remain low . ”
Translation : “ We do n't really have any clue what is going to happen next as we are in uncharted waters .
The credit markets are opaque , so it 's even possible we may deflate for a few years until we hit a Misesian crack - up boom and the currency fails through hyperinflation ( though true CPI / inflation is around 7 % .
However , hopefully we can get inflation instead by creating lots of lots of new money ( or “ inject liquidity ” ) and keep it from spiraling into hyperinflation .
Good thing many Americans still do not understand how the FED works . ”
Bernanke :
“ As a consequence of this elevated level of borrowing , the ratio of federal debt held by the public to nominal GDP is likely to move up from about 40 percent before the onset of the financial crisis to about 70 percent in 2011 .
These developments would leave the debt - to - GDP ratio at its highest level since the early 1950s , the years following the massive debt buildup during World War II . ”
Translation : “ My international banker and military - industrial complex friends love these profit - making opportunities .
War truly is a Racket , just like the highest - decorated officer in the history of the Marine Corps , Major General Butler , once figured out .
Too bad too few listened to him , otherwise I would not have a job . ”
Bernanke :
“ Let me close today with an update on the Federal Reserve 's initiatives to enhance the transparency of our credit and liquidity programs …
We expect to begin publishing soon a monthly report on the Fed 's balance sheet and lending programs that will summarize and discuss recent developments and provide considerable new information …
We will continue to look for opportunities to broaden the scope of the information and supporting analysis that we provide to the public . ”
Translation :
“ Crap .
I really can't believe 190 Representatives have co-signed H.R. 1207 , Ron Paul 's bill to audit the FED .
It 's a good thing my international banker friends have pretty much bought the Senate , that 17th Amendment of 1913 that my forefathers got passed along with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is a real lifesaver !
We will keep throwing sand in Congress ' and the American peoples ' eyes for as long , as hard , and as fast as we can . ”
Please check here to see if your Representative have co-signed HR 1207 , the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 .
I also recommend contacting your Senators ( the bill there is known as S 604 ) and writing directly to the Financial Services Committee at this link .
It 's time to fight back .

That spring , no true Englishman could enjoy an evening stroll without spotting a zeppelin .
“ My eye was at once attracted by a powerful light , which I should judge to have been some 1,200 feet above the ground , ” said Police Constable Kettle of his March 23 , 1909 sighting , reported in London ’s Daily Mail .
“ I also saw a dark body , oblong and narrow in shape , outlined against the stars . ”
His observation was seconded by a Miss Gill , who told the Evening News of “ a brilliant flashing light in the sky . ”
Zeppelins had been flying for nine years , but this was the first time one had been spotted over England .
Designed by Count Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin , the rigid airships were marvels of engineering : 446 feet long , built of 16 linked duralumin rings braced with wire and girders to hold bags of hydrogen in place , the whole structure covered with a cotton skin .
But they had also proven fragile , skittish , and prone to catastrophe :
Of the first 10 built , six crashed or burned .
By 1909 , only two , LZ 3 and LZ 4 , had enjoyed some success .
LZ 3 made 45 short hops totalling 2,733 miles , while in 1908 , LZ 4 made a 12 - hour trip of more than 600 miles .
But had one really flown from the zeppelin hangar at Friedrichschafen , Germany , to Peterborough , England , and back — a trip of 1,036 miles ?
British newspapers continued to report airship sightings : one in Cambridgeshire , another by two constables in Ipswich , an egg - shaped ship over Suffolk .
In May , says historian Brett Holman of the University of Melbourne in Australia , who has catalogued the reports , London newspapers carried 49 sightings , including a May 18 account of railroad signalmen seeing “ a boat or cigar shape ” over Cardiff , in Wales .
A zeppelin was even spotted over Ireland , where , according to the Belfast Telegraph , “ the aerial visitant was thousands of feet light [ high ] , and came steadily in the direction of the city . ”
The sightings caused the British terrible anxiety .
At the time , Germany and the United Kingdom were locked in an arms race .
In 1906 the British had commissioned the Dreadnought , the fastest battleship in the world , and the most sophisticated in firepower .
Germany would launch a fleet of formidable Kaiser - class battleships , but it hoped to shore up its naval power with airships .
In 1908 , German privy councillor Rudolph Martin bragged to Daily Mail readers that in the event of a war , a zeppelin fleet would “ transport 350,000 men in half an hour during the night from Calais to Dover … .
[ W ]e would conclude no peace until a German army had occupied London . ”
Popular culture reflected Germany ’s threat .
The year before the airship reports , the British magazine Pall Mall had serialized H.G. Wells ’
The War in the Air , a novel in which a fleet of German dirigibles bombs New York .
The following year , Martin elaborated on his boasts , publishing World War in the Air , a book that imagines zeppelins bombing block after block of Paris ( “ Even at high altitudes , ” says one character , “ I heard the sounds of hundreds of people crying for help ” ) and defeating England .
The British “ woke up to the idea that the Germans had created this dreadful weapon capable of breaking the [ protective ] barrier of the British navy , ” says folklorist David Clarke of the University of Sheffield . “ [ F ] or the first time in its history the island was vulnerable to invasion from the air . ”
The sightings went on for four months , with several hundred people throughout the United Kingdom reporting lights and zeppelin - like objects in the sky .
Were they on to something ?
In truth , the odds of spotting a real zeppelin over the British Isles in 1909 matched the likelihood of seeing Kaiser Wilhelm dancing the can - can at a Paris burlesque house .
“ No airships could have possibly invaded then , ” says historian Guillaume de Syon , author of Zeppelin !
Germany and the Airship , 1900 – 1939 .
The engines were reliable only in failing , he adds .
Furthermore , zeppelin pilots navigated “ by observing the roads or looking for landmarks like a church steeple , ” says de Syon , and those would have been in short supply as a London - bound zeppelin crossed the North Sea .
The journey would also carry the ship over Belgium and France in daytime ( zeppelins then did not fly at night ) , creating an international incident at a time when every visit of dirigibles to Europe ’s skies brought thousands of people streaming into the streets .
Many historians , Clarke says , think the airship scare was worked up by newspapers such as the Daily Mail , owned by Alfred Charles William Harmsworth , known as Lord Northcliffe .
The phantom airship reports spiced up the paper ’s usual fare and put pressure on the government to increase military spending ( one of Lord Northcliffe ’s preoccupations ) .
And with papers reporting airship spottings day after day , says Clarke , “ you get this huge popular delusion . ”
On the other hand , some papers were openly skeptical about the reports .
The Weekly Dispatch noted that in one case , an airship was seen at Stamford and 20 minutes later over the coast at Southend ; “ this would give the airship a speed of 210 miles per hour seeing as the two places are seventy miles apart . ”
For airships of the day , a speed of 40 mph was more like it .
Newspapers also reported cases in which witnesses refuted zeppelin sightings .
Daniel Blight told the South Wales Daily Post , “ The airship was of quarter - circle shape , with two bright lights , one at each end of it ….
I drew the attention to it of Constable No. 440C. , who was passing at the time , and no doubt he will report it . ”
But the paper also quoted Constable 440C .
saying that what he saw that night was “ a particularly bright star , and it was there again on Thursday night . ”
Morphometric and phylogenetic analyses of the fossilised remains of the jaws and teeth of a shrew discovered in a deposit in Gran Dolina de Atapuerca , in Burgos , have shown this to be a new species ( Dolinasorex glyphodon ) that has not previously been described .
The extinct animal had red teeth , was large in size compared with mammals of the same family , and was more closely related to Asian than European shrews .
Researchers from the University of Zaragoza ( UNIZAR ) have discovered fossils in the TD4 , TD5 and TD6 levels of the Gran Dolina deposit in Burgos that date to between 780,000 and 900,000 years ago , and have shown that these belong to a new genus and species of shrew ( Dolinasorex glyphodon ) , from the Soricidae family ( small insect - eating mammals ) .
" To date , all the medium to large - sized Soricidae fossils discovered in the deposits of the Sierra de Atapuerca belonged to Beremendia fissidens , a species of plio- pleistocene shrew that was distributed throughout Europe , " said Juan Rofes , lead author of the study that has been published recently in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society and a researcher in the Paleontology Department at the UNIZAR .
The morphometric and phylogenetic studies of the new species reveal a close link with the species of eastern Asia , where it could have arisen and evolved before migrating to the Iberian Peninsula .
In addition , analyses of jawbones and individual teeth of Dolinasorex glyphodon , collected between 1991 and 2007 in Atapuerca , have enabled the scientists to develop paleoecological and biogeographical hypotheses , suggesting that the animal lived in an epoch characterised by a warm , wet and relatively stable climate , and that " the origin and initial dispersal of this shrew would have been in and from the Asian continent , " adds Rofes .
A shrew with the looks of the devil
Dolinasorex glyphodon was a shrew with red teeth that belonged to the Soricinae sub -family .
By using allometric calculations ( relating to changes in the size of body parts in comparison with changes in the overall size of the animal ) , the researchers have described it as " giant " .
Compared with a modern , large - sized member of the Soricidae family , such as the water shrew ( Neomys fodiens ) , which weighs in at around 14 grams , the body mass of the extinct shrew reached 60 grams .
The study of the fossil remains of this mammal has also made it possible to discover that the shrew injected toxic saliva , in the same way that snakes do , via a " narrow and conspicuous channel " located on the inside surface of its lower incisors .
" This was a mechanism very similar to that of the modern solenodons and almiquis , which are close relatives of the shrews and live on the islands of Cuba and Haiti , " explains Rofes .
Although the remains of shrews are frequently found in paleontological deposits , their presence is due above all to the feeding habits of birds of prey , which " feed on micro-vertebrates and then regurgitate the skin , hair and bones in conglomerate pellets , " adds the expert .
Comparisons with faunal associations from many other European deposits have enabled the discoverers of Dolinasorex glyphodon to describe it as endemic , and it is the first genus of Soricidae to be described on the Iberian Peninsula to date .
However , Rofes and his team warn that " the results of this phylogenetic study are only a first step and not at all definitive , but they could be of great interest for more complete studies in the future . "
With Internet Explorer 8 out the door , Microsoft is trying to capitalise on its latest browser release with a marketing campaign outlining several benefits Internet Explorer 8 supposedly has over Chrome and Firefox .
The campaign is titled “ Get the facts “ , so I guess most of you will know what will come .
The campaign is divided into three sections : reasons to install , browser comparison , and mythbusting .
The reasons to install are n’t that crazy , it ’s just that the features and benefits listed are offset against previous versions of Internet Explorer – and let ’s face it , it ’s not hard to best Internet Explorer 6 and 7 .
Still , it does have some features in there that are not common in every browser , such as isolated tabs , which Firefox , Safari , and Opera ca n’t offer you .
The comparison is more interesting .
It takes Internet Explorer 8 and compares it to Firefox and Chrome ( disregarding Opera and Safari ) , and claims that Internet Explorer beats both of them in 7 out of 10 areas .
It claims IE8 is more secure , because it has better phishing and malware protection .
I ’m not particularly versed in those two areas , but what I do see is that they ignore the fact that there are also security threats that do not come from phishing and malware .
They also claim that IE8 has the better privacy features , which seems a bit weird to me as every browser has a “ porn button ” these days .
Web standards is an interesting one .
Microsoft claims it ’s a tie , stating that Internet Explorer 8 has the best CSS 2.1 compliance ( which is true ) , but that Firefox has more support for “ some evolving standards ” .
They do n’t even mention Chrome in this regard .
While IE8 may indeed be ahead when it comes to CSS 2.1 , overall they ’re still lacking behind the competition .
Claiming this is a tie is pretty far - fetched .
Related to this is the claim that IE8 is more compatible with more sites out there – they may even have a point on this one because IE - specific sites …
Work in IE8 .
According to Microsoft , Internet Explore 8 also wins when it comes to developer tools and manageability .
They also claim IE8 is ahead in reliability because it has both tab isolation and recovery features , adding that Firefox and Chrome have one or the other .
Customisability and performance are also ties , they claim , stating that while Firefox has a lot of extensions , IE8 comes with many of those already built - in .
The last section deals with myths around IE :
Myth # 1 : Internet Explorer is much slower than Firefox and Chrome .
Myth # 2 : Internet Explorer is less secure than Firefox .
Myth # 3 : Firefox is a richer , more adaptable browser than Internet Explorer .
Myth # 4 : Internet Explorer does n’t play well with Web standards .
It ’s an interesting campaign , but I ’m sure it wo n’t nudge any of us into the direction of IE8 .
However , less knowledgeable people on this subject could still see it as a very valid marketing campaign .
More impresive than the fact that this watch features an oxidized steel bezel made from the wreck of the Titanic , is the jaw - dropping design of the watch face .
The appropriately named Steampunk A la Grande features a number of Titanic inspired details such as the anchor inspired hour and minute hands and 80 hand - applied rivets which take its influence from the hull and boiler room of the historic ship .

July 15 , 2009 - The Soldier
At ease , you worthless sons of mothers !
I 've been asked to present our internet blog - reading public with this handsome collection of avatars , which I 'm told you can use on Steam .
I do n't mind telling you I have no idea what any of the words in that last sentence meant .
This is the problem with the youth of today : too much time inventing nonsense words , not enough time taking a bullet in the lung defending a hill .
I do n't have to know what the hell twitters and texting and body sprays are to understand that they 're not the sort of thing men should be engaged in .
Like conversations , or painting things that are n't a house .
The following is a short list of things men should be engaged in , at all times :
1. Getting a haircut
2. Yelling
3. Digesting ribs
4 . Hill defense
At any rate , enjoy your pretty portraits , Fried Green Tomatoes .
Do n't cry all over 'em when you 're painting pictures of poems tonight , or you might electrocute yourselves .
The first time I saw Barack Obama in the flesh was at Kingstree High School in South Carolina .
It was January 2008 , early in the presidential campaign , when people were still not quite sure what to make of the " skinny guy with the funny name , " as he called himself .
The crowd there were mainly African - American , which marked a change after the almost all - white audiences of Iowa and New Hampshire .
It also represented Obama 's first chance to reassure hitherto - sceptical black Americans that he was , indeed , one of their own .
In his manner , in his speaking style , he demonstrated just that – and swiftly .
" I need you not only to vote , but I need you to get cousin Pookie to vote , " he said , with a smile .
" I need Ray - Ray to vote . "
Anyone who ever doubted whether Obama was " black enough " left Kingstree that morning with no such doubts .
But the candidate did not just tickle his audience 's tummy .
He told them some uncomfortable truths too .
He told black fathers they needed to stay with their children , that parents needed to help their kids with their schoolwork , that black America needed to offer role models besides rappers and athletes .
I 've been thinking of that morning in Kingstree after reading the speech Obama gave last night to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , America 's premier civil rights organisation .
It was yet another stirring address – though we 're getting used to those .
But it also adopted the shape that now seems to characterise some of Obama 's most effective speeches and which was on display , if only in outline , all those months ago in South Carolina .
First , the president stresses his solidarity with and affinity for his audience .
To the NAACP , that came through a powerful attack on America 's long history of racism and his admission that that is far from being in the past : " the pain of discrimination is still felt in America , " he said .
That empathy came with a lot of practical talk on remedies , in employment , education and healthcare .
Once solidarity is established , Obama then feels able to tell some home truths .
Yesterday that echoed Kingstree very directly :
To parents , we can't tell our kids to do well in school and fail to support them when they get home .
For our kids to excel , we must accept our own responsibilities .
That means putting away the Xbox and putting our kids to bed at a reasonable hour .
It means attending those parent - teacher conferences , reading to our kids , and helping them with their homework .
And this :
They might think they 've got a pretty good jump shot or a pretty good flow , but our kids can't all aspire to be the next LeBron or Lil Wayne .
I want them aspiring to be scientists and engineers , doctors and teachers , not just ballers and rappers .
Imagine a white president saying these things .
He either would n't dare or , if he did , it would sound like finger - wagging and hectoring , whose motives would always be suspect .
People might well accuse such a president of racist bias , playing on a stereotype of black youth as " ballers and rappers " .
But Obama does not face that obstacle .
He is addressing black America from within .
He can speak of " our children " and " our communities " and mean it .
And people are prepared to take criticism from within – from one of their own – that they would never tolerate from an outsider .
Obama used that fact to his advantage when addressing African leaders earlier this month .
" I have the blood of Africa within me , " he told them – before launching a stern lecture on corruption and civil war , adding that Africans could not blame their former imperial masters for all their woes .
Yesterday he offered the NAACP a variation of the same theme :
Your destiny is in your hands , and do n't you forget that .
That 's what we have to teach all of our children !
No excuses !
No excuses !
He even used that approach in his landmark speech to the Muslim world last month :
My middle name is Hussein , I have Muslims in my family , I have reverence for the Islamic faith – but here 's where you are going wrong .
It is this ability , to speak to a range of constituencies his predecessors would have found out of reach – and to speak to those constituencies from within – that sets Obama apart .
And which means his presidency still retains the chance to be transformational .
I 've always loved mushrooms especially when cooked in Garlic .
The combination of the flavor and texture is amazing and they are a great compliment to many meats .
I have also used them as a starter and find that they are a great beginning to a meal .
The good thing about the recipe is that it 's very simple and adaptable .
As long as you have mushrooms and butter then you have a starter .
You can add your own herbs and spices to the recipe , or even remove the garlic if required .
Here 's the recipe :
Ingredients
1 pounds of mushrooms ( button are good , but you can use any )
One small onion .
( chopped )
2 cloves of garlic ( chopped )
1 oz butter
pint of Guinness .
Salt and pepper
cup cream ( optional )
cup Beef stock
Mustard ( optional )
Flour ( to thicken )
Cooking instructions
Clean and chop your mushrooms in slices
On low heat , melt the butter and fry the onions and garlic until they are soft .
Add the mushrooms , salt and pepper and cook for 1 minute on low .
Add the beer and increase the heat to medium , cook until the volume is reduced by half .
Stirring constantly , add the cream and stock and cook on low
To thicken : mix the flour with water until smooth and slowly stir into mushrooms .
Add Mustard ( I use French normally ) , but it 's optional !
Serving Suggestions
I use this as a starter , adding it to toast , or simply having this with some crusty bread .
It can be used as a great topper to a steak .

Hundreds of emaciated seabirds have washed up dead on beaches from Marin County to Monterey Bay , and wildlife officials said they suspect that a dip in the birds ' food supply may be killing them .
The black , iridescent Brandt 's cormorants began dying in mid-April , puzzling scientists who have seen the species thrive in recent years on the Farallon , Alcatraz and Año Nuevo islands .
Dead birds have been found in more than a dozen locations in the Bay Area , including Ocean and Baker beaches in San Francisco ; Montara and Pescadero beaches on the San Mateo County coast ; Rodeo and Muir beaches in Marin County ; and on the new east span of the Bay Bridge in Oakland .
Biologists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Department of Fish and Game are asking beachgoers not to move dead birds .
Volunteers from the Gulf of the Farallones and the Monterey Bay national marine sanctuaries are marking dead birds by clipping their wings or toes to help get a valid bird count .
About three dozen of the surviving cormorants have been sent to the International Bird Rescue Research Center in Cordelia , along with some western grebes .
Ten birds have been released to the wild .
' Emaciated and starving '
" Most of the birds brought in are emaciated and starving , " said Gerry McChesney , acting manager of the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge .
" They are having trouble finding food and are responding well to feeding . "
Seabird experts believe that the birds are suffering from a lack of food as ocean conditions have changed , triggering a crash in anchovy numbers in 2008 .
The birds , which had reached their highest numbers in years on the Central California coast , do n't appear to be ailing from viruses and bacteria , they say .
Results of tests are expected Monday .
The Brandt 's cormorant population reached about 40,000 in the region in 2007 , according to scientists .
But the birds did n't reproduce in normal numbers in 2008 .
" Usually by now , the breeding colonies are well along , " said McChesney .
" The birds should be into the egg - laying period .
But the colonies are almost empty .
The birds do n't seem to be around in very high numbers , and the birds that are around have been starving to death . "
Ocean conditions are generally good this year with vigorous upwelling of the nutrients that feed plankton and the small fish on which the seabirds feed .
They like rockfish , flatfish and anchovies .
Last year , some species of small fish were scarce , according to trawl information gathered by the National Marine Fisheries Service .
Northern anchovies - popular food for Brandt 's cormorants - hit their lowest numbers since 1990 as the bulk of the fish moved to Southern California , where they normally spawn in years of cooler waters .
Steve Ralston , research fisheries biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Santa Cruz , said it took 10 trawls to catch one anchovy last year .
In a typical year , more than 600 anchovies are caught in a trawl , he said .
" The ocean can wax and wane between warmer and cooler states , and when it 's warmer , anchovies and sardines are more plentiful in our survey .
Some of the cooler species , like calamari squid and juvenile rockfish , are less abundant , " Ralston said .
Bird and fish populations are closely linked , Ralston said .
Because young rockfish were scarcer in the ocean during the warmer years of 2005 , 2006 and 2007 , species such as seabirds and humpback whales may have switched to anchovies , said biologist Bill Sydeman , director of the Farallon Institute of Advanced Ecosystem Research in Petaluma .
When anchovy numbers dropped around the Farallones last year , the birds may have been unable to find food , which would have triggered reproductive failures of the Brandt 's cormorants , Sydeman said .
Other possibilities
There could be other reasons , such as their population reaching the maximum number that the ecosystem can support , he said .
Or perhaps more cormorants are being found dead because there are more of them , he said .
Jan Roletto , research coordinator for the Gulf of the Farallones sanctuary , said the disappearance of anchovies is a valid explanation .
But as she waits for results of pathogen tests , she is looking at other environmental factors .
" We 're just speculating right now , " she said .
A team led by Yale University researchers has created the first rudimentary solid - state quantum processor , taking another step toward the ultimate dream of building a quantum computer .
They also used the two - qubit superconducting chip to successfully run elementary algorithms , such as a simple search , demonstrating quantum information processing with a solid - state device for the first time .
Their findings will appear in Nature 's advanced online publication June 28 .
" Our processor can perform only a few very simple quantum tasks , which have been demonstrated before with single nuclei , atoms and photons , " said Robert Schoelkopf , the William A. Norton Professor of Applied Physics & Physics at Yale .
" But this is the first time they 've been possible in an all - electronic device that looks and feels much more like a regular microprocessor . "
Working with a group of theoretical physicists led by Steven Girvin , the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics & Applied Physics , the team manufactured two artificial atoms , or qubits ( " quantum bits " ) .
While each qubit is actually made up of a billion aluminum atoms , it acts like a single atom that can occupy two different energy states .
These states are akin to the " 1 " and " 0 " or " on " and " off " states of regular bits employed by conventional computers .
Because of the counterintuitive laws of quantum mechanics , however , scientists can effectively place qubits in a " superposition " of multiple states at the same time , allowing for greater information storage and processing power .
For example , imagine having four phone numbers , including one for a friend , but not knowing which number belonged to that friend .
You would typically have to try two to three numbers before you dialed the right one .
A quantum processor , on the other hand , can find the right number in only one try .
" Instead of having to place a phone call to one number , then another number , you use quantum mechanics to speed up the process , " Schoelkopf said .
" It 's like being able to place one phone call that simultaneously tests all four numbers , but only goes through to the right one . "
These sorts of computations , though simple , have not been possible using solid - state qubits until now in part because scientists could not get the qubits to last long enough .
While the first qubits of a decade ago were able to maintain specific quantum states for about a nanosecond , Schoelkopf and his team are now able to maintain theirs for a microsecond - a thousand times longer , which is enough to run the simple algorithms .
To perform their operations , the qubits communicate with one another using a " quantum bus " - photons that transmit information through wires connecting the qubits - previously developed by the Yale group .
The key that made the two - qubit processor possible was getting the qubits to switch " on " and " off " abruptly , so that they exchanged information quickly and only when the researchers wanted them to , said Leonardo DiCarlo , a postdoctoral associate in applied physics at Yale 's School of Engineering & Applied Science and lead author of the paper .
Next , the team will work to increase the amount of time the qubits maintain their quantum states so they can run more complex algorithms .
They will also work to connect more qubits to the quantum bus .
The processing power increases exponentially with each qubit added , Schoelkopf said , so the potential for more advanced quantum computing is enormous .
But he cautions it will still be some time before quantum computers are being used to solve complex problems .
" We 're still far away from building a practical quantum computer , but this is a major step forward . "
Doom hack .
I ’ve gotten PRDoom running on the device .
PRDoom is an open source doom clone that uses SDL for its rendering backend .
The Palm Pre ’s GUI , Luna , utilizes a framebuffer .
The SDL backend we used was directfb .
The Palm Pre ’s rootfs , based on openembedded , had directfb , but the openembedded repositories did not have any versions of SDL which linked against the directfb provided by palm .
The other option was to use fbdev , but I could n’t get it working , so I moved on quickly .
In order to control the rootfs , and libraries , I built a debian rootfs using debootstrap , and was able to install many components not available via ipkg .
Getting directfb working was actually fairly trivial , because palm uses it for their testing .
The /etc/ event.d/LunaSysMgr file , it had the line : exec / var / mft/usr / bin/ted -m –dfb:no-vt –dfb:no-cursor –dfb:bg-color=00000000 –dfb:pixelformat=ARGB .
I was able to dervice the directfb options from there .

WASHINGTON  House Democrats will ask the wealthiest Americans to help pay for overhauling the health care system with a $ 550 billion income tax increase , the chairman of the tax - writing Ways and Means Committee said Friday .
The proposal calls for a surtax on individuals earning at least $ 280,000 in adjusted gross income and couples earning more than $ 350,000 , said the chairman , Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York .
It would generate about $ 550 billion over 10 years to pay about half the cost of the legislation , Mr. Rangel said .
As the proposal envisions it , the rest of the cost would be covered by lower spending on Medicare , the government health plan for the elderly , and other health care savings .
With the economy still hobbled and Republicans already sharpening their tax - and - spend attack line , the proposal is perhaps the clearest expression yet of the mandate that Democrats believe they won last November , when voters expanded Democratic majorities in Congress and sent Barack Obama to the White House .
“ They just wanted to be able to use it , ” Mr. Belt said .
The garbage containers , which he described as “ newish , ” were cleaned and lined in plastic , and a filtration system was installed , as on a regular above - ground pool .
Mr. Belt ’s wife , Antonia , stitched together the coverings for the cabanas ; the furniture came from Ikea .
The main cost was the wood for the deck and the water : about 18,000 gallons , delivered from a New Jersey aquifer for $ 1,200 .
“ I tried to do it so that even if you had to rent one , you could do a stand - alone Dumpster , a grill and chair for under $ 1,000 , ” Mr. Belt said .
Copycats are welcome , because Macro - Sea itself is using the project as a template for a larger idea : turning eyesore strip malls into artsy community destinations , with Dumpster pools and other indie attractions .
“ I thought if we could get people to come here and swim in a Dumpster , I could probably use the same aesthetic sensibility ” to get people  and , not incidentally , better retailers  to come to a dingy strip mall , Mr. Belt said .
The company hopes to open its first repurposed shopping center in Atlanta this fall , ideally with dozens of pools in the parking lot that visitors can rent for the day .
While the project is conceptually simple  get a bunch of trash containers , clean and seal them , fill with water , jump in  there were a lot of details to finesse .
The coarse edges inside the containers were filed down , and underneath the liners , the bottoms were covered in sand , for soft landings .
Tightly packed sandbags double as benches along the walls , and pool toys and kid-friendliness provide an intentional counterpoint to the neighborhood grit .
Politico has a scoop :
The American Conservative Union asked FedEx for a check for $ 2 million to $ 3 million in return for the group ’s endorsement in a bitter legislative dispute , then flipped and sided with UPS after FedEx refused to pay .
For the $ 2 million plus , ACU offered a range of services that included : “ Producing op - eds and articles written by ACU ’s Chairman David Keene and / or other members of the ACU ’s board of directors .
( Note that Mr. Keene writes a weekly column that appears in The Hill . ) ”
This reminded me of another story that was sort of disappeared from polite discussion : Think Tank ’s Ideas Shifted as Malaysia Ties Grew :
For years , the Heritage Foundation sharply criticized the autocratic rule of former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad , denouncing his anti-Semitism , his jailing of political opponents and his “ anti - free market currency controls . ”
Then , late in the summer of 2001 , the conservative nonprofit Washington think tank began to change its assessment : Heritage financed an Aug. 30 - Sept. 4 , 2001 , trip to Malaysia for three House members and their spouses .
Heritage put on briefings for the congressional delegation titled “ Malaysia : Standing Up for Democracy ” and “ U.S. and Malaysia : Ways to Cooperate in Order to Influence Peace and Stability in Southeast Asia . ”
Heritage ’s new , pro-Malaysian outlook emerged at the same time a Hong Kong consulting firm co-founded by Edwin J. Feulner , Heritage ’s president , began representing Malaysian business interests .
The for - profit firm , called Belle Haven Consultants , retains Feulner ’s wife , Linda Feulner , as a “ senior adviser . ”
And Belle Haven ’s chief operating officer , Ken Sheffer , is the former head of Heritage ’s Asia office and is still on Heritage ’s payroll as a $ 75,000 - a- year consultant .
Despite everything that ’s happened , I do n’t think many people grasp just how raw , how explicit , the corruption of our institutions has become .
The Financial Times reports that the House Oversight committee wants to have a little chat with the Fed over the widespread reports that it muscled BofA more than a tad to complete its acquisition of Merrill after the Charlotte bank learned that the securities firm had posted large losses in December and tried to exit the deal .
What is noteworthy about this move is that this is apparently the first time in 20 years that Congress has subpoenaed the Fed .
Some will lament the supposed loss of Fed independence , but Willem Buiter has already tagged the Fed as the second least independent major central bank , surpassed only by the Bank of Japan .
As we noted in an earlier post , the Fed began selling out its vaunted independence in the Greenspan era , when the Maestro made nice to the Clinton administration for an unidentified quid pro quo .
presumably reappointment as Fed chairman .
And Bernanke has n’t simply been coordinating policy with the Treasury , but has instead acted as an off balance sheet vehicle for the Treasury , enabling it to circumvent budgetary constraints and evade the need for Congressional approval ( and oversight too ) .
So while it is a positive step to see this shot across the Fed ’s bow , Congress peculiarly is not going after the elephant in the room , namely the Fed ’s increasing role , as Buiter put it , as quasi- fiscal agent of the Treasury .
From the Financial Times :
Much of South Carolina 's Republican establishment is seeking Mark Sanford 's resignation .
S.C. GOP : Sanford must go
Gov. Mark Sanford ’s long and emotional interview with The Associated Press Tuesday appears to have been the final straw for South Carolina ’s Republican establishment , much of which is now actively seeking his resignation .
While Sanford seemed to have weathered the storm in the brutal days immediately following his admission of an affair with an Argentine woman , his support has cratered in the wake of the AP interview in which he talked of his “ tragic ” and “ forbidden ” love for his “ soul mate ” and admitted to having “ crossed lines ” with a handful of other women .

Fourteen GOP state senators — more than half the Senate Republican caucus — have already called for Sanford ’s resignation , joining a list that , as of Wednesday afternoon , included 11 Republican members of the state House and six of the state 's biggest newspapers .
And three leading South Carolina Republican officeholders , including the state ’s two U.S. senators , called Sanford today for what sources close to the lawmakers described as frank conversations about the governor ’s ability to carry out his job .
Sens. Jim DeMint and Lindsey Graham , as well as Rep. Gresham Barrett , talked to Sanford Wednesday , according to three top South Carolina GOP sources who confirmed the calls , but were hesitant to say whether the lawmakers had directly urged Sanford to resign .
But Wednesday night , Barrett told the Associated Press that he had in fact asked Sanford to step down during their conversation .
Two Barrett advisers subsequently confirmed the resignation request .
In doing so , Barrett becomes the first member of the South Carolina congressional delegation to publicly say he thinks the governor should quit .
Of the three , Graham is probably closest to Sanford , serving as godfather to the governor ’s youngest son .
Barrett , who represents an Upstate district , is running for governor next year .
“ The conversations are clearly geared toward doing the right thing , ” said one top South Carolina Republican .
Another top Republican in the state said of the governor : “ His support has collapsed . ”
By placing private phone calls to the governor , the GOP sources suggested , their hope is for him to step down without further public pressure .
“ Two days ago there were very few people calling for his resignation , ” said Rep. Bob Inglis ( R - S.C. ) , who has not called for Sanford ’s resignation .
“ It came out of that interview . ”
Even state Sen .
Tom Davis , the close friend Sanford mentioned frequently in his June 24 press conference , stopped short of backing the governor .
“ Before any important decision I make comes due diligence , and I owe it to my constituents to perform that due diligence before taking a public position on an issue as important as whether to call for the resignation of a duly - elected statewide official , ” Davis said in a statement Wednesday after meeting with Sanford .
“ I expect to form my official position very shortly . ”
Republican Harvey Peeler , the state Senate majority leader , said the Sanford “ romance novel ” is beginning to wear on lawmakers who had previous held back on calling for the governor ’s resignation .
“ The pressure is mounting and he just keeps talking and changing his story almost hourly , ” said Peeler , who in an interview with POLITICO referred to Sanford as “ Governor Fabio . ”
“ I ’m shocked that he ’s stayed in office this long , ” he added .
State GOP Chairwoman Karen Floyd , who had been quiet on whether Sanford should resign , released a statement Wednesday acknowledging that “ there is clearly a growing view that the time may have come for Gov.
Sanford to remove himself and his family from the limelight , so that he can devote his efforts full - time to repairing the damage in his personal life . ”
Republican state Sen. Larry Grooms , who describes himself as a longtime Sanford friend and ally , told POLITICO he called the governor following the AP interview to tell him that he would be calling on Sanford to resign .
“ Your effectiveness as governor has weakened to such a point ... that we wo n’t be able to pass any of your legislative agenda , ” Grooms said he told Sanford over the phone in explaining why he planned to join those calling on the governor to step down .
“ Senator , you need to understand something , ” Sanford answered , according to Grooms .
“ This is a story about true love . ”
Grooms then told Sanford that he “ was destroying the Republican Party , the party of personal responsibility , ” to which the governor did not respond .
In hanging up , Grooms told the governor that he would keep him in his prayers .
“ He asked me to continue to do that , ” Grooms said .
Sanford has shown no signs that he is willing to step down .
“ The governor has given a full and truthful account , and he is finished discussing this matter , ” said Sanford spokesman Joel Sawyer .
“ He is focused on being governor , on rebuilding his marriage and on building back the trust of South Carolinians . ”
“ This thing is real fluid , ” said Katon Dawson , an influential former state party chairman who has not called on Sanford to resign .
“ The facts are that the governor of South Carolina does not have to resign today and does not have to resign tomorrow .
Those are the facts , and I deal in facts . ”
But many state Republicans have their doubts that Sanford ’s focus really is on South Carolina .
“ His physical presence may be in South Carolina , but I think his mind is in Argentina , ” Grooms said .
One top South Carolina political insider said the unusually personal details of the interview have been “ very harmful ” to the governor .
“ The last thing you need to do is say you ’re going to come clean and then not come clean .
It ’s this extraction of information every day that is causing this erosion of trust , ” the insider said .
“ You would think that at the press conference that he would have vaguely confessed to unfaithfulness and said , ‘ The rest is between my wife and I ’ and then walked away . ”
“ It seems like he is coming unhinged , ” the longtime South Carolina pol added .
“ He needs to really go take a hike this time . ”
Numerous South Carolina
Republicans were so taken aback by the governor ’s remarks Tuesday that they speculated about Sanford ’s mental health after watching his life and political career unravel in short order .
“ I think it ’s obvious that he needs some help , ” said GOP state Sen. Larry Martin .
“ He needs to quit talking to reporters and go get some professional help . ”
Martin said the interview may have been “ geared to pre-empting some other information that might come out ” but turned into a disaster for Sanford .
“ I think he was trying to do some damage control and it just got out of hand , ” he said .
“ I ca n’t imagine his staff would have ever agreed to him doing that if they did n’t think there was some upside to it . ”
Martin added : “ I ’m just sad for him . ”
Peeler also said the interview left him personally concerned about the governor .
“ Those were the ramblings of a troubled man , ” he said .
“ I ’m not a lawyer .
I ’m not a doctor .
But I know when I see it .
That man needs help . ”
Asked about the press conference , Inglis said Sanford ’s “ close aides do n’t need all those details and the state certainly does n’t need all those details , ” adding that any media handlers would “ be telling him ‘ you do n’t need to tell them all that . ’ ”
The GOP congressman said he was not particularly disturbed by Sanford ’s comments to The Associated Press because “ Mark tries to not be affected by being governor .
So it ’s his usual nonaffected behavior that is getting him in this case . "
Inglis said he believes that because of the scandal , Sanford could have his best 18 months as governor if he chose to stay in office .
Sanford ’s tenure could now be more effective , the congressman said , because of “ the humility that can come out of this humiliation . ”
But after watching the avalanche of statements on Wednesday calling for the governor ’s resignation , GOP state Rep.
Lanny Littlejohn estimated that Sanford will likely only be able to hang on to his seat for another week , an outcome he would not have believed only a few days ago .
“ I ca n’t believe all this is happening .
It ’s like a dream .
It ’s unreal , ” he said .
“ It ’s just gotta be the shock of the year that things are playing out the way they are . "

Damn , Rockstar is full of surprises .
Who could have guessed that the developer ’s franchise - built on gritty crime , bloody violence , hardened characters and grossly exaggerated stereotypes - would debut an entry with words like “ ballad ” and “ gay ” right in the title ?
When the first downloadable content starred leather - clad biker gangs listening to classic rock , who could foresee a second expansion ’s logo with rainbow lettering and disco ball sparkles ?
Actually … everyone .
If you were paying close enough attention during the events of GTA IV and The Lost and Damned , as a matter of fact , you could predict a huge portion of The Ballad of Gay Tony , including everything from heroes and villains to locations and specific missions .
Skeptical ?
Here are 13 things we already know .
The protagonist is not Gay Tony .
Read enough online news stories in GTA IV and the name Tony Prince should be familiar .
A nightclub owner and Liberty City celebrity , he is often quoted for his dissatisfaction with the current quality of after hours entertainment in the metropolis .
Not enough drugs and orgies in post - 9/11 America , apparently .
The reports also make his affiliation with the Ancelottis – the weakest of the local Italian Mafia ’s five leading families – abundantly clear .
You , however , will play as Luis Fernando Lopez , a Dominican gangster and Gay Tony ’s hired bodyguard , bouncer and full - time assistant .
Despite the provocative title , your character will be heterosexual .
Rockstar loves to court controversy , and is turning out to be surprisingly progressive with their games ’ recent subject matter .
Apparently , though , even the developer has some inhibitions .
While you will no doubt be surrounded by homosexual characters in The Ballad of Gay Tony – some hopefully less stereotypical and predictably portrayed than others – the lead man is straight .
How can we be sure ?
Because the most obviously gay character in the original Grand Theft Auto IV , Bernie Crane , said so .
In the first expansion , you ’re asked to wiretap the vehicle of a local politician , Bryce Dawkins … who , contradictory to his “ family values ” platform , is having an affair with Bernie .
Once you ’ve laid the trap , you get to call a secret government number and listen to the taped conversations .
One of them goes like this :
Niko Bellic and Johnny Klebitz will definitely make appearances .
This is 100 % guaranteed .
In fact , you ’ve already seen the three men together , in both the original GTA IV storyline and in the second expansion .
Niko , Johnny and Luis have played crucial , though different , parts in at least four previous missions .
They ’ve even appeared in many of the same cutscenes .
Because of this frequent overlap , we can easily predict several of Luis ’s missions in The Ballad of Gay Tony .
Let ’s begin …
Mission Prediction # 1 : Bank Robbery Escape
Everybody who ’s played through GTA IV remembers Three Leaf Clover , the balls - hard bank - robbery mission undertaken by Niko and the McReary brothers .
What you might not remember , however , is that Luis is one of the hostages during that robbery .
Seriously , you can even kill him while he ’s cowering on the floor .
The question is , what was Luis doing in the bank when the McRearys hit ?
Was he running an errand , or did someone send him there ?
Was he planning to rob the place with a note before the hardcore criminals rolled in , or did he have advance knowledge of their heist ?
It ’s possible that , in all the confusion following the robbery , Luis ’ plan was to grab something important and book it out without anyone noticing .
Whatever his reasons , Luis ’ appearance in the Bank of Liberty is more than just coincidence .
Whether it ’s as an innocent bystander or a behind - the - scenes schemer , you can bet that trying to escape from the storm of cops and gunfire that descends on the bank will be part of Luis ’ story .
Mission Prediction # 2 : Diamond Deal
When we learned the identity of GTA IV ’s third protagonist , it became increasingly clear that the real story of the game was n’t about Niko ’s immigration and disillusionment , or about Johnny Klebitz and his gang of aging thugs .
No , the real story is about a little sack of diamonds and the people who are willing to kill and be killed to get their hands on them .
We ’ve already seen how the diamonds make their way from the Platypus ( the cargo liner Niko rides in on ) to Liberty City ; Gay Tony heads down to the docks to buy them from the men who smuggled them in .
As Luis , it ’ll be your task to escort him down to the docks , and then clean up the mess when the deal is ruined by Johnny Klebitz and his bikers ( who in turn were sent by scummy Mafioso Ray Boccino ) .
While Johnny chases down the limo carrying the diamonds , it ’ll be up to you , as Luis , to kill every last Lost biker that stays behind to try and murder you .
Mission Prediction # 3 : Museum Ambush
Ever wonder who the guy is that suddenly ambushes Niko , Johnny and Isaac Roth during the Museum Piece / Collector ’s Item mission , killing Mori Green and completely ruining the diamond deal ?
We know now that it ’s Luis , who ’s most likely there to get the diamonds back for Gay Tony .
As Luis , you ’ll likely have to sneak up to the window from which he ambushes the deal , after which you ’ll get to shoot the place up and make off with the diamonds while Niko and Johnny blast their way through your men .
While the carnage erupts downstairs , you ’ll need to make your escape through the roof and take down any of Isaac ’s men who get in your way before hauling ass to safety .
Mission Prediction # 4 : Ransom Return
Remember Gracie Ancelotti , the mobster ’s daughter you kidnapped as Niko ?
When it came time to exchange her for the game ’s now - iconic diamonds , it was n’t her father who showed up to make the handover – it was her friend Gay Tony , accompanied by level - headed Luis .
When Tony and Packie start arguing , it ’s Niko who shuts them up , and Luis who suggests a fair way to trade the diamonds for the girl .
Just then , however , Russian crime boss Rodislav Bulgarin and his thugs show up to snatch both Gracie and the diamonds .
In the ensuing chaos , the diamonds are thrown into a passing truck , but it ’s unclear what happens to Gracie , Bulgarin , Luis and Gay Tony .
However , it ’s pretty likely that Luis kills Bulgarin in the ensuing violence , if only for calling him Gay Tony ’s “ Dominican bitch . ”
Who knew that vinegar could do so much ?
It serves a purpose in just about every room of the house , and there are dozens of household ( and personal ) products that vinegar can replace , as you will see below .
It 's cheaper , better for the environment , and better for your health and home ( in eliminating unnecessary chemicals ) .
All - Purpose Cleaners
Vinegar in general is a natural ( and inexpensive ) disinfectant .
It can be used on almost anything except marble .
So stick it in a spray bottle and get to work !
Here are a few more " recipes " for various cleaning purposes .
( See also : Household Cleaning Hacks that Save You Money )
All - purpose cleaner : 2 parts vinegar , 1 part water .
Extra dirty spots :
Scour dirty areas with baking soda , then spray the all purpose cleaner ( recipe above ) over the area and wipe clean .
Floor cleaner : Brew a cup of peppermint tea ( use 1 tea bag : one cup for you , one for the floor ) .
Squeeze half a lemon in to the floor mix , and add 1 cup of vinegar .
Mop away with your solution ; the vinegar disinfects , the tea has antibacterial properties and removes marks , and the lemon freshens and disinfects .
Pee stains on carpet ( presumably from pets ) :
Blot up the initial stain , flush it with water , then apply equal parts vinegar and cool water .
Blot it all up , rinse , and let dry .
This will eliminate odors and stains .
Hard water stains and mineral deposits :
Allow a cloth soaked in vinegar to sit on a hard water stain ( for example behind your faucet ) or mineral deposit for a few hours .
Wipe clean .
Appliance cleaning : Clean your coffee maker or laundry machine or dishwasher by running vinegar through it , followed by water .
This reduces soap buildup and keeps everything in working order .
In The Kitchen
Remove labels from glass jars : Saturate the labeled area in vinegar and scrape the stickiness right off .
Dirty pot bottoms and cooking utensils :
Fill the pot with enough water to cover the stain , add 1 cup of vinegar , and boil rapidly for 5 minutes .
Let cool , then scrub the stains off .
While you 're at it , put your stainless steel cooking utensils in the pot to get them sparkly clean too .
Fruit stains on hands :
Had a little too much fun making that cherry pie or berry salad ?
Just rub your hands with vinegar to remove the stains .
Coffee stains on china :
Use a mixture of salt and vinegar to clean coffee stains from china .
Wooden cutting boards : Wooden cutting boards are great , except they can be a hothouse for bacteria ( especially if grooves have been cut into the board with use ) .
Disinfect it regularly with vinegar to keep it ( and your food ) clean .
Veggie maintenance : Clean and crisp up your veggies by soaking them in a mixture of water and a tablespoon or so of vinegar .
Any bugs lingering on your produce will float away , and your soggy celery will come to life again ( depending on how far gone it was to begin with ) .
Smelly onion hands : Eliminate onion odor off your hands by rinsing them in vinegar .
This also apparently works with other stinky parts of your body that soap is n't cutting through , such as underarms .
Clean sticky scissors : Sometimes those scissors get so gummy you can't even make them work .
Just wipe them down with vinegar , and they 'll be like new again .
Laundry
Fabric softener :
There are a few fabric softener strategies you can play with .
Add equal parts vinegar and baking soda , OR just ½ a cup of vinegar to your wash when you would add fabric softener ( final rinse cycle ) .
Line dried towels will come out softer with a vinegar - based softener .
Water :
You can also add 1 / 2 to 1 cup of vinegar to your wash water , which does the following :
Reduces the amount of soap you need to use
Reduces lint
Brightens colors , and stops them from running
Acts as a rinse aid
Keeps the washing machine running clean and well
Stain removal :
Use vinegar on stains before washing to remove stubborn ones like perspiration , fruit , mustard , and coffee .
In The Garden
Kill grass and weeds :
Pour or spray full strength vinegar on grass or weeds poking through your driveway or rearing their heads in other unsavory places .
In The Car
Frost - free windows :
If you know a chilly night is on the make , you can ensure that your windows will be frost - free when you wake up in the morning .
Simply mix 3 parts vinegar to 1 part water , and coat your windows with the mixture the night before .
In The Bathroom
Kill soap scum :
Wiping a scummy area with vinegar and rinsing with water will do as good a job as any at attacking your bathroom shower grime .
If the scum is particularly stubborn , scrub with baking soda ( a great natural abrasive ) after wiping with vinegar .
Rinse with water .
Unclog your shower head : Unscrew it , throw it into a pot of equal parts vinegar and water and boil for a few minutes to loosen deposits that are blocking your shower head .
Personal Use
Hair rinse :
If vinegar removes soap scum on your tiles , it stands to reason that it will also remove soap scum on your hair .
Rinse with a cup filled with ½ a cup of warm water and ½ a cup of vinegar , and your locks will be shiny and free of buildup .
Dandruff treatment :
Using the same technique as the hair rinse above but with a higher concentration of vinegar ; also acts as an effective dandruff treatment .
Acne treatment : Apply equal parts vinegar and water to problem areas .
Facial toner : Using vinegar as toner is a great ( and inexpensive ) alternative to using alpha hydroxyl based products .
Athletes foot ( and other fungus ) : Apply full - strength vinegar to the affected area twice daily until symptoms abate .
Miscellaneous Uses
Eliminate smoke odor : Simply put a bowl of vinegar in the offending room near the offending source .
Smoke odors be gone !
Air freshener :
If you would like to reduce icky smells but would like a nicer room smell than vinegar , add some fragrant spices ( like cardamom ) to your bowl of vinegar and leave it in a warm corner of the room .
Chrome polish :
Use full strength vinegar with soft cloth to make that chrome shine .
Insect traps : Vinegar is an active ingredient used in various insect and pest traps .
Not enough reason to stock up on vinegar ?

The move out of dollars would be a remarkable policy shift .
Japan 's opposition party says it would refuse to buy American government bonds denominated in US dollars , if elected .
The chief finance spokesman of the Democratic Party of Japan , Masaharu Nakagawa , told the BBC he was worried about the future value of the dollar .
Japan has been a major buyer of US government bonds , helping the US finance its Federal budget deficits .
But , he added , it would continue to buy bonds only if they were denominated in yen - the so - called samurai bonds .
" If it 's [ in ] yen , it 's going to be all right , " Mr Nakagawa said in an interview with the BBC World Service .
" We propose that we would buy [ the US bonds ] , but it 's yen , not dollar . "
However observers say that , while the move would be a remarkable policy shift , it was unlikely that Mr Nakagawa 's party will win the forthcoming election , due before mid-September , despite the unpopularity of the ruling Liberal party .
Risk
Such yen - denominated bonds would mean that America , rather than Japan , would be exposed to the risk of future falls in the value of the US currency .
Mr Nakagawa 's demand echoes doubts about the future of the dollar expressed earlier this year by the Chinese Premier and the governor of China 's central bank .
Both China and Japan have run large trade surpluses with the US for many years and have tended to invest the dollar surpluses in safe US Treasury bonds .
But both countries are worried that the value of these foreign exchange holdings could be jeopardised by a fall in the dollar .
Beijing , for example , has said it will issue its own bonds to fund any further lending to the International Monetary Fund and is believed to be diversifying out of dollars and into euros .
Japan faces a particularly difficulty because unlike China , its currency has been floating freely on international markets and the fall in the value of the dollar , relative to the yen , has hit Japanese exporters hard .
However a rapid exit from holding dollars would weaken the US currency further , making Japanese exports even more expensive in the US .
This means that any decision to switch to samurai bonds would have to be carefully managed so as to not exacerbate the situation , economists say .

An end to the " Snow War " ?
Thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court , Arizona skiers may soon be spared the inconvenience of living in one of the Union ’s warmest and driest states .
Last week the high court removed the final legal hurdle blocking Arizona Snowbowl from making artificial snow with reclaimed sewage effluent on the San Francisco Peaks — a plan which 13 southwestern tribes say will desecrate their sacred mountain .
In a long - running lawsuit filed against the the U.S. Forest Service ( the ski center 's landlord ) the Navajo and several other tribes had sought protection under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , arguing that to make snow on the mountain would decrease the " spiritual fulfillment " tribal members get from practicing their religion .
By declining , without comment , to act on the tribes ' appeal of a lower court ruling , the Supreme Court effectively gave Snowbowl the go - ahead .
Lawyers for the tribes say they still have several options ( which appear to be long shots ) for blocking Snowbowl .
For now , though , Snowbowl is free to busy itself with that time - honored Western tradition : moving water uphill toward money .
Now that the Supreme Court has spoken with its silence , the ski center — which spent $ 1.5 million on legal fees ( all the while bemoaning its lack of “ predictable ” revenue ) — will work out a schedule with Coconino National Forest to proceed with the $ 13 million expansion .
It includes a 14 - mile pipeline , big pumps , snowmaking guns , a 10 million - gallon holding pond , additional ski runs , a snow - play area and -- get this -- a 2,500 square foot Native American cultural and education center .
Other results to look for :
-- The Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce — which raised money to help cover Snowbowl ’s legal tab — will no doubt congratulate itself on a job well done .
After that , the Chamber can begin worrying about a boycott from the neighboring tribes it has offended — including the tens of thousands of Navajos who shop ( at least for now ) in Flagstaff .
-- Flagstaff ’s City Council — which approved the sale of reclaimed water from the city 's sewage treatment plant — can start reading the angry letters that will arrive from constituents asking the Council to honor Native American cultures by reneging on the deal with Snowbowl .
-- Environmentalists who objected to the plan because of pharmaceuticals and other micro-pollutants in the water can watch the science unfold , to see what these things will actually do to the alpine environment and to human health .
-- The Forest Service can continue trying to fulfill its unenviable , contradictory , near - impossible multiple - use mission -- while attracting criticism from writers like me .
-- Local whites who wrote anonymous , nasty comments on the local newspaper ’s web page can cling to their stereotypes of Indians as hypocrites who would build a casino on the Peaks if they could get away with it .
And indigenous people who look at relations with the United States government as a history of cultural genocide can say , “ I told you so . ”
But will this be the end of the story ?
I doubt it .
Such battles over the use of public lands may be waged in the desiccated language of environmental assessments and lawsuits , but they are won and lost by beating hearts .
And the hearts of Snowbowl 's opponents , I know , are resolute .
For this reason -- regardless of the high court ’s decision -- I cannot predict an end to this fight .
The swift movement by Republicans -- with Ensign ’s consent -- to clear him out of Senate leadership is a sign that the party wants nothing to do with another sex scandal as it tries to slow down the massive Obama agenda and focus on health care , energy and other pressing issues .
Ensign has said he will remain focused on his Senate duties representing Nevada , but his days as a rising star in GOP politics are clearly done .
“ One thing is for sure , he cannot go any further in Senate leadership , or higher in electoral politics now , ” said one Republican Senate aide ...
Before this announcement , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) said he saw no reason to remove Ensign from his leadership spot , but when asked whether Ensign could still be an effective spokesman for the party at this point , Graham said , " No . "
No one could believe that ambitious reactionary John Ensign -- who , until today , was harboring delusions of running for president in 2012 -- missed the Senate 's one roll call today , a vote to shut off a de facto filibuster by the Senate 's 3 biggest pests ( DeMint , Coburn and Bunning ) on S. 1023 a tourism bill that he was cosponsoring .
Every single senator -- even knee - jerk obstructionist kooks like Burr , Cornyn and Inhofe -- voted to shut off debate on a bill meant to " promote leisure , business , and scholarly travel to the United States . "
Needless to say , the bill is a huge priority for the collapsing Las Vegas tourist industry .
But Ensign was in Las Vegas instead of in DC .
He decided it would be politically advantageous to make the big announcement of his extramarital affair -- with a staffer at his PAC , so paid for by Republican donors -- in his home town with his poor wife at his side .
( He claims he was being blackmailed ; so sordid .)
The wife is n't angry because he paid the woman off last year and got her to go away , at least temporarily .
Ensign was one of the Republicans who pushed Larry Craig into resigning when Craig was caught soliciting a policeman in a public toilet .
( Earlier he had also demanded Bill Clinton resign . )
When I called his office to ask if he would take his own advice and resign a staffer told me to go -- well what Dick Cheney said to Pat Leahy .
Those Republicans are all so predictable -- and such huge supporters of the " sanctity of marriage . "
I bet Vitter is hoping this takes the heat off him .
After virtually begging Nevada voters not to force him out , this morning he resigned as the # 4 Republican leader in the Senate GOP -- chair of their Policy Committee .
Miss McConnell : “ He ’s accepted responsibility for his actions and apologized to his family and constituents .
He offered , and I accepted , his resignation as chairman of the Policy Committee . ”
His presidential pretensions were pronounced dead : Oops ... looks like there was some criminal behavior here too .
Ensign was using PAC money -- which is federally regulated -- to pay his mistress ' son while he was screwing her .
The 19 year old son was doing “ research policy consulting ” for the NRSC in March 2008 .
No wonder he got fired from his Republican leadership position this morning .
I wonder how long all the facts in this case are going to dribble out .
Why do n't these Republicans ever learn -- and just be honest and get it over with all at once ?

The officer captured on video apparently pushing a man during the G20 protests in London has been suspended , police have said .
Ian Tomlinson , 47 , died from a heart attack minutes after the incident on 1 April , near the Bank of England .
The Metropolitan Police suspended the officer after the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) called for that action to be taken .
The IPCC has launched a criminal investigation into the death .
It has yet to interview the officer involved but said it intends to " as soon as possible " .
In this case , we have expressed the view that the officer in question should be suspended from duty , in the public interest
IPCC Additional footage broadcast by Channel 4 News appeared to show an officer hitting Mr Tomlinson with a baton .
IPCC chairman Nick Hardwick has rejected suggestions that the police were not co-operating with the investigation .
He told Channel 4 News : " The police , both forces , have given us the information that they have available when we asked them for that .
It 's not true that they have n't co-operated with us . "
Mr Hardwick said the City of London police were used to gather evidence and added that involving them in the investigation was the right thing to do .
He said : " This is now a criminal investigation for which someone may face very serious charges .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The decision we took meant that we are now in the best possible position to bring that prosecution successfully if we need to do that . "
An earlier statement from the IPCC said : " The IPCC called for the officer to be suspended .
The MPS has now informed us that the officer has been suspended with immediate effect . "
" Although decisions about suspension are a matter for the Chief Officer of the police , when there is an IPCC investigation , the police are obliged to consult with us over the suspension of officers .
See a map of the scene " In this case , we have expressed the view that the officer in question should be suspended from duty , in the public interest . "
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said : " In order to maintain public trust in the police handling of public order events , a Metropolitan Police territorial support group police constable has been suspended , effective immediately , in relation to the IPCC investigation into the death of Ian Tomlinson .
Flower tributes have been left for Ian Tomlinson close to where he died " Although the Metropolitan Police consulted with the IPCC , the decision was taken independently by the Metropolitan Police having considered all the circumstances . "
Meanwhile , protester Safiullah Ghauri , 24 , has told the BBC that he saw Mr Tomlinson lying on the ground in Threadneedle Street moments after he had collapsed .
He said : " I appealed to everyone to call the police paramedics ...
When they came some of the protesters tried to stop the ambulance coming through .
" They stood in front of it and I pushed one or two of them away and shouted at them to try to clear a way through .
" Some of the protesters were getting out of hand . "
He said he thought some of the protesters ' mistrust of the emergency services was a result of police behaviour during the demonstrations .
Mr Ghauri , from Hayes in Middlesex , said he left a message for the IPCC but heard nothing back .
' Cover - up ' denied
The IPCC began an independent criminal probe on Wednesday after the first video footage of Mr Tomlinson being shoved to the ground emerged .
It has ordered a second post - mortem examination as part of the inquiry .
On Thursday the Met acknowledged Mr Tomlinson came " into contact with police " before he died .
Initially the force said it was unaware he had sustained the alleged assault and said its officers ' first contact with him was when they gave him medical aid before he died .
But it denied trying to " cover up " the incident .
Some activists who participated in the demonstrations during the G20 meeting are expected to march from Bethnal Green police station on Saturday to the spot where Mr Tomlinson collapsed .

Best 0 % Balance Transfer Credit Cards
This posts lists a bunch of the 0 % balance transfer credit cards on the market today , and having the list in the first place was motivated by a reader who managed to pay off her debt with these 0 % balance transfer offers .
Below is her story along with the different choices out there on the market today , including a couple options with no balance transfer fees .
During the 0 % balance transfer credit cards craze of recent years , many of my friends were calling me ignorant for not taking advantage of these balance transfer offers .
The idea was simple in that all you needed to do was apply for a few credit cards offering 0 % balance transfers , send the money to a high yield savings account and pocket the difference in interest .
The 0 % balance transfer tactic worked well , with each card earning a couple hundred dollars before taxes with minimal effort .
I never bothered , though .
The tactic seemed weird .
It just was n’t me and subsequently , I never talked about it here .
Now that the credit card companies are offering these 0 % balance transfer offers in full force again , a reader took the plunge and wrote me an email that really changed my perception of these 0 % balance transfer cards .
David , you have to write about these 0 % balance transfer credit cards .
I used one and it helped pay off my debt a year ahead of schedule !
Whoa .
That got my interest .
The 0 % Balance Transfer Story
Apparently , reader Shelby ( fake name as she requested to stay anonymous ) , used these cards to transfer all her credit card debt onto 2 cards with 0 % interest .
Then she made every effort to pay off the balance .
It was a great strategy because based on her calculation , the lack of interests helped her reach her credit card debt free goal 394 days ahead of time .
She said more people should take advantage of these offers to get out of debt and I totally agree .
All you need to do is apply for 0 % balance transfer credit cards and watch your debt shrink much more rapidly .
What is a 0 % Balance Transfer ?
An insightful and exciting way to decrease the burden of credit card debt , while at the same time not having to pay exorbitant interest fees , is to take advantage of a 0 % balance transfer credit card offer .
Sure , this may seem like a foolish exercise in futility at first glance – taking out a new credit card account to get rid of credit card debt – but nevertheless , the fact remains that this can be a remarkably effective tool in your arsenal when you want to save money and diminish credit card debt .
A 0 % balance transfer is a marketing tool used by credit card companies to increase the number of customers holding accounts with them , and also increase the amount of debt held within those accounts .
While these balance transfers are effective for the credit card companies , they also can be a powerful aid to customers who wish to save money and pay off credit card debt .
This is how the process works :
First , a customer opens a new credit card account that offers a 0 % interest balance transfer program .
These are not usually difficult to find , although there are variables about which customers should be aware .
Some balance transfer offers are considerably longer than others , and in this case , longer is definitely better .
In addition , customers would be well advised to pay close attention to the interest rate after the period of zero interest expires .
It will , of course , be increased .
However , some companies will charge incredibly high rates after the end of the initial period with no interest .
Because of the importance of these types of details , it is absolutely vital that a customer read the fine print very carefully before deciding which credit card offer to accept .
Once the new account has been opened , customers will usually find the telephone operators with their new credit card company more than willing to assist them in transferring the balances to their new account .
This is to be expected , of course , because they want as much of that money transferred into that account as possible – right up to the limit .
How that account is managed after the transfer is what will make the difference in how much money is saved over the course of the zero interest period .
Once the new account has high - interest funds transferred in , this is the best time to pay down that balance as aggressively as possible .
By doing this , customers may be able to completely pay off much of the credit card debt without incurring any interest fees at all , saving significant amounts of money .
It is , however , vital to remain aware of when the zero interest promotion ends .
In the event that there is still a balance remaining on the transferred balance as this time period comes to a close , it may be possible to open a 0 % balance transfer credit card with another company , and continue the cycle further .
Again , looking out for the longest period with a 0 % balance will help you to diminish debt and save money .
How to Calculate When Using a 0 % Balance Transfer Makes Sense
When deciding what to do about your debt , one common question is how to calculate when using a 0 % balance transfer makes sense .
0 % balance transfer credit cards are promotional offer that creditors extent to attract customers .
The offer permits you to transfer balances from other credit cards onto the new card at an amount up to your credit limit .
You will pay 0 % interest on the money transferred for a set period of time , usually between six months and one year .
After this period of time , any remaining balance will default to the normal interest rate , under the terms of most cards .
Most 0 % balance transfer credit cards charge you a fee to transfer the balance .
The industry standard is a 3 % fee .
This fee used to be capped , which meant that there was an upper limit maximum that would be charged .
Calculating Whether 0 % Balance Transfer Credit Cards Makes Sense
Your first consideration when calculating whether the 0 % balance transfer credit cards make sense should be determining whether you will save enough in interest to make the 3 % fee worthwhile .
This will depend on the amount of money you owe and the interest rate you are currently paying .
Interest rates on credit cards can vary widely from around 5 % to upwards of 25 % depending on your credit score and a number of other factors .
This will make a vast difference in determining whether a balance transfer makes sense in your situation or not .
Assume , for a moment , that you have a 5 % interest rate .
If you have a $ 1000 balance , that means that you are paying 5 % annually on a $ 1000.00 balance .
Although there is some variation on how creditors charge interest – some charge interest on a double month cycle - you will pay approximately $ 23.37 in interest over a 6 month period .
This number was calculating assuming you are making minimum payments of 3 % per month of the balance remaining .
If you are making larger payments , you will pay less in interest .
Over a one year period of time using the same calculations and assuming the same payment rate , you will pay $ 42.79 in interest over the course of the year .
This means that if the balance transfer offer is good for six months , a balance transfer may not be right for you , since you will pay a $ 30.00 fee ( 3 % of $ 1000 ) to save $ 23.37 in interest .
However , if the balance transfer offer is good for one year , then a balance transfer will safe you about $ 12.00 .
While this is a savings , only you can decide whether that amount of money is worth the hassle of transferring a balance .
If your interest rate jumps to 15 % on your credit card , the numbers look a bit different .
Again assuming a $ 1000 balance and payments at 3 % per month , you are now looking at $ 71.66 in interest over six months and $ 134.94 in interest over the course of a year .
Assuming a 3 % balance transfer fee of $ 30.00 , the offer begins to look a bit more attractive .
If your credit card interest rate is 20 % , with all other factors the same , you will pay $ 96.59 in interest over 6 months and $ 184.48 over one year .
In this situation , a balance transfer begins to look as though it might make sense .
Therefore , it seems clear that the higher the interest rate , the wiser it is to do a 0 % balance transfer .
The same rule applies for high balances .
If you had an $ 8000 balance on that same 20 % card , over the course of a year you would pay $ 1475.89 in interest .
This is quite a bit more then the $ 240 balance transfer fee you would pay .
Other Things to Consider about 0 % Balance Transfer Credit Cards
One other major factor to consider when making the calculation of whether a 0 % balance transfer credit cards make sense is whether you can actually pay the balance back within the promotional period .
If you have , for example , an $ 8000 balance , you would need to make credit card payments of over $ 1330.00 per month in order to have that balance paid off within a six month promotional period .
If you do not have that kind of cash lying around , you need to consider what happens when the promotional rate ends .
Typically , when a promotional rate ends , you will just have to begin paying at the regular interest rate on the remaining balance .
Thus , you would need to look at what that standard interest rate was in order to determine how much you should expect to pay in interest on the remainder of the transferred balance after your promotion ends .
You can do this by figuring out how much you can pay per month and subtracting that amount form the total owed .
So , if you were able to pay $ 200 a month on your $ 8000 balance , at the end of six months you would still have $ 6800 remaining on your card .
Find out what rate will be charged on that remaining balance .
If the rate is higher then the rate you have now , it might not be advantageous for you to take the balance transfer offer unless you are absolutely confident that you can pay off the balance within the promotional period .
Be diligent about ensuring that you really can pay off the money within the promotional period .
Do not be late on your payments or otherwise default on any agreement with the credit card company or you may find yourself spending much more money when your rate defaults to a penalty rate under the terms of the contract .
Finally , do not count on simply being able to transfer the balance again at the end of your promotional rate .
After the economic crisis of 2009 , the days of easy credit and endless balance transfer offers are no more and there is no guarantee that at the end of your promotional term , another balance transfer offer will come along .
With the Valgrind - on - Mac support coming along nicely , it ’s worth addressing another widely - used platform : Windows .
Will Valgrind work on Windows any time soon ?
There are actually two answers : ( a ) hell no , and ( b ) it already does ( sort of ) .
The patch I merged from the Darwin branch onto the trunk yesterday was 28,300 lines .
And that was almost entirely new code , because I ’d done a lot of work to synchronize the branch and trunk so that all non-addition changes had been dealt with .
Greg Parker spent over four years , off and on , working on the original port , and I spent close to three months full time cleaning it up , and Julian Seward also pitched in a bit .
I roughly estimate the Darwin port represents at least 1,000 person - hours of work , possibly much more .
And Mac OS X is a lot closer to Linux than Windows is .
Also , the Mac OS X kernel is open source , which makes a port much easier .
A Valgrind - on - Windows port would therefore be an enormous undertaking , one that is unlikely to happen soon , if ever .
That is how we get answer ( a ) above .
However , although Valgrind does n’t run on Windows , it is possible to run Windows programs under Valgrind , thanks to Wine — you run the Windows program under Wine , and Wine under Valgrind .
The development ( trunk ) versions of both Valgrind and Wine now have enough awareness of each other that they can apparently be used together .
I say “ apparently ” because I have n’t tried it myself , but I know that others have had some success .
But please note that this is fairly new and experimental , and should only be tried by those not afraid to get their hands dirty ( this page has more details ) .
And that ’s how we get the answer ( b ) above .
By Peter Jackson
When did a lavatory become a loo ?
And why were Victorian trousers " unmentionables " ?
The world 's first historical thesaurus , which is to be published after more than 40 years of research , claims to have the answers .
Loved by writers , not to mention crossword cheats , Roget 's Thesaurus has never been out of print since it was published in 1852 to " assist in literary composition " .
The best known dictionary of its kind , which groups synonyms - words with similar meanings - has been a source of reference for more than 150 years .
But a new beast is emerging from Britain 's vast ocean of words , a colossus to rival Roget .
A 40 - YEAR LABOUR OF LOVE World 's first historical thesaurus Contains almost every word in English from Old English to present day Started in 1964 by Michael Samuels , then professor of English Language at University of Glasgow Contains 800,000 meanings , organised into 236,000 categories and subcategories Published in two volumes on 8 October 2009 The Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary , published by Oxford University Press , is the culmination of 44 years of painstaking work by scholars at the University of Glasgow .
It not only groups words with similar meanings but does so in chronological order according to their history - with the oldest first and most recent last .
According to its publisher , it 's the largest thesaurus in the world and the first historical thesaurus in any language .
With 800,000 meanings , 600,000 words and more than 230,000 categories and sub categories , it 's twice as big as Roget 's version .
And if that does n't have him turning in his grave , it also contains almost every word in English from Old English to the present day , or 2003 to be precise - the cut - off date for the new dictionary .
So what can we learn from a book like this ?
Part of the dictionary 's appeal is its ability to show how words reflect the values of society at a given moment in history .
Words we commonly use today have evolved and sometimes changed unrecognisably .
English language professor Christian Kay has become an authority on such lexicographical metamorphoses - having given much of her working life to compiling the new thesaurus .
An English language professor , Ms Kay , one of four co-editors of the publication , began work on it in the late 1960s - while she was in her 20s .
With the help of this edited extract ( below ) from the new historical thesaurus , Ms Kay explains how an unremarkable word , such as " trousers " has evolved over almost 500 years .

PROF KAY'S EXPLANATION
breeks
The earliest reference from 1552 marks the change in fashion from breeches , a garment tied below the knee and worn with tights .
Still used in Scotland , it derives from the Old English " breeches " .
trouser
The singular form of " trousers " comes from the Gallic word " trews " , a close - fitting tartan garment formerly worn by Scottish and Irish highlanders and to this day by a Scottish regiment .
The word " trouses " probably has the same derivation .
unimaginables
This 19th Century word , and others like " unwhisperables " and " never- mention - ems " , reflect Victorian prudery .
Back then , even trousers were considered risque , which is why there were so many synonyms .
People did n't want to confront the brutal idea , so found jocular alternatives .
In the same way the word death is avoided with phrases like " pass away " and " pushing up daisies " .
stove - pipes A 19th Century reference hijacked in the 1950s by the Teddy Boys along with drainpipes .
The tight trousers became synonymous with youthful rebellion , a statement of difference from the standard post - war suits .
rammies
This abbreviation of Victorian cockney rhyming slang " round- me- houses " travelled with British settlers to Australia and South Africa .
Finally , how does Ms Kay feel , witnessing her work , after 40 years , make it into print ?
" It 's a big moment for me , " she says .
" In some ways I 'm glad to feel it 's all over , one of my main occupations has been fundraising which has been hard to keep going .
There will be a lot of satisfaction to see it in on the page . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
What a superb resource .
I 'm astonished to learn that " breeks " is the very first recorded version of what we now call trousers - believe it or not , " breeks " is still regularly used in Belfast in this context , almost 500 years after it made its debut !
Tony Black , Belfast I am sitting here in my kegs laughing my unmentionables off at the very thought that the prudish Victorians were so easily embarrassed .
( What did they do for us ? )
Doug Mummery , County Durham
In this part of SE Lancs at least , trousers are also called " Kecks " - I wonder if that 's from somewhere like the Scottish " Breeks " ?
Steve Taylor , Heywood UK
What about the word " slacks " to represent trousers ?
Was that one of the words edited out ?
Emma , Pontypridd
I would love to own a copy of this , but a quick search reveals that it 's not really priced for the average person .
Who can afford to spend over GBP150 on a thesaurus ??
Alys , Canada
I grew up in the Lake District where , in common with some other parts of the north , the term for trousers was " kecks " ; presumably this is related to " kickseys / kicksies 1812-1851 ( slang ) " .
Underpants were underkecks .
I 'd imagine the entry on them ( whether male or female versions ! ) includes even more euphemisms like " unmentionables " .
David V Barrett , London ' Trews ' is not a ' Gallic ' ( sic ) word , nor is any other .
It is derived from the ( Scottish ) Gaelic ( note spelling ) triubhas ( with the plural triubhsar giving us the English word trouser ) .
Although in Scotland ' Gaelic ' is pronounced roughly as ' Gallic ' , this latter word when used in English refers to all things French ( i.e. related to the ancient Gauls ) .
So for example , we sometimes in English refer to a ' Gallic shrug ' to describe a nonchalant Frenchman .
On the other hand , it is probably fair to say that there is not a single word derived from ' Gallic ' in the English language , with Gaulish ( the correct adjective when referring to the ancient Celtic language ) words being extremely rare even in French .
On the other hand , Gaelic has given us quite a few loanwords , not least whisky ( from uisge - bheatha ' the water of life ' ) and the expression ' smashing ' ( from 's math sin ' that 's good ' ) .
Jim , Edinburgh , Scotland Completely fascinating .
I 've always wondered how many words have evolved and this seems to be a perfect quick reference - although the effort into its production must have been quite something .
A colleague recalls calling his trousers " breeks " in Scotland in the 1950s , I guess some things never change .

POLITICO ( Washington ) - President Barack Obama ’s announcement Wednesday offering limited benefits to the same - sex partners of federal employees failed to quell growing anger in the gay community that gay rights issues were getting short shrift at the White House .
In fact , Obama ’s promise to offer ancillary employee benefits - such as long - term - care insurance and the right to use sick leave to care for domestic partners - while still denying more valuable benefits , such as health insurance and retirement funds , may have further agitated gay and lesbian activists who were already fuming over other perceived snubs .
Obama said he also favors extending health and retirement benefits to same - sex partners of federal employees but that such a move is currently prohibited by the Defense of Marriage Act , or DOMA , which passed in 1996 .
“ Are they kidding us ?
Domestic partnership benefits WITHOUT health insurance because of DOMA ? ” gay fundraiser and activist David Mixner told POLITICO in an e-mail .
“ It is like rubbing salt in the wound . ”
“ From what you describe , it seems to me to fall very far short , ” said C. Dixon Osburn , a gay activist in Washington .
“ A patchwork approach that does n’t amount to a full array of benefits one would want or expect ... does not seem like a very good olive branch . ”
Obama said Wednesday that he wanted to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act , calling it “ discriminatory , ” and that he supports legislation to give same - sex partners of Federal employees equal benefits as heterosexual couples enjoy .
“ Hundreds of Fortune 500 companies already offer such benefits , not only because it ’s the right thing to do , but because they recognize it helps them compete for and retain top talent , ” he said .
Gay leaders have been in a slow burn through much of the spring , distressed about the Obama administration ’s failure to press for immediate repeal of the military ’s do n’t ask , do n’t tell policy prohibiting openly gay men and women from serving .
Some also chafed at the White House ’s refusal to suspend forced discharges of gay military personnel .
The concern escalated to a public furor after the Justice Department filed legal briefs in recent days defending the military policy and DOMA .
Justice officials explained that they were required to defend the laws , but many gay leaders said the briefs used unnecessarily inflammatory language , particularly by citing legal precedents from cases that related to incest and underage spouses .
“ I think there is more palpable anger in the LGBT < lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender > community at the perceived inaction by the Obama administration than I have felt directed at any prior administration .
I think that ’s in part because the expectations were high and the response so far has been low , ” said Osburn .
In a conference call with reporters Wednesday , Office of Personnel Management Director John Berry insisted that Obama ’s action on benefits demonstrated aggressive leadership .
“ This is a first step , not a final step , ” Berry said .
“ It ’s an example of practicing before preaching .
I believe the president is taking bold action to do just that . ”
Berry , who is Obama ’s highest - ranking openly gay appointee , said Obama has been “ very clear ” that he would like to do away with do n’t ask , do n’t tell .
However , Obama did not mention the issue Wednesday .
Berry insisted that Obama ’s Wednesday announcement had nothing to do with the withering criticism the administration has faced from gays and lesbians in recent days .
Some leaders in the community are urging their members to boycott a June 25 Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Washington .
Berry acknowledged that some benefits announced Wednesday by Obama , such as sick leave to care for a same - sex partner , have been permitted on a case - by - case basis in the past .
“ What the president is doing today is making this no longer optional .
He ’s making it mandatory , ” Berry said .
But Osburn said the measures were not enough .
” The administration , by its failure to move on our issues - they are quickly losing credibility with our community , ” he said .

Problem : you ’re a fungus that can only flourish at a certain temperature , humidity , location and distance from the ground but ca n’t do the legwork to find that perfect spot yourself .
Solution : hijack an ant ’s body to do the work for you — and then inhabit it .
A paper , to be published in The American Naturalist ’s September issue , explores the astounding accuracy with which this fungus compels ants to create its ideal home .
The Ophiocordyceps unilateralis fungus infects Camponotus leonardi ants that live in tropical rainforest trees .
Once infected , the spore - possessed ant will climb down from its normal habitat and bite down , with what the authors call a " death grip " on a leaf and then die .
But the story does n’t end there .
" The death grip occurred in very precise locations , " the authors write .
All of the C. leonardi ants studied in Thailand ’s Khao Chong Wildlife Sanctuary had chomped down on the underside of a leaf , and 98 percent had landed on a vein .
Most had : a ) found their way to the north side of the plant , b ) chomped on a leaf about 25 centimeters above the ground , c ) selected a leaf in an environment with 94 to 95 percent humidity and d ) ended up in a location with temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius .
The researchers called this specificity " remarkable . "
In other words , the fungus was transported via the zombie ant to its prime location .
To see just how important this accuracy is to the fungus , the researchers identified dozens of infected ants in a small area of the forest .
Some of the ants were moved to other nearby heights and locations , and others were left to sprout spores just where they had died .
Those ants that were left where O. unilateralis directed them grew normal , healthy hyphae ( fungal threads ) within several days , but those that had been moved never did .
" I cannot think of another example [ of adaptive behavioral changes ] as specific as this one , " Edward Levri , who has studied behavioral changes in parasite hosts but was not involved in this study , wrote in an e-mail .
" The fact that infected individuals all die in a ' lock - jawed ' position , at 25 centimeters above ground , mostly on the north side of the tree is amazing and suggests that multiple behaviors and possibly multiple manipulatory physiological mechanisms may be required by the parasite . "
The authors also examined the impact of the fungus on an ant in the Polyrhachis genus and found that not all of the behaviors carried over .
" The fact that infection by this parasite in another ant species results in some behavioral change , but results in less optimal behavior for the parasite , points to the idea that this parasite has evolved to manipulate this specific host , " noted Levri , who is an assistant professor of biology at Penn State Altoona .
After the ant death , the fungus began growing hyphae inside the insect ’s body ; in a few days , the hyphae would emerge from the exoskeleton — " always … from a specific point at the back of the head , " write the authors of the study , which was led by Sandra Andersen of the Center for Social Evolution at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark .
Within a week , the fungus had grown to about twice the length of the host ant ’s body and had started sexual reproduction .
Meanwhile , " the ant cuticle is … remodeled into a protective case by reinforcing the weaker parts , " and the parts of the fungus inside the ant ’s body appear to differentiate into separate functions , write the researchers .
When the fungus releases spores , it creates what the authors describe as " an infectious ' killing field ' " about one square meter below the ant body that could infect C. leonardi ants or similar species that are unlucky enough to walk there .
Sound rare ?
Nature is actually full of zombie creatures doing the dirty work for their clever parasite hosts — a phenomenon known as adaptive parasite manipulation .
In Central America , ants that eat bird droppings can end up ingesting a nematode parasite that lays eggs in the ants ’ bellies , turns them bright red and rounds them out .
The color and shape change leaves the ants looking just like local berries that birds like to eat , thereby passing the parasite onto another bird .
And one wasp ( the emerald cockroach wasp , or Ampulex compressa ) attacks cockroaches with venom that blocks a neurotransmitter that allows the insect to control its own movements .
The wasp is then free to lead the walking zombie roach into the wasp 's nest — to have it serve as host and food for a wasp larva .
A video of Sesame Street 's Subway song as seen on YouTube .
Making files small enough to stream on the internet often involves using a lower resolution , compressing the data and transmitting the information at a lower bit rate .
( ( You Tube ) )
Television is not a daily staple for my infant daughter , but if she and I had to pick her favourite video now , at the age of 14 months , it would likely be the classic Sesame Street musical ode to the subway
A rollicking and subversive take on mass transit , it includes enough edgy humour for adults — as one woman sings " You could lose your purse , or you might lose something worse , on the subway ! " — and singing puppets , which my daughter seems to enjoy , if her squeal of delight and clapping is any indication .
In contrast , the Baby Einstein DVDs in our home do little more than pacify her .
She stares at the hand puppets but says little and then eventually scoots off to find a remote control , or a sock .
That we enjoy the classic Sesame Street is not surprising , but what is worth noting is that the video , which we discovered on YouTube , is of horrendous quality .
It 's blurry , the sound is terrible , and I 'm not sure it 's entirely clear to my daughter that these are , indeed , puppets .
In terms of picture quality , it 's got nothing on the Baby Einstein videos .
On the internet , though , this rarely seems to matter .
Viral videos
Two weeks ago , a 19 - year - old Australian woman named Clare Werbeloff became the latest YouTube minor celebrity for her vivid , offensive — and , as it turned out , entirely fictitious — retelling of a shooting she claimed to have witnessed .
The video , grainy to begin with before making the awkward transition to YouTube , still managed to be viewed over 500,000 times and gave rise to a new catch phrase : " Chk , chk , boom " — her " re-enactment " of the trigger - pulling event .
The Chk Chk Boom Girl video now stands alongside a long list of poorly shot , fuzzy short - form videos to go viral to the internet , joining Star Wars Kid , Numa Numa Guy and the Paris Hilton sex video in the list of things you 've probably seen but would never watch on a full - screen television .
Yet for years , the media and technology companies have been telling consumers what they really want is the best sound , the best video and the most life - like entertainment experience .
Why , then , does a website like YouTube attract hundreds of millions of viewers a day ?
Why do people put up with wallet - sized displays ; the so - called visual and aural " artifacts " caused during compression of video to smaller files ; or the lagging action as a result of slow - moving internet connections ?
Three words come to mind : here , now and , of course , free .
Quality is ' good enough '
" Convenience — and price — trumps all , " said Michael Masnick , a U.S. - based new media consultant who follows digital trends on the blog Techdirt .
Masnick believes people want better - quality video on the internet and on their phones , but it 's not what drives people to consume one product over another .
" It 's really the convenience issue at play , " he said .
" That said , for many applications , the quality is ' good enough . '
That does n't mean people would n't like better - quality video but that if it's not convenient , they can live with the lower quality . "
Gary Brolsma's Numa Numa
Dance , a video recording of his animated lip - synching to an obscure pop song , has been viewed on YouTube over 29 million times .
Recorded in 2004 using a webcam , it has both a restricted frame and poor resolution .

It 's a familiar tune to Paul Théberge , an associate professor at Carleton University , who has been following the impact technology and the internet has had on music .
Just as Flash video on YouTube undercut traditional broadcasting distribution , so , too , did the MP3 format change the music industry a decade ago , said Théberge , who holds a Canada Research Chair in technological mediations of culture .
Because of the compression technology used to make MP3s manageable to download , they suffer in sound quality compared to the best digital recordings .
But that did n't prevent online file sharing and the rise of portable MP3 players from taking off .
On the flip side , sales of CDs and DVDs plummeted in the last decade , particularly as peer - to - peer file sharing brought the cost of music down to as low as zero , provided one was willing to skirt copyright laws .
Anytime , anywhere video
And what happened then was n't so different from the revolution that started 30 years ago when audio tapes arrived on the scene , said Théberge .
" At some level , it 's the same old story , " he said .
" Audio tapes , VHS , MP3s , YouTube , all of these technologies allowed people to watch or listen in different contexts , either physically or temporally .
You could consume the media anywhere and anytime , and that 's what consumers want .
People have shown with their consumption of media in these formats that they are willing to put up with a little degradation . "
As one commenter on CBCNews .ca wrote in response to a story on YouTube : " Even though the picture quality is crap and the screen is tiny , I prefer youtube over regular television because I do n't have to watch ads and I can browse and watch what I want to watch when I want to watch it ... Control over content wins every time . "
Why is online video fuzzier than TV ?
A couple of reasons why your online viewing experience might not be up to your expectations : Video resolution : Measured in pixels , resolution is an expression of how much detail a given image has .
The more pixels , the finer the detail .
As most video is displayed horizontally for televisions and computers , the pixel dimensions are also stretched out horizontally , so a 240 pixel resolution screen is actually 320 by 240 pixels .
Many older YouTube videos were compressed to 320 by 240 pixels , though now the website 's standard is double that , 640 by 480 pixels , which is roughly the resolution one got from a VHS tape or a standard definition television .
It looks OK from the couch , but not so great up close on a computer monitor .
High - definition video is 1,280 by 720 pixels while Blu - Ray discs have 1,920 by 1,080 pixel resolution .
Bit rate :
How fast the video information can be sent has a big impact on video quality , and it's why high - definition video on the web does n't measure up to HD TV .
Certain media have built - in bit rates : DVDs send information at a rate of about five megabits per second ( Mbps ) while HD television can be less than 10 Mbps or close to 20 Mbps , and Blu - Ray discs send data at 40 Mbps .
HD video purchased through Apple 's iTunes store , by comparison , has a bit rate of about 4 Mbps , a sacrifice the company makes to keep the file itself from taking up too much space on your computer .
Compression technology can mitigate some of the impact of a low bit rate , but in general , a faster bit rate means better quality .
Streaming video is also at the mercy of your internet connection .
A 2008 study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development found the average broadband connection in Canada had a speed of about seven Mbps , of which only some can be devoted to streaming the video .
Which is not to say that people prefer bad - quality video but rather that consumers have repeatedly demonstrated a preference for convenience — witness the success of the Sony Walkman , Apple 's iPod , and video sharing websites like YouTube .
Better quality has attracted the interest of consumers but only when it 's also convenient .
Compact discs were an improvement in sound quality over LPs , but just as importantly , they were portable .
Background ' sizzle ' can make some music pop
Technology companies that forget this in their pursuit of the highest recording quality have paid the price .
Quadraphonic sound was a bust in the 1970s .
Beta video cassettes , incompatible with other players , became obsolete .
HD DVD and Blu - Ray discs socked it out for years in the battle of high - definition video technology , with Blu - Ray scoring a hollow victory , as online video threatens to overtake it .
" Blu - Ray still is n't taking off , even after it won the format battle with HD DVD , because the vast majority of people , outside of a few audiophiles , are not that interested in the difference in quality between it and regular DVDs , " said Théberge .
And in some special cases , people actually prefer less - than - perfect quality .
Jonathan Berger , a composer and music professor at Stanford University , conducted a series of studies and found for certain kinds of music — particularly distortion - heavy rock and roll — people actually preferred MP3s to better - quality formats .
As Berger told Nora Young on CBC Radio's Spark , the audio artifacts of compression , chaotic noise bursts he calls " sizzle , " actually enhance cymbal hits and distortion guitars .
The results do n't surprise Théberge , as rock music , particularly punk rock and heavy metal , has always maintained a preference for a raw , live sound where noise has an aesthetic value and sounding " too polished " can be the kiss of death with fans .
Video not always best in HD
In the realm of video , however , there are fewer analogues , though some exist , said David Purdy , vice - president and general manager of television services at Rogers Communications .
Adult video , extreme sports and user - generated content are all examples of formats where viewers have repeatedly rejected high definition in favour of grainy , poorer - quality video , said Purdy .
( Adult actress and director Stormy Daniels summed up her industry 's issues with HD best in an interview with the New York Times in 2007 : " The biggest problem is razor burn , " she said .
" I 'm not 100 per cent sure why anyone would want to see their porn in HD . " )
But in general , people who follow the online video world say better - quality video is still an end goal for most users , particularly for long - form content , such as full television episodes , movies or sporting events .
Even YouTube has moved toward better - quality video , in part in response to new competition from sites such as Hulu and Vimeo .
An HD - DVD video disc of ' The Bourne Supremacy , ' alongside a Blu-ray disc of ' Superman Returns . '
The two competing formats both tried to capture the high - definition disc market , but it was industry , and not consumers , that ultimately crowned Blu - Ray the winner , as adoption was slow .
( ( Associated Press ) )
The Google - owned leader in online video has recently added content in high - definition resolution , although HD means different things depending on the bit rate one is able to view the video at .
( See sidebar . )
YouTube senior product manager Shiva Rajamaran says as bandwidth on broadband internet connections improves , people 's expectations of high - quality video will naturally become greater .
Long hours watching short clips
" Better - video quality tends to be better , no matter the length or kind of content , " said Rajamaran .
" Does it matter for brief entertainment or breaking news ?
Maybe not , but if you are going to be spending 20 minutes or more leaning back watching a full TV episode , it should be watchable . "
While this might be true , it 's also true that one of YouTube 's and the internet 's enduring traits is its ability to suck a viewer in to watching not just one two - minute video but hours and hours of bad video in one sitting .
" It 's abundantly clear the first time you go online that you can spend days and nights watching what 's out there , " said Théberge .
" No megastore can stock that kind of material . "
It 's the combination of ease of use and interconnectivity — the ability to link from one video to the next — which might explain the power of online video , regardless of its quality .
Consider my Sesame Street experience .
For months , my daughter and I would come back to the YouTube video — likely posted without permission — and it was n't long before I was clicking on It 's Not Easy Being Green and C is for Cookie , each one only a search term away from popping on the screen .
It was n't until recently that it finally occurred to me that a better - quality version of the video was available on the Sesame Street website .
It was still not TV quality , but it was better .
We watched it together , this time in full - screen format .
At first , my daughter was unsure what she was watching , but then she reacted with a smile and yelp , a measure of joy equal to her previous viewing .
No more , no less .
" C " is for convenient , and I guess that 's good enough for her .

Kelly Fincham : No Irish journalist can forget where they were when they heard ...

Patrick " Dutchy " Holland , who became Ireland 's most - infamous murderer by being fingered in the slaying of crusading crime journalist Veronica Guerin , has died at 70 of natural causes .
A Dublin native and former U.S. Marine , Holland was a career criminal and a drug dealer .
His rap sheet rolled back a long way -- back to the 1960s .
He later joined a big - time drug gang led by John Gilligan .
Police probing the murder of Veronica Guerin in June 1996 learned from gang snitches Holland was her killer .
He went on the lam and fled Ireland , but returned to Dublin a year later .
During a trial on earlier drug charges , Police Officer Marion Cusack testified that she arrested Holland on suspicion of having a firearm at the location where Guerin was shot .
Cusack said : “ I had formed the opinion that Patrick Holland was the man who shot dead Veronica Guerin . ”
Holland was never charged with the murder , and always denied any involvement .
" I have n’t killed anybody ever .
There is no blood on my hands , ” he famously claimed .
He was convicted of the drug charges and sentenced to 20 years in prison .

Study of dieters shows how two brain areas interact in people with the willpower to say no to unhealthy foods
PASADENA , Calif . -- When you 're on a diet , deciding to skip your favorite calorie - laden foods and eat something healthier takes a whole lot of self - control - - an ability that seems to come easier to some of us than others .
Now , scientists from the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) have uncovered differences in the brains of people who are able to exercise self - control versus those who find it almost impossible .
The key ?
While everyone uses the same single area of the brain to make these sorts of value - laden decisions , a second brain region modulates the activity of the first region in people with good self - control , allowing them to weigh more abstract factors -- healthiness , for example -- in addition to basic desires such as taste to make a better overall choice .
These findings , which are being published in the May 1 issue of the journal Science , not only provide insight into the interplay between self - control and decisionmaking in dieters , but may explain how we make any number of decisions that require some degree of willpower .
" A very basic question in economics , psychology , and even religion , is why some people can exercise self - control but others cannot , " notes Antonio Rangel , a Caltech associate professor of economics and the paper 's principal investigator .
" From the perspective of modern neuroscience , the question becomes , ' What is special about the circuitry of brains that can exercise good behavioral self - control ? '
This paper studies this question in the context of dieting decisions and provides an important insight . "
That insight was the result of an innovative experiment : A group of volunteers -- all self - reported dieters -- were shown photos of 50 foods , including everything from Snickers bars to Jello to cauliflower .
The participants were asked to rate each of the foods based on how good they thought that food would taste .
Afterwards , they were shown the same slides again and asked to rate each of the foods based on its supposed health benefits .
From those ratings , the researchers selected an " index food " for each volunteer - - a food that fell about in the middle of the pack in terms of tastiness and supposed health benefits .
The participant was then shown the 50 items one final time and was asked to choose between it and the index item .
( To keep the choosers " honest " without forcing them to eat 50 different foods in one sitting , the researchers would randomly select a number corresponding to one of the slides , and the participant would have to eat whichever food had been chosen at that point . )
All three viewings of the slides were done with the participant inside an MRI scanner , so that the blood - oxygen level dependent signal ( a proxy for neuronal activity ) in specific areas of the brain could be measured .
After all the choices had been made , the researchers were able to pick out 19 volunteers who showed a significant amount of dietary self - control in their choices , picking mostly healthy foods , regardless of taste .
They were also able to identify 18 additional volunteers who showed very little self - control , picking what they believed to be the tastier food most of the time , regardless of its nutritional value .
When they looked at the brain scans of the participants , they found significant differences in the brain activity of the self - control group as compared to the non-self - controllers .
Previous studies have shown that value - based decisions -- like what kind of food to eat -- are reflected in the activity of a region in the brain called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , or vmPFC .
If activity in the vmPFC goes down , explains Todd Hare , a postdoctoral scholar in neuroeconomics and the first author on the Science paper , " it means the person is probably going to say no to that item ; if it goes up , they 're likely to choose that item . "
In the non-self - controllers , Rangel notes , the vmPFC seemed to only take the taste of the food into consideration in making a decision .
" In the case of good self - controllers , however , another area of the brain -- called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [ DLPFC ] -- becomes active , and modulates the basic value signals so that the self - controllers can also incorporate health considerations into their decisions , " he explains .
In other words , the DLPFC allows the vmPFC to weigh both taste and health benefits at the same time .
" The vmPFC works during every decision , " says Hare .
" The DLPFC , on the other hand , is more active when you 're employing self - control . "
" This , ultimately , is one reason why self - controllers can make better choices , " Rangel adds .
Still , the DLPFC can only do so much .
For instance , it can't override a truly negative reaction to a food , notes Hare .
" We rarely got people to say they 'd eat cauliflower if they did n't like cauliflower , " he says .
" But they would choose not to eat ice cream or candy bars , knowing they could eat the healthier index food instead . "
" After centuries of debate in social sciences we are finally making big strides in understanding self - control from watching the brain resist temptation directly , " says Colin Camerer , the Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Economics in Caltech 's Division of Humanities and Social Sciences and another of the paper 's coauthors .
" This study , and many more to come , will eventually lead to much better theories about how self - control develops and how it works for different kinds of temptations . "
The next step , the researchers say , is to come up with ways to engage the DLPFC in the decisions made by people with poor self - control under normal conditions .
For instance , Hare says , it might be possible to kick the DLPFC into gear by making the health qualities of foods more salient for people , rather than asking them to make the effort to judge a food 's health benefits on their own .
" If we highlight the fact that ice cream is unhealthy just before we offer it , " he notes , " maybe we can reduce its value in advance , give the person a head start to making a better decision . "
Whether this is indeed feasible remains to be tested .
But clearly , the possibilities are tantalizing , since these same sorts of value - based choices are at the root of everything from addictions like smoking to risky financial decisions .
" Imagine how much better life could be if we knew how to flex the willpower muscles in the brain and strengthen them with exercises , " says Camerer .

Canonical , the company behind the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution , is launching a new project to improve the usability of the platform .
The developers aim to identify and resolve 100 minor bugs that negatively impact the Ubuntu user experience before the release of the next major version in October .
The initiative , which is called One Hundred Paper Cuts , will be implemented by Canonical 's new design and user experience team in collaboration with the Ubuntu community .
Canonical 's design experts have called for Ubuntu users to participate by helping to identify relevant bugs .
They are specifically looking for easily fixable bugs that impact the usability of key system components such as the panels and file manager .
Canonical hopes to boost the overall quality of the platform by addressing a multitude of subtle issues that developers would otherwise ignore .
Many of the improvements that are applied through this effort will directly benefit upstream projects .
Canonical began assembling a team of professional designers last year to lead a broad community - driven usability initiative called Project Ayatana .
The new One Hundred Paper Cuts initiative is one of several strategies that comprises Ayatana .
Another major facet of Ayatana is Canonical 's experimental notification system , which was introduced in Ubuntu 9.04 .
During this development cycle , the new notification system will receive additional improvements as the design team simultaneously tackles the papercuts .
David Siegel , the developer of the popular GNOME - Do launcher , recently joined Canonical as part of the user experience and design team .
In his blog , he describes the function of the One Hundred Paper Cuts project and provides more specific insight into what kind of issues are classified as papercuts .
" If some small usability detail has been bothering you release after release , now is your chance to step up and get it the attention it deserves , " he wrote .
" If we can find and heal one hundred paper cuts , Ubuntu 9.10 will surely be the most usable release of Ubuntu yet . "
Users can participate by reporting bugs and flagging them as papercuts in Ubuntu 's Launchpad development site .
As Siegel points out in his blog , this is a great way for new contributors to get involved in the process of improving Ubuntu .
Users can also help by participating in the Ubuntu 9.04 usability study .
If the papercut project is successful , Siegel says , it might be reiterated during future development cycles .
Many of us who are experienced Linux users have become so accustomed to ignoring minor glitches that such problems practically become invisible .
The result is that there are a lot of really subtle deficiencies that have long been overlooked by developers but are immensely frustrating to new users .
The One Hundred Paper Cuts project looks like an effective way to overcome this challenge and smooth out some of Ubuntu 's rough edges .

Oakdale , CA : Scientists at Montsaint Genie Tech Inc. announced today that they have successfully transferred the gene segment that produces the psychotropic chemical THC in cannabis plants to many other common garden plants , including tomatoes , cucumbers , lettuce , carrots , and more .
â€
œWe probably can put the THC segment into almost any plant in existence , â€ says lead scientist Rebeca Vale .
â€ œItâ€™s a very simple process .
We are starting work on oak and maple trees now.â€ Asked if the resulting plants could be used in ways similar to cannabis , Vale replied , â€ œWell , you canâ€™t make twine out of a tomato plant , but if someone were to dry it and smoke it , all of the medicinal and psychotropic effects of marijuana would be present .
And whatâ€™s more , we have learned that tomatoes , in particular , actually produce more THC than cannabis itself .
â€ But is it legal ?
â€ œActually , yes , â€ says Vale .
â€ œOur research qualifies as GMO â€˜intellectual propertyâ€™ , as does the process itself .
Since tomatoes and other plants are not illegal , a person would be well within the law to grow them and use them as they please .
â€ Vale says that her company is working on a spray that will transfer the segment to many plants simply by spraying the leaves of seedlings .
â€ œItâ€™s a very simple process , â€ she says .
â€ œAnyone can do it .
We plan to start selling the spray - â€ ˜Genie Mistâ€™ - in a matter of weeks .
One bottle will sell for five dollars and be capable of treating 6,000 seedlings.â€
But how do the tomatoes taste ?
â€ œScrumptious , â€  Vale says .
â€ œBut , of course , they are best when roasted .â€ thecrit.com ]#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" Build yourselves a wall of ships ! " said the Oracle !
Yesterday evening , after writing the previous two articles on the battle between Intel and ARM + NVIDIA for the ultramobile space , I was telling our Linux editor why I think Intel pours so many resources into Moblin and other parts of the Linux ecosystem : they want to keep x86 - based Linux well ahead of ARM , because the software stack is critical to making inroads in low - power mobile and embedded applications .
But while Moblin might be fine for web tablets and the like , real embedded customers of the sort that Intel would ultimately like to poach from ARM run the VxWorks real - time OS by Wind River .
So this morning , Intel has announced that it is going to do with VxWorks what it cannot do with Linux — it 's just buying the whole thing .
Intel plans to buy Wind River for a cool $ 884 million in cash , and it seems likely that it plans to extend their Linux strategy to this new OS .
Intel 's announcement on the deal emphasizes that Wind River will be run as a subsidiary of Intel , and that " Wind River will continue to develop innovative , commercial - grade software platforms that support multiple hardware architectures that are optimized for the needs of its many embedded and mobile customers . "
But Intel is n't shy about trumpeting the fact that Wind River will now turn considerable attention to the x86 port of VxWorks .
Though Intel would deny it , because it wants to keep Wind River 's existing customer and revenue base intact for as long as it can , the ultimate result of this will be that the future of VxWorks is with x86 , and any ARM , MIPS , or PowerPC versions of the OS will be demoted to second - class citizen status .
For those of you not familiar with Wind River 's VxWorks , it 's a very popular embedded OS that 's used in everything from cars and appliances to NASA 's Mars rover .
As a proprietary OS , it 's sort of the Windows of the embedded world as far as reach , though embedded folks will hate that analogy because VxWorks is known for being everything that Windows is not , i.e. , lean , mean , and 100 percent bulletproof .
Any way you slice it , this news is a blow to ARM .
Intel would probably have just bought ARM if it would n't raise all sorts of antitrust flags , but buying Wind River was the second best thing .
In this respect , the Intel / VxWorks announcement is almost the mirror image of the ARM / netbook news from yesterday , in that it shows how these two architectures are increasingly coming into direct competition with one another .
Speaking of ARM and OS disappointments , Reuters reports that , " Microsoft 's new Windows 7 operating system will not run on netbooks powered by ARM chips , Microsoft said on Wednesday , a blow to the British firm 's hopes of becoming a big player in the sector . "
In other news , the fact that Microsoft will not give me a gold - plated bust of Bill Gates for my office is a blow to my hopes of becoming a guy with a gold - plated bust of Bill Gates in his office .
Seriously , this Win7 / ARM proposal was a bad idea , so it can't be a blow to anyone that Microsoft declined to waste its time on it .
Microsoft this week accused mobile ringtone and entertainment firm Funmobile for resorting to spamming Windows Live Messenger users to hawk its wares .
In a lawsuit filed in the Washington State superior court for King County against Funmobile , which sometimes does business as Mobilefunster , Microsoft accused company officials of misusing Microsoft 's Windows Live Messenger infrastructure in violation of the terms of service , and said they caused damage by using it to send spam messages .
" Such instant messaging spam , or ' spim , ' can take the fun -- and utility -- out of instant messaging , " Tim Cranton , Microsoft 's associate general counsel for Internet safety enforcement , wrote yesterday on his blog .
He added that so - called " spim " is dangerous .
" Cybercriminals know that for many Internet users , the threat of spim is not yet widely understood , " he said .
" Spim is more than just an annoyance .
It 's a serious threat to online privacy and security .
Spim campaigns that employ phishing tactics to get your account information can put all the personal information associated with your account at risk . "
Funmobile did not return requests for comment by press time .
The lawsuit marks the latest episode in which Funmobile has found itself in hot water .
The company is facing a number of lawsuits relating to its billing practices , with customers claiming that it wrongly slapped them with unauthorized charges for mobile phone content .
At least three lawsuits are in appeal , while a fourth is pending .
Additionally , a number of users have registered complaints against Funmobile billing practices on ClassActionConnect.com , a site set up by law firm KamberEdelson to coordinate class - action efforts .
Complaints against Funmobile billing practices on the site date back to 2007 .
Across the nation , from San Francisco to Boston , the Better Business Bureau gave the company an " F " for failing to solve customer issues including complaints about bait - and - switch advertising , unsubstantiated billing , and unauthorized services .
To obtain IM accounts , Microsoft 's complaint alleges that Funmobile used shady practices to dupe users into thinking a friend recommended their products .
" The Defendants collect and store the user 's Windows Live ID login credentials .
They then utilize those login credentials to access Microsoft 's proprietary systems and to access the user 's account , " the complaint said .
" Defendants then ' scrape ' or ' harvest ' all of the contacts within the user 's account , and send unsolicited bulk IMs to each of the user 's contacts .
As described above , those IMs erroneously purport to be from the user when , in fact , they are simply more misleading commercial solicitations promoting Defendants '
Web sites . "
" This kind of activity is n't just a violation of our terms of service for Windows Live , it 's a violation of our customers ' privacy , " Cranton wrote .
Microsoft's Windows Live team added that the claims of Funmobile 's spim attacks do n't mean that the company does n't work hard to protect its IM users .
" Windows Live takes privacy and security threats very seriously , employing a variety of ever - improving technical , educational and legal means to help keep customers and their data safe , " team members said in a blog post .
" That said , malicious attacks are always a risk , as hackers use increasingly sophisticated tools to circumvent security measures , " they added .
" And while we believe Windows Live is great platform for developers to build companion services on , we do not endorse services purporting to integrate with Windows Live unless they are built by Microsoft or by developers using official Windows Live APIs available at http://dev.live.com. "
Palm itself had warned that the Pre 's iTunes sync functionality could be broken at a moment 's notice ( and at Apple 's whim ) , but we 're pretty sure no one expected it 'd happen this quickly .
We 've been able to confirm that version 8.2.1 of the software prevents the sync from working , meaning that you 've got to add music the old - fashioned way -- the Pre functions as a USB drive , too -- until Palm gets around to patching the hack ( if they decide to patch it , that is ) .
This could end up being a protracted game of cat - and - mouse , which is entertaining to watch but nightmarish for the consumers down in the trenches actually trying to use this stuff .
Funny thing is , Apple 's straight up saying in its release notes that the update " addresses an issue with verification of Apple devices " -- in other words , they were n't being verified before , and now they are , thank goodness .
Peaceful sleep is once again within our reach .
Apple 's now gone beyond the " verification of Apple devices " phrase , calling out the Pre by name in a statement issued to BusinessWeek :
" It also disables devices falsely pretending to be iPods , including the Palm Pre .
As we 've said before , newer versions of Apple 's iTunes software may no longer provide syncing functionality with unsupported digital media players . "
In other words , " we told you this was going to happen , and it did . "
For its part , Palm appears to have re-issued the same statement it made a while back , saying that Apple 's move is a " direct blow " to its users .
Words are one thing , but here 's the real question : is there a quick counterstrike fix planned from Palm 's side ?

Holocaust Museum shooter von Brunn a 9/11 ' truther ' who hated ' neo- cons ' , Bush , McCain
Posted on by LdSentinal
The man accused of opening fire at the Holocaust Museum in Washington , DC on June 10 , James W. von Brunn , left a trail of unhinged writings around the internet .
The anti-semitism of von Brunn is the first thing one notices when visiting these bizarre websites .
However , like those of most " white supremacists " , many of von Brunn 's political views track " Left " rather than " Right . "
Clearly , a re-evaluation of these obsolete definitions is long overdue .
For example , he unleashed his hatred of both Presidents Bush and other " neo-conservatives " in online essays .
As even some " progressives " such as the influential Adbusters magazine publicly admit , " neoconservative " is often used as a derogatory code word for " Jews " .
As well , even a cursory glance at " white supremacist " writings reveals a hatred of , say , big corporations that is virtually indistinguishable from that of anti-globalization activists .
James von Brunn 's advocacy of 9/11 conspiracy theories also gives him an additional commonality with individuals on the far - left .
None of this will surprise readers of Jonah Goldberg 's bestseller Liberal Fascism : The Secret History of the American Left , From Mussolini to the Politics of Change , which clearly demonstrates that " fascism " of the kind advocated by the British National Party ( BNP ) and the likes of James W. von Brunn is just as likely to reflect " leftwing " views as " rightwing " ones .
In fact , anti-semitism is something the New Left and the " Far Right " have had in common since the 1980s , which is why so many former leftists like David Horowitz defected from one side to the other during the Reagan era and beyond .
It also helps explain the otherwise baffling alliance between the Left and radical Islam .
That this shooting occurred shortly after President Obama 's former mentor , Rev. Jeremiah Wright , blamed " the Jews " for his lack of access to his former parishioner is a troubling confluence of events as well .

Something to ponder .
I have said before that those of us who consider ourselves " patriots " who may very well one day have to stand up against our gummint can't begin to organize as " where two or more of you gather " there will also be the BATF , FBI , etc .
So " when the day comes " will it look like this ?

As even some " progressives " such as the influential Adbusters magazine publicly admit , " neoconservative " is often used as a derogatory code word for " Jews " .
A poorly informed writer unless he thinks Irving Kristol is a Jew hater .
The father of neo -conservatism wrote in The Weekly Standard this linked article entitled " The Neoconservative Persuasion " : Michael Tennant breaks it down in the following .
Neoconservatism Made Kristol Clear
by Michael Tennant Memo to Irving Kristol :
Get yourself to a secure , undisclosed location immediately if not sooner .
You are in grave danger .
No , you neednt worry about receiving threats from left - wing loonies like Al Gore or his disciple , the Unabomber .
You dont even have to fear the paleoconservatives and libertarians .
You should , however , keep your eyes open for members of the National Review / Wall Street Journal crowd .
IMPORTANT : If you receive a package in the mail from David Frum , call the bomb squad immediately !
Why do I say Irving Kristol had better keep a close eye on his allies on the official right ?
Simply this :
He recently wrote a piece for The Weekly Standard in which he spelled out exactly what neoconservatism is .
What s worse is that ol Irvs description of neoconservatism proves that it is everything its critics have said it is and worse .
Now that  the godfather of all those neocons ,  as Kristol describes himself , has spoken on the subject ( and written a book entitled Neoconservatism : The Autobiography of an Idea ) , the NR / WSJ crowd can no longer plausibly deny the existence of such a movement , as some have tried to do .
In addition , they can no longer plausibly claim that neoconservatism is merely another form of traditional conservatism .
Nor can they plausibly insist that neoconservatism has anything at all to do with the American founding and tradition of limited government and avoidance of entangling alliances .
Kristol has blown all these arguments out of the water .
Kristol first points out that neoconservatism had its origin among disillusioned liberal intellectuals in the 1970s ,  just in case anyone had any doubts about its ancestry .
At this time the grassroots of the Republican Party , and indeed much of Middle America , was still largely wedded to the ideas of small government at home and a reasonably prudent foreign policy abroad .
Barry Goldwater who Kristol says is politely overlooked  in the neocon pantheon of  20th - century heroes ,  while FDR is included had , after all , been the Republican presidential nominee in 1964 ; and Ronald Reagan , who at least espoused relatively conservative ideas even if he didnt follow through on most of them once in office , was to be elected president in 1980 .
In other words , neocon ideas were not the ideas of the mainstream right at the time , and their prospects werent even looking very bright .
So , says Kristol , one can say that the historical task and political purpose of neoconservatism would seem to be this : to convert the Republican party , and American conservatism in general , against their respective wills , into a new kind of conservative politics suitable to governing a modern democracy .
It s easy to see the liberal and , indeed , Straussian , as Kristol claims Leo Strauss as one of the forerunners of neoconservatism mind at work here .
We , the enlightened ones , will convert  you , the unenlightened , from your backward , parochial ways to our progressive , global ways ; and we will do so against your will , by deception if possible , by force if necessary .
The only genuinely conservative idea Kristol attributes to the neocons is an affinity for cutting tax rates .
Even there , however , Kristol hedges .
It s not that  the particularities of tax cuts . . . interested  the neocons , and it certainly is nt the case that they view tax cuts as a moral imperative .
They are interested in tax cuts only insofar as those cuts stimulate steady economic growth ,  presumably so the natives do not become restless when their bread and circuses peter out and start clamoring for the emperors head .
Kristol notes that the neocon emphasis on economic growth has led to an attitude toward public finance that is far less risk averse than is the case among more traditional conservatives . 
 Neocons ,  he adds , would prefer not to have large budget deficits , but it is in the nature of democracy [ and here he may be onto something ] . . . that one sometimes must shoulder budgetary deficits as the cost ( temporary , one hopes ) of pursuing economic growth . 
In other words , to heck with the future !
Open the floodgates of the treasury while at the same time reducing the revenues coming in , and dont worry about how your children and grandchildren are going to pay the bills .
What matters now is economic growth to keep the sheeple fat , dumb , and happy so that we neocons can retain and expand our power at their expense .
In case what he has written thus far has still failed to convince the reader that neoconservatism is merely a variant on liberalism , Kristol then opens up both barrels with his description of the neocon view of the state .
 Neocons do not like the concentration of services in the welfare state and are happy to study [ note that he doesnt say implement ] alternative ways of delivering these services .
But they are impatient with the Hayekian notion that we are on  the road to serfdom . 
Neocons do not feel that kind of alarm or anxiety about the growth of the state in the past century , seeing it as natural , indeed inevitable . 
Why , really , should they be alarmed ?
The state is their god , and they derive their power from expanding its reach .
As far as Kristol is concerned , the  19th - century idea of government as the enemy of human freedom was a historical eccentricity .
Here again one can see the Marxist mind of former liberals at work :
The total state is inevitable , so why fight it ?
Accept it , enjoy it , and get as much as you can out of it .
Stop fretting about lost liberty .
As a result ,  [ n ] eocons feel at home in todays America to a degree that more traditional conservatives do not . 
Now for the big subject of the day : foreign policy , the area of American politics where neoconservatism has recently been the focus of media attention ,  as Kristol puts it .
That , of course , is because neocon foreign policy is exemplified by precisely the foreign policy that the Bush administration has implemented , contrary to Bushs paean to a humbler foreign policy while campaigning .
It seeks to dominate the world at any cost , sending troops to far - flung countries ( Afghanistan , Iraq , Liberia ) in pursuit of , well , hegemony , in the guise of bringing liberation and democracy to the oppressed of the world .
It is completely contrary to the vision of the Founding Fathers and to the American tradition , which is why it had to be imposed on us against our will as well .
Kristol claims that there is no set of neoconservative beliefs concerning foreign policy , only a set of attitudes derived from historical experience .
He lists three theses  guiding neocon foreign policy and adds , parenthetically , as a Marxist would say . 
( The apple certainly doesnt fall far from the tree .
Does it , Irving ? )
Those three theses that patriotism is a good thing , that world government is a bad thing , and that statesmen should be able to distinguish friends from enemies seem relatively harmless .
To be fair , Kristol is right in saying that there are no core principles behind neocon foreign policy because these three theses  seem to have little or nothing to do with the paragraphs that follow .
Essentially , neocon foreign policy is that might makes right .
Oh , Kristol doesnt come right out and say this , but his words add up to the same thing .
For a great power ,  he writes ,  the national interest is not a geographical term . 
That is , U.S. foreign policy should not be confined to safeguarding the territorial United States .
Oh , no .
We must be concerned with the entire world .
 A larger nation has more extensive interests .
And large nations , whose identity is ideological , like the Soviet Union of yesteryear and the United States of today , inevitably have ideological interests in addition to more material concerns . 
Yes , according to Irving Kristol , neocon foreign policy applies equally to the Soviet Union and the United States , both of whom have ( or had , in the case of the Soviets ) ideological interests  which trump mere territorial concerns .
Kristol further notes that since the U.S. will always feel obliged to defend . . . a democratic nation under attack from nondemocratic forces ,  the neocons thus feel it necessary to defend Israel today . 
Apparently only the holding of elections , not what those elected governments  policies are , matters to neocons , and even then they re more than willing to give some leeway to cooperative dictators .
Once again , I must give Kristol credit for being accurate in his assessment that no central principles ( other than the one left unmentioned , spelled p - o - w - e - r ) guide the neocons in their quest for national greatness  ( as Kristols equally arrogant son , William , put it ) .
It s clear , though , that this power - grubbing , world - dominating foreign policy is certainly not in the interest of the average American , which is why he has to be converted against his will by the neocons .
Kristol continues to celebrate the power of the U. S. , and he notes that [w ] ith power come responsibilities , whether sought or not , whether welcome or not .
And it is a fact that if you have the kind of power we now have , either you will find opportunities to use it , or the world will discover them for you . 
The neocons , of course , are not content to let the world find uses for the power theyve worked so hard to achieve .
As a matter of fact , they re more than happy to find opportunities to use it .
Whether those opportunities  are in the best interest of the country or the world is irrelevant ; all that matters is that the neocons are the ones finding the opportunities and wielding the power .
Finally , in case any doubt remains as to whether the Bush administration qualifies as neoconservative and there are still some out there who believe it remains fully within the American conservative tradition Kristol puts all doubt to rest .
Bush and his administration , he says , turn out to be quite at home in this new political environment , although it is clear they did not anticipate this role any more than their party as a whole did . 
Face it , says Kristol : Weve won , and you traditional conservatives in the Republican Party never saw it coming and still dont know what hit you .
Unfortunately , hes right .
What 's not to like about neo-cons ?
Their plans sound inter-denominational to me .
There is no linkage between the neo-cons and the Jews and any attempt to say otherwise is said to whitewash a despicable political agenda called neoconservatism .

I disagree .
If the Tiller the killer murderer can be labeled by the left as a representative of Christians and pro-lifers .
And therefore we are directly responsible for Tiller ’s death .....
Then howzabout the right wingers look at this guy as a typical leftist Bush hating - neocon hating - anti-semite liberal .
No doubt he voted for Obama .
Those type always do .

China poised to go all out with clean tech DISPATCH FROM CHRONICLE FOREIGN SERVICE
BEIJING - DECEMBER 13 : A mother and child walk past a wind turbine on the south bank of Guanting Reservoir on December 13 , 2007 in Beijing , China .
Beijing has put forward " Green Olympics " as one of the three themes for the 2008 Olympic Games .
Guanting Wind Power
Field will begin operation at the end of this month with 33 wind turbines producing 50,000 kw , according to local media .
China has accelerated its development of wind resources and other clean energy to meet its vast long - term energy needs , and help to achieve the " Green Olympic " goal .

China is at a crossroads .
This nation of 1.3 billion people is faced with the daunting task of building on its 30 years of unprecedented economic development without further damage to its environment .
Currently , one - third of China 's rivers are polluted ; one - fourth of its territory is desert while another one - third suffers from severe soil erosion and drought ; more than three - fourths of its forests are gone ; urban residents are forced to breathe air containing lead , mercury , sulfur dioxide and other elements of coal - burning and car exhaust .
The number of cars is expected to grow from 33 million to 130 million in the next 12 years and every 30 seconds a baby is born with pollution - related birth defects .
Just last year , China overtook the United States as the world 's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide .
By 2030 , the International Energy Agency says China 's emissions will be 41 percent greater than those of the United States .
How China meets these challenges will have major global implications , says Peggy Liu , founder of the nonprofit Joint U.S. - China Cooperation on Clean Energy with offices in San Francisco , Beijing and Shanghai .
" China is the battlefront in the war of energy , " said Liu , one of Time Magazine 's 2008 " Heroes of the Environment . "
Giddy over new energy
In fact , Chinese and Silicon Valley venture capitalists are giddy over alternative energy programs as the best way to maintain economic growth , stave off environmental devastation and turn China into the world 's leading provider of clean energy technology .
The nation already is set to become the global leader in wind energy , according to Greenpeace China .
" The domestic demand for technologies that clean up the environment and energy - efficient technologies represents a huge market opportunity for entrepreneurs , " said Forrest Zhong , general partner at the Shanghai office of the Menlo Park venture capitalist firm , Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers .
" Clean tech , green jobs , climate change , this is what everyone is talking about , " added Patrick Tam , a UC Berkeley graduate in bioengineering and general partner of the Beijing venture capital firm , China Environment Fund .
Liu points to several government laws and targets : imposing regulations backed by fines on industries that refuse to reduce emissions and adopt energy - efficient technologies ; increasing industrial energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2010 and reaching 10 percent of the country 's power output from renewable energy by 2010 and 15 percent by 2020 .
In March , Beijing announced it would devote nearly $ 31 billion of its $ 586 billion stimulus package to " energy conservation and environment . "
China also recently announced plans to spend $ 3 billion to subsidize the purchase of as many as 60,000 hybrid , electric and fuel - cell vehicles by 2012 for use in 13 major cities , including Shanghai and Beijing and provide subsidies of $ 8,800 to local governments that purchase electric cars for their fleets .
The government has already ordered fuel - efficiency standards to jump from 36 mpg in 2008 to 43 mpg in 2009 in contrast to the current 25 mpg in the United States
" China is not waiting for anybody , " said Liu .
" China has environmental policies that are eons more progressive than in the U.S. China has already made the decision to go green in full force . "
But most analysts agree that China must solve its biggest environmental headache - coal .
China , which uses more coal than the United States , the European Union and Japan combined - 39 percent of annual world coal consumption - fires up a new coal - fired power plant every week , according to the Woodrow Wilson Center of International Scholars .
The sulfur dioxide in coal combustion not only contributes to global warming and acid rain that poisons waterways , but also causes some 700,000 premature deaths a year , according to the World Bank .
Coal , which currently produces about 70 percent of China 's energy and half of U.S. electricity , is " not going to go away anytime soon , " said Tam .
" The U.S. has a long history of experience using coal in a cleaner way , " and " a lot of that technology could be used in China to help solve its problems . "
Two such joint efforts are already under way .
Coal agreement
Last December , the United States and China signed a $ 250 million agreement to develop a joint clean coal production plant in Inner Mongolia , which is expected to open in 2010 and produce 1.5 million tons of clean coal annually .
Another initiative is a joint research project between Stanford University and Beijing 's Tsinghua University on producing clean coal without emitting carbon dioxide .
Even though many environmentalists say clean coal is a fantasy - " it 's like healthy cigarettes , " Al Gore said last year - China hopes these joint ventures will develop technologies that focus on the environmental impact of coal extraction , the high cost of sequestering carbon , and improved management of resulting pollutants .
In the meantime , investors and consumers alike must overcome a " lack of confidence " in clean energy technologies , supporters say .
" Clean tech is still expensive to adopt and once everybody can afford it , it will become a huge industry employing hundreds of millions of people , " said Zhong of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers .
" Very much like automotive and computer industries but in a much larger magnitude . "
Here is an inspirational dubstep and rock tune titled “ The Light ” from US based TH!S. TH!S got this to say about the track : “ Basically , I threw all my despair over guitars & beat to make sure everyone knows that if they are feeling worn down or like they ca n’t go on that there is light [… ]

Text of President Mary McAleese 's speech : Click here
Victims of Church child abuse wept yesterday as Irish President Mary McAleese apologized for their suffering on behalf of the people of the Republic .
For many of them , now senior citizens , it was the first time they shed such tears of joy .
More than 280 victims of institutional abuse traveled from near and far to Aras an Uachtarain yesterday to hear the President , according to the Belfast Telegraph .
McAleese spoke of the painful lives endured by thousands of children who had suffered institutional abuse , as laid out graphically in the Ryan Report .
“ For so long your suffering seemed to make strangers of you in your own land . ”
Older men and women in the audience spoke of feeling “ free ” for the first time after they emerged from the Presidential home in Phoenix Park .
One attendee , John Kelly , had lived on the streets of London after he suffered horrific abuse at the Daingean reformatory .
Yesterday he said the meeting with the President had been an historic occasion for many of the 14,000 abuse victims who fled Ireland .
He praised the President for giving them the desire to be Irish again and calling for the perpetrators of abuse to be prosecuted .
“ I spent 33 years in England , ” he said .
“ I slept on benches in Hyde Park .
It was safer than those places .
People would n’t come back .
Why would they , for a state that did n’t care about them ?
“ Today ’s the first day the State has acknowledged ‘ You ’re Irish and have rights ’ and it ’s 48 or 50 years too late .
But this President has done that and that has given us hope and inspiration .
And now we ’re proud to be Irish . ”
He said he had seen dozens of old and frail faces light up as the President spoke to them .
As children , they had been tried for offences they did not commit before being thrown into institutions , he said .
“ Half of them emigrated and we brought many of these people back here today .
“ Before they die , they have heard the President saying ‘ We were wrong . ' "

IT 'S FREE Taxpayers are on the hook for an extra $ 55,000 a household to cover rising federal commitments made just in the past year for retirement benefits , the national debt and other government promises , a USA TODAY analysis shows .
The 12 % rise in red ink in 2008 stems from an explosion of federal borrowing during the recession , plus an aging population driving up the costs of Medicare and Social Security .
That 's the biggest leap in the long - term burden on taxpayers since a Medicare prescription drug benefit was added in 2003 .
The latest increase raises federal obligations to a record $ 546,668 per household in 2008 , according to the USA TODAY analysis .
That 's quadruple what the average U.S. household owes for all mortgages , car loans , credit cards and other debt combined .
" We have a huge implicit mortgage on every household in America — except , unlike a real mortgage , it 's not backed up by a house , " says David Walker , former U.S. comptroller general , the government 's top auditor .
USA TODAY used federal data to compute all government liabilities , from Treasury bonds to Medicare to military pensions .
Bottom line :
The government took on $ 6.8 trillion in new obligations in 2008 , pushing the total owed to a record $ 63.8 trillion .
The numbers measure what 's needed today — set aside in a lump sum , earning interest — to pay benefits that wo n't be covered by future taxes .
Congress can reduce or increase the burden by changing laws that determine taxes and benefits for programs such as Medicare and Social Security .
Rep. Jim Cooper , D - Tenn. , says exploding debt has focused attention on the government 's financial challenges .
" More and more , people are worried about our fiscal future , " he says .
Key federal obligations : • Social Security .
It will grow by 1 million to 2 million beneficiaries a year from 2008 through 2032 , up from 500,000 a year in the 1990s , its actuaries say .
Average benefit : $ 12,089 in 2008 .
• Medicare .
More than 1 million a year will enroll starting in 2011 when the first Baby Boomer turns 65 .
Average 2008 benefit : $ 11,018 .
• Retirement programs .
Congress has not set aside money to pay military and civil servant pensions or health care for retirees .
These unfunded obligations have increased an average of $ 300 billion a year since 2003 and now stand at $ 5.3 trillion .

EATR is an autonomous robotic platform able to perform long - range , long - endurance military missions without the need for manual or conventional re-fueling .
The patent pending robotic system can find , ingest and extract energy from biomass in the environment , as well as use conventional and alternative fuels ( such as gasoline , diesel , propane and solar ) when suitable .

It 's actually a steam - powered machine , which employs a biomass furnace that can be fed by all manner of organic materials , harvested with its " gripper " claw and chainsaw .
The EATR 's ideal source of fuel would probably be foliage , not humans , but there are just too many red flags here .
Claws ?
Chainsaws ?
" Organic matter " and " biomass " euphemisms ?
Not to mention this is the second death - powered machine we 've seen in as many weeks .
The project is set to be completed in about 90 days , so enjoy the next three months , folks .

I ’m proud to announce that the new versions of Pyevolve will have Genetic Programming support ; after some time fighting with these evil syntax trees , I think I have a very easy and flexible implementation of GP in Python .
I was tired to see people giving up and trying to learn how to implement a simple GP using the hermetic libraries for C/C++ and Java ( unfortunatelly I ’m a Java web developer hehe ) .
The implementation is still under some tests and optimization , but it ’s working nice , here is some details about it :
The implementation has been done in pure Python , so we still have many bonus from this , but unfortunatelly we lost some performance .
The GP core is very very flexible , because it compiles the GP Trees in Python bytecodes to speed the execution of the function .
So , you can use even Python objects as terminals , or any possible Python expression .
Any Python function can be used too , and you can use all power of Python to create those functions , which will be automatic detected by the framework using the name prefix =)
As you can see in the source - code , you do n’t need to bind variables when calling the syntax tree of the individual , you simple use the “ getCompiledCode ” method which returns the Python compiled function ready to be executed .
Here is a source - code example :
from pyevolve import * import math error_accum = Util.ErrorAccumulator ( ) #
This is the functions used by the GP core , # Pyevolve will automatically detect them # and the they number of arguments def gp_add ( a , b ) : return a+b def gp_sub ( a , b ) : return a - b def gp_mul ( a , b ) : return a*b def gp_sqrt ( a ) : return math.sqrt(abs ( a ) ) def eval_func( chromosome ) : global error_accum error_accum.reset ( ) code_comp = chromosome.getCompiledCode( ) for a in xrange ( 0 , 5 ) : for b in xrange ( 0 , 5 ) : # The eval will execute a pre-compiled syntax tree # as a Python expression , and will automatically use # the " a " and " b " variables ( the terminals defined ) evaluated = eval ( code_comp ) target = math. sqrt (( a*a ) +( b* b ) ) error_accum += ( target , evaluated ) return error_accum.getRMSE( ) def main_run ( ) : genome = GTree.GTreeGP ( ) genome.setParams(max_depth=5 , method= " ramped " ) genome.evaluator.set( eval_func ) ga = GSimpleGA.GSimpleGA( genome ) #
This method will catch and use every function that # begins with " gp " , but you can also add them manually .
#
The terminals are Python variables , you can use the # ephemeral random consts too , using ephemeral:random.randint ( 0,2 ) # for example .
ga.setParams( gp_terminals = [ 'a ' , 'b ' ] , gp_function_prefix = " gp " ) #
You can even use a function call as terminal , like " func ( ) " # and Pyevolve will use the result of the call as terminal ga.setMinimax ( Consts.minimaxType[" minimize " ] ) ga.setGenerations( 1000 ) ga.setMutationRate(0.08 ) ga.setCrossoverRate( 1.0 ) ga.setPopulationSize(2000 ) ga.evolve ( freq_stats=5 ) print ga.bestIndividual( ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : main_run ( )
I ’m very happy and testing the possibilities of this GP implementation in Python .
And of course , everything in Pyevolve can be visualized any time you want ( click to enlarge ) :
The visualization is very flexible too , if you use Python decorators to set how functions will be graphical represented , you can have many interesting visualization patterns .
If I change the function “ gp_add ” to :
@GTree.gpdec( representation= " + " , color= " red " ) def gp_add ( a , b ) : return a+b
We ’ll got the follow visualization ( click to enlarge ) :
I hope you enjoyed it , I ’m currently fixing some bugs , implementing new features , docs and preparing the next release of Pyevolve , which will take some time yet =)
In 2006 I was sexually assaulted .
I never expected to blog about it .
One evening in DC , a stranger grabbed me as I walked from the metro stop to my apartment after work .
I wish I could say I screamed or fought back , but I was too horrified .
Instead I could only stare in disbelief at the jackass holding me down .
This can't be happening .
In a desperate scramble I somehow managed to break away before it escalated to rape and ran inside my building .
He winked and blew a kiss from behind the glass door , as if to say ' oh well , next time ' .
I was the third women in the neighborhood to report a similar story to police in two weeks -- also the luckiest .
The experience forever shattered a false sense of security , knowing that to monsters like this man , I ’m nothing more than conquest , having no identity beyond what I can potentially provide for them .
The reward is n't about sex -- but subjugation and power .
And I will not be a silent witness to rape .
* * * * * * * * * * * * Today begins a very important initiative called Silence Is The Enemy to help a generation of young women half a world away .
Why ?
Because they are our sisters and children -- the victims of sexual abuse who do n't have the means to ask for help .
We have power in our words and influence .
Along with our audience , we 're able to speak for them .
I 'm asking all of you -- bloggers , writers , teachers , and concerned citizens -- to use whatever platform you have to call for an end to the rape and abuse of women and girls in Liberia and around the world .
In regions where fighting has formally ended , rape continues to be used as a weapon .
As Nicholas Kristof recently wrote from West Africa , 'it has been easier to get men to relinquish their guns than their sense of sexual entitlement . '
The war has shattered norms , training some men to think that ' when they want sex , they need simply to overpower a girl . '
An International Rescue Committee survey suggests 12 percent of girls aged 17 and under acknowledged having been sexually abused in some way over the previous 18 months .
Further , of the 275 new sexual violence cases treated Jan-April by Doctors Without Borders , 28 percent involve children aged 4 or younger , and 33 percent involve children aged 5 through 12 .
That 's 61 % age 12 or under .
We read about their plight and see the figures , but it 's so easy to feel helpless to act in isolation .
But these are not statistics , they are girls .
Together we can do more .
Mass rape persists because of inertia so let 's create momentum .
The movement began a couple weeks ago after I was feeling particularly outraged after reading Kristof 's terrific NYTimes piece
. I wondered aloud to Isis
how we might draw attention to the mass rape taking place across the globe .
Very soon we began coordinating a blogospheric awareness campaign to say 1 ) this is happening 2 ) it 's completely monstrous , and 3 ) we want change .
But acknowledgment is n't enough - - people have to be motivated to care and act .
We want folks thinking about these girls beyond a single morning they read a few coordinated posts .
Silence Is The Enemy was born -- so named because we will not be .
All through June , I 'll continue posting information , details , benchmarks , and let everyone know about progress made , new initiatives , and stories from the region .
I encourage others to do so as possible .

By me - 15/7/2009 08:02 - United States
Today , at 3:00 am , I sat with my 3 year - old adopted daughter while she tried to go back to sleep .
She had had a nightmare , and I read that " not leaving " was the most important thing a father could do .
My wife woke and called me a pervert for sitting there .

In April 2007 , 26 people from the U.S. Justice Department , local law enforcement , the military , academia , and civil society came together at the behest of the National Institute of Justice ( NIJ ) , the research arm of the Justice Department , to consider the issue of “ nonlethal ” weapons development .
In April 2007 , 26 people from the U.S. Justice Department , local law enforcement , the military , academia , and civil society came together at the behest of the National Institute of Justice ( NIJ ) , the research arm of the Justice Department , to consider the issue of “ nonlethal ” weapons development .
Based on the findings of this meeting , Penn State University won a $ 250,000 contract to conduct further research into new incapacitating chemical weapons –for example , sedatives , anaesthetics , morphine - like analgesic chemical agents , and certain brain - signalling bioregulators –for police use in the United States and “ operationalize ” these weapons .
To market these weapons as somehow separate from the chemical and biological weapons that are banned by international treaties , they are being given new , obfuscating names .
In this intentional narrative , chemical weapons become “ calmatives ” or “ advanced riot control agents . ”
And they are promoted as part of a group of so - called “ nonlethal ” weapons .
Worse yet , the semantic confusions go farther .
These weapons are n’t really weapons at all but “ capabilities , ” “ technologies , ” and “ techniques . ”
Similarly , other weapons under this umbrella lose their descriptive edge : laser weapons become “ optical distractors , ” acoustic weapons become “ acoustic hailing devices , ” and electrical weapons become “ electromuscular incapacitation devices . ”
This marketing language is pervasive .
In a 2000 Penn State report that inspired the 2007 NIJ meeting , the word “ weapon ” is n’t used once even though the report is a complete exploration of the potential range for new chemical and biochemical technologies .
The 2007 NIJ meeting , convened under the title “ Community Acceptance Panel–Riot Control Agents , ” discussed incapacitating chemical weapons as a potential subset of riot control agents , echoing suggestions in a 1959 U.S. Defense Science Board report that they should be described as “ reinforced tear gas ” or “ super tear gas ” in order to avoid public opposition and circumnavigate legal restrictions .
In 1990 , the U.S. Army rebranded their Incapacitating Chemical Program , which focused on the weaponization of fentanyl - related opioid chemicals , renaming it the Riot Control Program .
A plan for a new chemical grenade emerged from this work .
They called it the “ advanced riot control agent device , ” but the fentanyl payload remained the same .
The reason for this rebranding ?
The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) , which outlawed the use of any toxic chemical as a weapon , was entering the latter stages of negotiation .
The CWC makes an exception for the use of riot control agents , such as tear gas , which it permits for use in “ law enforcement including domestic riot control , ” defining these agents as any chemicals that “ can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure . ”
Anaesthetics , sedatives , and morphine - like analgesic chemical agents do n’t fit this description .
Nor do brain - signalling bioregulators .
This was illustrated starkly in 2002 when a fentanyl - related chemical was used to end the siege of a Moscow theater , killing 129 of more than 800 hostages .
But with the soft terminology of “ nonlethal ” weapons , these chemical and biochemical weapons are being included in the same category as tear gas and pepper spray .
These semantic strategies are intimately and dangerously linked to efforts to push the legal boundaries of what is acceptable under the CWC .
Not only have weapon developers and promoters sought to squeeze incapacitating agents into the riot control agent category , but they have sought to widen the use of riot control agents to warfare , which is clearly prohibited by the CWC .
U.S. military officials have gone so far as to say that research and development of incapacitating chemical weapons will continue “ as long as it is cost - productive to do so . ”
Furthermore , these officials suggest that if there are technologies that the Defense Department is banned from pursuing , they will subcontract the work to the Justice or Energy departments .
Meanwhile , Defense is busy working on a variety of chemical delivery systems , including airburst munitions and long - range 155 - millimeter mortar rounds , but no one will say what they ’re going to put in them .
In answering criticisms of these weapon programs , proponents may repeat the mantra that advances in science and technology , particularly in the pharmaceutical industry , will deliver the breakthroughs necessary to create the harmless sleeping gas of fictional James Bond portrayals .
However , this is currently beyond the realm of scientific , technical , or operational possibility .
Thus , scientists , doctors , and the pharmaceutical industry should resist this parasitic relationship , which seeks to coopt progress in drug development for anaesthesia and treatment of mental illness and subvert it for use in new chemical or biochemical weapons to control , manipulate , and incapacitate .
The British Medical Association has already stated that it will resist this process and that others should follow suit .
Even if future technical advances were to enable the development of new chemical weapons that do n’t risk significant deaths in operational conditions , the wider public must ask itself whether the police and militaries of the future ( not to mention the criminals , terrorists , torturers , and dictators ) should have access to chemical weapons to manipulate human cognition , perception , emotion , motivation , performance , and consciousness .
The 2007 NIJ meeting was seemingly held in an international security vacuum .
While those in the defense and security communities warn of emerging external threats from rationally engineered agents that target specific biological processes to cause incapacitation , impairment , or death , they are missing the elephant in the room .
( See , for example , “ Biotechnology : Impacts of Biological Warfare and Biodefense ” and “ Globalization , Biosecurity , and the Future of the Life Sciences ” . )
Specifically , states that highlight external threats posed by countries or non-state actors seeking chemical and biological weapons for terrorism or mass destruction need to look at the proliferation threats within , which proceed unchecked .
If the world wants to avoid a renaissance of chemical and biological weapons , it ’s time for policy makers to come to grips with this issue before it ’s too late .
It ’s a glaring contradiction : Chemical weapons are promoted as counterterrorism weapons on one hand , while the grave external threat to international security from the proliferation of the very same class of weapons is simultaneously espoused .
The two are separated by a gulf in public relations –“ nonlethal ” weapons versus weapons of mass destruction .
The international community , particularly countries such as the United States , Russia , and the Czech Republic that are developing these weapons , should recognize that the societal costs of pursuing new incapacitating chemical weapons are far greater than any perceived operational benefits for policing or counterterrorism and put a halt to them immediately .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - New swine flu infections were found around the world on Tuesday and the specter of a pandemic hit the travel industry as governments warned people to stay away from Mexico where 149 people have died .
The number of infections in the United States rose to 65 , Canada has 13 , and new cases were also confirmed in Israel and New Zealand .
The United States , Canada and the European Union are telling people to avoid non-essential travel to Mexico , and Cuba suspended all flights to and from Mexico for 48 hours .
Travel companies were also staying away .
Carnival Cruises canceled stops at Mexican ports for three of its ships on Tuesday and Canadian tour operator Transat AT postponed flights to Mexico until June 1 .
President Barack Obama asked the U.S. Congress for $ 1.5 billion to finance its response to the flu threat , and California declared a state of emergency , allowing it to deploy more resources to prevent new infections .
The World Health Organization said a pandemic -- a global outbreak of a serious new illness -- is not yet inevitable but that all countries should prepare for the worst , especially poorer developing nations .
“ They really get hit disproportionately hard , ” said the WHO ’s acting assistant director - general Dr. Keiji Fukuda .
One of the mysteries of the outbreak is why the virus has killed scores of people in Mexico while the cases outside the country have been relatively mild and no one has died .
Experts say this may be simply a matter of where they have been looking to find it and officials say they expect to find deaths as the disease spreads .
A pandemic could snuff out fragile signs of economic recovery around the world as travel , trade and manufacturing output would all be hit .
The last flu pandemic was in 1968 , when “ Hong Kong ” flu killed about 1 million people around the world .
Seven countries have confirmed cases of the swine flu and a dozen others have suspected infections .
Mexico City is at the center of the outbreak and many residents are staying in their homes while schools , churches , cinemas and restaurants have all been shut down .
Airline share prices declined again on Tuesday on fears that they could experience a sharp drop in traffic .
U.S. , European and Asian stock markets all retreated despite positive U.S. consumer confidence data as flu fears and worries about American banks weighed on sentiment .
“ Prices remain in a bit of a swoon as market participants fret that a potential influenza pandemic might prove fatal to the frail signs of recovery just beginning to show , ” said Mike Fitzpatrick , vice president at MF Global in New York .
Oil dropped almost 2 percent to below $ 50 a barrel and investors cut their exposure to riskier currencies .

The swine flu virus is not caught from eating pig meat products but several countries , led by Russia and China , banned U.S. pork imports .
The EU said it has no plans to restrict pig meat products from the United States .
TRAVEL ALERTS
A barrage of travel warnings by foreign governments and travel firms threatened to batter Mexico ’s tourism industry , a main source of foreign currency for the country .
UK travel firms Thomson Holidays and First Choice decided to repatriate their customers from Mexico and cancel flights bound for Cancun , although most airlines continued to operate their services .
Slideshow ( 36 images )
Many private companies took their own precautions , restricting travel to Mexico and other countries with confirmed cases .
Honda Motor
Co , which like most major auto makers has production facilities in Mexico , has suspended all global business travel until at least May 6 .
Experts say that while it is impossible to stop the spread of the disease , efforts to slow its progress could buy crucial time for countries to procure essential drugs .
The WHO ’s Fukuda said a mild pandemic is possible but he also cautioned that the 1918 “ Spanish ” flu that killed tens of millions of people emerged from mild beginnings .
Worldwide , seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year .
In Mexico , people from company directors to couriers wore face masks while airlines checked passengers for flu symptoms .
The government has shut all schools across Mexico until at least May 6 .
Restaurants , bars , cinemas and even churches in the capital have been closed to limit new infections .
Residents rushed to stock up on food , water and surgical masks but the usually hectic city is otherwise very quiet .
Mexico says the first fatal case that alerted authorities to the strange new virus was in the southern state of Oaxaca but they have not yet found the origin of the outbreak .
… while leaving the carcass and feathers intact !
Issue # 79 • January / February , 2003
Figure 1 .
With a trash bag properly fitted around the chicken , clean up will be easy .
When I was 12 years old Grandpa would let me help him pluck whole chickens after we had dipped them in scalding hot water in a washtub .
That was the way he sold whole chickens to stores with his family business .
One day I asked Grandpa , “ Is n’t there an easier way to dress out a chicken ? ”
He showed me a method with no need to pluck feathers and no smelly stench from a wet chicken .
It ’s just a fast , easy way to put meat on the table .
Things you will need
A sharp knife , axe , meat cleaver , or machete for cutting off the head .
Rope .
Cut 3 or 4 pieces of ¼- inch rope 12 to 18 inches long .
One is to tie the chicken ’s legs together tightly before you cut the head off ; otherwise you will have a headless chicken running about the yard .
The other is to tie the chicken ’s legs onto your hook on a tree or cart .
Figure 2 .
Front view showing where the cuts are made and how the skin is peeled away
A bowl .
I use a stainless steel one but any large bowl or panwill do .
Put your chicken in it once you cut it away from the carcass .
A large bowl of water .
Again I use a stainless steel one .
It ’s to keep my hands and knife clean while skinning the chickens .
I use two sawhorses for a table base , over which I placed a sheet of ¾-inch plywood 24 x 48 inches .
If you have a small folding table you could use it .
A clean sheet of plastic or butcher ’s paper big enough to cover your work table top .
Tape it on or tuck it under the table top .
I use my trusty cart , setting it up on end .
The handle bar is just the right height for me to hang the chickens from and skin .
I put a concrete block in it while I ’m pulling the skin downward so the cart will not fall on me .
A garden hose is handy to clean your knives and to pre-clean the chicken of any dirt or feathers before they are taken into the house for final cleaning and freezing preparation .
A large black garbage bag with two twist ties that hold the garbage bag on the cart .
Cut the garbage bag two - thirds of the way down so that anything you cut off while skinning , such as the feathers and carcass , goes into the bag ( Figure 1 ) .
The process
Now you are ready to butcher and skin the chicken .
Figure 3 . A view showing how to cut away the mini-wing drumstick
Tie the chicken ’s legs together and cut off its head .
Then hang the chicken up by its legs ( see Figure 2 ) with the breast of the chicken facing you .
Make the first cut around the yellow part of the leg joint only deep enough to separate the skin , but not deep enough to cut the leg tendon .
Cut and pull down the skin from the leg , cutting just deep enough that the skin will come loose from around the meat .
Pull the skin of the chicken down laterally to each side , all the time cutting away the other skin to reveal the leg meat that you will cut off later .
Figure 4 .
The skinned carcass , ready for you to take the meat
Continue to cut and pull the skin all the way down and backwards around the upper thigh .
Continue to cut and pull the skin down around the breast and cut the wing loose at the first joint of the wing ( Figure 3 ) .
Some people may want to continue to clean and cut around the feathers of the wing for the small tip of the wing bones , but for me there is so little meat it is not worth it .
It ’s as easy as 1 , 2 , 3
Now we are ready to strip the skinned carcass ( Figure 4 ) .
First , cut the wings , or mini- drumsticks , off at the joint near the breast .
By forcing them backwards and cutting as close to the breast and joint as possible , you will expose the wing joint and you can cut through and around it .
Next , cut the breast out .
Lay your knife at an angle , starting the cut as close to the breastbone as possible .
Figure 5 . Side view showing where to cut the meat
Take your knife and stay close to the rib cage while cutting downward and backward in an arcing direction as shown in Figure 5 .
Repeat the process on the other breast .
You are ready to claim the legs and thighs all in one piece .
If you want to separate them later you can do so .
Go up to the ankle joint at about ¾ to 1 inch above the “ leggin ’s ” ( that ’s what I call the scaly yellow part above the feet on the chicken ) , and cut through and around the joint so that each leggin ’ and foot falls free .
While holding the drumstick and thigh in the left hand , take your right hand and hold the carcass while at the same time pushing the thigh and drumstick backwards .
This is like opening a set of French doors .
You will both see and hear the thigh joint pop loose from the hip joint .
Cut as close to the round point as possible ( Figure 5 ) .
To separate the thigh from the carcass , make the next and final cut at the back upper part of the thigh , just about 1 ½ to 2 inches next to the anus .
You now have a complete thigh and drumstick .
Some folks might say that you are not getting all the meat , that you are leaving the two small bony pieces on the wing tip , the two little scraps of meat on the backbone , the liver , and the neck .
I say if you like those parts , go for it .
Figure 6 .
The results of a freshly skinned and butchered chicken .
100 + years in our family
With this method , I have butchered chickens for more than 40 years , just like my grandfather did for 60 years before me .
I can remember that Grandma ’s chicken fried in a cast iron skillet beat Col.
Sanders by a mile .
Raising your own stock , whether it be young chicks to fryer size , rabbits , goats , or beef cattle can be a family affair .
Children gain knowledge , learn responsibility , and the necessary basics of self - sufficiency .
It does n't get much more straight forward than this .
Either you side with those struggling against an oppressive state , facing down armed thugs and paramilitaries on the streets - those being beaten , intimidated , threatened and shot - or you side with oppression .
You do n't need to support the apparent ' leaders ' of the movement - in fact you can find them quite repulsive - and you do n't need to have any illusions about their democratic credentials .
What matters is that a genuine popular movement against a repressive state is sweeping through Iran and that it brings with it the promise of real democratic gains and the extension of liberty .
Movements like this develop a dynamic of their own - and one that it is often difficult for its fundamentally conservative leaders to contain .
It is clear that a wide range of political and social forces are throwing their weight behind the anti-government demonstrations including the Iranian Left and other progressive forces .
This movement , and right now only this movement , can smash the most reactionary aspects of the Iranian state regime - the legally embedded misogyny , the murderous homophobia , the stonings , the hangings , the execution of children , the repression of trade unions , the incarceration of political prisoners .
With ( a lot of ) luck it may even go further than this - this sort of struggle can take people beyond liberal demands into a much more radical consciousness very quickly .
It 's deeply depressing then to see sections of the British Left equivocating and fence - sitting in relation to the anti Ahmadinejad demonstrations - refusing to take sides ( although I suspect that this refusal often masks - very thinly - a preference for Ahmadinejad ) .
Worse still , some individuals have come out openly in support of Ahmadinejad and the reactionary regime he heads .
Galloway for example - who surely now should n't be touched with a ten foot pole .
It 's clear that this is shaping up to be a watershed moment for the UK Left and one that could have very liberating effects - whatever the outcome in Iran .
It looks to me like a lot of the more noxious baggage gathered over the past few years can now be , and must be , dumped and some basic principles reaffirmed .
We can ditch the apologetics , the theoretical acrobatics and the bad conscience .
We can start to breathe freely again .
Some socialists have chosen the wrong side - or at best , refuse to choose the right side .
This is simply the logical outcome of some of the bad politics of recent years - some became so thoroughly immersed in it that they drowned .
But they are clearly in a minority .
Thank god .

Discovered 1930s Notes and Bonds
July 2005
The Federal Reserve is aware of several scams involving high denomination Federal Reserve notes and bonds , often in denominations of 100 million or 500 million dollars , dating back to the 1930s , usually 1934 .
In each of these schemes , fraudulent instruments are claimed to be part of a long - lost supply of recently discovered Federal Reserve notes or bonds .
Fraudsters often falsely claim that the purported Federal Reserve notes or bonds that they hold are somehow very special and are not known to the public because they are so secret .
Fraudsters have attempted to sell these worthless instruments , or to redeem or exchange them at banks and other financial institutions , or to secure loans or obtain lines of credit using the fictitious instruments as collateral .
The Federal Reserve has never issued any bonds or notes with coupons attached .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is not aware of any currency or debt stockpile of large denomination Federal Reserve notes from the 1930s and warns that any institution that pays out on such a claim does so at its own risk .
It should also be noted that the largest denomination of currency ever printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was the $ 100,000 Series 1934 Gold Certificate featuring the portrait of President Wilson .
These notes were printed from December 18 , 1934 , through January 9 , 1935 , and were issued by the Treasurer of the United States to Federal Reserve Banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the Treasury Department .
The notes were used only for official transactions between Federal Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the general public .

Consider this post educational , or a proof - of - concept intellectual exercise .
Dozens of tutorials on how to crack WEP are already all over the internet using this method .
Seriously — Google it .
This ain't what you 'd call " news . "
But what is surprising is that someone like me , with minimal networking experience , can get this done with free software and a cheap Wi -Fi adapter .
Here 's how it goes .

What You 'll Need
Unless you 're a computer security and networking ninja , chances are you do n't have all the tools on hand to get this job done .
Here 's what you 'll need :

Crack That WEP
To crack WEP , you 'll need to launch Konsole , BackTrack 's built - in command line .
It 's right there on the taskbar in the lower left corner , second button to the right .
Now , the commands .

First run the following to get a list of your network interfaces :
airmon-ng
The only one I 've got there is labeled ra0 .
Yours may be different ; take note of the label and write it down .
From here on in , substitute it in everywhere a command includes ( interface ) .

Now , run the following four commands .
See the output that I got for them in the screenshot below .
airmon -ng stop ( interface ) < br> ifconfig ( interface ) down < br> macchanger --mac 00:11:22:33:44:55 ( interface ) < br> airmon -ng start ( interface )

If you do n't get the same results from these commands as pictured here , most likely your network adapter wo n't work with this particular crack .
If you do , you 've successfully " faked " a new MAC address on your network interface , 00:11:22:33:44:55 .

Now it 's time to pick your network .
Run :
airodump -ng ( interface )
To see a list of wireless networks around you .
When you see the one you want , hit Ctrl +C to stop the list .
Highlight the row pertaining to the network of interest , and take note of two things : its BSSID and its channel ( in the column labeled CH ) , as pictured below .
Obviously the network you want to crack should have WEP encryption ( in the ENC ) column , not WPA or anything else .
Advertisement
Like I said , hit Ctrl +C to stop this listing .
( I had to do this once or twice to find the network I was looking for . )
Once you 've got it , highlight the BSSID and copy it to your clipboard for reuse in the upcoming commands .
Advertisement
Now we 're going to watch what 's going on with that network you chose and capture that information to a file .
Run :
airodump - ng -c ( channel ) -w ( file name ) -- bssid ( bssid ) ( interface )
Where ( channel ) is your network 's channel , and ( bssid ) is the BSSID you just copied to clipboard .
You can use the Shift + Insert key combination to paste it into the command .
Enter anything descriptive for ( file name ) .
I chose " yoyo , " which is the network 's name I 'm cracking .
Advertisement
You 'll get output like what 's in the window in the background pictured below .
Leave that one be .
Open a new Konsole window in the foreground , and enter this command :
aireplay - ng - 1 0 - a ( bssid ) -h 00:11:22:33:44:55 -e ( essid ) ( interface )
Here the ESSID is the access point 's SSID name , which in my case is yoyo .
What you want to get after this command is the reassuring " Association successful " message with that smiley face .
Advertisement
You 're almost there .
Now it 's time for :
aireplay - ng - 3 - b ( bssid ) -h 00:11:22:33:44:55 ( interface )
Here we 're creating router traffic to capture more throughput faster to speed up our crack .
After a few minutes , that front window will start going crazy with read / write packets .
( Also , I was unable to surf the web with the yoyo network on a separate computer while this was going on . )
Here 's the part where you might have to grab yourself a cup of coffee or take a walk .
Basically you want to wait until enough data has been collected to run your crack .
Watch the number in the " # Data " column — you want it to go above 10,000 .
( Pictured below it 's only at 854 . )
Advertisement
Depending on the power of your network ( mine is inexplicably low at - 32 in that screenshot , even though the yoyo AP was in the same room as my adapter ) , this process could take some time .
Wait until that # Data goes over 10 k , though — because the crack wo n't work if it does n't .
In fact , you may need more than 10 k , though that seems to be a working threshold for many .
Advertisement
Once you 've collected enough data , it 's the moment of truth .
Launch a third Konsole window and run the following to crack that data you 've collected :
aircrack - ng - b ( bssid ) ( file name - 01.cap )
Here the filename should be whatever you entered above for ( file name ) .
You can browse to your Home directory to see it ; it 's the one with .cap as the extension .
Advertisement
If you did n't get enough data , aircrack will fail and tell you to try again with more .
If it succeeds , it will look like this :

The WEP key appears next to " KEY FOUND . "
Drop the colons and enter it to log onto the network .
Problems Along the Way
With this article I set out to prove that cracking WEP is a relatively " easy " process for someone determined and willing to get the hardware and software going .
I still think that 's true , but unlike the guy in the video below , I had several difficulties along the way .
In fact , you 'll notice that the last screenshot up there does n't look like the others — it 's because it 's not mine .
Even though the AP which I was cracking was my own and in the same room as my Alfa , the power reading on the signal was always around - 30 , and so the data collection was very slow , and BackTrack would consistently crash before it was complete .
After about half a dozen attempts ( and trying BackTrack on both my Mac and PC , as a live CD and a virtual machine ) , I still have n't captured enough data for aircrack to decrypt the key .

So while this process is easy in theory , your mileage may vary depending on your hardware , proximity to the AP point , and the way the planets are aligned .
Oh yeah , and if you 're on deadline — Murphy 's Law almost guarantees it wo n't work if you 're on deadline .
Got any experience with the WEP cracking courtesy of BackTrack ?
What do you have to say about it ?

THC Detox products do work .
Be careful to read about what the product actually does .
Some of them will say the detox THC from your body , when all it does is hide the THC from the test .
Now , for a lot of people this will help them out , because they are only looking to pass the test that is coming up .
There are a lot of THC detox products that work , and like all of them , drinking a lot of water will help flush the chemical from your body .

America has had a flat tax for over seventy years .
We refer to it as the Social Security System .
While many prefer to think of it a socialized retirement plan , it is not .
It has always been a flat tax .
President Roosevelt understood that any attempt to enforce a pension or insurance program upon the American people would be unconstitutional , but he did understand that the federal government was empowered to tax .
At the time of his presidency , America was a poor country with a large population of indigent elders . .
Instead of addressing the problem at hand , a large number of indigent retired elderly that needed assistance , the President instead went about instituting a massive program to transfer resources from workers to all retired workers , regardless of need .
While this has been historically looked upon as a social program , it was also part of Rossevelt ’s grand plan to rescue Capitalism from its Great Depression death throes .
The Social Security plan was crafted as an ingenious method of diverting worker ’s own funds to pay for their own retirements , which took the load off industry to pay a wage generous enough to accomplish this .
Because of the probable unconstitutionality of any federal benefit or insurance program , the administration created the Social Security program using the framework of a tax and distribute method .
The important titles in the legislation , which defined the collection and distribution of funds , were separated as Titles II and VIII .
The actual revenue collection procedures were filed under the Internal Revenue Code .
It was and remains to this day , despite a greatly increased rate , a flat income tax wage on working people which is transfered by the federal government to retirement aged workers .
Even so , it barely squeaked by the Supreme Court justices .
It is obvious they understood Roosevelt ’s true intentions , but were hesitant to strike down the social legislation due to the President ’s threat of packing the court with his own handpicked judges .
Roosevelt was threatening to impose a rule that would allow presidents to appoint new justices when an existing justice reached the age of 70 and refused to retire .
This would give him the immediate power to appoint six justices , greatly tilting the court in his favor .
Many decisions of the time we made by the court with this possibility in mind .
A very important part of the Social Security legislation is Section 1104 .
“ The right to alter , amend , or repeal any provision of this Act is hereby reserved to the Congress ” .
In other words , Congress has complete control over the program .
Since its inception , the collection of revenue for the Social Security system has been a flat tax levied on the gross income of all wage earners with a complimentary flat tax of equal rate levied on the worker ’s employer .
Not only is it a flat tax , but it is a regressive type of tax .
Collection of the tax has always ceased at a certain income level .
Presently , this amount is $ 106,000 .
Because of this , the lower income worker is taxed at a greater rate than the upper end earners .
One can earn a few hundred dollars a month and still be subject to withdrawal for Social Security .
The tax is collected like any other income tax , right off the wage earner ’s check .
The government then distributes the amount needed to pay those presently collecting payments according to current laws .
Through the years , Congress has used its power over the system to redefine who collects , how much they collect and at what age they collect .
As defined by section 1104 , this is completely under the jurisdiction of the Congress .
It has also been proven time and again in the highest court that this collection of tax and redistribution to the taxpayer is not in any way the property of the taxpayer .
If this were the case , the entire system would be unconstitutional , since it could then be interpreted as a pension plan .
All proceeds from the collection of Social Securty taxes are the property of the US government .
There is a surplus amount that is collected each year that is above and beyond the funds needed to meet the present payment obligations .
It is placed in the Social Security Surplus Fund , which was redefined along with the SS tax rates during the Reagan administration .
In recent years this amount has been in excess of 2 trillion dollars .
The surplus funds have all been used to purchase special treasury securities .
Like all income taxes , the surplus fund is used to fund the Federal Government in any way Congress sees fit .
This transfer is not accounted for against the Federal Debt .
Since it is impossible to pay the surplus amount back to the taxpayer without tax collections or borrowing in the same amount , this expensing of the Social Security Fund can only be replenished by future income taxes or a higher SS tax rate .
The special security status does not allow the securities to be sold on the world market .
In other words , the Social Security surplus amount does not exist in any form other than the paper it is written on .
Social Security obviously benefits those who receive payments , but it is not and never has been a benefit program .
It is a legally mandated transfer of funds from those presently working to those who have retired .
Benefit or pension plans are provided by employers as a means of competing for worker ’s .
A benefit or pension is a alternative form of a wage or salary , not a tax .
I like last .fm , but this is beyond retarded .
Get out your adult diapers and haldol , then read on .
Apparently , last .
fm 's software is too simplistic to realize that in classical music , we often list the composer 's LAST NAME first for purposes of easy indexing .
But to last .fm , " Respighi , Ottorino " and " Ottorino Respighi " are two different people .
I guess there may be a handful of rock bands that use commas in their names , but it is not rocket science to set up an equivalency table and when a comma is found , check out .
Instead , last.fm has opted for the ignorant and offensive step of telling us we need to " fix " our tags – putting us out of line with the classical community and world in general – to accomodate their incompetent software .
What is this retardation ?
Internet service providers would have to make it possible for police and intelligence officers to intercept online communications and get personal information about subscribers , under bills tabled Thursday .
" We must ensure that law enforcement has the necessary tools to catch up to the bad guys and ultimately bring them to justice .
Twenty - first century technology calls for 21st - century tools , " said Justice Minister Rob Nicholson as he announced the new bills with Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan at a news conference in Ottawa .
The bills are intended to modernize the Criminal Code and help law enforcement officials chase those suspected of using the internet and other new technologies to communicate and commit crimes , as well as maximize the ability to conduct international investigations , Nicholson said .
Targets ' safe havens '
One bill , announced by Van Loan , would require telecommunications and internet service providers to :
Install and maintain " intercept - capable " equipment on their networks .
Provide police with " timely access " to personal information about subscribers , including names , address and internet addresses , without the need for a warrant .
Van Loan said the bill wo n't provide new interception powers to police , but simply update the legal framework designed " in the era of the rotary telephone . "
He noted that police can already get the authority to intercept communications , but the network is often incapable of allowing such interception .
" Criminals , child pornographers , organized crime members and terrorists are aware of these interception safe havens .
They identify them and gravitate towards them to exploit them and continue their criminal activities undetected , out of the reach of the investigative powers of law enforcement . "
Van Loan added that internet service providers are currently not required to provide subscriber information to police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Agency ( CSIS ) , and may be unwilling to provide such data without a police warrant , slowing down the investigation of crimes such as child sexual exploitation or online theft .
ISPs must preserve data
The other bill , introduced by Nicholson , would :
Allow law enforcement officials to obtain transmission data ( routing information ) that is sent or received via telephone or internet if authorized by a production order or warrant .
Require telecommunications companies to keep data related to specific communications or subscribers if that information is needed in an investigation and requested via a preservation order .
Allow police to remotely activate existing tracking devices that are found in some cars and in devices such as cellphones .
Make it a criminal offence for two or more people to agree to or arrange child sexual exploitation by means of telecommunications .
Make it illegal to possess a computer virus for the purpose of committing an offence of mischief , even if the virus has not yet spread .
Internet surveillance in other countries United Kingdom The Regulation of Investigatory Power Act of 2000 includes provisions to require ISPs to install systems to aid investigators in tracking electronic communications .
United States The USA PATRIOT
Act of 2001 expanded wiretaps to internet connections .
The Bush administration authorized the National Security Agency to conduct domestic wiretaps without a warrant in 2001 , possibly earlier .
The Protect America Act of 2007 and FISA Amendments
Act of 2008 extended that authority .
Australia The Surveillance Devices Bill of 2004 allows Australian Federal Police to obtain warrants for the use of data , optical , listening and tracking surveillance devices .
The Intelligence Services
Act of 2001 covers the use of surveillance devices by the country 's security agencies .
New Zealand The Search and Surveillance Powers Bill was introduced in September 2008 to update the surveillance powers and procedures New Zealand 's law enforcement agencies .
Sweden Sweden 's parliament approved new laws in June 2008 to allow the country 's intelligence bureau to track sensitive words in international phone calls , faxes and emails without a court order .
The law took effect in January 2009 .
Nicholson said the government believes the proposed legislation strikes an " appropriate balance " between law enforcement 's investigative powers to protect public safety and the privacy and rights and freedoms of Canadians .
Law enforcement officials at the news conference praised the bill .
Calgary deputy chief of police Murray Stooke said police have been requesting the modernization of laws related to interception of communications for a decade .
He added that the government consulted broadly with Canadians and interest groups before introducing the new legislation .
" We do understand that the privacy concerns of Canadians must be respected , " he added , " but at the same time , we have a growing gap in terms of our capacity [ to investigate crimes ] . "
However , University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist wrote in his blog Thursday that the bills are " pretty much exactly what law enforcement has been demanding and privacy groups have been fearing .
It represents a reneging of a commitment from the previous Public Safety Minister on court oversight and will embed broad new surveillance capabilities in the Canadian internet . "
Cost to ISPs
Tom Copeland , head of chair of the Canadian Association of Internet Providers ( CAIP ) , which represents dozens of smaller Canadian ISPs , said Thursday he fears the bill requiring internet - tapping capability could put some of his members out of business .
Van Loan said the companies themselves will have to pay for new equipment to meet the requirements , although the government will provide " reasonable compensation " when retrofits to existing hardware are needed .
The companies will have 18 months to make the changes , but there will be a three - year exemption for those with less than 100,000 subscribers .
But even that may not be enough time for some small providers , as they usually buy used , older network equipment that would n't be tappable , he said .
Buying that new equipment could cost $ 15,000 , and even if the government covers half , the remainder would be a " significant burden , " Copeland said .
" I know a lot of providers who could n't come up with the other half – it 's just not the margins we have . "
Larger internet service providers such as Bell also expressed concerns .
Spokeswoman Jacqueline Michelis said in an email that the company " has long been committed to working with law enforcement agencies to find effective and efficient solutions for their legitimate surveillance needs , " but policing costs should n't be downloaded to one particular industry .
" Other funding mechanisms must be found , " Michelis said .
Copeland said that with respect to providing subscriber information without a warrant , he is glad the bill brings some " clarity and consistency " to the issue .
Previously , he said , ISPs were unsure whether providing that information would violate the Privacy Act and leave the companies vulnerable to a lawsuit .
He said the other bill introduced Thursday represents no real change to ISPs .
Rogers Communications participated in consultations during the drafting of the bills and now that they have been tabled , will study them and provide feedback to the government , said Nancy Cottenden , director of communications for the company , in an email .
Considering that many Canadians practically bleed Tim Hortons coffee on any given workday , it may come as a surprise to some that the much - beloved chain is once again returning its home base to Canada .
Did n't know Tims was actually based in the United States up until now ?
That 's easy to forgive , considering just how deeply ingrained the brand has become in the Canadian consciousness .
But it is true that the house built on the doughnut and double - double was for nearly 15 years – a result of its purchase by U.S. burger chain Wendy 's – registered far away in the State of Delaware .
Parent company Tim Hortons Inc. ( TSX : THI ) announced Monday it has filed documents in the United States that would to shift its corporate ownership back north of the border .
Its current Canadian headquarters is in Oakville , west of Toronto .
The company says the move – which it had said it was considering earlier this year – will save on taxes and make international expansion easier .
It certainly wo n't hurt its image with Canadians either , because the famous chain is probably the country 's most - treasured brand .
Although it will have virtually no impact at all on its storefront operations , the announcement was well received by Tims fans , quickly garnering delighted comment on social networking Internet sites .
Tim Hortons , founded in the mid-'60s by Hamilton - born hockey legend Tim Horton , became part of Wendy 's in 1995 , forging a partnership with its founder Dave Thomas that saw the restaurants sit side - by - side at many locations .
After Thomas ' died in 2002 , the two companies started to drift apart , with the doughnut chain choosing to focus on sandwiches and other breakfast and lunch options .
The concept clashed with offerings from the Wendy 's brand .
In 2006 , the company was spun off into its own American entity , though its corporate headquarters remained in Oakville , Ont. , and most of its stores are in Canada .
Since then , the chain has struggled to boost sales in the United States despite thriving in Canada .
The company 's shift back into Canada will create a domestic subsidiary with which Tims will merge , transforming it into a company incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act .
On Monday , executives from the company declined to comment on the changes , though they 've been in the works for several quarters .
Earlier this year , president and CEO Don Schroeder told analysts in a conference call that it believed the move was beneficial for the company and its investors .
" With these assessments substantially complete management and the board concluded that a reorganization is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders over the long term , Schroeder said . "
He added that the change in " no way alters our commitment to growing our business in the U.S. or in any way affects our underlying business . "
Tim Horton's has been a publicly traded company , listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges .
Shareholders will hold the same amount of stock as before , and the company will continue to operate under the Tim Hortons name with stock listings on the TSX and the New York Stock Exchange .
The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday June 28 2009
In the article below , we made reference to " guaranteed rewards that were paid over three years " .
In fact , Goldman Sachs has a policy of not paying multi- year guarantees , and variable compensation for its employees has always been driven by the performance of the firm .
Staff at Goldman
Sachs staff can look forward to the biggest bonus payouts in the firm 's 140 - year history after a spectacular first half of the year , sparking concern that the big investment banks which survived the credit crunch will derail financial regulation reforms .
A lack of competition and a surge in revenues from trading foreign currency , bonds and fixed - income products has sent profits at Goldman Sachs soaring , according to insiders at the firm .
Staff in London were briefed last week on the banking and securities company 's prospects and told they could look forward to bumper bonuses if , as predicted , it completed its most profitable year ever .
Figures next month detailing the firm 's second - quarter earnings are expected to show a further jump in profits .
Warren Buffett , who bought $ 5bn of the company 's shares in January , has already made a $ 1bn gain on his investment .
Goldman is expected to be the biggest winner in the race for revenues that , in 2006 , reached £ 186bn across the entire industry .
While this figure is expected to fall to £ 160bn in 2009 , it will be split among a smaller number of firms .
Barclays Capital , Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are among the European firms expected to register bumper profits , along with US banks JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley following the near collapse and government rescue of major trading houses including Citigroup , Merrill Lynch , UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland .
In April , Goldman said it would set aside half of its £ 1.2 bn first - quarter profit to reward staff , much of it in bonuses .
It is believed to have paid 973 bankers $ 1 m or more last year , while this year 's payouts are on track to be the highest for most of the bank 's 28,000 staff , including about 5,400 in London .
Critics of the bonus culture in the City said the dominance of a few risk - taking investment banks is undermining the efforts of regulators to stabilise the financial system .
Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman , said : " The investment banks more than any other institutions created the culture of excessive leverage , excessive risk and excessive bonuses that led to the downfall of the financial system .
Now they are cashing in and the same bonus culture has returned .
The result must be that we are being pushed to the edge of another crash . "
Goldman Sachs said it reviewed its bonus scheme last year and switched from a system of guaranteed rewards that were paid over three years to variable payments that tied staff to the firm .
It told employees last year that profit - related bonuses would be delayed by 12 months .
Until the release of its first quarter profits in April , it seemed inconceivable that a firm owing the US government $ 10 bn would be looking to break all - time records in 2009 .
David Williams , an investment banking analyst at Fox Pitt Kelton , said : " This year is shaping up to be the best year ever for investment banks , or at least those that have emerged relatively unscathed from the credit crisis .
" These banks are intermediaries in the bond markets where governments and companies are raising billions of pounds of new money .
There is also a lack of competition that means they can charge huge sums for doing business . "
Last week , the firm predicted that President Barack Obama 's government could issue $ 3.25tn of debt before September , almost four times last year 's sum .
Goldman , a prime broker of US government bonds , is expected to make hundreds of millions of dollars in profits from selling and dealing in the bonds .
( OPRAH.com ) -- Attention single ladies !
Comedian Steve Harvey , the best - selling author of " Act Like a Lady , Think Like Man " and a self - professed expert on manhood , is here to take you inside the male mind .
Comedian Steve Harvey says real men like to provide and protect , but some also like to cheat .
Whether you 're looking for Mr. Right or trying to forget Mr. Wrong , Steve is n't holding anything back .
Many women have long lists that describe what they 're looking for in a man ... but are their standards simply too high ?
Yinka and Lynell are two 30 - something friends who have long lists .
They 're here to ask Steve if they 'll ever find a man who meets all their requirements .
Lynell says she 's looking for a God- fearing , spontaneous African - American millionaire with straight teeth and nice shoes who wants children ... among other things .
" That would be the Lord , " Steve jokes .
" I 'll be trying to meet him the same time you do . "
If a woman is serious about her list , Steve says she should ask herself one question before turning down a date .
" Are you willing to be the same thing to him that you 're talking about on that list ? " he says .
" A lot of women are not . "
In general , do women even need a list ?
Steve says single ladies do need to set standards .
" I think lists are great .
You 've got to have them .
You 've got to know what you 're looking for , " he says .
" Without standards , you settle for stuff . "

Before you get discouraged , Steve reminds women to stay patient and remember that real men are n't afraid of standards and requirements .
" You 've got to wait on this guy to come along .
He 's coming .
He 's out there .
He 's already created .
God has already made him , " he says .
" He has a job .
He 's wearing the clothes you like .
He 's walking around .
You 're not waiting on him to be born .
He exists today .

Why do many successful , independent women have a hard time finding love ?
There are millions of smart , beautiful women around the world who can't figure out why they 're unlucky in love , including a group of friends from New York .
Steve is here to set them straight .
Steve says many successful women dated good men but did n't know it at the time .
" You do n't know the DNA of a good man , " he says .
Even if you look like a million bucks -- and you have a few million in the bank --
Steve says a woman needs to know how a man shows his love .
It 's all about the " three P's . "
Oprah.com : Can a list help you find love ?
" We profess , we provide and we protect , " he says .
" A man has got to see where he fits into the providing and protecting role .
If you 've got everything , you can do everything , you 've got your own car ... you 've got a guard dog and a handgun .
The guy is thinking , ' Where do I fit in here ? '
" You 've got to make a space for him to fit in so he can come in and do what men do . "
Steve does n't advise women to downplay their success or pack up their designer shoes .
Instead , he says strong women have to walk a thin line .
" You can't let your independence and your ability to take care of yourself be the dominant factor of who you are , " he says .
" You know how many times I hear women say : ' I do n't need a man .
I 've got this .
Why do n't a man just come to me ? '
Just like you 're saying it , you 're projecting it .
If you 're projecting it , where does a man fit in there ?
Just relax . "

How to act like a lady , think like a man
After a few dates , some guys just stop returning calls and texts .
Even if they are n't interested , do n't they want closure ?
Steve has a simple answer to this question ... no . " Ladies , you 're not going to get closure from a man , " he says .
" We do n't do closure .
And you know why ?
Because we do n't even know you 're having an issue .
We 're stupid . "
If you 're hoping for a courtesy call , Steve says you can forget about that too .
" We 're not courteous .
Listen , it 's not in our DNA as great communicators anyway , " he says .
" See women keep waiting on closure .
Bring it on .
If you want closure , close .
Move on with your life . "
How important is sex in a relationship ?
Sex , or " the cookie " as Steve calls it in his book , is a major point of contention for many couples .
If you do n't think it 's important to your man , Steve says you 're wrong .
" It 's critical , " he says .
" It 's one of the three things that a man has to have .
A man has to have love , support and the cookie .
[ If ] anyone of those three things is missing in the relationship , he 's going to go get it somewhere else . "
If a man is cheating or has the intention to cheat , why pursue commitment with one woman ?
Michele found out her boyfriend of many years was cheating after he told her he was ready to settle down and get married .
The male mind may be a mystery to women , but Steve says there 's a simple explanation for this behavior .
" A man having sex outside of his relationship is very different from [ a woman ] , " he says .
" Once we shower and wash off , we cool .
" Please know that about a man .
If he 's going to cheat , it has nothing to do with his emotional attachment to you or his feelings for you . "
Steve says cheaters make promises to their significant others because they know that 's what women want to hear .
" Michele , there 's nothing wrong with you .
You have n't done anything , " he says .
" Please release yourself .
Let the baggage go . "
Sadly , many women have dated men who cheat ... and most of them do n't even know it .
Steve says there are a few major reasons why men stray , though none of them excuse the behavior .
The top 5 reasons :
• They can
• They think they can get away with it
• The man has n't become who he wants and needs to be or found who he truly wants to be with .
• What 's happening at home is n't " happening " like it used to .
• There 's always a woman out there willing to cheat with him .
If you 're married to a mama 's boy , is there anything a wife can do to become the number one woman in his life ?
Before Jill married her husband of 13 years , she says she knew he was a mama 's boy .
Over the years , she 's grown tired of coming in second .
Steve says the first mistake women like Jill make is thinking they can change their men .
" You think if you give him enough cookie , bake it just right , he 'll straighten up , " he says .
" That 's not what happens with a mama 's boy . "
Men stay in this adolescent mind - set because their mothers set standards when they were boys and upheld those standards throughout their lives , Steve says .
Wives must enter into their marriages with their own set of rules to stand a chance .

" You have to start saying : ' Hey , look , you have to respect me .
You have to be here to show your son how a man treats a woman .
You have to be here to show your daughter how a man should treat her , ' " he says .
" ' You ca n't do it if you 're playing me second to your mama . ' "
If that does n't work , Steve suggests appealing to the " three Ps " -- profess , provide and protect .
" If you do n't say to your man : ' Okay , look , next time she calls , do not leave us in the middle of the night .
We 're unprotected , ' " he says .
" Every man has it in his DNA to do these things when we love you .
When you call on it and require it , we rise to the occasion . "

“ You know you ’re going to bankrupt the country with health care , right ? ” talk show host Bill O’Reilly began as an introduction to talk with Sen.
Hillary Clinton about her health care plan .
“ Oh , no , I ’m not , ” said Clinton , who appeared on the The O’Reilly Factor on April 30 , 2008 .
Clinton boiled her plan down to this : “ Everybody who has health insurance who ’s happy with it , you keep it .
No changes .
But what I am going to do is take an already existing plan -- it ’s not government - run , it ’s not a new bureaucracy .
It ’s the way Congress and federal employees get their health care .
And we ’re going to open it up to every American , because I think it ’s about time ... ”
“ But you ’re going to subsidize it , ” O’Reilly interjected .
“ Well , we are , ” Clinton said .
“ But here ’s why .
You already are subsidizing it .
Your family policy has a $ 900 hidden tax .
Why ?
Because when some poor person who does n’t have health insurance ... ”
“ ... goes to the emergency room ... you ’ve got to pick it up , ” O’Reilly said , finishing her sentence .
The $ 900 figure is key to Clinton ’s plan .
Yes , she is saying , the government will subsidize her health care plan .
But , the thinking goes , private insurance companies will charge lower premiums to their existing customers because they will no longer have to subsidize health care costs incurred by uninsured people .
Think of it like this , said John Sheils , senior vice president of The Lewin Group , a non-partisan group that has analyzed health care plans for both Democrats and Republicans : Someone shoplifts a loaf of bread from the grocery story .
The price of bread is inflated a bit for everyone else to offset the store ’s loss .
“ That ’s kind of what ’s going on with healthcare , ” Sheils said .
Hospitals have to treat people who come in and need medical care .
And if those people do n’t pay , “ it ’s kind of like walking out of the story without paying for bread , ” he said .
The cost is shifted onto those with private insurance .
Sheils said Clinton ’s claim that family health insurance policies subsidize the uninsured to the tune of about $ 900 a year is “ in the ballpark . ”
Sheils believes the number is a little lower , closer to $ 800 per year .
Hillary cites that same $ 900 figure in her formal health care proposal , the American Health Choices Plan .
“ One cause of the crisis in the health care system is that rather than containing costs , the system shifts them : about half of all hospital losses are passed along to other payers , ” according to her plan .
“ Rather than reducing prices , the system raises families ’ costs .
“ And , rather than covering all Americans , the system charges insured families a “ hidden tax ” : premiums are roughly $ 900 higher to pay for the cost of care for the uninsured . ”
It cites a report from Families USA called “ Paying a Premium :
The added cost of care for the uninsured . ”
The report was based on an analysis of data by Kenneth E. Thorpe , former Clinton administration health expert , now a professor at Emory University .
Thorpe says Clinton ’s figure actually is low .
According to his analysis , about $ 922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005 .
But the cost of health care has gone up since then , as have the number of uninsured .
In 2008 , the number is closer to $ 1,270 , he said .
“ The only way for hospitals to offset the costs ( of the uninsured ) is to have private insurers pay more than it ’s worth , ” Thorpe said .
“ It is their only means to stay financially solvent . ”
In 2005 , private health paid about 25 % more than the cost of care in hospitals , Thorpe said , citing a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report to Congress .
O’Reilly did n’t contest Clinton ’s numbers , but he did take umbrage with subsidizing other people ’s health care .
“ I mean , I do n’t want to be paying for someone who ’s taking heroin and drinking a bottle of gin a day , ” O’Reilly said .
“ But I assume you want to pay for some hardworking families whose kid has juvenile diabetes , ” Clinton said .
“ Or some woman ... that just gets diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis . "
“ I do n’t mind doing it , ” O’Reilly said .
Clinton ’s point was that , to an extent , family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured .
There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $ 900 a year , as she stated , but several health policy experts agreed that she ’s at least close .
We rate her statement True .
Now that I ’ve got the DEFUN 2009 schedule sorted out ( you are coming , are n’t you ? ) , I ’ve had time to take a breath and think about the Haskell text library again .
Its API is currently a clone of the ancient and venerable Haskell list API .
If you ’ve used the list API to do much text processing , you ’ve probably spilled more than a few tears into your whiskey .
The bytestring library also mostly clones the list API , albeit with a few improvements .
This state of affairs makes me somewhat sad : here we are with a fabulous language , but a 1991 - era API for mangling text .
To put this state of affairs into perspective , here is a function - by - function comparison of the string manipulation APIs of Python 2.6 and Haskell .
This is intentionally somewhat pessimistic : I focus on aspects of the Python API that are either absent from or not trivially reimplemented in Haskell , but not the reverse .
( If the details that follow make your eyes glaze over , skip them and read on after the table below . )
Python Haskell x + y x `append` y x in y x `isInfixOf` y x < y x < y x <= y x <= y x == y x == y x != y x /= y x > y x > y x >= y x >= y x % (... ) x[ i ] x `index` i x [ i : j ] ( j - i ) `take` ( i `drop` x ) hash ( x ) len( x ) length x x * y y `replicate` x x.capitalize ( ) x.center(y ) x.count ( ) x.decode ( ) decode ... family x.encode ( ) encode ... family x.endswith(y ) y `isSuffixOf` x x.expandtabs ( ) x.find(y ) x.format ( ... ) x.index(y ) x.isalnum ( ) all isAlphaNum x x.isalpha( ) all isAlpha x x.isdigit ( ) all is Digit x x.islower ( ) all isLower x x.isspace ( ) all is Space x x.istitle ( ) x.isupper ( ) all isUpper x x.join (y ) intercalate x y x.ljust ( w ) x.lower ( ) toLower x x.lstrip ( ) dropWhile isSpace x.partition(y ) break ( ==y ) x x.replace ( y, z ) x.rfind(y ) x.rindex (y ) x.rjust (y ) x.rpartition(y ) x.rsplit(y ) x.rstrip(y ) x.split(y ) x.splitlines ( ) lines x x.startswith(y ) y `isPrefixOf` x x.strip ( ) x.swapcase ( ) x.title ( ) x.translate(y ) x.upper ( ) toUpper x x.zfill ( )
For now , I ’m intentionally not looking at Python ’s unicodedata or string packages , even though each contains a handful of additional useful functions .
How would I broadly categorise what ’s missing from the current Haskell APIs ?
Formatting .
The format method that ’s new in Python 2.6 is well designed and extremely useful .
While there are a few formatting libraries on Hackage , each has flaws which I think are substantial enough to make them undesirable for wide use .
As examples of those shortcomings , I ’m thinking of a lack of static type safety or a poor fit for automated translation tools .
Searching and splitting text .
The Haskell APIs are based on predicates over individual characters , whereas what ’s usually needed is predicates over strings .
In other words , do n’t just find me a character ; find me a substring .
Parsing .
I ’m not overly concerned about this , since Haskell ’s libraries far outshine those of Python in this area .
Although they currently lack support for the text library , the Parsec and attoparsec libraries will acquire it , I ’m sure , as soon as there ’s demand .
What would be welcome is a decent Unicode - capable regular expression engine , for those times when you just have to get yourself into trouble in the name of expediency .
I intend to address each of these areas over the coming months , and I ’ll write up the APIs I intend to flesh out here before I actually implement them , to solicit feedback from the community .
One step that I think I ’ll probably take , for instance , is to move a few of the functions in the Data .
Text module that clone the list API into a new module , Data .
Text .
Legacy , so that I can use the same function names in Data .
Text , but with more useful types .
As an example of what I have in mind , I ’d be inclined to move split :: Char -> Text -> [ Text ] into the legacy module , and replace it with split :: Text -> Text -> [ Text ] .
There ’s something of a tension between the goals of providing a small , focused text library and getting all the API details right in a way that will make it truly useful .
I find the proliferation of tiny libraries on Hackage , each providing a few little pieces of missing functionality , to be pretty dispiriting from the point of view of getting dug in and producing useful application code quickly , so I intend for the text and text - icu libraries to be broadly useful from the get - go .
If you have opinions , or better yet patches , to contribute , let ’s get things rolling !
Real graphics card competition on the Mac is not something that Apple users are accustomed to hearing about , but with the Radeon 4870 and now the NVIDIA GTX 285 available for the Mac Pro , it looks like we 've got just that .
While Mac gaming may not be any more viable than it was a few years ago , the ability to dual - boot Windows has been a huge win for those wanting high - end PC gaming without having to put another box next to their work Mac .
With Core Image , CUDA , Snow Leopard and OpenCL just around the corner , a good GPU is becoming more and more of a mainstream need , and the Geforce GTX 285 looks like it has power to spare .
In this short review , we take a look at what the Geforce GTX 285 can do under both Windows and OS X .
We even include some Windows gaming benchmarks , though our main focus here is on investigating the GTX 285 's suitability for professional 3D rendering on the Mac .
System Requirements
Mac Pro 2008 or 2009 with OS X 10.5.7 or later
Mac Pro ( Early 2009 ) or Mac Pro ( Early 2008 with 800 Mhz DDR2 FB - DIMM memory )
2 PCI Express slots ( only one is used but the card is double - wide )
Price : $ 449
Card Specs
Core Clock Speed : 648MHz
CUDA Processing Cores : 240
Memory Clock Speed : 2,484MHz
Memory Bandwidth : 159GB/sec
Shader Clock Speed : 1,476MHz
Bus : PCIe 2.0
Interface : Two dual - link DVI with HDCP support
Warranty : 2 - year warranty upon registration
Test machine : 8 - core 2.66 GHz Mac Pro Nehalem
What 's in the box
1GB EVGA Geforce GTX 285 ( make sure your box came with one of these )
Two Mac Pro-compatible molex cables
DVI - to -VGA adapter
Driver disk
( Note that the SLI cable for two - card Windows gaming is not included . )
As you can see above , the card itself a bit shorter than the Radeon 4870 .
It does n't lock into the Mac Pro 2009 's plastic bracket , but it 's held firmly in place by the notched card and Mac Pro brace .
You 'll also notice that the GTX 285 does n't include the much - reviled Apple mini Display Port connector ; instead , it has two standard dual - link DVI ports .
If you 're wondering why anyone would hate the mini DP , this image should speak volumes :
The elegant option for mini DisplayPort to HDMI , and the whole kit only costs you $ 40 + tax and delivery .
From the Ars forum thread " Apple , your mini displayport is stupid .
I hate it .
Unlike the Windows - only GTX 285 cards , this card does n't feature a TV out .
This is n't a problem in my opinion .
On the hardware side , the GTX 285 is reasonably future - proof thanks to its 1GB of DDR3 memory and OpenGL 3.0 spec compatibility .
My biggest gripe with the Apple - compatible Radeon 4870 is that it only has 512MB of RAM , which is really the rock bottom for modern games and too little for high - end 3D application work .
The 4870 's only built for OpenGL 2.1 compatibility so there 's also less room for growth with the Radeon .
All we need now is for Apple to bring us OpenGL 3.0 support in OS X and someone to make an application that uses it .
Real soon now .
Installation
Thanks to the Nehalem Mac Pro 's brilliant design , " installation " is nothing more than popping it in , fastening the card via a screwdriverless PCI Express mounting bracket , and attaching the two molex cords .
Make sure to install the drivers before you install the card though — I learned the hard way that you will have no video if you do n't .
EVGA has posted a newer driver [ DMG ] that I recommend installing instead of the one on the CD .
All tests in this review are done with the newer driver .

I ’m amazed , from time to time , to see debates still raging in the classical music world about declines in ticket sales and the aging of the audience .
You ’d think we ’d have settled these questions by now .
How many cars does the US auto industry sell ?
We know that .
So why do n’t we know how many people are buying tickets to classical concerts ?
I ’ll grant that the classical data is harder to assemble , since we have to gather information from many sources .
But still , it ’s strikingly — well , pick a word : immature ?
unworldly ?
unprofessional ? — certainly something not at all good that we in the classical music business can’t collectively point to data about some of our most urgent and hotly debated issues that all of us can agree on .
Especially since the aging of the audience ( as I ’ve pretty firmly shown ) can be established beyond much doubt .
And so now comes the National Endowment for the Arts with the latest of its periodic studies of the arts audience .
We ’ve seen numbers from 1982 , 1992 , 1997 , 2002 , and now 2008 .
( Later I ’ll explain why I have n’t given links for the first two studies . )
And what does the 2008 data show ?
It ’s not good , though none of it , I have to say , should surprise anyone who ’s looked at the earlier studies .
But among much else , the new figures , as I ’ll show , pretty much blow up any hope that the classical audience is going to be renewed — or at least renewed at the size it is now — by younger people coming into it in future years .
Why do I think that ?
Let ’s start with some quotes from the NEA ’s press release on the new numbers .
( The press release is what the link in the last paragraph goes to .
Though you can also read the actual study , and see the detailed data .
I ’ll show how later . )
Here are the quotes :
“ There are persistent patterns of decline in participation for most art forms . ”
“ Between 1982 and 2008 , attendance at performing arts such as classical music , jazz , opera , ballet , musical theater , and dramatic plays has seen double - digit rates of decline . ”
“ Audiences for jazz and classical music are substantially older than before … .
Since 1982 , young adult ( 18 - 24 ) attendance rates for jazz and classical music have declined the most , compared with other art forms . ”
And then , as if all this were n’t bad enough , there ’s one final , killer finding , the one that blows up the hopeful belief that younger people can renew the classical audience :
“ Forty - five to 54 - year - olds – historically dependable arts participants – showed the steepest declines in attendance for most art events , compared with other age groups . ”
But wait , it gets worse !
If you look at the statistical tables that accompany the report , you ’ll see that people 55 to 64 also show a steep decline in classical music attendance .
So now we have people from 45 to 64 going less often to classical performances .
That ’s the core of the classical music audience !
And they ’re showing a greater decline than any other age group .
Younger age groups , the tables show , had their most striking declines earlier .
Now the core of the audience , people 45 to 64 — whose rate of attendance was more or less constant between 1982 and 2002 — has started to go to classical concerts less often .
Only those 65 and over still go to classical concerts at the same rate that they did in the past .
So why does this show that the classical music audience is n’t renewing itself ?
First , we should remember that these age groups are moving targets .
As the years pass , people get older , and those who were 45 to 64 in 1982 are n’t the same people who are 45 to 64 now .
So let ’s look at those people who were 45 to 64 in 1982 , and whose attendance at classical music events had n’t yet started to decline .
They were born between 1918 and 1937 , and grew up — which I ’ll roughly define as spending their high school and college years , from age 14 to age 22 — between 1932 and 1959 .
During those years , classical music had n’t yet become a problem , still functioned as part of the mainstream of our culture , still reigned unchallenged as serious musical art , and , most important , still had a younger audience .
It was natural for younger people to go to classical concerts , and then to keep going as they grew older , and still to keep going now .
But what about people aged 45 to 64 now ?
They were born between 1945 and 1964 , and grew up , roughly speaking , between 1959 and 1986 .
Those were years when interest in classical music started to decline , when popular culture rose up ( starting in the ’60s ) with a force and seriousness never seen before , and when the classical music audience was starting to age .
Younger people , during those years , were increasingly less likely to go to classical concerts .
And so why should we be surprised that people in this age group are going to classical concerts less often now ?
What all this really means is that , as time goes on , people coming into what used to be seen as the prime classical concertgoing ages — 45 and older — increasingly grew up at a time when classical music had started to recede from the cultural mainstream .
So naturally they ’re less interested in classical music than the generations before them were .
With each passing year , more people from 45 to 64 fit this description , and , no surprise , are less interested than those before them in going to classical concerts .
And thus we see the dire numbers that the new NEA study reveals .
Unless we have reasons to believe that these trends will reverse — and what would those reasons be ? — as time goes on , a smaller percentage of Americans in all age groups ( even , eventually , those over 65 ) will go to classical performances , and the classical audience , rather than being renewed , will shrink .
Footnotes :
1 . In my next post , I ’ll show why a declining percentage of people going to classical concerts might not yet mean a decline in absolute numbers , a decline in the actual count of people attending .
But , even if we have n’t seen it yet , it ’s surely coming in the future .
2 . The NEA , for reasons best known to itself , treats classical music and opera as separate categories in these studies .
The numbers I ’m quoting all come from the classical music category .
Many fewer people attend opera ( maybe because there are n’t as many opera performances as there are orchestra and chamber concerts ) , and — very interesting , this — the percentage of people going to opera only declined after 2002 .
The idea , though , that there was any increase in younger people going to opera in recent decades looks like a myth , though what really did happen — that the percentage of younger people in the audience after 1982 did n’t decline until our current decade — is still pretty striking .
3. Links .
The 2008 link I gave at the start , goes , as I said , to the NEA ’s news release about the study .
But for people who want more , they offer links to an NEA brochure about the study , to detailed statistical tables , and to a summary page with still more links .
As for the 1982 and 1992 studies , they are n’t available online .
But data from them is included in the statistical tables appended to the new study , and here ’s a link to another NEA study that refers to those earlier years .

Kuuntelitpa sitten musiikkia laitteella tai vain luonnon ääniä , jotka esittävät jonkinlaista sinfoniaa , musiikki on kaikkialla ympärillämme .
Kasinopelien kehittäjät tietävät tämän ja hyödyntävät sitä kolikkopeleissä ja ruleteissa boost casino games .
Tässä on mielenkiintoisia musiikin käyttötapoja , joita kolikkopelien kehittäjät käyttävät .
Kuljettaa ihmiset pelin läpi
Kun ensimmäiset yksikätiset rosvot ilmestyivät valokeilaan jo 1800 - luvulla , ääniä käytettiin vain kertomaan ihmisille , voittivatko vai hävisivätkö he .
Huolimatta kolikoiden ilmeisistä kilahduksista ja vetovarren mekaanisesta vetämisestä , äänet olivat yksinkertaisia .
Tänä päivänä käytetään erityisiä ääniä kertomaan ihmisille , mitä pelissä tapahtuu .
Jokainen ääni edustaa yhtä osaa pelinkulusta , kuten bonuspelit , kertoimet , tuplauspelit , ilmaiskierrokset , wildit ja scatterit .
Tämä tekee varmasti koko kolikkopelikokemuksesta miellyttävämmän ja tiedostavamman .
Viihdyttää ihmisiä koko ajan
Musiikin on tarkoitus viihdyttää ja tehdä ihmiset iloisiksi ja kiinnostuneiksi musiikista , joka soi taustalla .
Vaikka nämä sävelet eivät saa sinua tanssimaan ja liikuttamaan koko vartaloasi , kolikkopeliautomaattien musiikkia käytetään saamaan ihmisiä nyökyttelemään päätään ja seuraamaan rytmiä .
Jos pidät musiikista , jota kolikkopelissä käytetään ja huomaat nyökytteleväsi päätäsi ja naputtavan jalkaasi lattiaan , kehittäjät ovat tehneet työnsä upeasti .
Musiikki rentouttaa ja saa ihmiset keskittymään ja se on osoittautunut lääkkeeksi ihmisille , sillä musiikki rauhoittaa ihmisiä ja saa heidät siirtymään Zen-mielentilaan .
Kolikkopelien kehittäjät käyttävät musiikkia ja ääniä auttamaan ihmisiä keskittymään siihen mitä he ovat tekemässä , tehden pelaajat tietoisiksi pelin taustatarinasta ja antaen heidän miettiä seuraavaa siirtoaan tai strategiaansa ilman stressiä .
Kolikkopelien kehittäjät tietävät , että pelaajat menettävät ajantajun , kun he keskittyvät kolikkopeliin .
Tämän seurauksena pelaajat käyttävät enemmän aikaa ja rahaa koneeseen , jolloin kasinon omistajat voittavat pitkällä tähtäimellä enemmän rahaa .
Pidä hauskaa ja juhli
Kolikkopelien kehittäjät käyttävät musiikkia juhlimaan pelaajien kanssa , jolloin he tuntevat olonsa arvostetuksi pelin pelaamisesta .
Kun voitat pelissä , taputusäänet , kolikoiden putoaminen ja sireenin äänet alkavat soimaan juhliakseen sinun kanssasi .
Erilaiset melodiat , tempot ja äänenvoimakkuudet soivat myös mukana saaden ihmiset tuntemaan olonsa innostuneeksi ja innokkaiksi kun he ovat voittamassa .
Musiikin käyttäminen , jotta saadaan ihmiset pelaamaan ja kuluttamaan enemmän , on täydellistä kolikkopelialalla , jolloin sekä pelaajat että kasinoiden omistajat ansaitsevat enemmän rahaa .
Kehittäjien tulisi edelleen parantaa tapoja , joilla he käyttävät musiikkia tuotteissaan houkutellakseen enemmän ihmisiä .
“ This case is unlike anything we have encountered , ” said Ralph S. Boelter , the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. ’s Minneapolis office , which is leading the investigation .
Most of the men are Somali refugees who left the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul in two waves , starting in late 2007 .
While religious devotion may have predisposed them to sympathize with the Islamist cause in Somalia , it took a major geopolitical event  the Ethiopian invasion of their homeland in 2006  to spur them to join what they saw as a legitimate resistance movement , said friends of the men .
For many of the men , the path to Somalia offered something personal as well  a sense of adventure , purpose and even renewal .
In the first wave of Somalis who left were men whose uprooted lives resembled those of immigrants in Europe who have joined the jihad .
They faced barriers of race and class , religion and language .
Mr. Ahmed , the 26 - year - old suicide bomber , struggled at community colleges before dropping out .
His friend Zakaria Maruf , 30 , fell in with a violent street gang and later stocked shelves at a Wal - Mart .
If failure had shadowed this first group of men , the young Minnesotans who followed them to Somalia were succeeding in America .
Mr. Hassan , the engineering student , was a rising star in his college community .
Another of the men was a pre-med student who had once set his sights on an internship at the Mayo Clinic .
They did not leave the United States for a lack of opportunity , their friends said ; if anything , they seemed driven by unfulfilled ambition .
“ Now they feel important , ” said one friend , who remains in contact with the men and , like others , would only speak anonymously because of the investigation .
The case has forced federal agents and terrorism analysts to rethink some of their most basic assumptions about the vulnerability of Muslim immigrants in the United States to the lure of militant Islam .
For years , it seemed that “ homegrown ” terrorism was largely a problem in European countries like Britain and France , where Muslim immigrants had failed to prosper economically or integrate culturally .
By contrast , experts believed that the successful assimilation of foreign - born Muslims in the United States had largely immunized them from the appeal of radical ideologies .
The story of the Twin Cities men does not lend itself to facile categorizations .
They make up a minuscule percentage of their Somali - American community , and it is unclear whether their transformation reflects any broader trend .
Nor are they especially representative of the wider Muslim immigrant population , which has enjoyed a stable and largely middle - class existence .

 He has n’t bombed Iran yet ,  says Ron Paul , when asked to assess the best and worst characteristics of President Barack Obama ’s six months in office .
 The worst thing is he is probably still thinking about it . 
No sooner does the representative from Texas ’ 14th Congressional District , nicknamed  Dr. No by his detractors , find himself embraced by mainstream Republicans ( and even some Democrats ) on domestic policy issues , then he pivots his focus to foreign affairs .
Obama , Paul told POLITICO during a sit - down in his office this week , has talked a little better than his action , but he has already expanded [ the number of troops ] in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
He became the peace candidate : ‘ Yeah , we ’re going to end that war in Iraq . ’
But it ’s not sincere .
I do n’t think they had any intention , never did . 
It ’s a unique time for Paul .
With the economy in the tank , the same cable news shows that spurned him during the election now keep asking him on to talk monetary policy .
Republican
House members are finally voting with him on spending measures .
But following his exhilarant , if quixotic , quest for the presidency , Paul finds himself simultaneously gratified and frustrated by his return to the friendlier - than - before confines of the House of Representatives .
He thinks he ’s well situated in Congress to push for his libertarian causes , but then claims he does n’t " pay a whole lot of attention " to the activity on the House floor these days , adding , " I do n’t think it ’s relevant to the big picture . 
 A lot of this is just tinkering , bailing out , more money , more spending , no shift of direction and it ’s a little bit frustrating , " he says .
Asked if he feels more embraced by the Republican Party establishment , Paul shrugs and says , " half and half . 
" I think there ’s respect .
But they do n’t call me in and say , ‘ What we need to find out from you is how you reach the young people . ’ "
As for another presidential run in 2012 ,  I do n’t think that ’s likely ,  Paul says .
But in the next breath , he admits that he would have made the same prediction three years before his last run for the party ’s banner .
And he questions whether the names being bandied about as possible Republican nominees will connect to his supporters .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
 The one thing that is characteristic about anybody who joins us is that they are energized and everybody recognizes that , " Paul says .
" We also know that it is the energy in a small group of people that really leads nations . 
" Let ’s say I have 15 percent of Republicans and [ Mitt ] Romney has 30 percent .
If his people are n’t energized , our guys might stand for three of his . "
As for soon - to - be departing Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , Paul dismisses her supporters as " more establishment , conventional Country - Club type of Republicans . 
" I wonder whether she ’s energizing the 15 — 20 year olds , " Paul muses .
" That would be a question I would have .
Because she does n’t talk about the Federal Reserve and some of these issues .
She does n’t talk too much about personal liberties , civil liberties , getting rid of drug laws , attacking the war on drugs , punishing people who torture . "

The Best of Ron Paul
Off of EA ’s announcement of the NHL 10 ’s cover athlete today comes word of the selected athlete for their upcoming College basketball game .
Oklahoma Sooners power forward , and AP player of the year , Blake Griffin will be gracing the cover of NCAA Basketball 10 , and unlike the cover athlete for NHL 10 this makes perfect sense .
Black Griffin was the best player in college basketball last year , and is projected to be the number 1 pick in tonight ’s NBA draft .

Agnès Guillemin et Agnès Chryssostalis partagent le même prénom et la même formation : l’école d’architecture de Paris - La Seine .
Elles s’y découvrent complémentaires , partageant une même sensibilité qui forge leur duo .
Après l’école ce sont dans des agences parisiennes qu’elles poursuivent leur route , séparément cette fois : un apprentissage pratique du travail en équipe , de la synthèse économique et programmatique des projets sur lesquels elles travaillent .
Mais l’envie leur vient de développer un vocabulaire propre .
Un choix qui les amène à créer en 2005 leur atelier Agnès & Agnès architecture .
Conception « de l’intérieur vers l’extérieur » , utilisation par touches de la couleur , sensibilité pour l’intériorité et vision de tout « objet » comme une petite architecture – elles créent d’ailleurs une unité de design de mobilier au sein de l’agence …
Leur écriture s’affirme et enchaîne les interventions , souvent en commande directe pour des espaces à vivre ( maisons , lofts , extensions , transformations etc. ) .
Peu à peu l’agence se tourne vers les lieux publics ( avec plusieurs restaurants , hôtels et boutiques ) puis les marchés publics : le contact avec des maîtres d’ouvrage différents – du particulier à la commande unique à l’aménageur de grande ampleur – développe leur capacité d’adaptation à des demandes et des budgets très divers .
L’agence puise dans ces expériences multiples pour renouveler ses modèles et ses méthodes , avec toujours pour mot d’ordre la continuité entre les espaces intérieurs et extérieurs , la qualité d’usage des lieux de vie et la réversibilité des solutions proposées .
Health and safety ban coffee morning pensioners at public library - because they could spill hot drinks on children
A group of pensioners have been banned from holding a coffee morning at a public library for health and safety reasons - in case they spill hot drinks on children .
The seven members of the Over 50s coffee morning have been meeting every Tuesday for the past four years without incident at the Eye Library in Eye , near Peterborough , Cambridgeshire .
But council officials have now axed the meetings claiming that toddlers from a nearby nursery who use the library at the same time could be injured if hot coffee spilt on them .
Banned : Derek Taylor slammed the ' laughable ' moves of Peterborough City Council for axing the coffee morning group over safety fears
Now members , who used to pay 20 p each to the library to cover costs , have arranged to meet at each other 's homes instead .
Coffee club member Derek Taylor slammed the ' laughable ' move and claimed they had usually finished their drinks by the time the toddlers arrived for their half hour visit .
' It is just laughable really .
It is health and safety gone through the roof , ' he said .
' Nearly four years ago we set up a coffee morning at Eye Library after the librarian at the time came up with the idea , and since then about seven of us have been going there every Tuesday .
' About three weeks ago a toddlers group started coming up on the Tuesday as well , and then this week when we went , we were told that we would not be allowed any tea or coffee because of health and safety reasons because there is a risk we could spill hot tea on the children .
' However , we understand that is not the case at all , because we have always finished our drinks before the children even arrive , and that it is the case that the librarian does n't want to wash up extra cups .
' It is very disappointing , we all thoroughly enjoy the weekly meeting , it is a chance for us all to catch up and have a chat . '
Anger brewing : The Over 50s coffee morning group have now been forced to meet at each other 's houses after four years of gatherings at the Eye Library ( above ) without incident
Retired office worker Patricia Owen , 70 , and her husband Ray , 69 , have also been attending the coffee mornings since they were launched .
' We are being told we can't have a hot drink .
Health and safety is a silly excuse , ' Mrs Owen said .
' We have now made alternative arrangements and plan to have our coffee mornings at each other 's homes . '
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents ( RoSPA ) has called for sensible risk assessments to be made .
' While the last thing anyone would want is a toddler getting scalded , risk assessments should n't only be based on hazards , ' said the group 's spokesman Carl Christopher .
' They should also be based on the probability of these hazards occurring .
' This would seem to be a disproportionate reaction to risk .
I 'm sure a sensible compromise could be found that does not leave these pensioners on the streets . '
Peterborough City Council , who run the library , said there were ' concerns ' about hot drinks being served when children were close by .
A spokesman said : ' In recent months a group from the local nursery has started to visit Eye library every Tuesday , between 11 am to 11.30 am .
' Unfortunately , their visit also overlaps with the regular meeting of the Over 50s coffee morning .
' However , we do not want to spoil anyone 's fun , and will be speaking to both groups to see if we can be more flexible about the timings so that the nursery group are not in the library at the time the coffee morning is meeting .'
I ’m writing in response to Keene Sentinel columnist Michael Schuman ’s story titled “ Will the Free Staters Please Sit Down ? ” I must admit , a couple of years ago , before coming to understand the message of liberty , I would have agreed with Schuman ’s opinions .
Schuman ’s views are consistent with what many would describe as main stream America .
Unfortunately many of his ideas are based in ignorance and misunderstanding that stems from a lack of critical thinking .
Like most of us , Schuman probably attended government indoctrination centers where school children are taught to stand on their X , respect authority , and do as you ’re told without question .
Take a look at the pledge of allegiance .
How many other countries have one ?
How many of you know it was written by Fancis Bellamy , a National Socialist ( Nazi ) flag salesman , to “ instill a strong belief in the state . ”
Dont believe me ?
Look it up on the internet .
You ’re likely to find the same picture I did of school children doing a Roman salute – the same one Hitler ’s army used – before that was changed after WWII .
Schuman ’s description of a classical libertarian is severely flawed and his examples display an ignorance of private property vs. individual rights .
The article begins by describing libertarians as “ a Republican who wants to smoke pot and watch porn . ”
What does it mean to be a Republican – or a Democrat – these days ?
The only difference I can discern between the two parties is how they want to take more of your money to grow government .
The red / blue game is simply a distraction to keep the masses complacent while government works to extract more of your wealth to exert greater control over your life .
Classical libertarians on the other hand believe it ’s wrong to initiate force or violence on others to provide a product or service .
Sure government seems fair and even “ necessary , ” but what happens if you do n’t pay their taxes ?
While we ’re at it , have you ever wondered how two main viewpoints ( or parties ) manage to represent hundreds of millions of people ?
How is it countries like Sweden and Switzerland have hundreds of political parties with members elected to Parliament ?
Could it be that campaign finance “ reform ” is a tool used by the two major parties to retain power while setting the bar high enough to prevent new entrants from gaining a foothold ?
Many of you are probably libertarians without realizing it .

Schuman continued with a concert example concerning a woman who remained standing despite everyone around her sitting to enjoy the concert .
Libertarians believe in social ostracism , which Schuman did when he had someone ask her to tak a seat .
Schuman ’s failure was likely caused by a lack of numbers .
Would the result have been the same if twenty people were shouting “ sit down ! ” instead of one person asking ?
The additional pressure might have changed her mind ; I ’ve seen it work .
Failing to get his way , Schuman then went to get the authorities ( the usher ) , just as government trains us to snitch on our neighbors , rather than seeking to understand and resolve differences .
In the story , the woman refused to sit , saying she had a right to stand , and the usher decided there was nothing he could do .
This is where Schuman concludes libertarians are selfish based on his limited understanding of rights .
If I ’m invited to a friend ’s house ( private property ) and he has a “ no shoes inside ” policy , do I have a “ right ” to wear shoes in his house ?
If I do n’t like the policy , I wo n’t go over to his house , or I ’ll see if I can bring a pair of slippers to wear inside .
In Schuman ’s example , libertarians may advocate : petitioning the venue for a standingin / seated section ; a boycott of the venue ; opening your own venue , where you set the rules ; requesting a refund from the venue ’s management .
What would Schuman ’s solution involve ?
Perhaps he suggests a “ no standing ” law commanding the guns of government to punish the woman with arrest , taxpayers with enforcement costs , and the private property owner by trampling his rights and ability to provide innovative solutions to changing customer demands .
Libertarians believe in the power of a true free market to solve problems , and we understand the unintended consequences that arise from using force – government – to solve problems .
Schuman continues by comparing the Free State Project to a Christian Fundamentalist group moving to South Carolina .
He left out the Mormons who moved to Salt Lake City .
I ’m left wondering about the political fathers and the 13 % of American colonists who supported them in throwing off British rule .
Would that make Mr. Schuman one of the loyalists , the 30 % of the population happy with British rule ?
Many of them were run off to Canada .
While Schuman seemed to understand at least one aspect of the trillion dollar failure that is the war on drugs , he does n’t seem to understand the concept of a victimless crime .
In his initial attempt to discredit this idea he repeats his earlier flawed concept with the smoking issue .
Again the issue is private property .
Are you a victim of second hand smoke if you voluntarily decide to patronize an establishment that allows smoking on its private property ?
Customers and employees are free to ostracize , patronize , or increase choice and diversity in the marketplace through competition .
Schuman then set his sights on gun control .
He references what he describes as almost daily shooting sprees around the nation .
What he fails to mention , and what most do n’t understand is this : the most deadly cities in America – New York , D.C. , LA , Chicago – also have the most restrictive gun laws .
States with the least restrictive gun laws like New Hampshire and Vermont also enjoy some of the lowest crime rates .
The facts show gun laws reduce safety .
In what seems like a direct attempt to discredit the messenger , Schuman implies the Free State Project is an extreme organization .
In his article , he describes the New Hampshire Free Press – a local paper which publishes stories on topics including the 9/11 Truth Movement and the John Birch Society – as “ one of the project ’s media outlets . ”
As a fellow journalist , I would expect Schuman to do some basic fact checking and investigation .
Spending 5 minutes reading the FAQ section at FreeStateProject.org , and he would have understood that the Free State Project exists solely to encourage liberty activists to move to New Hampshire and get active for liberty .
The FSP does not endorse any political parties , not any candidates , nor any legislation .
It certainly does n’t have any media outlets !
Here ’s how the FSP works : people hear about the message of liberty and eventually the FSP ; they move to New Hampshire ; they learn about the various things activists are doing and they decide what they want to support .
The FSP is not involved past moving .
Some liberty activists see something they want to change – like the government abrogating freedom of the press – while others come up with new ideas – like volunteering at the Community Kitchen , the monthly canned food drive , or Keene Freedom Fest , to name a few .
These activists come up with a plan and the people who think it ’s a good idea support it .
The best ideas garner the most support .
If someone is unhappy with the way things are going they splinter off and start their own group .
It ’s happened several times , and the liberty movement grows stronger and more diverse with each split .
It ’s something a command and control , top - down organization could never accomplish .
It ’s also the way a true free market – most libertarians advocate – would operate .
No leaders ; no structure ; only individuals standing for and supporting what they believe .
That brings us to Schuman ’s last example , my unlawful indefinite detainment without trial for filming on public property .
To begin with my last name is Dodson , not Miller , and Schuman acknowledges my identity is no secret .
Had he done the slightest bit of investigation he would know that I have identified myself , with a fingerprint , as demanded by their laws .
Had he reviewed the publicly available court filings , he would know the court / prosecutor team has presented no laws to the contrary .
He would also know that over the last month and a half the courts have ignored most of our requests including 3 separate motions to schedule a trial .
Is that what this country was founded upon , arresting journalists critical of the state and holding them indefinitely without trial ?
Schuman then points out that taxpayers have been forced to pay thousands of dollars for my detainment and asks , is this a victimless crime ?
Absolutely not , along with me , taxpayers are victims of an out of control judge , protected by a lifetime appointment , who ’s willing to throw away as much of your money as he wants to challenge the slightest threat to his authority .
This has little to do with my identity and everything to do with control .
Schuman attempts to close his story by drawing an analogy between my situation and a Peanuts comic strip in which Snoopy is described as doing something “ Pretty stupid ! ” Gandhi said it best , “ First they laugh at you , then they fight you , then you win . ”
While Schuman and others may be laghing , the New Hampshire bureaucrats have started fighting .
Unfortunately , they ’re fighting an idea ; an idea that , thanks to press coverage on the internet , The Keene Sentinel , the Boston Globe , Fox News , and Break the Matrix , has now spread over a quarter million people , a handful of which are now planning their move to New Hampshire .
Laugh all you want , and I hope you do n’t mind if I join you .

NASHVILLE , Tenn . --
At just 19 years old , Sahel Kazemi thought she had it all :
She was dating former NFL star Steve McNair , partying in VIP rooms and vacationing in Las Vegas .
When her family visited Nashville for her 20th birthday less than two months ago , they said she was very happy and planning to move in with McNair .
She thought he was in the final stages of a divorce from his wife of 12 years .
Only there was no divorce .
And Kazemi's happiness soon changed into something much darker .
Kazemi was laid to rest Friday in a private , 30 - minute ceremony attended by about 30 family members and friends at Jacksonville Memory Gardens .
Cemetery officials prevented reporters and photographers from covering the graveside service .
Nashville police say in the days leading up to the murder - suicide , Kazemi saw another young woman leaving the condominium where she and McNair would soon be found dead .
Kazemi also was worried about money .
On Thursday , July 2 , the same day she was arrested for DUI , Kazemi purchased a 9 mm semiautomatic pistol for $ 100 from a man in the parking lot of the mall where she worked .
About two weeks before Kazemi killed McNair and herself , police say , she poured out her troubles in a chance meeting with Vera Mosley Buckner , a customer at the Dave and Buster 's restaurant where Kazemi worked .
The young waitress asked Buckner , a stranger , if she could talk to her .
" She sat down in the booth in front of me and the first thing she said was , ' Have you ever been in love ? ' " said Buckner , of Decatur , Ala .
Kazemi then opened her heart .
" She said , ' I date Steve McNair . ' ...
And she said , ' We 've been dating for eight months and we 've been on all kinds of vacations , but lately he acts like he does n't want to spend time with me and I do n't know what to do . ' "
By sometime in the early hours of the Fourth of July , she had made up her mind .
Police say when McNair went to his downtown condo sometime between 1:30 and 2 a.m. on Saturday , Kazemi 's car was already there .
He was sitting on the sofa , likely asleep , when she shot him twice in the head and twice in the chest .
Then she sat down next to him , positioning herself so that she would fall into his lap , and shot herself .
Family and friends were shocked at the news , describing Kazemi as a sweet girl who did not have it in her to kill someone .
They also said she would not have wanted to kill herself .
" She was enjoying her life , " said her nephew , Farzin Abdi .
" She just had it made , you know , [ with ] this guy taking care of everything . "
Abdi said Kazemi , who went by the name " Jenni , " met McNair while working as a waitress at Dave and Buster's .
Restaurant manager Chris Truelove said of Kazemi , " She was pretty outgoing .
A lot of the guests liked being around her , and she liked being around the guests . "
She was also slender and curvy , with long black hair and an olive complexion .
Her looks were compelling enough that Buckner 's two daughters asked Kazemi to take a picture with them .
Sahel Kazemi apparently met Steve McNair while working as a waitress at a sports bar and restaurant .

Kazemi told relatives that she refused McNair 's advances at first .
But soon they began dating , and before long he was at her apartment a couple of nights a week -- so often that neighbors thought he might be living there .
Abdi says McNair took Kazemi on vacations to Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Key West , Fla. , and his home state of Mississippi .
Pictures of the two parasailing together have surfaced on the celebrity Web site TMZ.com .
All that would have been exciting for any young woman , but it must have seemed unbelievable for Kazemi , who dropped out of high school and moved to Nashville from Florida with a boyfriend at age 17 , sometimes working two or three jobs to support herself .
Born in Iran , she and her family were persecuted for their Baha'i faith , Abdi said .
When Kazemi was 9 , her mother was murdered , according to an account her ex-boyfriend gave The Tennessean newspaper in Nashville .
After that , the family fled to Turkey before settling in Florida .
Despite the tragedy of her childhood , she was relentlessly upbeat .
Asked to describe her personality , Abdi said , " She was a very energetic girl .
She never got tired .
She wanted to have fun all the time . "
She was proud of the fact that she did not have to ask her family for money , and from what she told Abdi , McNair also liked her independence .
" He liked her so much because they would go shopping and stuff and she would want to spend her own money , " Abdi said .
" The reason he said he loves her is because she 's not trying to use him like other girls .
She was different from other girls he had been with . "
But police say Kazemi was spiraling out of control in the days just before killing McNair and taking her own life -- although there was no suicide note .
Police said she had recently begun to suspect McNair was seeing another young woman .
Kazemi had even followed that woman home , although she did not confront her .
And she was starting to get into financial trouble .
Her roommate had recently moved out , doubling her rent .
And she was making payments on a Kia as well as a Cadillac Escalade that she had said was a gift from McNair .
The title was in both of their names .
She had been pulled over for DUI in that Escalade two days before the Fourth of July .
She had posted an ad on Craigslist to sell her furniture because , according to Abdi , she planned to move in with McNair .
Later that Thursday , Kazemi bought the gun .
According to police , the next day she told an associate , " My life is a ball of s--- and I should just end it . "
That may be the last clue as to what motivated her actions after she left work early and ended up at McNair 's condo .
As police chief Ronal Serpas said , " It will never be known exactly what was on Kazemi 's mind early Saturday morning . "

Web searches using the terms " sex " or " sexual " from India on Microsoft 's new search engine Bing receive a message that the search may return sexually explicit content and advises users to change search terms .
But if the user enters terms such as " sex selection " or " choose child sex , " the search engine returns a large number of links relating to the sexual selection of children before birth .
" This is a violation of the law , as search engines are providing access to information that leads to female infanticide , " said Sabu Mathew George , an activist campaigning for tighter regulation of information available on the Internet on sex selection .
In India , the advertisement of products and techniques to aid in sex selection of unborn children is an offense under the country 's " The Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques ( Prohibition of Sex Selection ) Act . "
Google and other search companies pulled down sex selection advertisements in India in 2008 , after George petitioned India 's Supreme Court that some companies were promoting sex selection techniques and products through advertising and links on their search engines .
But searches on engines from Google and now Bing still return information on sex selection , George said .
Microsoft 's spokeswoman in India was not immediately available for comment .
Bing has been criticized in some countries including the U.S. because adult content , including pornographic videos , can be easily viewed .
Bing has an " autoplay " feature that lets users preview videos by hovering the cursor over a search result .
By refusing to return results when users in India search for the term " sex , " Bing is placing itself on the safe side of Indian law .
The country 's Information Technology
Act considers it an offense for anyone who " publishes or transmits or causes to be published " online pornographic material .
Those found in violation of the law face a fine and imprisonment .

You can easily install Windows 7 from a USB drive
Microsoft's TechNet magazine has posted instructions on installing Windows 7 from a USB key - which will be very handy for anyone installing Windows 7 on a netbook , in particular .
Installing Windows 7 from a USB key will also be faster than installing it from DVD .
Here , according to TechNet , is what you need to do :
1 . You should already have DiskPart installed on your Windows machine - you 'll use this to prepare the USB drive .
If this free disk partitioning app is n't already already installed , you can download DiskPart from Microsoft .
2. Launch DiskPart by typing diskpart into the Start search box .
3 . Now run the list disk command to check the status of your drive .
4 . Next , run select disk 1 where the " 1 " is actually the corresponding number of your USB drive .
5 . Now run clean .
6 . Once that 's done , run create partition primary .
7 . Now you can make the partition active by entering active .
8 . Next , set up the file system as Fat32 by running format fs=fat32 quick .
9 . Enter the assign command to give the USB drive a drive letter - this will make it easier to access from Windows Explorer .
10 . Drag and drop the contents of your Windows 7 installation DVD onto the USB drive to copy the files across .
11 . Stick the USB key drive into the machine you want to install Windows 7 onto and boot the system from the drive .
The Windows 7 installation will now begin .

The notion of open game worlds has always appealed to me , ever since Elite .
When there ’s even the faintest whiff on a free roaming environment , or virtuality that I can go off an explore , I ’m interested .
It ’s an impulse that leads me to spend endless hours in Stalker , or to expend an entire day driving around Fuel .
But whatever game I play , I end up feeling somewhat dissatisfied .
It ’s kind of dissatisfaction that does not seem to be so common with linear or arena games .
I think it ’s to do with a specific tension that open world games create : between what the game is about , and what the environment – and its openness – implies .
The most obvious example of this tension that I can think of exists in Far Cry 2 .
The game ’s environment is a brilliant Africa - in - miniature , and everything from the flies buzzing in the air to the gleam of the swampy jungle has been conjured spectacularly .
The combat too is entertaining : fire propagation , over - wrought grenade physics , ludicrous close - combat battle - horror at the end of a semi-automatic shotgun .
But the two systems do not mesh comfortably .
Far Cry 2 tries to push your experience as close to that of a traditional shooter as it can manage in this open environment .
Once you ’re outside of the key “ safe ” towns , anything and everything is an enemy , or a target .
It is , like any traditional shooter , a rolling battle .
This surprised and exasperated many gamers , because while they were happy to suspend disbelief for a game like , say , Crysis , which could be seen as a very wide corridor , they could not make the same leap for a game that did not really funnel you continuously in a single direction .
The verisimilitude of Far Cry ’s world – with its network of roads , villages , rivers and army encampments – seemed at odds with our experience of it .
Where everyone was an enemy , and everything would chase , shoot , and attack you , the world seemed at odds with itself .
The very notion of it being an open world seemed to suggest that the game would support more life : civilians , passive enemies , the illusion of a wider world .
I think about this , and I think about Outcast , the voxel sci- fi adventure .
Right there , back in 1999 , was a game brave enough to say : “ here ’s a world , it ’s full of life , politics , danger , go deal with it and save your own world in the process . ”
You traipsed out into its pixellated valleys and did precisely that .
Thanks to the freedom of movement and general neutrality of much of the world of Outcast , when combat occurred it was an moment of high drama .
Combat in Far Cry 2 , meanwhile , is often reduced to a kind of road - clearance .
The Outcast player ’s experience of being in a particular , although virtual , place was therefore ( despite its incredibly lack of visual fidelity by modern standards ) incredibly potent .
The illusionism required for an open world game is different to that of a linear game .
For Half - Life 2 the illusion is all about momentum .
As Gillen regularly points out , such games are all about forward motion , and they break down the moment we do n’t see where to go , or who to shoot .
Open world games go for quite a different illusion .
They might simple be a big arena for stuff to happen in , or they might try to be a little more indulgent of our imagination , and to try to create the illusion that there ’s really something going on , that there ’s life .
Perhaps the best illusion of a living environment is the one generated by GTA4 .
The city of Rockstar ’s most recent game is a masterwork on its own , without any of the game elements considered .
I find myself lost in it , staring out of the window of a taxi with a similar reverie to that of visiting a real foreign city .
Except here I can be much braver , and explore more fearlessly into dangerous terrain .
It ’s the potency of GTA4 ’s illusion of cityness that really gets me : the chatter on the sidewalks , the slow chug of the traffic around town , the general ambient goings on that pay little attention to you unless you specifically interfere with them .
The failure of Far Cry 2 ( and also in a related sense Fallout 3 and Assassin ’s Creed ) was that the design never really made a bid for that kind of suspension of disbelief .
You were the centre of what was going on in those worlds , and you always knew it .
The illusion of life outside of your own in - game activities is , perhaps , one thing open worlds need pursue and exploit , beyond even the essential mechanics of their game .
Stalker , for example , was fundamentally a shooter , just like Far Cry 2 , but the existence of neutral or indifferent entities , the very - slightly wider range of interactions ( an inventory , non-combat items ) seemed to expand the illusion into something we wanted to poke , prod , and understand the limits of .
This spooky Ukrainian countryside - dungeon really could be The Zone , and I could be the rogue , hooded individual charged with exploring it .
While not precisely open - world in the same way GTA4 is , the game provided a sense of life and non-linearity that allowed you to get lost in it , and invest in it , because you were always given reasons to value the idea of exploring it .
Exploring .
That seems to be to be the other aspect of open worlds that developers need to make the most of if they want to have their world mean something to players .
Aside from the randomly distributed nonsense - money of Far Cry 2 ’s diamonds , it had little reason for you to poke about in particular points on the map .
You could not expect to find many secrets – perhaps a hang - glider here and there .
Instead , you followed the missions and did the violence where it was directed , and therefore most fruitful .
I ’d argue that where the open world model prospers is often when it gives you reason to explore and investigate its limits : finding the very highest jumps or the most obscure billboards in Burnout Paradise , for an example that is neither a shooter , nor trying to create the illusion of a living world .
I often feel as though open world games create fantastic places , but then fail to create a game that is appropriate to the environment we find ourselves in .
Fallout 3 ’s mechanics , voices , and character design left me struggling to enjoy what is , clearly , an astonishing feat of world creation .
I know that many people felt similarly aggrieved with Oblivion , although I actually got on with that a whole lot better .
Similarly , when I played Assassin ’s Creed my continuing reaction ( aside from my indignation at the cutscenes ) was a disbelief that the design team had done so little to exploit their astonishing medieval city .
It felt , at times , that the assassination game was going on in spite of their bustling city around me – as if the team had created this beautiful world and then did n’t really know what to do with it , because they had this assassin game to be getting on with too …
So to come full circle with the sense of dissatisfaction with open world games : I think the way we experience them , by comparison with linear games , says something about how our gaming imagination functions .
We seem to understand that when linear games point us in a certain direction , that ’s the way to go .
When an open world game appears , its very structure suggests something about how we should behave , or want to behave , and predisposes us to judge on the basis of how it entices us to go somewhere that the game itself has n’t suggested , and on how it then deals with that action .
Further , there seems to be a need for us to feel more embedded , as if our actions matter more where we can come back to the scene of our actions .
In Far Cry 2 I did n’t expect the enemies I ’d killed at a checkpoint to reappear : the open world had led me to expect some level of persistence .
In Fallout 3 I did n’t expect to be constrained by the ropes of the story , or the level structure , because that moment stepping outside the vault said : the horizon is the limit to this .
Perhaps my own suspension of disbelief simply becomes less easy to manage , because the illusion of “ worldiness ” is n’t strong enough , or the game is really a linear experience in a very wide corridor , with no real reason for us to stray off the path .
One day I should like to see a game perform the incredible genre - splicing process required to marry up the elements that make various successful open worlds so strong .
I should like that game to give me a direction , a purpose , without telling me exactly what I need to be doing .
I should like it to ignore me , but nevertheless carry my mark when I choose make it .
This imaginary game will , I hope , dump me on the midst of a strange place , perhaps with with a pyre of smoke on the horizon , and instruct me : “ survive ” .
I ’d like that .
( Also , it would have an absolutely incredible map , but that ’s another blog post . )
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
The woman who stabbed pregnant actress Sharon Tate to death will be considered for parole from prison a month after the 40th anniversary of the killings that cast a shadow of fear over southern California .
Susan Atkins , shown here after her indictment in the Manson murders , has been denied parole 17 times .
Susan Atkins , 61 , has been denied parole in 12 previous hearings , but the former " Manson Family " member now is terminally ill with brain cancer and is paralyzed .
Charles Manson used his hypnotic powers to direct Atkins and other " family " members to kill seven people , including the pregnant Tate , in a two - night rampage that terrorized the city of Los Angeles , California , in August 1969 .
Atkins -- who was initially sentenced to death along with Manson and three others -- will have her 13th parole hearing on September 2 , according to a spokesman with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
In July of last year , Atkins -- California 's longest - serving female inmate -- was denied a compassionate release in a unanimous decision by the California Board of Parole Hearings .
She has repeatedly been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings , and she now shuns Manson .
By her own admission , Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy and stabbed the pregnant woman 16 times .
In a 1993 parole board hearing , Atkins said Tate " asked me to let her baby live .
... I told her I did n't have any mercy on her . "
After stabbing
Tate to death , according to historical accounts of the murders , Atkins scrawled the word " pig " in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband , director Roman Polanski .
Polanski was not home at the time , but three of Tate 's house guests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager who was visiting the home 's caretaker in his nearby cottage .
A Web site maintained by her husband and attorney , James Whitehouse , says Atkins is now paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and cannot sit up in bed or even be moved into a wheelchair .
However , despite her declining condition and her impressive prison record , the site says , " there is still a very real chance the Parole Board will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society . "
Atkins ' compassionate release was opposed by Tate 's sister , Debra , Los Angeles County prosecutors and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , among others .
However , the former prosecutor who won her conviction , Vincent Bugliosi , said he supports Atkins ' request for release .
" She has paid substantially , though not completely , for her horrendous crimes , " Bugliosi told the Los Angeles Times last year .
" Paying completely would mean imposing the death penalty . "
Bugliosi is the author of several books on the Manson case , including " Helter Skelter . "
Debra
Tate told CNN in an e-mail in March that she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free , saying the slayings were " so vicious , so inhumane , so depraved , that there is no turning back . "
" The ' Manson Family ' murderers are sociopaths , and from that , they can never be rehabilitated , " Debra Tate said .
" They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die .
There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the ' Manson Family . '
Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we , as a society who values justice , can do . "
In a manuscript posted on her Web site , Atkins , who was known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz , wrote that " this is the past I have to live with , and I have to live with it every day . "
" Unlike the reader , or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool , I can't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life .
Just like the families and friends of the victims , this is with me every day .
I have to wake up every day with this and no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community I will never be able to replace what my crime took away .
And that 's not ' neat , ' and that 's not ' cool . ' "
Atkins was housed in the California Institution for Women at Frontera until May 2008 , when her declining health caused her to be moved to Central California Women 's Facility at Chowchilla .
Manson and those convicted along with him in the murders -- Atkins , Patricia Krenwinkel , Leslie Van Houten and Charles " Tex " Watson -- have been in California prisons for more than three decades .
All were initially sentenced to death , only to have their sentences commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down death penalty laws in 1972 , establishing a four - year moratorium on executions .
Van Houten was released for six months after her conviction was overturned , but was reconvicted .

( CNN ) --
A group of black Philadelphia police officers filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against their department , alleging an online forum geared toward city police is " infested with racist , white supremacist and anti-African - American content . "
A group of black police officers claim other colleagues post racist messages on domelights.com during work .
The suit alleges white officers post on and moderate the privately operated site , Domelights.com , both on and off the job .
Domelights ' users " often joke about the racially offensive commentary on the site ... or will mention them in front of black police officers , " thus creating " a racially hostile work environment , " according to lawyers for the all - black Guardian Civic League , the lead plaintiff in the suit .
A look at the site 's forums Friday for racist comments found several possibilities .
Reads one : " In urban areas , it seems [ African - Americans ] living on welfare in paid for housing is ingrained in their culture as well as fighting .
...
Kids , along with adults can't speak proper English or spell at a 3rd grade level , but they can sing among " theyselves " the lyrics to a rap song . "
Said another Domelights user of an African - American woman : " She is a classic example of that exact non tax paying , no car insurance driving , bad weave wearing , all the whitey 's are racist black women . "
The site 's tagline is " the voice of the good guys . "
" Every time African - Americans do or say something in our city , we get this backlash of cops who think they 're anonymous on this Web site -- just racist , nasty , hurtful things about what we do , " said Rochelle Bilal , the president of the Guardian Civic League and a 23 - year veteran of the force .
The league 's attorney said other black officers echo Bilal 's statement .
" We 've heard the same story over and over again , which is that [ African - American officers ] witness in the workplace Domelights being used and discussed [ in a racial manner ] , " said Brian Mildenberg , whose firm is also representing several campers from a mostly black Philadelphia day camp that recently gained national attention when its members were turned away from a swim club .
He said it was " a gift from the heavens in a way that the two things happened at once . "
While Mildenberg and Bilal said they had been monitoring the 10 - year - old Web site for years , the pool incident did seem to play into the timing of the lawsuit .
" When they said something about our pretty , brown , young , innocent children and called them monkeys because they wanted to go swimming , that was enough , " Bilal said .
She may have been referring to this comment posted on Domelights : " Maybe the people who work for a living did n't want to swim with a bunch of ghetto monkey faces . "
The lawsuit also highlights comments made on Domelights by the site 's founder and administrator , a sergeant in the Philadelphia police force who goes by the online handle " McQ . "
A statement from McQ that Mildenberg described as " racially abusive commentary " reads , " Blacks and other minorities frequently do n't have the resources that white people have .
Consequently , blacks may not be able to keep their vehicles inspected , registered , and roadworthy . "
McQ is also listed as a defendant in the lawsuit .
Asked why McQ bears responsibility for the racist remarks of his site 's anonymous commenters , Mildenberg said it was because " he started it . "
The person known as McQ did not respond to a request for comment , but posted a message on the site citing the lawsuit .
McQ wrote that the suit may cause the Web site to be suspended , but added his statement was not an admission of wrongdoing .
" I categorically deny any wrongdoing on my part , " the message reads .
" I did not make racist posts .
I did not maintain the Web site on city time . "
Ideally , Mildenberg said , his clients would like to see the site shut down .
Failing that , they want Philadelphia police officers to be prohibited from posting comments on the site , particularly during working hours .
The plaintiffs in the class - action suit also are seeking unspecified financial damages available under the Civil Rights Act for Philadelphia 's 2,300 African - American police officers , according to Mildenberg .
Shelley Smith , Philadelphia 's city solicitor , said .
" The lawsuit is about a private Web site .
It 's not a police department Web site .
It 's not operated or overseen by the police department .
The allegations against the city and police department are misplaced . "

Rob Bennett for The New York Times
Updated , July 21 , 12:01 p.m. |
On Tuesday , two consumer advocacy groups , using the Freedom of Information Act , made public for the first time federal research about the serious and growing threat of cellphone use on America ’s roadways .
The research was for a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that never happened in part because of concerns about angering Congress .
An increasing number of studies show that driving while talking on a cellphone can be dangerously distracting .
Yet most states have not barred handheld phones , and none have banned all drivers from using hands - free devices .
( Half a dozen states and the District of Columbia prohibit driving while holding a phone ; currently 14 states and the District of Columbia ban texting while driving . )
Some opponents say cellphone bans are simply not enforceable .
Others argue that drivers do all sorts of distracting things while driving — like eating , arguing with kids in the back seat , listening to music — so it makes little sense to outlaw one activity .
We asked several experts how significant is the cellphone hazard ?
As a matter of public safety , should all cellphone use while driving be banned ?
Education , Backed by Law
Janet P. Froetscher is president of the National Safety Council .
More than 50 research studies have reported the risks of cellphone use while driving .
Talking on a cellphone while driving makes a person four times more likely to be in a crash .
This is a much higher risk than most other distracting activities , including eating , drinking , reading billboards , listening to the radio , or talking to other passengers .
It ’s the cellphone conversation that diverts people ’s attention from the road .
The National Safety Council has called for a total ban on cellphone use while driving because more than 100 million people are engaged in this high - risk activity every day .
We do not support laws that would permit the use of hands - free devices , because there is no scientific evidence that those devices are any safer for drivers .
Hands - free - only laws send the wrong message and may actually encourage more unsafe behavior .
In fact , hands - free - only laws tend to send the wrong message — that drivers can safely talk on phones without getting into crashes .
And such laws may actually do harm , if drivers , lulled into a false perception of safety , start using hands - free phones to make more calls and talk longer .
Some argue that the cellphone laws are not enforceable .
But many law enforcement officers involved in the setting of our policy do n’t agree .
There are various approaches available , and there are some good models to follow .
For example , a “ high visibility mobilization ” strategy — letting drivers know laws will be enforced — has been developed to enforce drunk driving , speeding , seat belts , child safety seats and graduated licensing for teens .
With this approach , several times each year , people are informed that law enforcement is paying special attention to a particular law .
Read more …
These programs are designed to increase compliance with a law , not to write more tickets .
The science is clear : high visibility mobilizations can cause people to change their high - risk behavior and comply with the law .
The same model could be use to increase compliance with cellphone laws .
Laws , of course , are not the only way to address this problem .
Educating people about the risks and the science is also important .
Verizon Wireless , one of the major carriers , does this well on its Web site : “ For your well being and the well being of those around you , you should consider turning your phone off and allowing calls to go to Voice Mail while you are driving . ”
That message needs to go mainstream .
Total Bans May Be Impractical
David Champion is director of automobile testing at Consumer Reports .
There is no question that talking on a cellphone while driving is a dangerous distraction .
The issue that has caused much debate is the magnitude of the distraction .
Many studies have shown that the level of distraction has more to do with the intensity of the conversation and not whether the phone is hand - held or hands - free .
An in - depth conversation that requires a good deal of thought causes a higher level of distraction than a relatively short “ Can you pick up milk on the way home , Honey ” type of call .
Both the length and intensity of the call increase the risk of a crash .
The longer the call or the more in - depth or emotional the conversation is , the more the driver concentrates on the call rather than on his or her driving .
Why not make the punishment for crashes caused by cellphone use extremely high ?
According to a study by the University of Utah cellphone users drive slower , pass less often and take longer to get to their destination .
Compared with undistracted drivers , those who used cellphones drove an average of 2 miles per hour slower .
This is a good sign , but even driving slowly can cause accidents because annoyed drivers who are being held up may drive recklessly to pass the cellphone user .
Whether it ’s talking on a cellphone , eating or drinking , adjusting the radio , or programming your navigation system , increasingly , it seems that driving is not always the top priority in the car .
Read more …
Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ’s 100 - Car Study indicated that if a driver takes his eyes off of the road for more than two seconds , it greatly increases the risk of a crash .
Together with the intensity of the conversation , cellphone use is becoming a major cause of road crashes and fatalities .
Texting while driving raises this level of risk exponentially .
Ultimately , if the studies show that talking on a cellphone provides the equivalent impairment of having a blood alcohol level of 0.8 — the limit to drive a car in most states — the use of cellphones while driving should be banned .
This is probably an impractical solution , but since other restrictions all have their own issues , the best solution in the near term is to warn drivers with public service announcements of the risks involved with cellphone use and make the punishment for crashes caused by cellphone use extremely high .
Let People Dial While Driving
Katherine Mangu - Ward is a senior editor at Reason magazine .
In 1995 , 13 percent of the U.S. population owned a cellphone .
Today , cellphone ownership rates are well over 80 percent .
In those 14 years , the annual number of motor vehicle deaths has remained eerily constant , hovering around 40,000 .
We must resist the impulse to pass a bunch of new laws that simply satisfy our need to do “ something . ”
These tidy numbers do n’t prove that driving while simultaneously talking to your mom and texting your sister is a brilliant , risk - free idea .
( Perhaps that figure could have been lower . )
But the facts do suggest that the rise of the killer cellphone — and the corresponding need for government intervention — has been exaggerated .
As strong as the impulse may be to pass a bunch of new laws in order to satisfy our need to do “ something , ” we must resist .
The human brain is a funny , quirky thing .
We ’re not great at estimating risk , especially at the extreme ends of the scale .
A few news stories about tragic texting deaths , plus a new brain study or two , and we start to lose track of where cellphone use fits on the risk scale .
Rubbernecking , or “ looking at an external object , ” triples your risk of being involved in a crash or near crash — about the same increase as dialing a phone .
“ Reaching for a moving object ” — a kid , say increases the risk by nine times .
Yet there is no clamor to ban mobile parenting .
Read more …
We humans are also notably bad at comparing concentrated costs with diffuse benefits .
It ’s easy to tally up the costs of dialing while driving — there are accident reports and mortality figures .
But it ’s much harder to add up all the benefits .
Think of every carpool disaster averted , grocery list amended , or stress - relieving traffic update made possible by the use of cellphones in cars .
Think of every kid who got through to his mom , every long - distance relationship maintained , every roadtrip rescued .
True , these are n’t matters of life and death , but billions of tiny gains in happiness and reductions in stress are too often overlooked in public policy debates .
The Trouble With Cellphone Laws
Anne McCartt is senior vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , a nonprofit research organization funded by auto insurers .
It ’s clear that cellphone use while driving increases crash risk .
But it ’s far from clear that laws prohibiting all cellphone use behind the wheel will have much effect on driver behavior .
Research now links talking on a cellphone to a greater likelihood of crashes .
A 2005 Institute study of drivers in Western Australia found cellphone users four times as likely to get into injury - producing crashes .
The study , using cellphone billing records to verify phone use of drivers , found that the increased risk was similar for males and females , drivers younger and older than 30 , and hands - free and hand - held phones .
If officers ca n’t readily see whether a driver is using a phone , they ca n’t enforce the law vigorously .
The problem is making laws banning cellphone use effective .
In New York , which enacted the first ban on handheld cellphones in 2001 , drivers ’ use of such phones went down by about 50 percent shortly after the law took effect .
But this decline had dissipated substantially when measured a year later .
The result was different after a similar law was enacted in Washington , D.C. , where use also declined by about 50 percent and the decline was sustained a year later .
More intensive enforcement in Washington could be a reason for the difference .
Evidence is mounting that conversations on both hands - free and handheld phones lead to similar declines in measures of driving performance .
There may be advantages of hands - free devices in placing the call , but the cognitive distraction of the conversation remains with a hands - free device .
Read more …
Based on this evidence , it makes the most sense to ban the use of any type of phone .
But it ’s difficult to enforce a hands - free ban , because officers can’t readily see whether a driver is using a phone .
And without strong enforcement , behavior wo n’t change .
The record high rate of safety belt use in the U.S. , for example , is the result of states enacting belt laws and vigorously publicizing and enforcing them through the Click it or Ticket program .
Drivers using phones have to believe there is a high likelihood that they will be stopped and ticketed .
Absent tough , sustained , and highly visible enforcement , laws are unlikely to have much effect in convincing motorists to put down their phones .
How the Brain Reacts
Marcel Just is the D.O. Hebb Professor of Psychology and director of the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging at Carnegie Mellon University .
Tim Keller is a senior research psychologist at the center .
They are co-authors of the study , “ A Decrease in Brain Activation Associated With Driving When Listening to Someone Speak . ”
Behavioral studies have shown that talking on a cellphone diverts the driver ’s attention and disrupts driving performance .
We investigated that question by looking at brain activity that occurs during driving .
In our study , using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , we examined the effect of listening to someone speak on the brain activity associated with simulated driving .
Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging , Carnegie Mellon University
Participants steered a vehicle along a curving virtual road , either undisturbed or while listening to spoken sentences that they judged as true or false .
The parietal lobe activation associated with spatial processing in driving decreased by 37 percent when participants concurrently listened to the sentences .
We found that listening comprehension tasks drew mental resources away from driving and produced a deterioration in driving performance , even though the drivers were n’t holding or dialing a phone .
These brain activation findings show the biological basis for the deterioration in driving performance ( in terms of errors and staying in a lane ) that occurs when one is also processing language .
They suggest that under mentally demanding circumstances , it may be dangerous to combine processing of spoken language with a task like driving a car in demanding circumstances .
Our listening experiment did not require the participants to speak , so it was probably less disruptive to driving than an actual two - way conversation might be .
It ’s likely that our study actually underestimates the reduction in driving performance .
Read more …
If listening to sentences degrades driving performance , then probably a number of other common driver activities — including tuning or listening to a radio , eating and drinking , monitoring children or pets , or even conversing with a passenger — would also cause reduced driving performance .
It would be incorrect , however , to conclude that using a cellphone while driving is no worse than engaging in one of these other activities .
First , it ’s not known how much these other distractions affect driving ( though that would be an interesting study ) .
Second , talking on a cellphone is a particular social interaction , with demands different from a conversation with a passenger .
Not responding in a cellphone conversation , for instance , can be interpreted as rude behavior .
By contrast , a passenger in a car is more likely to be aware of the competing demands for a driver ’s attention .
Indeed there is recent experimental evidence suggesting that passengers and drivers suppress conversation in response to driving demands .
Third , with spoken language , a listener cannot willfully stop the processing of a spoken utterance .
These considerations suggest that talking on cellphones while driving can be a risky choice , not just for common sense reasons , but because of the way our brains work .
Cellphone Use as a Moral Issue
Tom Vanderbilt is the author of “ Traffic : Why We Drive the Way We Do ( and What It Says About Us ) . ”
He writes the “ Transport ” column for Slate and blogs at How We Drive .
Human attention is imperfect and prone to gaps under the best of circumstances .
In a well - practiced task like driving , it is virtually impossible to assume , much less legislate , that an individual will always devote sufficient attention .
That said , the science is growing increasingly conclusive that a cellphone conversation — whether hand - held or hands - free — exacts a toll on things like reaction time and hazard detection ; that these conversations quantitatively differ in their effects from other forms of in - car distraction ( including talking to a passenger ) ; and , perhaps most important , we are not fully able to gauge exactly how distracted we are .
Since driving is the only thing most of us do that can cause the loss of someone else ’s life , is n’t it wrong to compromise our driving ability ?
And texting while driving , which emerged so quickly as an activity that the science is still catching up , is even more insidious , compromising not only one ’s mental workload , but requiring many more glances away from the road .
In an ideal world , we would n’t need a law banning such activities — rather , they would be simply common - sense measures taken by the operators of heavy industrial machinery ( which , despite the marketing messages that car companies put out , is what driving is ) .
As the late visionary Dutch traffic engineer Hans Monderman put it to me a few years back , “ There are so many things that can be forbidden .
The stranger thing is that we believe everything that is n’t forbidden is allowed . ”
The threat level was last at critical after an attack on Glasgow Airport The UK terror threat level has been lowered from " severe " to " substantial " , the Home Office has said .
The level was raised in 2007 , meaning a terrorist attack was " highly likely " .
The downgrading means there is a " strong possibility " of an attack .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said there remained a " real and serious threat " from terrorists and the public would see little change in security measures .
The level is set by the UK's Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre ( JTAC ) .
The JTAC , which is a unit within the security service MI5 , sets the level based on the intelligence available about terrorist intentions and capabilities .
According to BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw , security sources said the decision to change the threat level was a " finely - balanced judgement " .
The sources said the level was " under constant review " and could go up again if it was felt appropriate , our correspondent added .
The JTAC states that the current threat to the UK " comes principally from al - Qaeda and related networks " , but " Northern Ireland - related terrorism [ is ] also still a threat " .
' Remain vigilant '
At " substantial " , the threat from terrorism is at its lowest since levels were first made public three years ago .
Under the previous , slightly different system , the level was lowered to the equivalent of " substantial " in May 2005 - two months before the 7 July London bombings .
We still face a real and serious threat from terrorists
Home Secretary Alan Johnson
In a statement , the home secretary said : " JTAC make their judgements based on a broad range of factors , including the intent and capabilities of international terrorist groups in the UK .
" We still face a real and serious threat from terrorists and the public will notice little difference in the security measures that are in place , and I urge the public to remain vigilant .
" The police and security services are continuing in their thorough efforts to discover , track and disrupt terrorist activity . "
THREAT LEVEL SYSTEM
Low - attack is unlikely Moderate - attack is possible , but not likely Substantial - attack is a strong possibility Severe - attack is highly likely Critical - attack is expected imminently
There are five levels of terror threat , ranging from low - meaning an attack is unlikely - to critical - when an attack is expected imminently .
Substantial is the third level on the scale .
The threat was last at critical in June 2007 , after an attack on Glasgow Airport and the failed car bombings in central London .
Terror expert David Capitanchik told the BBC that part of the reason for the downgrading may be to show that the war in Afghanistan is , as ministers say , reducing the threat to Britain from al - Qaeda .
" I think the government , and possibly the security services , want to show ... that somehow , despite the loss of soldiers , it 's being successful - it is actually reducing the threat , " he said .
" The other point is that we have a lot more people now working in MI5 .
" They are better trained than they were in the past and therefore they are better able to maintain surveillance of any extremists there are in this country . "

JERUSALEM  Palestinian Authority forces clashed with Hamas militants in the West Bank early on Sunday , leaving six dead in the bloodiest such encounter in two years .
The violence erupted days after the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , assured President Obama in Washington that his troops were imposing order on the area .
In Gaza , Hamas reacted by arresting Fatah activists and hinting of further revenge .
The clashes and threats show that Fatah , which dominates in the West Bank , and Hamas , which runs Gaza , remain in a tense standoff , and that the Palestinian unity needed for creation of a state is far off .
Both sides said unity talks mediated by Egypt were imperiled .
A spokesman for Mr. Abbas ’s West Bank forces , Adnan Dameiri , told a news conference in Ramallah that a patrol in the city of Qalqilya had come under fire on Saturday night from a house , leading to a curfew and negotiations lasting for hours .
During the negotiations , a grenade was thrown from the house , killing three security officers , Mr. Dameiri said .
Palestinian Authority forces then stormed the house , and two Hamas militiamen , including one of its leaders , were killed , along with the owner of the house that the militants had commandeered .
Like him or not , Sacha Baron Cohen knows how to create a critical mass of media attention .

Inquiring minds are asking " What is the Real CPI ? "
It 's a good question , too .
However , you can find many widely differing opinions .
For example , you will get one answer from the government , a different answer from sites like Shadowstats , and a third opinion from me .
First let 's look at John Williams ' Shadowstats .
That 's an interesting chart , especially given the hyperinflationary bent of John Williams .
He pegs the CPI at 2 % as of May 2009 and had it at 9 % mid-2008 and right around 5 % in 2007 .
In contrast , the official CPI was 5.5 % in mid-2008 and 2+ % in 2007 .
The problem will all of those numbers is they fail to properly take housing into consideration .
And housing has been falling like a rock .
Should housing be in the CPI ?
How ?
Bear in mind the government considers housing a capital good not a consumption item .
Based on the idea that one would be renting a house if one did not own it , the government uses Owners Equivalent Rent ( OER ) and not housing prices in the CPI .
OER is the largest component in the CPI .
By the same measure one might argue that lawn mowers and automobiles are capital goods .
Lawn mowers are durable , not immediately consumed , and if one owns buildings and uses lawn mowers to maintain their properties ( or if one hired someone to cut their lawns for them ) , the mowers would indeed be depreciated over time as a capital expense .
The same logic also applies to auto leases .
Let 's explore this from a practical standpoint starting with theory .
Consumer Price Theory and Practice
Here are a few excerpts of note from the Consumer Price Index Manual , Theory and Practice By Ralph Turvey .
Page 47 : The treatment of owner occupied housing is difficult and somewhat controversial .
There may be no consensus on what is the best practice .
The distinctive feature is that it requires the use of an extremely large fixed asset in the form of the dwelling itself .
Page 147 : The treatment of owner - occupied housing is arguably the most difficult issue faced by CPI - compilers .
Equally important it may be difficult to identify a single principal purpose for the CPI .
In particular , the dual use of CPIs as both macroeconomic indicators and also for indexation purposes can lead to clear tensions in designing an appropriate treatment for owner - occupied housing costs .
Case Shiller CPI vs. CPI -U
CS -CPI
Year over year has now fallen for 8 consecutive months and 11 of the past 15 .
High Year over year comparison data points for the next several months will likely result in CPI deflation coming in at - 7 % to - 8 % in the coming months .
Case Shiller CPI vs. Shadowstats
A Practical Matter
By ignoring housing prices , CPI massively
understated
inflation for years and the CPI is massively
overstating
inflation now .
Thus , as both theoretical and practical matters , Greenspan and Bernanke blew it by failing to take housing prices into consideration .
WASHINGTON 
The problem with global warming , some environmentalists believe , is “ global warming . ”
The term turns people off , fostering images of shaggy - haired liberals , economic sacrifice and complex scientific disputes , according to extensive polling and focus group sessions conducted by ecoAmerica , a nonprofit environmental marketing and messaging firm in Washington .
Instead of grim warnings about global warming , the firm advises , talk about “ our deteriorating atmosphere . ”
Drop discussions of carbon dioxide and bring up “ moving away from the dirty fuels of the past . ”
Do n’t confuse people with cap and trade ; use terms like “ cap and cash back ” or “ pollution reduction refund . ”
EcoAmerica has been conducting research for the last several years to find new ways to frame environmental issues and so build public support for climate change legislation and other initiatives .
A summary of the group ’s latest findings and recommendations was accidentally sent by e-mail to a number of news organizations by someone who sat in this week on a briefing intended for government officials and environmental leaders .
Asked about the summary , ecoAmerica ’s president and founder , Robert M. Perkowitz , requested that it not be reported until the formal release of the firm ’s full paper later this month , but acknowledged that its wide distribution now made compliance with his request unlikely .
If you think the U.S. military is n't serious about this soft power , hearts - and - minds stuff , it 's worth considering a recent report by an Army Human Terrain System research team on saffron .
That 's right : The U.S. Army commissioned a detailed , heavily footnoted 22 - page report on saffron as a potential cash crop for Afghan farmers – and as a potential alternative to growing opium poppy .
In a nice touch , the report even includes a recipe for sabzi pilau : a Persian rice dish with saffron , spinach and meat .
Delicious !
Devising alternative livelihoods for Afghan farmers involved in the poppy trade is a serious business , and thus far no one has been able to come up with a viable and sustainable alternative .
For Afghanistan 's impoverished farmers , opium is almost ideal : it is a high - value , low weight crop that requires minimal water ; the paste collected during the harvest is easy to store and transport ; and the buyers come to directly to you .
Problem is , the illicit opium trade is an important source of financing for the Taliban and other insurgents .
But U.S. - funded schemes to wean Afghan farmers off opium have , to borrow a phrase from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , been a heartbreaking failure .
And as the HTS report notes , saffron is not likely to replace poppy as an alternative crop in terms of profitability .
" While saffron is significantly more profitable than crops such as wheat , onions , and chick peas , it is still less profitable than poppy , " the report states .
" According to the figures , poppy is estimated to be more than 50 % more profitable than saffron . "
It 's interesting , nonetheless , to see the military studying aid and development models so closely .
Non-governmental organizations such as the Danish Committee for Aid to Afghan Refugees have promoted saffron as an alternative crop .
The HTS report notes that an Afghan National Army officer recommended that coalition Provincial Reconstruction Teams provide farmers with saffron seeds .
The report also comes as the Army apparently expands the HTS program , despite grumbling from Human Terrain workers in the field .
A recent Army news article from Iraq refers to a $ 40 million expansion of the program – a snippet of news , incidentally , that is buried in a photo caption .
It will be interesting to see how the Army manages this : the program recently saw a mass exodus of social scientists , many of whom quit because they were being converted from contractors to government employees .

“ As Far As the Eye Can See ” ; The Human Spirit Marches for Justice
Election protesters in Iran march peacefully ( for the most part ) and brilliantly chant a thank you to the police .
They demand a recount .
The thrill of watching the endless stream of human beings put it all on the line for justice is overwhelmingly inspiring and shaming at the same time .
Oh , where were we in 2000 ?
The human spirit always longs for freedom and justice .
The protest we ’re witnessing right now is a result of pure , raw humanity at its best .
It ’s universal .
It ’s something we all share .
Pondering the immense power of the human spirit gives rise to great hope .
Dare I say , hope for a different world in the future ?
Advertisements
At the risk of sounding like a progressive naïf , the protests going on in Iran right now move me deeply .
As Americans , and indeed citizens of the entire world , reach out to the Iranian people via Twitter , FB , cell , etc , we aid them in their fight for freedom .
What may appear to be simple sharing of information feels more like a paradigm shift of epic proportions to me .
We are communicating with the younger generation of Iranians .
We ’re supporting their desire to get out information , we ’re supporting their right to have every vote counted accurately .
We ’re working together .
How easy it is to see our brother or sister in our Iranian friends , as their impressive passion for justice reminds us of our own feelings in 2000 and 2004 .
I remember well the isolation I felt during 2000 especially .
The internet was not what it is now .
I wonder how differently things would have gone …
Instead of the right ’s “ war on terror ” , we are having a uniting movement for justice .
How much more powerful and undeniable unity is .
An “ enemy ” is converted to a friend though common goals .
What changes will come as the younger generation of Iranians grow up , knowing the world was watching , the world cared ?
I ’m not prone to this kind of optimism , normally , so writing these words feels at once hopelessly naïve , but also full of the deep truth war needs us to forget .
We are one .
I know things will not go smoothly , I ’m all too aware of the problems and dangers facing the world right now , but at this moment … at this particular moment , I ’m overcome with the sheer , undeniable power of hope and unity .
I ’ll take it .
Peace Out .
Edited to add : I am deeply saddened to see the latest headline that a gunman opened up at a rally .
My thoughts are with all of the Iranians ; I wish them safety and justice .
One gunman ca n’t undo what ’s happening on a global level .
Andy Robinson says his players have performed well in Bucharest
Head coach Andy Robinson has urged his Scotland A side to win the IRB Nations Cup when they take on France on Sunday .
The Scots lead the French at the top of the table on points difference after wins over Uruguay and Russia , and are gearing up for their Bucharest clash .
" There are plenty of improvements that need to be made between now and our match against France , " said Robinson .
" The players have worked extremely hard since we arrived in Bucharest ... it 's pleasing we 're top of the table . "
The Scots ' superior points difference of 66 - 46 more than France - sets up a thrilling finale on Sunday .
They followed up a 49 - 7 victory over Russia with a laboured 27 - 3 win over Uruguay .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The French , meanwhile , recorded wins over Italy and Romania .
" Over the first two games , we have highlighted the positives , but also more importantly addressed the mistakes in order to improve every player 's game understanding , " Robinson said .
" France A have a number of quality players and collectively the players know they must raise their level of performance for what will be a really tough challenge . "
The sides meet at Stadionul National Arcul de Triumf on Sunday at 1800 BST .
Wow , look at that title for some keyword stuffing !
Stuffing … get it ?
The Telegraph : bedrock of traditional journalism , pinnacle of UK news reporting – I ’m sorry , I ca n’t finish that sentence , I ’m too busy crying with laughter .
Seriously .
I mean , seriously .
Sure , everyone needs to remain competitive in this ultra - fast world of social media and transient online traffic , but there ’s a lot to be said for keeping your integrity too .
In this master stroke of continued patchy reporting from the UK ’s Telegraph we have a serious ‘ news ’ report about a crop circle , that depicts the Phoenix flying from the ashes .
Or is it a turkey ?
What could this possibly mean ?
Oh yes , I might have guessed .
Obviously it means the world is going to end on December 21st 2012 .
What a coincidence , those Mayan fellas have been saying the same thing all along .
Now we have crop circles ?
And crop circle enthusiasts telling us it ’s the end of the world ?
Holy crapcakes , doomsday really is coming .
I ’ve been such a fool .
The saving grace about this article is that it has n’t been filed under ‘ science ’ , unlike the “ Mars Skull ” hilarity a few weeks ago .
But that ’s the article ’s only saving grace .
I ’d understand if there was a little scepticism in the tone of the report , or perhaps a little light - hearted banter about aliens and their fetish for bending corn , but unfortunately this is an article that jumps to one huge conclusion :
Crop circles = Doomsday
It really is that simple .
Reading signs in bent corn has been the fodder for doomsday theorists for as long as there have been doomsday theories and this report does nothing to challenge that .
Is it really that hard to find a skeptic / scientist / logical thinker in Wiltshire these days ?
I might be missing something here , but where ’s the link between these crop circles and doomsday in 2012 ?
That ’s right , there is n’t one .
And I ’m now certain that crop circle depicts a turkey …

So how can libraries survive in the face of the kind of drop in cash support that we ’re seeing today ?
Well , for starters , let ’s look at some of the other libraries in the state for examples of what could be done .
Most of the steps that are being taken to counteract the funding crisis right here , right now involve quick and easy solutions to cut costs as opposed to the formulation of strategies that focus on raising money .
Chief among these is the layoff of staff , reduction of services , and lastly , the closing of physical locations , whether they be branches of , or main libraries themselves .
Some libraries have even gotten involved in some pretty heavy borrowing , with city funds going to construction and maintenance of libraries instead of equally critical areas such as the funding and maintenance of roads and public works .
Obviously , working into the negative is not a sustainable option– there are only so many workers you can lay off , only so many services you can cut , and only so many physical locations you can close , with those who borrowed left out in the cold , owing cash they can’t possibly afford to pay back .
This is not an option– it ’s just prolonging the inevitable .
The two best options at this point are simple ones– finding a way to raise money or changing the way we do things altogether .
How does this work ?
How does it apply to the future ?
Well , let ’s focus on the two , almost incongruent and irreplaceable aspects of the modern library – public access to the internet and preserving the knowledge contained in books for public access .
Giving the library an online branch where texts can be stored ( and viewed ) electronically to supplement the physical branch is a start in the right direction , but one we ’ve yet to see wholly implemented as yet due to copyright issues and other corporate scares .
Consider also the library ’s possible role as museum or reliquary , a place where books are kept in physical form for historical value .
Lastly , consider the need for public access terminals– if funding could be secured for all three of these separately , whether from a government or private source , it could give libraries the edge they need to persist , a veritable triumvirate of functioning sectors or public agencies / entities that would operate separately and yet as a whole , breathing new life into a system that could suddenly become not only more efficient , but also more sustainable than it has ever been before .
Now , you ’re probably asking yourself : “ would any of these ideas , present or future , work in my community for a library short on funding ? ”
It depends– how ready are we for change ?
Can the staff of any given library handle an upgrade of the caliber of which I ’m talking , or will they have to rely on fundraising ( at best ) and cuts ( at worst ) to save or generate money ?
It all takes money , and if we ’re already in a financial crisis , making massive changes that cost money is n’t likely to be on the books .
I think instead of asking ourselves “ what strategies are available to save libraries and do these strategies work in this case , ” we need to be asking ourselves what we can do , as people and concerned citizens , to save our libraries from disappearing under the waves of financial hardship– forever .
Grownup Erector Set
Think of it as a giant Erector Set.
Grid Beam is a great way to make working prototypes of furniture , experimental vehicles and even small buildings .
If your idea does n’t work , you can change it until it does .
If you do n’t need it anymore , Grid Beams are easily demountable and ready to use for the next project .
I find the ability to try ideas quickly in analog form to be a huge advantage .
With nothing simulated , you know for sure it works , not merely that it should work .
A drawing can lie to your client or worse , to you .
Grid Beams never lie .
The book illustrates a remarkable array of projects , all real , and many actually at work .
Inspiring !

Japanese regulators ordered Citigroup on Friday to suspend advertising and other promotional activities in its retail banking division in Japan for a month for compliance violations and for failing to monitor suspicious transactions .
The regulator , the Financial Services Authority , said Citigroup ’s Japanese unit , Citibank Japan Ltd. , had failed “ to make notification of suspicious transactions , including money laundering . ”
It cited fundamental problems with the bank ’s compliance and governance system .
“ C.J.L. has not accurately identified a series of problems that were recently found , ” the agency added , “ and the effectiveness of the internal audit has not been ensured . ”
The suspension , which is to begin July 15 , means that the bank will be prohibited from advertising , soliciting customers or using publicity in relation to its retail banking products .

The thief3
The princess looked at her face
That became red and filled with fear
The princess said : " why did you this worst thing ?
Why did you convert their fathers to be nothing ?
They can't move or talk or even think
You made them fill of losing hope sink
You deserve to die or even get hurt "
The witch woman collected her intelligent
And said with yellow smile that was gained
" What do you say my sweetly girl ?
My daughter that I will love at all "
The king smile at her and said "
" Dear , you have kindly heart "
He looked at his daughter and said "
Do n't accuse any person without evident
Go to your room and do n't go out "
The princess ' face got red and
Her tears were descended
She run with that boy to her suite
The king ordered her to stop
He ordered the boy to be dismissed
She cried very , very loud
She stayed at her room without getting out
Till her father entered at once
He saw the pale of her face
Her body became thin
He astonished and said
" what did make my groom sick ? "
Smile , smile to see my gift
Come to my suit to see my gift "
She thought that the witch was dismissed
And his famous justice was returned
She entered his suite in speed
With great smile that decorated
Her face to make her more smart
She called with a smile "
" What is the " her speech was interrupted
As she saw a strong guy and the witch stood
The king said " this is your groom ! "
Is that good gift at your mind ! "
She said with sad :
" Who is that ? "
The king said "
He is the nephew of my love "
We ’ve been covering the ongoing meltdown at MySpace from a variety of angles , including last week ’s US job cuts and today ’s big international layoffs .
Another ongoing question has been the fate of Tom , co-founder of the social network and default friend to everyone who signs up .
While we recently learned that Tom was staying at MySpace , we did n’t know in what capacity , until now .
According to The Business Insider , Tom is getting a $ 500,000 year contract to take an “ ambassador ’s role ” and “ stop coming to the office . ”
In other words , half a million dollars a year to not do much of anything other than remain the official face of the site .
Granted , that ’s a big pay cut .
Tom and ousted CEO Chris DeWolfe were getting a reported $ 7.5 million per year from the deal they signed after the social network was sold to News Corp .
But considering it looks like Tom ’s role is now to keep his profile up and running , post an occasional bulletin , and leave his wall open for confused member comments ( he still gets hundreds a day ) , it ’s hardly a bad deal .
The biggest question now is what ’s next for Tom and Chris after starting what became the world ’s top social network , only to see it lose its edge under News Corp .
Nanoparticles specially engineered by University of Central Florida Assistant Professor J. Manuel Perez and his colleagues could someday target and destroy tumors , sparing patients from toxic , whole - body chemotherapies .
Perez and his team used a drug called Taxol for their cell culture studies , recently published in the journal Small , because it is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs .
Taxol normally causes many negative side effects because it travels throughout the body and damages healthy tissue as well as cancer cells .
The Taxol - carrying nanoparticles engineered in Perez 's laboratory are modified so they carry the drug only to the cancer cells , allowing targeted cancer treatment without harming healthy cells .
This is achieved by attaching a vitamin ( folic acid ) derivative that cancer cells like to consume in high amounts .
Because the nanoparticles also carry a fluorescent dye and an iron oxide magnetic core , their locations within the cells and the body can be seen by optical imaging and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .
That allows a physician to see how the tumor is responding to the treatment .
The nanoparticles also can be engineered without the drug and used as imaging ( contrast ) agents for cancer .
If there is no cancer , the biodegradable nanoparticles will not bind to the tissue and will be eliminated by the liver .
The iron oxide core will be utilized as regular iron in the body .
" What 's unique about our work is that the nanoparticle has a dual role , as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent in a biodegradable and biocompatible vehicle , " Perez said .

Perez has spent the past five years looking at ways nanotechnology can be used to help diagnose , image and treat cancer and infectious diseases .
It 's part of the quickly evolving world of nanomedicine .
The process works like this .
Cancer cells in the tumor connect with the engineered nanoparticles via cell receptors that can be regarded as " doors " or " docking stations . "
The nanoparticles enter the cell and release their cargo of iron oxide , fluorescent dye and drugs , allowing dual imaging and treatment .
" Although the results from the cell cultures are preliminary , they are very encouraging , " Perez said .
A new chemistry called " click chemistry " was utilized to attach the targeting molecule ( folic acid ) to the nanoparticles .
This chemistry allows for the easy and specific attachment of molecules to nanoparticles without unwanted side products .
It also allows for the easy attachment of other molecules to nanoparticles to specifically seek out particular tumors and other malignancies .
Perez 's study builds on his prior research published in the journal Angewandte Chemie Int.
Ed .
His work has been partially funded by a National Institutes of Health grant and a Nanoscience Technology Center start - up fund .
" Our work is an important beginning , because it demonstrates an avenue for using nanotechnology not only to diagnose but also to treat cancer , potentially at an early stage , " Perez said .
Perez , a Puerto Rico native , joined UCF in 2005 .
He works at UCF 's NanoScience Technology Center and Chemistry Department and in the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences in the College of Medicine .
He has a Ph.D. from Boston University in Biochemistry and completed postdoctoral training at Massachusetts General Hospital , Harvard Medical School 's teaching and research hospital .
A scientist at Ohio University has developed a catalyst capable of extracting hydrogen from urine .
That 's right .
Urine .
Now you can fill one tank while draining another .
Gerardine Botte claims the device uses significantly less energy than is needed to extract hydrogen from water and says it could power hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the near future .
Her electrolyzer uses a nickel - based electrode to extract hydrogen from urea ( NH2 ) 2CO , the main component in urine .
Hydrogen is less tightly bound to the nitrogen in urea than to the oxygen in water , so the electrolyzer needs just 0.37 volts across the cell to oxidize the urea , according to Botte .
That 's less than half the amount of energy in an AA battery and considerably less than the 1.23 volts needed to split water .
One of hydrogen 's biggest stumbling blocks to use as an alternative fuel is the amount of energy needed to produce it .
And then there 's the matter of distributing it .
Botte says her gadget eliminates such problems because it 's small enough to integrate into an automobile .
Urine is also readily available – your body produces two to three liters of it each day , and it is the most abundant form of waste on the planet .
We could treat waste water while fueling our cars .
" Urea is the same stuff we use to fertilize our flower beds .
It 's a solid that dissolves in water and is therefore easy to move , " Botte told Wired.com .
" An electrolyzer built into a car would eliminate the need for a hydrogen storage tank , and with the right partnership , I believe we could have pee-powered cars capable of 60 miles per gallon on the road within a year . "
Botte 's current electrolyzer prototype is about the size of a pair of CD jewel cases and can produce up to 500 milliwatts of power .
That 's pretty small , but Ohio University has patented the technology and Botte says it could be scaled up to power hybrid and electric vehicles or anything else running on electricity .
" We are currently working on the chemistry of the electrolyzer , " she said .
" The next step is the engineering , which should flow just fine .
It would involve increasing the size of the electrolyzer , making it more efficient and testing its long - term stability . "
She says the cost of developing the technology for conventional cars would all depend on what 's powering the car .
The electrolyzer would have to pull energy from a power source like a battery in order to produce hydrogen for a fuel cell .
Botte also is examining how the electrolyzer could draw the power it needs from a solar panel .
Hooking it up to a rooftop solar panel – like the one on the 2010 Toyota Prius – could increase efficiency as much as 40 percent , she said .
Botte has n't gotten much in the way of federal funding for the project , though she is working with the Department of Defense to develop electrolyzer technology for military use .
" Years ago , the army pushed to develop hydrogen technology in order to eliminate the use of noisy generators when out in the field or in order to deal with what 's called the ' silent camp problem , ' " Botte said .
" The problem they were running into out in the desert was access to large amounts of clean water .
The electrolyzer , however , eliminates the need for clean water other than drinking water and to transport fuel to remote areas . "

hmm yes , makes sense however it would be nice if there were an " advanced " option allowing us to override that , because now we have to choose between supporting the site or unblocking the whole netand there 's quite a lot of highly popular sites using toolbars ( reddit , digg , retweet , etc. ) .
anyways in my particular case I just managed to create a set of filters that allow me to see the ads on the main site and subreddits and block them for the toolbar ( i.e. external content ) here : this because recently the toolbar was moved to its own url , two weeks ago this could n't be done .
thanks guys !
How much do national parks boost local economies ?
A lot .
One exhaustive study ( 46 page pdf ) found that national parks generate four dollars for every one dollar spent by the federal government .
Obviously , parks provide jobs , not only in the park but in the adjacent T - shirt shops , motels , fast food joints , and fudge shops that sprout like weeds near most parks .
Recently , a Utah study attributes 2500 jobs and $ 107 million to Arches National Park .
( Photo credit NPS . )
Ken Salazar and the owners of the West Yellowstone Ye Olde Grizzly Bear & Tourist Trap are both hoping that you 'll drive to Yellowstone this weekend , save $ 20 , and spend it on a T - shirt that says " I spent $ 100 on gas to drive to Yellowstone and all I got was a bunch more carbon on my footprint . "
However , there 's a less obvious component of national park economics that indirectly leads to better jobs than those selling T - shirts .
National parks create infrastructure that people consider desireable in locating businesses and families , e.g. , good roads , upgraded airports , sewer lines and cel phone coverage .
In the long run , national parks create reasons for people to want to live near national parks .
A Bozeman , Montana economist has noted three Wests : urban , rural - and - declining [ or " bad " ] , and rural - but - connected [ or " good " ] .
It 's no coincidence that national parks are near many rural - but - connected regions .
A list of desireable rural Western areas correlates with a list of national parks : Jackson Hole ( Grand Teton / Yellowstone ) , Moab ( Arches ) , St. George ( Zion ) , Flagstaff ( Grand Canyon ) .
The economic benefit of the parks goes well beyond one weekend and a T - shirt .
If you can afford $ 20 admission and T - shirts for the whole family , consider buying an America the Beautiful pass for $ 80 instead of the T - shirts , which gives admission to all national parks , monuments , forests , and BLM lands for one year .
Here 's two examples showing how the pass pays for itself on one summer road trip :
Road trip from Los Angeles to Rogue River , OR :
-- stop at Yosemite National Park , 20 bucks free !
-- stop at Lassen Volcanic Park , 10 bones free !
-- stop at Oregon Caves Nat'l Monument , take cave tours 34 clams for four people free !
-- stop at Crater Lake National Park , 10 bills free !
-- on the way back , visit Redwoods National Park , free free !
( Redwoods is always free )
-- visit Yosemite next winter , 20 shekels free !
Road trip through Northern Arizona and Southern Utah :
-- stop at Grand Canyon , 25 greenbacks free !
-- stop at Zion , 25 George Washingtons free !
( photo credit NPS )
-- stop at Bryce , 25 ducats free !
-- stop at Pipe Spring National Monument , in a blatant effort to match your diarist in national park nerdiness , 5 duckies free !
If you 're still planning your vacation , RandySF 's I Miss Those Great American Vacations might bring back nostalgia for road trips ... or , if your brother was as car - sick and bratty as mine , not !
And if you 're on the East Coast , most of the national parks in the Washington area have always been free , even if there 's Disrepair on Washington Mall , as DJ ProFusion has correctly noted .
Of course , once you get to your selected national park this weekend , reduce your carbon footprint : get out of your car and on to the trails .
Take a hike !
Your body and your mind will thank you .
The vast open spaces , bison , waterfalls , redwoods , canyons , wildflowers , dark skies , and sheer jaw - dropping awesomeness of our national parks are dulled and filtered by automobile windshields .
And -- way cool special DailyKos event ! -- after you return from a national park this weekend , if you 're a fitness buff , if you care about what goes in your body , or if you 're otherwise interested , please stop by next Fitness Monday at 8 AM PDT , for a very special livechat with author Dr. David Kessler , who will be discussing The End of Overeating .
In the meantime , hike on !
Enormous blobs of thick , black , gooey biological material have been spotted drifting in the waters off Alaska 's northern coast , and nobody is quite sure what they are .
Alaskan hunters first noticed the ooze early last week drifting miles offshore in the frigid arctic waters of the Chuckchi Sea , according to Anchorage Daily News .
Local officials and the US Coast Guard flew in to investigate , and residents say they can't remember seeing anything like it before .

The mystery goo is blackish - brown , has hairy strands in it , and gives off an unusual odor , ADN reports .
Officials from Alaska 's North Slope Borough say they took a helicopter team to examine the goop from the air and saw a strand stretching nearly 15 miles long .
" It 's certainly biological , " US Coast Guard representative Terry Hasenauer told the paper .
" It 's definitely not an oil product of any kind .
It has no characteristic of an oil , or a hazardous substance , for that matter .
" It 's definitely , by the smell and the makeup of it , it 's some sort of naturally occurring organic or otherwise marine organism . "
The Coast Guard 's samples are being analyzed in Anchorage and results should be back next week , Hasenauer said .
In the meantime , they 're sticking to the story that it 's probably some sort of algae and disappointingly not a creature from outer space bent on eating a small town in Pennsylvania .
" It 's textbook for us to consider algae because of all the false reports of oil spills we 've had in the past .
It 's one of the things that typically comes up when a report turns out not to be an oil spill after all , " Hasenauer told ADN - but added , " there 's all types of natural phenomena that it could be . "
In the meantime , the substance appears to be staying away from shore for the most part and keeping its body count at a minimum .
Gordon Brower with the North Slope Borough 's Planning and Community Services Department told the paper he saw some jellyfish tangled up in the goo and someone else retrieved bones and feathers from a dead goose .
" If it was something we 'd seen before , we'd be able to say something about it , " Brower said to the paper .
" But we have n't ... which prompted concerns from the local hunters and whaling captains . " ®
The Pakistani military came to the aid of citizen militia groups fighting the Taliban in the northwest on Tuesday by providing supporting fire and helicopter gunships .
Citizens near the Swat Valley formed a militia group — also known as a lashkar — on Saturday in order to strike back at the Taliban , who bombed a mosque in the neighbouring Upper Dir district on Friday .
The militia group , outraged over the attack that killed at least 33 worshippers , began fighting the Taliban two days ago .
Their numbers have grown from 500 when initially formed to over 2,000 , as men from two villages and a town joined the group Tuesday , according to a local police official .
" People back in the villages , especially children , are fetching them food and other supplies .
They are doing it because they think the fighters are fighting for their sake , they think it is their common war , " police official Atlas Khan said .
At least 14 insurgents have died since fighting began on Saturday .
Militias encouraged
The government has encouraged citizens to set up militias to oust Taliban fighters , especially in the regions that border Afghanistan where al - Qaeda and the Taliban have hideouts .
But villagers ' willingness to do so has often hinged on confidence that authorities will back them up if necessary .
The army has been reluctant to support militias with heavy fire for fear of hitting the citizen fighters , who were engaged in close combat with Taliban forces .
Khan confirmed media reports that helicopter gunships struck two villages , Shatkas and Ghazi Gay , where the militants have strongholds , late Monday and Tuesday morning .
" Lashkar men are positioned on surrounding mountains and keeping a vigil on the movement of Taliban militants , " one military official who requested anonymity told the Agence France - Presse news agency .
Some of the Taliban were blocked Tuesday when they tried to get away to nearby Malik Bai village , which the tribesmen also encircled , police said .
" Villagers have encircled them completely , and they cannot run away , " said Upper Dir district police Chief Ejaz Ahmad .
Asked how long the fight might go on , the police chief said , " The militants are well - entrenched in their strongholds .
The area is large and consists of tough terrain , which also has thick forests .
I cannot say when , but it will take time to expel or kill all the militants completely . "
Shelling in Bannu
Meanwhile , the military started shelling in the Bannu district , about 220 kilometres south of Dir .
The military pummelled the tribal - controlled area of Jani Khel in Bannu after tribesmen refused to hand over Taliban militants taking refuge there , senior local government official Kamran Zeb Khan said .
Military spokesman Maj. - Gen. Athar Abbas did not confirm the shelling , but said an operation was planned in the area against Taliban blamed for the recent hijacking of a convoy of military college students .
The students were all freed .
Earlier , the BBC reported that officials had imposed a curfew in Bannu , an area bordering the Taliban stronghold of Waziristan .
Troops are massing at the border between Bannu and Waziristan , which is where several high - profile insurgents — among them al - Qaeda head Osama bin Laden , his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri and Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud — are believed to be hiding .
Possible Waziristan strikes
Local officials say citizens are leaving the area in preparation for what they believe will be a military strike on Waziristan .
No plans for an operation in South Waziristan have been announced , and the military has refused to comment directly .
Connecting the Bannu operation to a possible broader offensive in the Waziristan districts was " speculation , " Abbas said .
U.S. officials have said privately they would like Pakistan to follow up the Swat offensive by launching an operation in the nearby South Waziristan tribal region .
The month - old Swat offensive , the latest round in a valley that has experienced fighting for two years , is seen as a test of Pakistan 's resolve to take on al - Qaeda and Taliban fighters on its soil .
The U.S. hopes the offensive will eliminate a potential sanctuary for militants implicated in attacks on Western forces across the border in Afghanistan .
The military says more than 1,300 militants and 105 soldiers have died so far in the offensive .
The Taliban have threatened to stage suicide attacks in major Pakistani cities in revenge for the Swat operation .
The trailer for Sara Ziff 's documentary about the modelling industry , Picture Me. Observer
A beautiful woman sits in front of a video camera .
Her name is Sena Cech and she is a fashion model .
Her tone is matter - of - fact , as though what she 's about to describe is commonplace in the industry in which she works .
The scene : a casting with a photographer , one of the top names in his profession .
Halfway through the meeting Cech is asked to strip .
She does as instructed and takes off her clothes .
Then the photographer starts undressing as well .
" Baby - can you do something a little sexy , " he tells her .
The photographer 's assistant , who is watching , eggs her on .
What 's supposed to be the casting for a high - end fashion shoot turns into something more like an audition for a top - shelf magazine .
The famous photographer demands to be touched sexually .
" Sena - can you grab his cock and twist it real hard , " his assistant tells her .
" He likes it when you squeeze it real hard and twist it . "
" I did it , " she shrugs , looking into the video camera .
" But later I did n't feel good about it . "
The following day she hears that the job is hers if she wants it .
She turns it down .
" I did n't like the way the casting had gone .
If the casting was that sexual I was sure the job would be really sexual and gross . "
The photographer never offered her work again .

This is the ugly , sleazy side of the modelling industry , the side few insiders like to talk about .
It 's one of the most secretive businesses in the world , which is ironic when you consider that it is also one of the most pervasive .
Its stars are some of the most recognised icons of our time , household names whose bodies are frequently emblazoned across 40 ft - high billboards , yet apart from the occasional flurry of publicity about anorexia or drug - taking , outsiders know surprisingly little about the multimillion - pound business which profits from some of world 's most beautiful women .
Models rarely give interviews , and if they do they 're as studiedly anodyne and vague as Premiership footballers quizzed outside the changing room after a match .
Sena
Cech is one of a handful of models who has decided to talk publicly about the seedy , unglamorous and , on occasion , abusive side to her profession for a new documentary , Picture Me .
The woman behind the film is Sara Ziff , a catwalk model turned documentary maker .
Ziff makes an unusual whistleblower .
She 's made hundreds of thousands of dollars from the modelling business .
Her motivation for speaking out has nothing to do with revenge or failure ( when I ask her what it 's like to be rejected for a job because of the way you look , it 's clear this has not happened to her very often ) .
She 's been the face of brands like Calvin Klein , Tommy Hilfiger , Stella McCartney , Dolce & Gabbana and Gap .
Her long limbs and angular cheekbones , almond - shaped blue eyes and blonde hair have adorned hoardings in Times Square and beyond .
She 's strutted down the catwalk , eyes blank , unsmiling , for all the top designers from Marc Jacobs to Louis Vuitton , Gucci to Chanel .
Picture
Me began as a quirky homespun video diary .
Ziff 's former boyfriend and co-director Ole Schell would often accompany her on jobs , and because he was a film - school graduate it seemed natural to take along the camera equipment in order to make sense of the surreal , insular world in which they found themselves .
The earlier parts of the film reflect the lighter side of the industry such as the camaraderie among the models and the buzz of a catwalk show .
Schell would also document their private moments : arguments about money because Ziff was earning Monopoly amounts and he could not compete ; Ziff in the bath after a long day at a shoot .
The process might simply have highlighted an industry as fake and frothy as a bowl of Angel Delight , but what emerged over the course of five years of filming and hundreds of hours of footage was something darker , more subversive .
They started giving the camera to fellow models , putting them on the other side of the lens and giving them a chance to speak .
Gradually the couple became less like innocent home - movie makers and more like undercover reporters .
They sit in Ziff 's minimalist apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and recall the years of filming .
They broke up during the editing process but they still seem to be good friends .
Ziff is tall , skinny , though she says she weighs more than she ever has done before .
There 's something instantly arresting about the way she looks , even though she 's unmade - up and dressed down , in black leggings , white shirt .
" I was at work , being paid to do a job , be social , effortlessly cheery , " Ziff recalls .
" Meanwhile I was sneaking in Ole so that he could film without other people realising it . "
It did n't always go to plan .
Schell describes being routinely thrown out of shows by notoriously publicity - shy design houses .
At a private Gucci show at the Los Angeles home of the restaurateur Mr Chow , he came to the attention of the armed guards and was escorted to a holding cell in the house , his camera confiscated .
Shooting on a shoestring budget , editing in Schell 's apartment , they end up with one of the best films about the world of modelling and an honest portrayal of an industry built on artifice .
The final film , which premiered in New York and is already picking up awards on the film festival circuit , is at times a rare and unsettling look at what must be one of the few unregulated industries in the western world .
A 16 - year - old model is on a photo shoot in Paris .
She has very little experience of modelling and is unaccompanied by her agency or parents .
She leaves the studio to go to the bathroom and meets the photographer - " a very , very famous photographer , probably one of the world 's top names " , according to Ziff - in the hallway .
He starts fiddling with her clothes .
" But you 're used to this , " says Ziff .
" People touch you all the time .
Your collar , or your breasts .
It 's not strange to be handled like that . "
Then suddenly he puts his hands between her legs and sexually assaults her .
" She has no experience of boys , she has n't even been kissed , " says Ziff .
" She was so shocked she just stood there and did n't say anything .
He just looked at her and walked away and they did the rest of the shoot .
And she never told anyone . "
This interview did n't make the final version of Picture Me .
The model had agreed to be included but the day before the premiere in New York she changed her mind and became frightened about the repercussions .
She begged Ziff and Schell not to use the material .
Ziff was disappointed but she did n't feel comfortable betraying a friend in an industry where women , she believes , are betrayed all the time .
" There is a lot of shame in telling a story like that , but it is really widespread , " says Ziff .
" It does n't happen in front of anyone .
It happens in the dark recesses .
Pretty much every girl I have talked to has a story like it , but no one talks about it .
It 's all under the radar because people are embarrassed and because the people in the industry who are doing these things are much more powerful , and the model is totally disposable .
She could be gone in two years . "
Ziff is not naive .
She has benefited in all kinds of ways from the business in which she 's worked for 13 years .
She has earned the kind of money other twentysomethings can only dream of and travelled all around the world .
She also knows that fashion plays with ideas around fantasy and sex .
It 's an industry that is as much about undressing as dressing up , as much about what 's underneath as what 's on top .
The model 's job is to look into the camera lens and make a woolly , oversize cardigan look sexy .
It was ever thus .
Go back to the black - and - white images of models in the 50s - all New Look nipped - in waistlines and prim below - the - knee hemlines - and there 's still a sexual undercurrent .
The industry has always had a predatory side .
Anyone approached in the street by a middle - aged man and asked if they 'd like to be a model would think twice about giving him their details ( which is the reason model scouts are generally women ) .
There is something inherently intimate about the whole business of fashion photography - the all - seeing lens , the exposed subject , the powerful photographer .
What 's shocking , listening to Ziff , is how prevalent , and how far up the fashion food chain , sexual exploitation goes .
" Vulnerable girls are being put into a potentially predatory environment , " says Ziff .
" What 's in the agency 's interest is not always best for the girl , and if she 's in a compromising situation , she does n't necessarily have anyone to turn to . "
A union , she believes , could provide some protection .
She is part of a small coterie of models who are beginning to speak out about the industry and break the mafia - like silence .
A few have started blogs on which they talk frankly about their lives beyond the next fitting .
Eighteen months ago , two models based in Britain , Victoria Keon - Cohen and Dunja Knezevic , sought advice from Equity and set up their own union .
It campaigns for better working conditions , holiday and sickness pay , protection in case of injury .
What alarms Ziff is that there 's an expectation that models are comfortable using their sexuality .
Often they can feel under pressure to conform , not least because they 're being paid a great deal of money .
On occasion , Ziff says , she has earned as much as $ 150,000 a day .
" I 've done shoots naked , totally naked .
They sell it to you as : ' Here 's this great artist and he wants to take your portrait . '
I had to switch off the voice in my head that said : ' Do you really want to do this ? '
When you 're being paid a lot of money and you want to appear cool you really do n't want to show any resistance to going with it .
" But at the end of the day I used to wonder : what 's the difference between doing a shoot in your underwear for Calvin Klein and being a stripper ?
Obviously you are compromising yourself .
How far am I willing to go ?
How much am I willing to show for a big fat cheque ? "
The industry has become increasingly sexualised , and the lines between what is acceptable and what is n't have become more blurred .
Naked models inside the pages of a magazine or on a billboard are ubiquitous .
Add to this the fact that in their bid to find models that have the " ideal " model shape - flat chests , boyish hips - some agencies are hiring younger and younger girls .
Ziff recalls one model sitting backstage at the shows playing with a colouring book .
" It is an inherently unbalanced and hierarchical relationship when you pair a 15 - year - old girl with a 45 - year - old man who is trying to create a sexualised image .
You are asking for trouble . "
The sexual side of the industry can go beyond the shoots , says Ziff .
" When you are working at a higher level there is no separation between life and work .
You are expected to go to certain parties and schmooze .
There is a pressure to have a drink with someone with an ulterior motive and not offend them because they may book you for a $ 100,000 campaign .
They have the power . "
In the past , she has found herself in compromising situations that she wishes she 'd dealt with differently .
She tells the story of a 16 - year - old model who complained when a 45 - year - old photographer made a pass at her .
" Her agency said she should have slept with him . "
" Imagine being an eastern European model from Latvia , " says Ole , " who can barely speak English and is supporting a family back home .
Imagine how compromised they are . "
Sara Ziff was 14 when she first began modelling .
Her third casting was in the East Village in New York .
" We had to go in one by one .
The photographer said he wanted to see me without my shirt on .
Then he told me that it was still hard to imagine me for the story so could I take my trousers off .
I was standing there in a pair of Mickey Mouse knickers and a sports bra .
I did n't even have breasts yet .
' We might need to see you without your bra , ' he told me .
It was like he was a shark circling me , walking around and around , looking me up and down without saying anything .
I did what he told me to .
I was just eager to be liked and get the job .
I did n't know any better . "
Teenage girls , she says , are being persuaded to pose in a sexual way when they do n't even know what it means yet .
She recalls being a " virginal teenager " and posing innocently when she did n't feel remotely sexy .
" The images came out and they were practically pornographic .
What the photographer saw was not what I felt .
It had nothing to do with that 14 - year - old and what she was feeling and everything to do with what the person behind the camera projected onto her . "
For all her success as a model - she was out - earning her father , a university neurobiologist , by the time she was 20 - Ziff was probably always an outsider in the industry .
Put it this way , she 's the first model I 've met who quotes Joan Didion .
Her parents are academics who never approved of her career and it's possible she thought too much about the wider significance of what she was doing to really enjoy it herself ( she was taking courses in women 's studies while at the same time modelling couture ) .
For once , being beautiful and brainy does n't seem such an enviable combination .
Modelling was n't a profession she sought for herself .
She was scouted in New York near Union Square by a female photographer when she was walking home from school .
" It had happened to me before but I had never followed up on it .
This seemed different .
The photographer was with her husband , pushing a baby in a stroller , and somehow this made her seem potentially less sleazy . "
Within a week she was being offered a magazine shoot in Jamaica and a show for Calvin Klein .
At school she juggled modelling with lessons .
" I 'd earn a few thousand dollars in an afternoon .
I 'd never earned more than a dollar from the tooth fairy , so as you can imagine this was all pretty exciting . "
When she decided to become a professional model instead of going to college her parents were dismayed .
( " For my parents it was not if I 'd go to college , it was which one of five colleges I would go to . " )
Modelling was , Ziff admits , a way to rebel against her academic background .
At the age of 18 she left home ; two years later she 'd earned enough to buy her own loft apartment .
The irony is that the women in Picture Me may be earning large amounts of money - Schell laughingly recalls piles of cash like you see in movie scenes - but they seem to have little power over their lives .
" You become this living doll , " says Ziff .
Every decision is made by someone else .
They remain somehow like the girls they were when they first entered the profession , encouraged not to think about their futures , anxious to remain the same body shape they were when they were teenagers .
There 's a suggestion that some models lose weight because it 's the only aspect of their lives that they have any control over .
Picture
Me shows
Ziff turn from a breezy , confident 18 - year - old intoxicated by the amount of money she is making into someone exhausted , emotionally and physically , before she hits her mid-20s .
" By the end , " she says , " I was a shell . "
Twenty - hour days were routine .
In the film we watch her begging to be allowed a day off and being told that she 's not allowed .
" Sometimes people forget you 're human , " she says .
We see her haggard and tearful , her skin spotty , her hair dragged back and greasy .
By the end of the show season she weighs less than 100lb , not because she 's been starving herself but because there 's literally no time to eat .
Teenage girls will have seen Ziff in glossy magazines and wished they could look like her , but Ziff is filmed leafing through the same images in her local newsagent and saying how dreadful she thinks she looks .
It seems the industry which makes the rest of us feel insecure and imperfect leaves its own stars feeling the same way .
She 's 27 years old now , a full - time student at Columbia University who models when she can fit it in around her studies .
She 's with an agency she likes .
Her portfolio may have paid her student fees but the cool loft apartment has been swapped for a one - bedroom flat , the catwalks for the college library .
She describes her life now as nerdy and monkish .
" Contrary to my wide - eyed , rather opportunistic outlook at 18 , perhaps I learned that there are no short cuts in life , " she tells me in an email after the interview .
" Modelling brought some money and attention - but not the kind of attention you 'd want . "

Sara Ziff is a full - time student at Columbia University , not Cornell University as we previously said .
This has been corrected .
Users of Apple 's MobileMe have already discovered that the £ 59 - per - year service is sometimes slow and unreliable , and they 're now talking about another shortcoming that was intentional .
MobileMe allows users to synchronize email , calendar and contact information among various devices over the internet .
Although the log - in process for MobileMe is encrypted , Apple does not encrypt data that users send from browsers through MobileMe .
The lack of SSL ( Secure Sockets Layer ) or any other form of encryption means that if a MobileMe user is connected to the internet via a WiFi hotspot , someone else connected to the same hotspot could relatively easily see all the data that the MobileMe user sends .
" Seems like a pretty major omission for a service that 's specifically aimed at roaming users , " wrote a person called ShepUK on the Macrumors forum .
He called the lack of SSL encryption a deal breaker for him .
Free web mail offerings from Yahoo and Microsoft also do n't encrypt data that users send , though Google 's free Gmail does offer an SSL encryption option .
However , MobileMe has more features for transferring data over the web than do those services .
Because customers must pay to use MobileMe , some people think it ought to have this basic security feature .
" MobileMe is suppose to be Microsoft Exchange for the rest of us .
But Microsoft Exchange does things in a secure manner , " wrote a commenter using the name James Katt in a blog postM about the SSL issue .
" As it is , if you run a business using your Mac , then you cannot use MobileMe because it transmits data insecurely . "
Still , while security professionals say Apple should offer an SSL option , they do n't suggest that this is a major problem .
" I would n't say that it 's a critical issue or something that 's a reason not to use the service , but it 's definitely something that should be addressed , " said Noam Rathaus , CTO of Beyond Security , a company that offers products for discovering security issues in servers , computers and networks .
He briefly examined the way MobileMe works and said it does appear that transmissions are n't encrypted .
Apple has not replied to a request for comment .
The setup could open the door to potentially serious situations in which an onlooker could learn passwords used by a MobileMe customer if the user requested a lost or forgotten password to be sent via email .
If MobileMe users are concerned about the security of information , they may want to use another mail mechanism to send sensitive messages , said Wolfgang Kandek , chief technical officer for Qualys , a provider of vulnerability - management and policy - compliance products .
VPN ( virtual private network ) connections could protect users , but some enterprises set up VPNs to protect access only to corporate servers and not to Internet sites .
In that case , a VPN would n't protect a user of MobileMe , he said .
People always ask :
What can I do to make a difference ?
So many people in poor countries desperately need assistance .
So many people in rich countries would like to help but fear their donations would line the pocket of a corrupt official or be lost in an aid bureaucracy .
The result is a short circuit , leaving both sides unfulfilled .
That ’s where Scott Harrison comes in .
Five years ago , Mr. Harrison was a nightclub promoter in Manhattan who spent his nights surrounded by friends in a blur of alcohol , cocaine and marijuana .
He lived in a luxurious apartment and drove a BMW  but then on a vacation in South America he underwent a spiritual crisis .
“ I realized I was the most selfish , sycophantic and miserable human being , ” he recalled .
“ I was the worst person I knew . ”
Mr. Harrison , now 33 , found an aid organization that would accept him as a volunteer photographer  if he paid $ 500 a month to cover expenses .
And so he did .
The organization was Mercy Ships , a Christian aid group that performs surgeries in poor countries with volunteer doctors .
In April of this year I wrote about Honda ’s press release announcing that they had made some breakthroughs in the area of mental control of robots .
On close inspection it seemed that Honda had not accomplished anything that other researchers were n’t already doing , so they were essentially announcing that they were in the game .
Well , not another Japanese car manufacturer is in the game also – Toyota .
They announced that they have developed a system that allows a person to control a wheelchair with their thoughts alone .
The system allows a person to make the chair go right , left , or forward with thoughts alone .
Curiously , in order to stop the chair a traditional puffer control is still needed ( where the operator controls the chair by puffing into a tube ) .
This is nothing new – devising a system that can distinguish among three brain states is fairly crude .
Obviously they could not make it distinguish a fourth to command the chair to stop .
But Toyota needs their distinguishing feature – something to put in the press release to make their technology seem like a breakthrough .
So , they tell us , theirs is the fastest system yet .
While other systems take several seconds to process the thought commands , their system accomplishes this task in 125 milliseconds ( thousandths of a second ) .
That is fast enough to give the feel of instantaneous control .
In fact the response time of the brain itself , from thought to action , is about 100 milliseconds .
While this is an incremental advance at best , it does sound like a legitimate advance .
But more interesting is that we now have two large corporations investing in research into mental control of machines .
They add to the research groups at Duke University and in New York who have also made headlines with their research .
The University of Pittsburgh has a suite of labs that are working on the various aspects of robotic mental control .
At the Motorlab their research if focusing on correlating patterns of cortical activation with motor control in three - dimensional space .
At the NTE lab , they are researching the interface between neural tissue and “ smart biomaterials , ” as well as neural tissue engineering .
So they are working on the interface between brain and machine .
At the Rehab Neural EngineeringLab they are working on decoding the sensory feedback given to the brain from limbs during movement .
This research could close the loop – allowing users to feel their prosthetic limb , which would greatly enhance control .
Although not mentioned on their site , there is straight neuroscience research which is discovering the neural activity that correlates with the brain ’s sense of ownership over a body part – the sense that a body part belongs to you .
So it is very plausible that in the future not only would a brain - machine interface allow a user to control a robotic limb , but also to feel it , receive information from the limb regarding its position and the tension on its “ muscles ” , and also feel as if it is part of their body .
This is Six Million Dollar Man territory .
This is all very exciting .
As the Neuro Rehab website says :
There is a rapidly growing brain - computer - interface ( BCI ) community working to develop methods of extracting and processing neural signals for directly controlling devices such as cmputers or prosthetic systems .
Now we also have large corporations like Honda and Toyota in the game – which is a sign that a technology is poised to move out of the lab and into the market .
These companies say they have not plans to market any particular technology , they are just doing technology research .
This is clear from the crude devices they are demonstrating .
But it means that we are beyond the basic university level research into developing technological applications .
We must also remind ourselves that while this technology is steadily progressing , and has already made interesting advances , it is probably years away from the simplest applications and decades away from any mature applications , like fully functional neuro - prosthetic limbs .
That is the one downside to tracking new and exciting technology in its early phase – you have to wait years to decades before the promised applications emerge .
It ’s like seeing an awesome movie preview a decade before the release date .

Advertisement Burma 's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has gone on trial at the notorious Insein prison in Rangoon .
She is charged with breaching the terms of her house arrest , because of a visit by an American man who swam across a lake to her house earlier this month .
Dozens of supporters gathered near the jail as the trial got under way .
It has now been adjourned for the day .
Many observers see the charges as a pretext to ensure Ms Suu Kyi is in jail during next year 's elections .
Ms Suu Kyi has already spent 13 of the past 19 years in jail or detained in her home , and faces a further three to five years ' imprisonment if found guilty of these latest charges .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It is unclear how long the trial will take , but estimates range from a few days to several weeks , as the government is expected to summon 22 witnesses to support its claim .
Two of Ms Suu Kyi's assistants are on trial with her , and Mr Yettaw is also being tried .
Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party won landslide elections rejected by the military in 1990 , and she was awarded the Nobel peace prize soon after .
Wire barricades Security is tight around Insein prison , says a BBC reporter in Rangoon - whose name is being withheld for his safety , because all foreign journalists are barred from Burma .
Dozens of supporters , including prominent members of her National League for Democracy party , gathered near the jail in quiet protest .

But riot police set up barbed wire barricades to prevent them getting too close and plain - clothes officers filmed them .
The ambassadors of Great Britain , France , Germany and Italy were barred from entering the prison , but the US consul was reportedly allowed in , possibly to see Mr Yettaw .
Mr Yettaw was thought to be in the courtroom with Ms Suu Kyi on the first day of the trial , though it is unclear whether he was being tried as part of the case against Ms Suu Kyi .
There are no outside observers , but unnamed Burmese and opposition officials said proceedings had now been adjourned until Tuesday , after several hours of testimony .
A LIFE IN DETENTION 1988 : Military junta comes to power after crushing pro-democracy uprising 1989 : Martial law declared ; opposition NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi put under house arrest 1990 : NLD wins elections ; result rejected by the ruling junta 1995 : Suu Kyi released from house arrest , but movements restricted Sept 2000 :
Put under house arrest again when she tried to defy travel restrictions May 2002 : Released unconditionally May 2003 : Detained after clash between NLD and government forces Sept 2003 : Allowed home after operation , but under effective house arrest .
In the years since , the orders for her detention periodically renewed Mr Yettaw arrived on her back lawn in Rangoon earlier this month , after swimming across a lake using home - made flippers .
He was almost certainly uninvited , and Ms Suu Kyi's lawyers say she will plead not guilty to breaking the terms of her house arrest , saying he was allowed to stay only because he pleaded exhaustion .
Ms Suu Kyi's home is one of the most closely guarded locations in Rangoon , and her supporters believe the military authorities must have allowed the man to reach it , as he tried the same stunt unsuccessfully last November .
According to Burma 's constitution , Ms Suu Kyi was scheduled to be freed on 27 May after six consecutive years of house arrest .
The misguided exploits of an apparently well - intentioned individual have now given the military government a pretext to keep her locked up , say correspondents .
Analysts say the trial shows that the military junta still fears Aung San Suu Kyi's influence over Burmese people , despite the fact she has been in detention for most of the past two decades .
They are keen to keep her detained in the run-up to the elections in 2010 - largely derided as a sham by the international community .

More from BBC World Service Ms Suu Kyi's prosecution is taking place in such haste and secrecy , and on such bizarre charges , that it has already been dismissed as farcical by many governments around the world .
Protests against the trial took place at outside Burmese embassies around the world on Monday .
US President Barack Obama formally extended sanctions against Burma on Friday .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Monday that the European Union should also consider toughening sanctions against the Burmese regime .
But so far there has been no official reaction from Burma 's two large neighbours , China and India , or the South East Asia regional group Asean , which counts Burma as a member .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A woman was trampled to death by cows while walking her dogs in northern England , police said Monday .
Experts say cows can become aggressive if they feel their calves are being threatened .
The 49 - year - old died at the scene , said a press officer for North Yorkshire police , where the incident took place on Sunday just after noon local time ( 7 a.m. ET ) .
" She had two dogs with her , " said the spokeswoman , who declined to be named in line with police policy .
They were not on a leash , she added .
" We believe the cows may have gotten protective of their calves , " she said .
The woman was alone when she was killed in Gayle , near Hawes in Wensleydale , she said .
Police and the National Farmers ' Union both said it was very unusual for people to be killed by cows in Britain .
" There are perhaps a few incidents every year where people are injured by cattle , " said Mike Thomas , a spokesman for the union .
" People being killed by cattle is quite a rare occurrence . "
But he said cows could become aggressive if they felt their calves were being threatened .
" If the dog is getting close to the animal , it 's going to react in some kind of aggressive manner , " he said .
People who feel threatened by cows while walking dogs should let their animals off the leash in order to put distance between themselves and their pets -- because cows are more likely to see dogs than people as a threat -- and move to the edge of the field , he said .
The average cow weighs about 1,760 pounds ( 800 kg ) , he said .
If you ’re dying to play FFXIII , and ca n’t wait any longer , there may be some relief ahead .
Square Enix has revealed that Snow , Vanille and Sazh are now coming to store shelves in pint size form ( i.e. as action figures ) .
Even though FFXIII is still about a year off from a stateside release , the fanfare is at a fever pitch .
Hopefully this can wet your appetite long enough to wait for the release date .
No release date for the action figures has been given at this time .
The new hallucination for most strapped McMansion owners is that they 'll " rent the house for a year and then sell when the market comes back . "
The happy theory here is that , yes , prices are temporarily depressed , but when the green shoots really take hold , we 'll go roaring right back to 2006 levels again .
Most real - estate agents will be eager to tell you that they agree with this theory .
What they wo n't be able to tell you , as Mark Hanson of the Field Check Group points out , is why .
Even after a 30 % fall from the peak , house prices are still too high .
Meanwhile , millions of homeowners are losing their jobs , consumers are still saddled with truckloads of debt , banks are still tightening credit , foreclosures and delinquencies are still soaring , mortgage - mods are a failure , there are still too many houses on the market , wages are declining , taxes are likely to go up , and the economy is likely to struggle for years .
In short , it 's likely that house prices will now crash below fair value and remain below it for years .
So McMansion owners sniffing at current prices and planning to " wait until the market comes back " will likely be waiting a lot longer than they think .
Mark Hanson thinks the next segment of the real - estate market to crack will be the mid- to - high end ( big houses in prime locations ) .
Why ?
Because so far , those who forked over more than $ 1 million for their houses have resisted reality more successfully than the folks in lower - end housing brackets , where rampant foreclosures have driven prices down .
But that , Mark says , is about to change .
More evidence for this view comes from southern California , where Jonathan Lansner has written up the latest sales figures for Orange County .
Note that inventories have shrunk considerably in the low - and mid-tier brackets , which is a good sign ( it means the market in these segments is close to equilibrium ) .
And then note that months - supply for $ 1 + million houses is still a whopping 13 months -- which means no one is paying what McMansion owners are asking .
Big price cuts on McMansions coming soon ...
Jonathan Lansner :
The latest reading on the Orange County housing market from Steve Thomas at Altera Real Estate , with data as of last Thursday …
After rising much of the year … demand , measured as new pending sales in the past month , dropped by 23 in two weeks to 3,629 .
Demand is +623 vs. year ago .
Inventory of homes for sale dropped by 125 homes in two weeks to 9,188 — lowest supply level since February 2006 and down 5,652 in a year .
Expected market time — how long it would take to sell current inventory at the recent sales pace — dropped a smidge in two weeks to 2.53 months vs. 4.94 a year ago .
Market time was last this low in September 2005 .
Thomas says : “ Typically at this time of year demand reaches a plateau and begins to drop a bit in July before increasing one last time for the year in August . ”
And a look at how price matters , in terms of Thomas market time …
For under a half - million , it theoretically will take 1.58 months to sell off all inventory .
Half - mil to $ 1 million ?
2.75 months .
If it ’s a 7 - figure listing , it ’s 13.08 months .

Alright US
Airways , I think we ’re done here .
I tried to be reasonable , but in the end , it ’s probably best if we decide to forever part ways .
Not as friends , mind you , but with a great deal of animosity on my part .
It ’s the kind of hard feelings that would make me pipe up in a crowd of strangers when someone mentions you and say , â€ œ
Oh , US Airways is bullshit , â€  or something equally eloquent .
I really have n’t thought it out yet .
Flight # 1 : Maintenance Issues , and Customer Service Nightmares
On first glance you seemed decent enough .
The plane loaded on time and although you were hardly glamorous , I was willing to give you some strong points for punctuality … kind of like rewarding the homely for having a good sense of humor .
Sadly , those bonus points did n’t last when a “ routine engine check ” turned into an oil leak and would require , according to the pilot , “ at least two hours ” to fix .
It appeared things were getting off to a rocky start .
Alright , we ’ll count this as strike one .
These things happen .
Sometimes maintenance issues pop up and it ’s probably better to be safe than sorry .
I ’m willing to concede I ’d be even more pissed off if you ’d let me fall from the sky to a bloody death , so I suppose we ’ll call the inconvenience what it was …just an inconvenience .
You actually worked pretty hard to figure out a solution for the twenty or so of us international travelers who were now going to miss our connections .
It took about an hour , but in the end you succeeded in finding a flight that would get to Stockholm just two hours after originally intended .
Not too bad , all things considered .
I was ready to give you a big hug and say well done .
Unfortunately , this is where all the fun started .
After checking in with the new flight you ’d assigned us , and confirming we were in fact provided with seat assignments , we were rounded up by a US Airways representative who told us we were not going to be allowed on the flight .
Three hours had passed from the initial deboarding , and the only progress we ’d made was that we were being taken back to the original gate and removed from the flight we were already â€ œconfirmedâ€ on .
I ’m only putting confirmed in quotes because I do n’t think the two of us define it in quite the same way .
Strike 2 .
What the hell , US Airways ?
Why you gotta screw with me like this ?
After a couple more hours of sitting around waiting , we were finally given a new flight assignment that routed us through Copenhagen on SAS and got us to our destination about 8 hours after our original flight would have arrived .
We were still arriving on the same day and arguably you did the best you could , so let ’s call this a foul ball and keep you at two strikes … .
The Return Flight Part 1 : More Customer Service Nightmares and Awkward In - Flight Handjobs
Now it was time for the return flight , and I was anxious to see if I would finally end up flying with you after all .
As per usual , I went online 24 hours before the departure to check in and print out my boarding pass , only to be greeted with an error message .
Great .
Nothing else has been convenient so far , so why start now ?
The message said that there was an inconsistency in my ticket info and I should clear it up at the check - in gate .
Great , this sounds like a “ quick ” fix …
22 hours later , I found myself standing at the check - in counter and being told that the computer is giving some weird error that was preventing the employee from checking me in .
What “ weird error ” ?
Why ?
I ’ve had this flight booked for the past four months .
Nothing has changed .
How do you eff this up ?
It took approximately an hour and twenty minutes to get checked in , only to have the printer run out of paper and my boarding pass get stuck .
Dear God .
By the time the error got cleared and the printer restocked , I had roughly 5 minutes to get through security and make it to my gate .
Your helpful advice : â€ œWhat I recommend you do at this point is run.â€ 
Thanks .
I was just going to meander through some of the shops and pick out a few souvenirs first .
Somehow I managed to make it just in time and boarded the plane a sweaty disgusting mess of tense nerves and inner rage .
You know what ?
I ’m counting this as strike three .
You ’re out before I ’ve ever even flown on one of your goddamn planes .
Disappointingly , I did still need to get home , so off we went in one of your shitty little tin cans .
Now , this part is n’t really your fault , but I ’m pretty much considering it the swirly turd sundae to go along with the shit sandwich you ’d already been serving up .
The couple next to me on the flight was all over each other : kissing , fondling , caressing , and at one point I saw some blanket on lap action with rapid arm movements .
This sort of thing is good for no one .
To make matters worse , the guy looked like Harvey Weinstein and the girl was probably about 30 years younger than him .
Not that I ’m a big fan of being a captive audience to anyone ’s mid-flight handskie , but seeing a couple like this makes you worry the complimentary pretzels might come right back up .
Gross .
After nine hours of being horribly uncomfortable and wavering back and forth between sneaking peeks and trying to ignore the daddy issues nightmare going on directly to my right , we finally landed back in the US .
Of course , right before we landed , your overweight , greasy haired , missing - a- tooth troll of a stewardess refused to give me a customs card , saying , â€ œWe already came through and passed them out.â€ 
When I pointed out that our row had been neglected , she said I could grab one at customs and then loudly muttered , â€ œWe only came through the cabin like five timesâ€ while walking away .
First of all , not true .
And secondly , I ’m totally okay with talking shit about customers behind their back .
It ’s pretty much all that makes customer service jobs manageable sometimes .
Still , at least wait until the customer is out of ear shot .
Otherwise it ’s just plain rude .
But …maybe I should give her the benefit of the doubt since she could have been blinded by what was going on in the seats next to me and just proceeded to walk on by .
All â€œfiveâ€ times .
Return Flight Part 2 : Broken Toilets and Bonus Landings
Upon landing in Philadelphia and going through customs , I assumed the worst was over .
Boy , was I wrong .
The flight took off without incident and I honestly thought I was finally going to be getting a pleasantly uneventful experience .
However , about two hours into the flight someone came over the intercom to announce the toilets were clogged and to â€œplease refrain from using them until further notice.â€ 
No one seemed particularly happy about this announcement , but seeing as how I did n’t really need to use the bathroom anyway , I pretty much ignored it and continued working away on my laptop .
After another half hour and some various tests that involved resetting all the lights over and over again , another announcement was made that we were going to be landing in Denver so a maintenance crew could pump out the shitters .
The plane erupted in a series of boos , and a couple people were shouting that we should take a vote and continue directly onto Seattle , restroom or no .
However , one of your stewardesses quickly put that idea to rest when another announcement was made saying FAA regulations required us to land as soon as possible .
So , it was off to Denver for an hour and a half delay along with some more time sitting next to a man I affectionately dubbed Snoring Hitler , mostly because he looked like Hitler and started snoring pretty much as soon as we boarded the plane .
Again , I know this part is n’t really your fault , but regardless , it sure did n’t help .
After the bathrooms were finally fixed , we departed Denver and were greeted with another announcement requesting everyone take great care not to throw anything in the toilet .
Apparently the blame was being placed on the passengers for the initial technical difficulty .
From sharing stories with people in my immediate vicinity , it sounded as if this sort of technical difficulty is n’t unusual on US Airways flights .
One woman reported her flight to Philadelphia had been without running water , and another woman said her flight to Germany earlier in the week had included a broken video system that needed to be reset every 20 minutes and prevented the passengers from watching any in - flight entertainment .
It kind of made me wonder what sort of other maintenance issues your planes have .
Are you deliberately cutting corners or just inept ?
We did finally make it into Seattle , so at least you got all of us there safely .
However , you have instantly shot your way to the top of my Do Not Fly list .
Congratulations , you were absolutely horrible in pretty much every possible way .
Fool Me Once , Shame on You
Anyway , US Airways , what I ’m trying to say is â€œfuck you.â€ 
You provided a piss poor experience every step of the way .
The only pleasant part of my journey was when you had to put me on an SAS flight because your plane was sitting on the runway being fixed .
So , I guess I should at least give you partial credit for turning me onto yet another foreign airline that actually gets it right .
As far as our relationship goes , we ’re done .
Not only did you strike out , you did n’t really even seem to care .

For years , scientists have assumed that the sun is an enormous mass of hydrogen .
But in a paper presented before the American Astronomical Society , Dr. Oliver Manuel , a professor of nuclear chemistry at UMR , says iron , not hydrogen , is the sun 's most abundant element .
Manuel claims that hydrogen fusion creates some of the sun 's heat , as hydrogen -- the lightest of all elements -- moves to the sun 's surface .
But most of the heat comes from the core of an exploded supernova that continues to generate energy within the iron - rich interior of the sun , Manuel says .
" We think that the solar system came from a single star , and the sun formed on a collapsed supernova core , " Manuel says .
" The inner planets are made mostly of matter produced in the inner part of that star , and the outer planets of material form the outer layers of that star . "
Manuel 's theory that the solar system was born catastrophically out of a supernova goes against the widely - held belief among astrophysicists that the sun and planets were formed 4.5 billion years ago in a relatively ambiguous cloud of interstellar dust .
Iron and the heavy element known as xenon are at the center of Manuel 's efforts to change the way people think about the solar system 's origins .
Born of a supernova
Manuel believes a supernova rocked our area of the Milky Way galaxy some five billion years ago , giving birth to all the heavenly bodies that populate the solar system .
Analyses of meteorites reveal that all primordial helium is accompanied by " strange xenon , " he says , adding that both helium and strange xenon came from the outer layer of the supernova that created the solar system .
Helium and strange xenon are also seen together in Jupiter .
Manuel has spent the better part of his 40 - year scientific career trying to convince others of his hypothesis .
Back in 1975 , Manuel and another UMR researcher , Dr. Dwarka Das Sabu , first proposed that the solar system formed from the debris of a spinning star that exploded as a supernova .
They based their claim on studies of meteorites and moon samples which showed traces of strange xenon .
Data from NASA 's Galileo probe of Jupiter 's helium - rich atmosphere in 1996 reveals traces of strange xenon gases -- solid evidence against the conventional model of the solar system 's creation , Manuel says .
Damn You Facebook !

The MSN messages terrorized Jane .
The 14 - year - old was bullied by girls who called her names and spit on her , but when the attacks moved into cyberspace , she became more withdrawn , anxious and depressed .
She sought help at Southlake Regional Health Centre in Newmarket , where she told a youth crisis worker she wanted to " kill ( the ) bullies " and had a " plan " for getting back at the main bully .
The crisis worker asked if Jane really planned to hurt the bully .
The teen is said to have replied , " Yes , ( the bully ) deserves it because of what she did to me . "
The worker called police and Jane was charged with uttering a threat .
She was jailed , released two weeks later under strict conditions and eventually acquitted .
But Jane ( not her real name ) , now 17 , still feels justice was not served .
That 's why she and her mother launched a $ 4 million lawsuit against defendants that include the hospital , the youth worker and York Region police .
At the heart of the case is a patient 's expectation of receiving help and confidentiality , as well as the responsibility of health workers to report violent threats to police .
A patient 's relationship with a professional is protected by confidentiality , but that cannot be used as a " vehicle for plotting a future injury , " says Bernard Dickens , a University of Toronto specialist on medical law .
" If one discloses intention to go ahead and do something bad in the future , that 's not protected . "
In this case , he says , the youth worker may have misjudged the alleged plan by taking it too seriously , " but it would be a mistake not to take it seriously enough . "
Lawyer Barry Swadron , who represents the teen with Susan McDermott , says " mental health professionals teamed up with the police authority in an effort to turn the victim into a criminal . "
Hospital and police spokespeople declined to comment because the case is before the courts .
Statements of defence have n't been filed .
The unusual tale is gleaned from public court documents , such as an amended statement of claim that protects Jane 's identity , and transcripts of the criminal trial where crisis worker Stacey Morton testified .
The two met in June 2006 .
In an interview with the Star , the teen said the plan " was just a fantasy " that " spiralled out of control . "
" I wanted somebody to believe that they were really hurting me . "
The " plan " involved abducting the main bully , slicing her mouth and sewing it to resemble the rag - doll character in Tim Burton 's animated film The Nightmare Before Christmas .
Morton testified Jane told her she was hearing voices in her head and Morton worried what would happen if a voice told her to harm or kill someone .
According to the statement of claim , which has not been proved in court , Morton became " fixated " on Jane 's comments about " killing bullies " and asked about it so often that " ( she ) encouraged Jane to develop the plan . "
But Morton testified the plan was Jane 's idea .
" She said that the plan needed to be better thought out , as she does not want anything to go wrong like ( the bully ) escaping , " said Morton .
The hospital psychiatrist , who treated Jane , told Morton he did n't believe Jane capable of carrying the plan out .
Morton spoke with the program 's clinical director , who recommended calling police .
According to the claim , police interviewed the bully , who said Jane had n't threatened her .
They did not interview Jane 's mother , Jane , or her attending psychiatrist .

On Sept. 4 , Jane was arrested and jailed .
Upon release , she was permitted to leave home only to attend school or in the company of her mother or adult brothers .
In the following months , Jane says she suffered nightmares and panic attacks , and withdrew from her few friends .
After a two - day trial in June 2007 , she was acquitted .
" I used to have a little bit of self - esteem , like I enjoyed doing speech competitions and stuff , " Jane says .
" But now ... never again . "

So last week , Newsweek printed a heroic front - page article detailing the antiscientific medical swill Oprah Winfrey has been routinely doling out to her audiences .
This nonsense includes , of course , Jenny McCarthy , as well as dangerous quackery by Suzanne Somers and others .
The article really slams Oprah hard , as well it should .
Unsurprisingly , Oprah has released a statement about this , and it 's full to the brim of fail .
I would n't call it a lie , but it 's spinning like a newborn pulsar :
For 23 years , my show has presented thousands of topics that reflect the human experience , including doctors ' medical advice and personal health stories that have prompted conversations between our audience members and their health care providers .
I trust the viewers , and I know that they are smart and discerning enough to seek out medical opinions to determine what may be best for them .
That , to be blunt , is baloney .
First off , it 's wrong .
She pounds home the New Age nonsense from Somers and McCarthy , giving them a platform to relentlessly mislead and misinform people millions at a time , and on those shows rarely gives more than very brief lip service to actual medical research .
Second , it 's at best a cop -out to say that her viewers will do more research .
She has to know that 's almost certainly not true !
The Oprah imprimatur can rocket a book up the best - selling list , as it has for Somers and McCarthy , as well as many others .
Clearly , a vast horde of people will go out and buy what she tells them to because she 's the one who told them to .
And what she 's telling them to buy is dangerous medical nonsense .
The only good news coming out of this is that the mainstream media are taking notice .
Besides Newsweek itself , other venues are writing about it too .
Of course , the blogs are all over it as well ( the Newsweek blog has links to more ) .
Oprah : shame on you .
You had a chance to look this situation over carefully , investigate your methods and ideas , and make this right .
Instead you resort to defensive posturing and spin .
It makes me sick to my stomach .
But how many people will your credulous platform literally make sick ?
US students attacked at Kinneret beach
Yaakov Lappin , THE JERUSALEM POST
A visit to Israel by five young American Jews turned into a nightmare on Friday evening when they were set upon by a large gang of intoxicated thugs armed with metal poles , rocks and chairs on a Lake Kinneret beach , in a brutal and unprovoked attack .
Isaac , 21 , from Los Angeles , who asked that his last name be withheld , spoke to The Jerusalem Post about the harrowing experience , hours before boarding a flight back to the US , where he will undergo another check to ensure that he has not sustained any brain damage .
" I need another post - emergency room CAT scan , " he said by phone .
" This is Israel and I'm Jewish .
I came here for many reasons .
I always thought this is the place where I would be safe .
The men who attacked us were also Jews , " he said .
After completing a semester at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Isaac had volunteered to teach English to asylum - seekers and migrant workers .
Together with another American student and three American Jewish volunteers from programs around the country , the group settled down on the Ein Gev beach , on the eastern shore of the Kinneret , for a weekend break .
" Next to us were 10 young men speaking and singing in Hebrew and playing techno music .
They were drinking .
My friend and I were swimming in the water , when we looked up and saw that a bunch of guys had approached us .
One of them started yelling in Hebrew , saying my friend looked at his girlfriend , " Isaac said .
" He head - butted my friend in the face , and my friend started to bleed . "
The assault was only the first in a series of escalating and severe attacks .
Three men proceeded to set upon Isaac 's friend , while another three began attacking Isaac .
" We managed to get to shore .
They picked up rocks and wooden chairs .
One of them repeatedly smashed the chair on my head , until there was nothing left but a splinter , " Isaac said .
At this stage , Isaac managed to flee his attackers .
He ran down the beach , where he met an Arab family , made up of old women , children , and two men .
" They told us we were safe , that no one would attack us .
We thanked them and walked away .
Then the attackers arrived and began assaulting the family , " Isaac recounted .
The Arab family was pelted with rocks , while Isaac once again found himself outnumbered and under attack .
" A metal pole was smashed into my back and a rock was dropped on my head .
I was covered in blood , and did n't see much after that .
My forehead was split open , " he said .
A group of kibbutz members on the beach then intervened .
" One of them was a doctor and began treating us .
Someone called the police . "
By this time , both the Arab family and the kibbutz members had congregated around the American youths , and made a heroic effort to capture their attackers by forming a human fence around the parking lot 's exit to prevent the gang from escaping .
" The young men who assaulted us jumped in their cars , but all the men and women on the beach got in front of the cars and would n't let them leave .
The cars reversed away from the people and then shot forward at 40 to 50 kilometers an hour toward the group .
Anyone standing there would have been killed , " said Isaac .
His helpers were forced to jump out of the way .
Having cleared the path for their getaway , the gang then duped the police , who had just arrived on the scene in a number of patrol cars .
The attackers were stopped by officers just outside the beach 's parking lot , but told police they had been the ones who were assaulted , adding that they felt their lives to be in danger .
The men asked police if they could move away from the scene .
In the ensuing pandemonium , with civilians on the beach still trying to stop the attackers from fleeing , officers recorded the license plate number of their two vehicles before allowing the attackers to drive away , instructing them to pull over further down the road .
Needless to say , the attackers sped away .
Police subsequently used the license plate numbers to trace one member of the gang .
A 25 - year - old suspect from Kiryat Ata was arrested after being identified during a line - up .
Police will seek to extend his custody on Tuesday .
Tiberias police chief Dep. - Cmdr .
Efi Partuk told the Post that an internal inquiry would be launched to examine the police 's initial response , but added that it was easy to see how officers were at first confused by the chaotic scene .
" When officered arrived and saw what looked like people attempting to harm the attackers , the first consideration was safety .
They sought to regain control of the scene first , and noted the license plate numbers of the cars , " Partuk said .
" I believe we cannot judge them [ negatively ] for their actions . "
He added that a team of investigators was working around the clock to arrest additional suspects , and that police were focusing on tracing the attackers ' elusive second vehicle .
" This is a severe case , and a senior officer has been assigned to it .
We have also sent material to state prosecutors , and a prosecutor has been assigned to this case , " Partuk added .
" We will succeed in tracing the other suspects . "
While recovering in hospital and in intense pain , Isaac had reconsidered plans to lead a birthright - Israel tour around the country after graduating from college , though he now says he will proceed with his plans .
" After hearing so many Israelis react with fury to what happened , and with everyone being so incredibly helpful , that 's really comforting , " he said .
Isaac is suffering from breathing problems due to the rock that was smashed against his collarbone , but he was able to walk a bit on Monday .
He expressed hope that the thugs responsible for his ordeal would be arrested .
" If nothing happens , I do n't know how I 'll feel safe , " he said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Supreme Court sided Monday with white firefighters in a workplace discrimination lawsuit , a divisive case over the role race should play in job advancement .
The Supreme Court in a 5 - 4 ruling backs firefighters in a reverse discirmination case .
In the split 5 - 4 vote , a majority of the justices ruled that the city of New Haven , Connecticut , improperly threw out the results of promotional exams that officials said left too few minorities qualified .
One Latino and no African - American firefighters qualified for promotion based on the exam ; the city subsequently decided not to certify the results and issued no promotions .
A group of 20 mostly white firefighters sued , claiming reverse discrimination .
Watch the firefighters applaud the ruling »
High court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor heard the case on her federal appeals court last year and sided with the city .
The Supreme Court was being asked to decide whether there was a continued need for special treatment for minorities , or whether enough progress has been made to make existing laws obsolete , especially in a political atmosphere in which an African - American occupies the White House .
At issue was whether the city intentionally discriminated -- in violation of both federal law and the Constitution 's Equal Protection Clause .

In Depth : Obama 's Supreme Court nominee
" The city rejected the test results solely because the higher scoring candidates were white , " wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy for the majority .
" Fear of litigation alone cannot justify an employer 's reliance on race to the detriment of individuals who passed the examinations and qualified for promotions . "
In a dissent read from the bench , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned the fairness of the test , which was 60 percent written and 40 percent oral .
" Relying so heavily on pencil - and - paper exams to select firefighters is a dubious practice , " Ginsburg said , calling the majority ruling " troubling . "
" Congress endeavored to promote equal opportunity in fact , and not simply in form .
The damage today 's decision does to that objective is untold , " she said .
Key plaintiff Frank Ricci and others took promotional exams in 2003 for lieutenant and captain positions that had become available in New Haven .
Watch why the firefighters filed the lawsuit »
When the results came back , city attorneys expressed concern about the results , and the New Haven corporation counsel -- after several public hearings -- refused to certify the test , and no promotions were given .
The city said that under a federal civil rights law known as Title VII , employers must ban actions such as promotion tests that would have a " disparate impact " on a protected class , such as a specified race or gender .
The Obama administration took a nuanced position on the appeal .
A Justice Department lawyer told the high court that while the federal government supported the city 's discretion to nullify the test results , it also believed the lawsuit should be allowed to proceed on a limited basis .
Kennedy argued that " the process was open [ and ] fair " and that the city officials " were careful to ensure broad racial participation in the design of the test itself and its administration . "
He added that " race - based action like the city 's in this case is impermissible under Title VII unless the employer can demonstrate a strong basis in evidence that , had it not taken the action , it would have been liable " under the law dealing with " disparate impact . "
Kennedy said the city had not met that threshold .
The case has received added attention because Sotomayor was on the appellate court that dismissed the appeal .
Sotomayor was part of a three - judge panel that ruled in February 2008 to uphold a lower court decision supporting New Haven 's move to throw out the results .
In June 2008 , Sotomayor was part of a 7 - 6 majority that denied a rehearing of the case by the full court .
Legal analysts said they expect Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee will want to ask about her role in that case as well as her comments about ethnicity and the bench .

• The court said it will reargue a campaign finance reform case dealing with a scathing documentary about former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton .
The justices put off an expected ruling and will rehear the issues on September 9 .
The court usually begins its fall term in early October .
At issue was whether the 90 - minute " Hillary : The Movie " -- as well as television ads to promote the film -- should have been subject to strict campaign finance laws on political advocacy or was instead a constitutionally protected form of commercial speech .
• The justices accepted the appeal of Timothy Abbott , who is fighting to gain custody and the return of his son , after the boy 's mother secretly took him from South America to Texas .
At issue is whether one country 's court order preventing a child from being taken overseas by a parent represents " rights of custody " enforceable in another country .
• A small Kansas church that has gained nationwide attention for protesting loudly at funerals of U.S. service members killed in overseas conflicts received a temporary victory .
The justices rejected an appeal from Missouri officials over their efforts to keep members of the Topeka - based Westboro Baptist Church from demonstrating at least 300 feet from memorial services and burials .
• Family members of those who died in the September 11 , 2001 , attacks will not receive a hearing before the high court on whether they can sue Saudi Arabian officials who allegedly helped fund extremist groups responsible for the attacks .
• The court backed away from a case dealing with whether pharmaceutical companies can use patients ' prescription drug histories to help target direct - marketing campaigns .
Without comment , the justices turned down an appeal dealing with a state law restricting the commercial use of such information , meaning the New Hampshire law remains in place .
• Retiring Justice David Souter said goodbye to his Supreme Court colleagues in a brief statement he read from the bench , saying they had " touched me more than I can say . "
The 69 - year - old justice said he is looking forward to his retirement in New Hampshire but said he would retain fond memories of " the finest moments in my life . "

Simulation of differential equations with turtle graphics using JSXGraph .
SIR model without vital dynamics
The SIR model measures the number of susceptible , infected , and recovered individuals in a host population .
Given a fixed population , let [ math ] S(t ) [ / math ] be the fraction that is susceptible to an infectious , but not deadly , disease at time t ; let [ math ] I ( t ) [ / math ] be the fraction that is infected at time [ math ] t[ / math ] ; and let [ math ] R(t ) [ / math ] be the fraction that has recovered .
Let [ math ] \beta[ / math ] be the rate at which an infected person infects a susceptible person .
Let [ math ] \gamma[ / math ] be the rate at which infected people recover from the disease .
A single epidemic outbreak is usually far more rapid than the vital dynamics of a population , thus , if the aim is to study the immediate consequences of a single epidemic , one may neglect birth - death processes .
In this case the SIR system can be expressed by the following set of differential equations :
[ math ] \ frac{dS}{dt} = - \ beta I S [ / math ]
[ math ] \ frac{d R}{dt} = \gamma I [ / math ]
[ math ] \ frac{dI}{dt} = -( \frac{dS}{dt}+\frac{dR}{dt} ) [ / math ]
Example Hong Kong flu
initially 7.9 million people ,
10 infected ,
0 recovered .
estimated average period of infection : 3 days , so [ math ] \gamma = 1/3[ /math ]
infection rate : one new person every other day , so [ math ] \beta = 1/2[/math ]
Thus S(0 ) = 1 , I ( 0 ) = 1.27E - 6 , R(0 ) = 0 , see [ 1 ] .
The lines in the JSXGraph - simulation below have the following meaning :
* Blue : Rate of susceptible population * Red : Rate of infected population * Green : Rate of recovered population ( which means : immune , isolated or dead )

A whopping 98 % of products that are advertised , labeled or packaged as “ green , ” are not telling the complete truth about their environmental friendliness and are potentially misleading consumers with their claims , according to ( pdf ) research from TerraChoice Environmental Marketing .
A recent multi-country survey and analysis of so - called “ environmentally friendly ” products in the toy , cosmetic , cleaning and baby - product categories found that advertising for these products has increased dramatically in the last several years :
Availability of such products in the US and Canada has similarly increased between 40 % and 176 % .?
But while there are more items claiming to be “ all natural , ” “ organic , ” or otherwise green , nearly all of them are committing at least one of – what TerraChoice dubs – the “ Seven Sins of Greenwashing . ”
Greenwashing is defined by the company as the act of misleading consumers regarding the environmental practices of a company or the environmental benefits of a product or service .
The seven sins of greenwashing and their frequency in the US , according to TerraChoice :
The Sin of the Hidden Trade - Off ? occurs when one environmental issue is emphasized at the expense of potentially more serious concerns .
In other words , when marketing hides a trade - off between environmental issues .
Paper , for example , is not necessarily environmentally preferable just because it comes from a sustainably - harvested forest .
The Sin of No Proof happens when environmental assertions are not backed up by evidence or third - party certification .
One common example is facial tissue products that claim various percentages of post - consumer recycled content without providing any supporting details .
The Sin of Vagueness occurs when a marketing claim is so lacking in specifics it becomes meaningless .
‘ ” All - natural ” is an example of this Sin. Arsenic , uranium , mercury , and formaldehyde are all naturally occurring , and poisonous .
“ All natural ” is n’t necessarily
“ green . ” The Sin of Worshiping False Labels is when marketers create a false suggestion or certification - like image to mislead consumers into thinking that a product has been through a legitimate green certification process .
One example of this sin is a brand of aluminum foil with certification - like images that show the name of the company ’s own in - house environmental program for which there is no explanation .
This sin has been added to TerraChoice ’s list since it ’s previous report in 2007 .
The Sin of Irrelevance arises when an environmental issue unrelated to the product is emphasized .
One example is the claim that a product is “ CFC - free , ” ? since CFCs are banned by law .
The Sin of Lesser of Two Evils occurs when an environmental claim makes consumers
feel ‘ green ’ about a product category that is itself lacking in environmental benefits .
Organic cigarettes are an example of this phenomenon .
The Sin of Fibbing is when environmental claims are outright false .
One common example
is products falsely claiming to be Energy Star certified .
“ The good news is that the growing availability of green products shows that consumers are demanding more environmentally responsible choices , and that marketers and manufacturers are listening , ” said Scot Case , VP of TerraChoice .
“ The bad news is that some marketers are exploiting consumers ’ demand for third - party certification by creating fake labels or false suggestions of third - party endorsement . ”
In addition to looking at products in the US and Canada , the report also investigated the state of greenwashing in the UK and Australia , including an examination of nearly 1,000 products .
Results revealed that greenwashing continues to be an international challenge .
“ The final piece of good news is that eco-labeling is on the rise , ” added Case .
“ Legitimate eco-labeling is nearly twice as common as it was in our 2007 survey , increasing from 13.7 % to 23.4 % on all ‘ green ’ products . ”
About the study :
In November 2008 through January 2009 , TerraChoice researchers were sent into category - leading big - box retailers in the US , Canada , the UK , and Australia with instructions to record every product making an environmental claim .
For each , the researchers recorded product details , claim (s ) details , any supporting information , and any explanatory detail or offers of additional information or support .
In the US and Canada , a total of 2,219 ‘ green ’ products were recorded .
Claims made bny products were tested against best practices found in guidelines provided by the FTC Canadian Competition Bureau , Australian Consumer and Competition Commission , and the ISO 14021 standard for environmental labeling .
The report is available here .
The US government is providing liquidity to banks President Bush has asked Congress to release the remaining $ 350 bn ( £ 236bn ) of US financial bail - out funds after a request from Barack Obama .
There is strong opposition in Congress to releasing the money with the House of Representatives and the Senate considering blocking the move .
But funds would be likely to remain available because any disapproval could be vetoed by President Bush .
But observers say if the payout was rejected , it could aggravate markets .
There have been hopes that if the final tranche of the bail - out was approved , it would give a strong start to Mr Obama 's efforts to fighting the financial crisis when he takes office next week .
The president - elect 's team have been trying to douse opposition to the payment of the rest of the funds agreed last year under the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( Tarp ) .
" I called President Bush to trigger the second half of what 's known as the Tarp , that 's related to financial rescue , " said Mr Obama .
" I did so because in consultation with the business community and my top economic advisers , it is clear that the financial system , although improved from where it was in September , is still fragile . "
The White House said that President Bush had formally requested on Monday evening that Congress release the remaining pledged capital .
' Rules needed '
The US House of Representatives passed the $ 700 bn government plan to rescue the US financial sector in October last year - having rejected an earlier version of it which hammered global stock markets .
The package was aimed at buying up the bad debts of failing financial institutions on Wall Street .
The Treasury Department , which is managing the Tarp , has already committed the first half of it - mainly to capital injections into troubled banks , but many Congress members are unhappy with how it has been handled .
US Democratic congressman Barney Frank said that he and Mr Obama agreed that new rules were needed to govern how the next $ 350bn was disbursed - but said he wanted these written into law .
Carmakers and even leading figures of the pornography industry have argued that they should be given access to the cash which was earmarked for financial institutions .

If Shakespeare were alive now , he would be a mobile phone novelist , " the author Tadashi Izumi asserts .
And if Shakespeare lived in contemporary Japan , Izumi may well be right .
Five of last year 's top ten best - selling novels started life as mobile phone – or keitai – novels .
Izumi , age 37 , is part of the keitai novel publishing boom .
His debut novel , Cross Road , a tale of romance with a protagonist inspired by Emily Bronte 's Heathcliff , was an immediate success .
More than two million copies were downloaded in the first week of it being published online before he was approached by a conventional publisher who transformed his work into traditional book form .
" It can be an effective way to get publishers interested in you , " he says .
Keitai novels are mainly read by teenage girls , with 13 - to 18 - year - olds accounting for 70 per cent of downloads , and while Izumi gained a doctorate in Victorian literature from Cambridge University , he does not claim to be writing highbrow literature .
" There is less scene - setting than in conventional novels , fewer adjectives , and more of a focus on conversation and emotions .
The structure of the novels , with very simple sentences , makes them accessible , " he says .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ryu , age 24 , the author of Tokyo Real , a gritty tale inspired by his friend 's addiction to the drug MDMA , agrees that the accessibility of mobile phone novels is crucial .
" My novel is very dark .
I think readers reacted to it , and I hope that , for a few , it may have helped them to stop taking drugs , " he says .
He wrote his book on his mobile phone at night before going to sleep .
It was first published online , with download figures so high that Ryu was approached by a conventional publisher within 48 hours .
More than three million people have now read the book on their phone , and last year Real readers organised a march through the Tokyo streets to raise awareness of the dangers of drugs .
Ryu used the profits from the novel to buy a bar , where people not only come for a drink , but also to visit the author to talk about their experiences with drugs or for ad - hoc counselling .
" It 's only been so effective because people would read it on their mobiles , so it was accessible to people who may be into drugs , " he says .
There was a time when mobile phones were used simply to communicate .
In high - speed Japan , where more than 100 million people own mobile phones , they are not only a platform for novelists , but for all forms of artistic expression .
Mao Sakaguchi discusses mobile art
Manga – comic art – is a major part of the Japanese publishing industry , representing a 481 billion yen ( £ 3.4 bn ) market domestically .
And it 's now migrated to the mobile .
Manga fans download stories , which have up to 1,000 scenes and added sound effects , and scroll through them during any idle moments .
Toru Kenjyu , CEO of Takarajima Wondernet , the biggest creator of mobile manga , says that 80 per cent of comic book downloads – for which subscribers pay a £ 3 monthly charge to keep up with – are by women .
The current best - seller is Catwalk Beat , the story of a boy with a troubled background , but excellent sartorial sense .
When he starts a new school , his fashionable threads unite all the pupils .
More than seven million people downloaded the mobile manga , and the fashions from Catwalk Beat have been produced for real and are available to buy online .
And while this may eventually be published as a traditional comic book , it is more enjoyable on the mobile as the phone vibrates whenever there 's a tense moment .
It 's not just comic art that is popular on mobile phones in Tokyo ; street artists also create designs specifically for mobiles .
Mao Sakaguchi , web project leader of the Shibuya HP France Gallery , says he grew frustrated by the limited art market in Japan , so had the idea of using mobiles to introduce art to a wider audience .
" I had friends who were street artists , and I used my fashion store as an art gallery , changing the work monthly , " he says .
" We started by taking pictures of their work that could be downloaded onto mobile phones . "
This progressed into art designed specifically for the mobile , using Adobe Flash software .
Artists now design menu icons , applications and tools – such as a revolving conveyor belt of sushi that spins across the screen to indicate phone signal strength – as well as wallpaper for mobile phones .
Takeru , age 38 , is a motion graphic designer and one of Tokyo 's mobile phone artists .
" It 's a good way to show my work to young people , " he says .
" They may not be so interested in art , but by seeing it on their mobile phones they are introduced to it .
The phone gives you freedom because your work is interactive , animated and changing – which is not possible with still art .
We try to make the tools for the phone creative , which is an interesting challenge . "
Akhr , 26 , an artist , agrees that artwork for mobile phones is beneficial for both artists and phone owners .
" It 's very different from showing art in galleries because it 's so accessible .
And it 's a good way for young artists to get exposure , " he says .
While Japan leads the mobile phone art movement , Britian is following .
The mobile network 3 launched the award - winning INQ1 handset last year , which incorporates pre-installed desktop artwork created by members of a community art project .
Sarah Pope , head of marketing at 3 , says : " Work by artists from the USA , Britain , Japan and Italy has been used and the resulting pieces feature as wallpaper .
Any budding artist , photographer or illustrator can send their work to art@inqmobile and they could be featured when we launch the next handset in the range . "
The most established mobile phone art form internationally is the pocket film , shot using phone cameras ; there are now annual pocket film festivals held in Paris , Toronto , Taiwan , and Yokohama in Japan .
Masuki Fujihata discusses mobile phone films
Mobile phones have proved invaluable for capturing images for immediate news , such as the photos of the Hudson River plane crash landing that were first posted on Twitter .
But Masaki Fujihata , Director of Tokyo's first film academy and creator of Japan 's Pocket Film Festival , believes that most people are unaware of the camera 's capability .
" Some filmmakers try to imitate Hollywood on their phones , but actually a phone is an effective device to make an observation on the world .
You can capture something intimate , " he says .
The majority of pocket films are around five minutes in length , and Fujihata says it 's important to bear in mind you are working with a small device with a low resolution .
The best films , he says , include filming inventions .
For example , one film was shot with a phone concealed in a paper bag , held very low to the ground .
The film is shaky rather than slick , which adds to the effective conveyance of a child 's personal perception of the world .
He believes that the pocket film offers a new way of communication .
" Humans evolve .
First we learnt to talk and listen , then how to read and write .
Now we are learning filming and editing , and it is a fundamentally new language of communication .
Very soon we will see pocket films winning Oscars , " he says .
Japan , long renowned for its love of all things technological , feels like a glimpse into the future .
And mobile phone companies in Britain are watching very closely .
Sarah Pope , head of marketing at 3 , says : " art , in the many forms it takes , has greatly benefitted from the internet in terms of reach .
At 3 we want to extend this process to the mobile . "
The company has seen a huge shift in the last five years in how talent rises from grass roots and back streets to the mass market .
" Everybody is a publisher and promoter and they are using social networking tools on the internet to get their music , photography , art and films noticed , " she says .
She has observed many teenagers and people in their twenties sitting in front of a computer , using Facebook , watching YouTube , sending instant messages , emailing and listening to music .
" Give them a mobile phone and what do they do ?
Text and , less frequently , make a voice call , " she says .
" Where are all those other communication tools they use on their computers ?
The INQ1 makes the migration of PC - based habits onto a mobile platform easy and gives everyone the tools to be their own promoter . "
The speed of the mobile phone 's evolution from its distant cousin , the 1980s house brick , is ever - gathering pace , and it seems that its future is based around this new language of creative communication , rather than straightforward chat .

Another short video from Mike Gray , for Common Sense for Drug Policy .
This one is from Todd McCormick 's recent THC Expo in Los Angeles -- as Mike describes it , the " [ l ] argest marijuana merchandising exhibit in US History , " " draw[ing ] crowds and exhibitors from all over the world to the Los Angeles Convention Center . "
This could not happen if marijuana were not basically accepted by society , or a large part of it , despite the retrograde laws that still see thousands arrested daily .
View the first video in the series , " Retirees Demand Marijuana , " here .

In drug policy he is well known as author of the book Drug Crazy , possibly the best introduction to the madness of the drug war yet written .

“ Depending on whom you ask , ” Goldman Sachs is either “ really good at what they do , ” said Boyd Erman and Tara Perkins in Canada ’s The Globe and Mail , or “ the beneficiary of a giant government conspiracy . ”
How else to explain the well - connected bank ’s $ 3.4 billion quarterly profit ?
For starters , there ’s evidence that Goldman is “ making money the old fashioned way : it ’s earning it , ” through smart trading and helping to sell government bonds .
“ Sure , give Goldman credit ” for its big quarterly profit , said Zac Bissonnette in BloggingStocks .
But that gain would be “ completely wiped out ” without the $ 13 billion gift taxpayers gave Goldman , through AIG , to cover its lousy bets .
We should be “ absolutely outraged ” that all we got in return for our “ generosity ” was worthless AIG stock .
What ’s with “ all the Goldman haters ? ” said Ryan Barnes in Seeking Alpha .
Goldman
Sachs is doing well because for decades it has hired “ the smartest , most Machiavellian young people on the planet . ”
The market has been extremely volatile , and that ’s when the smartest traders make the most money .
Goldman has those traders — how does that make them “ intrinsically evil ” ?
“ The geniuses at Goldman screw up like everyone else , ” said Charlie Gasparino in The Daily Beast , and without the $ 10 billion federal bailout , plus the $ 13 billion from AIG ’s taxpayer bailout , Goldman would be “ toast .
Finished .
Kaput . ”
But here ’s the bigger problem : Goldman ’s “ doozy ” of a profit will be from “ embracing much of the same risk that nearly led to its demise , ” only this time it ’s gambling with taxpayer dollars .
Finally , there is health care .
Every cliché
Ann Coulter throws at the Democrats is gloriously fulfilled by the Democratic health care bills .
The bills do almost nothing to control health care inflation .
They are modeled on the Massachusetts health reform law that is currently coming apart at the seams precisely because it does n’t control costs .
They do little to reward efficient providers and reform inefficient ones .
The House bill adds $ 239 billion to the federal deficit during the first 10 years , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
It would pummel small businesses with an 8 percent payroll penalty .
It would jack America ’s top tax rate above those in Italy and France .
Top earners in New York and California would be giving more than 55 percent of earnings to one government entity or another .
Nancy Pelosi has lower approval ratings than Dick Cheney and far lower approval ratings than Sarah Palin .
And yet Democrats have allowed her policy values to carry the day  this in an era in which independents dominate the electoral landscape .
Who ’s going to stop this leftward surge ?
Months ago , it seemed as if Obama would lead a center - left coalition .
Instead , he has deferred to the Old Bulls on Capitol Hill on issue after issue .
Machiavelli said a leader should be feared as well as loved .
Obama is loved by the Democratic chairmen , but he is not feared .
On health care , Obama has emphasized cost control .
The chairmen flouted his priorities because they do n’t fear him .
On cap and trade , Obama campaigned against giving away pollution offsets .
The chairmen wrote their bill to do precisely that because they do n’t fear him .
On taxes , Obama promised that top tax rates would not go above Clinton - era levels .
The chairmen flouted that promise because they do n’t fear him .
Last week , the administration announced a proposal to take Medicare spending decisions away from Congress and lodge the power with technocrats in the executive branch .
It ’s a good idea , and it might lead to real cost savings .
But there ’s no reason to think that it will be incorporated into the final law .
The chairmen will never surrender power to an administration they can override .
That leaves matters in the hands of the Blue Dog Democrats .
These brave moderates are trying to restrain the fiscal explosion .
But moderates inherently lack seniority ( they are from swing districts ) .
They are usually bought off by leadership at the end of the day .
And so here we are again .
Every new majority overinterprets its mandate .
We ’ve been here before .
We ’ll be here again .
Thirty years ago , during the demonstrations that led to the Shah ’s downfall , one of the dominant images was scenes of uniformed soldiers firing live ammunition at protesters .
This week , Iran ’s clerics seem determined , at least , not to repeat that historic mistake .
They remember that the daily news coverage of the Shah ’s soldiers shooting and killing unarmed protesters precipitated the collapse of the regime .
Instead , bearded plainclothes militiamen have been attacking and harassing the demonstrators in Tehran this past week .
These are Basijis , members of a civilian paramilitary organization founded by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979 .
It was conceived of as a civilian auxiliary force subordinate to the Revolutionary Guards , and so it has functioned over the past three decades .
During the eight - year Iran - Iraq war , fervent Basijis volunteered to serve on the front lines .
For a time , very young Basijis were encouraged to offer themselves for martyrdom by clearing minefields with their bodies in what became known as “ human waves ” — literally walking to their deaths en masse so that more experienced soldiers could advance against the enemy .
An Iranian friend of mine who is a war veteran described the Basiji boy martyrs as having played a tragic but significant role in the war , by providing Iran with a “ flesh wall ” against Saddam Hussein ’s vastly superior Western - supplied military technology .
In peacetime , the corps lets the Islamic regime employ violence as a form of social control while retaining some plausible deniability ; scruffy bearded men in civilian clothes are not , after all , uniformed soldiers .
The Basij is now said to have some 400,000 active members nationwide , with perhaps a million more reservists ; in some ways , their relationship to Iran ’s Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who is also their commander in chief , recalls the one between Nicolae Ceausescu and the loyalist miners trucked in from the Romanian countryside to strong - arm pro-democracy protestors .
From 1997 to 2005 , during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami , the Basij showed its usefulness again , by attacking students at demonstrations .
Some students were killed .
The protests died out .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who I wrote about for The New Yorker in April , is a Basiji , and the organization has always been an important part of his power base .
During the past four years , with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president and the reform movement dormant , the Basij has not been needed as shock troops .
Instead they have made their presence felt by periodically throwing up traffic barricades on the streets of Tehran and stopping cars to smell the breath of drivers for evidence of illegal alcohol consumption , or to question couples about their marital status .
These Basijis are usually scruffy working - class men , and thus bring an element of notional “ class struggle ” to the otherwise pragmatically lived lives of the citizens of the Islamic republic .
Not surprisingly , among more educated and affluent Iranians , they are almost unanimously despised .
In the mass demonstrations that have taken place this week , the modus operandi of the Basijis has been brutal and predatory .
They have used the same tactics as packs of African wild dogs worrying a herd of wildebeest .
They choose their targets at the edges of the crowds , going for the vulnerable and unwary stragglers , and moving in as a group to reduce them with violence .
Last Monday , the men who fired guns at demonstrators from the rooftops of buildings were almost certainly Basijis .
They killed seven demonstrators at their leisure , and it also seems likely that they hoped this display of lethal intent would so intimidate the protesters that they would give up and go home .
Clearly , that did not work , and it is probable that they were ordered to tone down such public displays of violence , at least for the time being .
But they have continued to attack surreptitiously and in terrifying ways , jumping demonstrators as they return home on darkened streets at night .
On Wednesday , there were reports that men who appeared to be Basijis had come onto the Tehran University campus and had stabbed students with knives .
On a trip I made to Iran in 2006 , a year after Ahmadinejad assumed the presidency , I met a Basij official , Dr. Mahdi Araby , who worked at the Tehran City Hall .
In the late nineteen - nineties , Araby had been one of Ahmadinejad ’s engineering students at the Iran University of Science and Technology , where Ahmadinejad was studying for his Ph.D. in traffic management .
In 2003 , after Ahmadinejad ’s appointment as mayor of Tehran , he had asked Araby to come and work with him .
Araby described Mayor Ahmadinejad as a man of pure heart and missionary zeal .
“ His original aim was not political , ” explained Araby .
“ He just wanted to serve people . ”
Araby pointed to a beige windbreaker that was hanging on a hook on the closed door of the room .
I remarked that it appeared to be exactly like the jacket the president usually wore .
He smiled proudly and said it was his .
“ It is the jacket of the Basij . ” he said .
He then told me the following story .
One night during Ahmadinejad ’s time as mayor , Araby had been driving home when he saw an elderly couple standing by the side of the road and looking as though they were in distress .
They were holding up a jerrican to show that they had run out of gas , but no one had stopped to assist them .
Araby did .
He instructed the old man how to siphon some petrol from his car , but the man had explained that he was asthmatic , so Araby did it himself .
The old woman had wanted to pay him , but he had refused , telling them , “ I am a Basiji .
It is our duty to help . ”
Araby accidentally swallowed some of the petrol and had begun spitting up blood , so he ended up in hospital for three weeks .
He explained that he had a lung problem from a chemical - weapon attack during the Iran - Iraq war .
He smiled ; his wounds , like his Basij jacket , were a badge of honor .
Next , Araby told me a story he had heard about Ahmadinejad while he was mayor .
The story was that Ahmadinejad had been dressing up as a streetsweeper at night and going out with a work crew for an entire month , to understand what their life was like and decide how to pay them a fair wage .
Araby had confronted Ahmadinejad about the story and asked if it was true .
“ He asked where I had heard it from , and he smiled , ” said Araby .
To him , Ahmadinejad ’s reaction was a confirmation of the rumor .
“ Ahmadinejad is a true Basiji , ” he said approvingly .
It was that same spirit that propelled Ahmadinejad into the presidential race , Araby believed .
“ I can tell you that , up to two months before the presidential election in 2005 , he was undecided about running .
But our people were fed up with the promises being made during the presidential campaign , and we realized that the middle - class people , and the people at the lower rungs of society , were not satisfied either . ”
Araby said , “ He had n’t planned to become president .
We pushed him to do it . ”
The Basij also connects Ahmadinejad to his spiritual mentor , Ayatollah Mesbah - e - Yazdi , a conservative hard - liner who is extremely hostile to the West and has frequently called for a stricter interpretation of Iran ’s Islamic revolution , which he believes has strayed from the path set out for it by the late Imam Khomeini .
Yazdi has frequently endorsed the use of violence against critics of the regime .
In 2005 , he openly and controversially encouraged his followers to vote for Ahmadinejad .
Yazdi does not like Western journalists , but one of his aide ’s , Hojestaleslam Gharavian , spoke to me on his behalf .
We met in an office on a nondescript residential backstreet of southern Qom .
Gharavian , a teacher of Islamic studies , wore black and white robes and a black turban .
He explained that it was he who had first brought Ahmadinejad to Yazdi ’s attention , and that it had come about by a quirk of destiny .
The ayatollah had been in the habit of speaking to the university professors ’
Basij organization once a week , but once , when he was unable to attend , and Gharavian had stood in for him .
He had met and been impressed by Ahmadinejad , who was a prominent member of the group .
Afterward , he told Ayatollah Yazdi about him , and introduced them .
“ What was it that impressed you ? ” I asked Gharavian .
“ I saw that he had a true Basij culture , ” he said approvingly .
“ And that , like Imam Khomeini , he was especially resistant to foreign cultural influences . ”
400 years of discussion and we ’re still not sure what creates the Earth ’s magnetic field , and thus the magnetosphere , despite the importance of the latter as the only buffer between us and deadly solar wind of charged particles ( made up of electrons and protons ) .
New research raises question marks about the forces behind the magnetic field and the structure of Earth itself .
The controversial new paper published in New Journal of Physics ( co-owned by the Institute of Physics and the German Physical Society ) , ‘ Secular variation of the Earth ’s magnetic field : induced by the ocean flow ? ’ , will deflect geophysicists ’ attention from postulated motion of conducting fluids in the Earth ’s core , the twentieth century ’s answer to the mysteries of geomagnetism and magnetosphere .
Professor Gregory Ryskin from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University in Illinois , US , has defied the long - standing convention by applying equations from magnetohydrodynamics to our oceans ’ salt water ( which conducts electricity ) and found that the long - term changes ( the secular variation ) in the Earth ’s main magnetic field are possibly induced by our oceans ’ circulation .
With calculations thus confirming Ryskin ’s suspicions , there were also time and space correlations - specific indications of the integral relationship between the oceans and our magnetospheric buffer .
For example , researchers had recorded changes in the intensity of current circulation in the North Atlantic ; Ryskin shows that these appear strongly correlated with sharp changes in the rate of geomagnetic secular variation ( “ geomagnetic jerks ” ) .
Tim Smith , senior publisher of the New Journal of Physics , said , " This article is controversial and will no doubt cause vigorous debate , and possibly strong opposition , from some parts of the geomagnetism community .
As the author acknowledges , the results by no means constitute a proof but they do suggest the need for further research into the possibility of a direct connection between ocean flow and the secular variation of the geomagnetic field . "
In the early 1920s , Einstein highlighted the large challenge that understanding our Magnetosphere poses .
It was later suggested that the Earth ’s magnetic field could be a result of the flow of electrically - conducting fluid deep inside the Earth acting as a dynamo .
In the second half of the twentieth century , the dynamo theory , describing the process through which a rotating , convecting , and electrically conducting fluid acts to maintain a magnetic field , was used to explain how hot iron in the outer core of the Earth creates a magnetosphere .
The journal paper also raises questions about the structure of our Earth ’s core .
Familiar text book images that illustrate a flow of hot and highly electrically - conducting fluid at the core of the Earth are based on conjecture and could now be rendered invalid .
As the flow of fluids at the Earth ’s core cannot be measured or observed , theories about changes in the magnetosphere have been used , inversely , to infer the existence of such flow at the core of the Earth .
While Ryskin ’s research looks only at long - term changes in the Earth ’s magnetic field , he points out that , “ If secular variation is caused by the ocean flow , the entire concept of the dynamo operating in the Earth ’s core is called into question : there exists no other evidence of hydrodynamic flow in the core . ”
On a practical level , it means the next time you use a compass you might need to thank the seas and oceans for influencing the force necessary to guide the way .
Dr Raymond Shaw , professor of atmospheric physics at Michigan Technological University , said , “ It should be kept in mind that the idea Professor Ryskin is proposing in his paper , if valid , has the potential to deem irrelevant the ruling paradigm of geomagnetism , so it will be no surprise to find individuals who are strongly opposed or critical .

Edward A. Lee , Computing Needs Time , Communications of the ACM , Volume 52 , Issue 5 ( May 2009 ) .
The foundations of computing , rooted in Turing , Church , and von Neumann , are about the transformation of data , not about physical dynamics .
This paper argues that we need to rethink the core abstractions if we really want to integrate computing with physical processes .
In particular , I focus on a key aspect of physical processes that is almost entirely absent in computing , the passage of time .
This is not just about â€œreal - time systems , â€ which accept the foundations and retrofit them with temporal properties .
Although that technology has much to contribute , I will argue that it cannot solve the problem alone because it is built on flawed foundations .
The section of most direct relevance to LtU is probably section 5.2 on programming languages , which opens by saying :
Programming languages provide an abstraction layer above the ISA .
If the ISA is to expose selected temporal properties , and programmers wish to exploit this , then one approach would be to reflect these in the languages .
Also potentially of interest to the LtU readership is section 5.4 on formal methods , which closes by asserting that
... type systems are formal methods that have had enormous impact .
What is needed is time systems with the power of type systems .
Note : The " Tagged Signal " meta - model of computation mentioned in section 3 of the paper was previously discussed on LtU here .

The Closet Entrepreneur blog explains how a sinnet handily tames cables :
The chain sinnet ( aka chain braid , daisy chain , or monkey braid ) is a cable shortening and storing method that can be used to make stray cables a little more pleasing to the eye .
You create a chain sinnet by making a loop at the base of your cord , then pull the remaining cord into each new loop .
Be sure to keep your loops loose to avoid damaging the cord .

Plants producing large quantities of drinking water from moisture in the air could look like this .

Cracks permeate the dried - out desert ground , the landscape bears testimony to the lack of water .
But even here , where there are no lakes , rivers or groundwater , considerable quantities of water are stored in the air .
In the Negev desert in Israel , for example , annual average relative air humidity is 64 percent - in every cubic meter of air there are 11.5 milliliters of water .
Research scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB in Stuttgart working in conjunction with their colleagues from the company Logos Innovationen have found a way of converting this air humidity autonomously and decentrally into drinkable water .
" The process we have developed is based exclusively on renewable energy sources such as thermal solar collectors and photovoltaic cells , which makes this method completely energy - autonomous .
It will therefore function in regions where there is no electrical infrastructure , " says Siegfried Egner , head of department at the IGB .
The principle of the process is as follows : hygroscopic brine - saline solution which absorbs moisture - runs down a tower - shaped unit and absorbs water from the air .
It is then sucked into a tank a few meters off the ground in which a vacuum prevails .
Energy from solar collectors heats up the brine , which is diluted by the water it has absorbed .
Because of the vacuum , the boiling point of the liquid is lower than it would be under normal atmospheric pressure .
This effect is known from the mountains : as the atmospheric pressure there is lower than in the valley , water boils at temperatures distinctly below 100 degrees Celsius .
The evaporated , non-saline water is condensed and runs down through a completely filled tube in a controlled manner .
The gravity of this water column continuously produces the vacuum and so a vacuum pump is not needed .
The reconcentrated brine runs down the tower surface again to absorb moisture from the air .
" The concept is suitable for various sizes of installation .
Single - person units and plants supplying water to entire hotels are conceivable , " says Egner .
Prototypes have been built for both system components - air moisture absorption and vacuum evaporation - and the research scientists have already tested their interplay on a laboratory scale .
In a further step the researchers intend to develop a demonstration facility .

A new study suggests that we lose and replace about half of our friends every seven years , and as a result the size of our social network remains the same over time .
For ages sociologists have debated whether personal preference or social context holds more sway over how we meet people and the nature of our relationships ( would , for example , your husband have become your husband if you ’d met him in a bar instead of via your best friend ? ) .
Sociologist Gerald Mollenhorst took on the challenge of addressing this question by crafting a study that investigated how the context in which we meet people influences our social network .
Mollenhorst conducted a survey of 1007 people ages 18 to 65 years .
Seven years later the respondents were contacted once again and 604 people were reinterviewed .
They answered questions such as : Who do you talk with regarding important personal issues ?
Who helps you with projects in your home ?
Who do you pop by to see ?
Where did you get to know that person ?
And where do you meet that person now ?
The results : personal network sizes remained stable , but many members of the network were new .
Only 30 percent of the original ‘ helper ’ friends and discussion partners had the same position in a subject ’s network seven years later , and only 48 percent were still part of the social network .
This finding contradicts previous research showing that social network sizes are shrinking because we are becoming increasingly individualistic .
Evidently , not so much .
Mollenhorst also found that social networks were not formed based on personal choices alone .
Our choice of friends is limited by opportunities to meet , and people often choose friends from a context in which they have previously chosen a friend .
If the pond had fish the first time , why not cast back in ?
Also , in contrast to research that suggests people typically separate things like work , social clubs and friends , this study shows that these categories often overlap – another blow to the argument that we ’re becoming staunch individualists who keep our social compartments separate .
" So ask me , " said the veteran music hall comedian , " what is the secret of my success . "
The adoring fan began : " Tell me , what is ... " " Timing ! " interrupted the veteran comedian , before his interlocutor could go any further .
It 's an old story , but very relevant to the present economic debate .
There can be no doubt , as the opposition and the governor of the Bank of England have no hesitation in reminding us , and Robert Chote , director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies , forcibly told the Society of Business Economists ' annual meeting last week , that the country faces a huge medium - term fiscal crisis .
The prime minister is said to be at best unaware of the scale of the crisis , and at worst the perpetrator of what Churchill famously described as " terminological inexactitudes " on the subject .
But it is to the credit of Mervyn King , the governor , and more seasoned Conservatives , such as my old friend Kenneth Clarke , that they are not calling for dramatic cuts in public expenditure , or frightening tax increases , to take effect immediately .
It is all a question of ... timing .
King and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee are doing their best to dampen exaggerated expectations about " green shoots " and economic recovery .
The general situation is still pretty grim .
It is not a " recovery " when the rate of deterioration slows down .
Nor will it be a recovery by traditional standards if the 4.3 % decline in the UK 's gross domestic product now forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for this year is followed by a modest upturn .
One has to remember not only the sensational scale of this recession , but also the lost output , or unrealised potential for an increase in living standards , arising from the fact that the economy is not growing at the trend rate of ( perhaps : there is much debate ) some 2.5 % a year .
The loss would be a lot greater if it had not been for the fiscal ( tax cuts ; higher public spending ) and monetary ( reduced interest rates ; desperate efforts to boost liquidity in the economy ) measures taken by the Treasury and Bank of England .
My suspicion is that , when the time comes to make a start on reducing the deficit , the real debate will not be between " Tory Cuts " and " Labour investment " ( it seems to be commonly accepted that there will have to be cuts ) , but between " deep spending cuts accompanied by tax cuts - or no tax increases " ( a Cameron government ) and " unavoidable , but fewer , spending cuts accompanied by tax increases " ( a Lazarus - style resurrected Labour government ) .
Recovery was impeded several times after the Great Depression of 1929 - 32 by premature fiscal tightening .
And , for all the concern about the " structural " budget deficit - ie , that element not accounted for by the cyclical impact of this Great Recession - I cannot help feeling that , after a period of robust recovery , that deficit might look less " structural " than it appears to be at present .
This minority view is born of long experience of the vagaries of public finance .
And it begs the question , because for a variety of familiar reasons , " economic growth " may be a more arduous process in the future .
But a credible medium - term fiscal plan will eventually be needed .
Ironically , it will be needed to impress those financial markets that have got it so spectacularly wrong , and which , in the case of banks , have been bailed out ( or can rely on being bailed out ) with public funds that contribute to the rise in the deficit - as , indeed , does that part of the recession attributable directly or indirectly to the financial crisis .
One of the reasons the Bank is so bearish about the recovery is that it knows that insufficient credit is getting through to industry .
After the feast , the famine .
There is plenty of credit getting through to the bankers themselves , however .
How lucky they are that the drip torture of the political system by the media has diverted the wrath of the nation from bankers to politicians .
And how unlucky for so many decent politicians that they have been tarred with the same brush as the minority of miscreants .
So we have a " Labour " government coming to the end of its life having achieved little on the inequality front but apparently still being too craven to take on abuses of the financial system , even when it has rescued the wretched system .
You could not make it up .
As Gore Vidal says of a world in which the financial elite are offered carrots but no sticks , it is a case of " socialism for the rich and capitalism for the rest " .
Almost all the analysts who have been helping the Queen with her inquiries into what brought about the crisis cite the distorted rewards system as one of the key factors provoking excessive risk - taking .
And here we go again .
I was particularly struck by an article on The Banking Crisis and Inequality ( World Economics January - March issue ) by Tim Lankester , a distinguished civil servant , now President of Corpus Christi College , Oxford .
He argues that the growth in inequalities of income and wealth in the US and UK in recent decades - quite apart from any moral and social aspects - itself contributed to the financial and economic crisis .
He sees the huge increase in top incomes , supplemented by massive borrowing , as having driven up property prices , which forced families on middle and lower incomes to borrow beyond their means :
" When the financial and property bubbles burst , falling prices reduced the value of collateral pledged by borrowers - thus weakening the banks ' balance sheets . "
He concludes that in capitalism 's last great crisis , in the 1970s , the problem was the declining share of profits and the rising share of wages and salaries .
In the latest crisis the problem has been that " too large a share of national income has gone to high - income earners and not enough to the lower paid " .
In other words , by kowtowing to the financial elite , policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic helped that elite to wreck the system .
And , with the intriguing exception of Mervyn King , they are kowtowing all over again .

Game theory has provided researchers in a variety of fields , from psychology to economics , an opportunity to test human behaviors under controlled conditions .
It allows big questions — are humans rational actors when money 's on the line , for example — to be tested in situations where behaviors that deviate from expectations are easy to detect .
The Ultimatum Game is one example of these experiments , and it has been used to show that humans are n't purely rational when it comes to monetary decisions , as they appear willing to make financial sacrifices in order to punish others in the name of fairness .
A paper that will appear at PNAS this week takes things a step further and shows that people will still reject unfair monetary offers , even when the only one they punish is themselves .
The basic rules of the Ultimatum Game are simple .
One person is given a stack of cash , and told to divide it between themselves and a second party .
That second party is then given the chance to accept or reject the offer ; if it 's rejected , neither of them get any money .
Clearly , any of this free money should be better than nothing , so under assumptions of strictly rational behavior , you might expect all offers to be accepted .
They 're not .
Things in the neighborhood of a 50/50 split are accepted , but as the proportions shift to where the person issuing the ultimatum tries to keep seventy percent of the total , rejections increase .
By the time they hit an 80/20 split , nearly 70 percent of the offers are rejected , even though that 20 percent of the total cash would leave the recipient better off than where they started .
It 's still possible to interpret this behavior as being rational within a social context .
A lot of human behavior , and that of other primates , seems to be focused on ensuring cooperative behavior within small groups .
The rejection of offers within the Ultimatum Game can be viewed as a form of punishment for unfair behavior .
In that light , the rejection may make sense to the degree that the immediate loss of money provides a long - term incentive for fair and cooperative behavior within a group .
Rational economic behavior is restored .
The new paper pretty much blows that explanation out of the water by testing individuals using a couple of variations of the Ultimatum Game .
In the first , which the authors term " the Impunity Game , " the person making the offer gets their share of the cash regardless of whether the offer is accepted or not .
In this game , the only consequence is the potential for guilt caused by the knowledge that an offer was rejected .
Rejection rates do drop , but they remain substantial — offers of an 80/20 split got rejected over 40 percent of the time ( down from around 70 percent ) despite the lack of real economic consequences .
To really nail things down , the authors conducted tests of a Private Impunity Game , in which the person who made the offer was n't even informed of whether it was rejected or not — they simply walked away with their share of the cash .
Here , even the nebulous hope that the person making the offer would feel pangs of guilt from its rejection was removed .
Rejection rates were essentially unchanged .
People keep rejecting offers they perceived as unfair , even if , like the proverbial tree in the forest , no one will hear their rejection .
In another hint of the nature of this response , the authors describe how a similar study was performed in which the Impunity Game was explained to participants as a series of if / then statements : " if A chooses X and B chooses Y , then A receives $ i and B receives $ j . "
Here , when subjects are forced to reason through the conditions to figure out that their rejections did n't cause any sort of financial punishment on the ones making the offer , rates or rejection were about the same as they are in the Ultimatum Game .
This suggests that people can't even be bothered to perform a rational analysis when money is on the line , much less engage in rational actions .
The lack of objective analysis is also demonstrated by a number of results that indicate that changes in the levels of hormones and neurotransmitters — testosterone , serotonin , and oxytocin , for example — can all skew the statistics by changing the average response to unfair offers .
Given the fact there 's essentially no way to provide a rational actor gloss to these results , the authors attempt to explain it through an emotional response that sounds much like a gorilla 's chest beating .
Our emotions commit us to these sorts of displays despite their irrational nature , and force us to follow through on them often enough to make sure everyone knows it 's not an idle threat .
Nine times out of 10 , the chest beating may just be a display , but is anyone willing to risk the chance that a given instance will turn out to be the exception ?
The problem with this explanation is that it adds a layer of complexity — a mechanism that ensures a degree of commitment to an emotional response — on top of what 's essentially a simple situation : people act without thinking .
Earlier this year , I attended a discussion entitled " Evolution and the Ethical Brain " in which researchers argued that our ethical decision making ( such as how to respond to unfair financial offers ) is performed by a system that operates in much the same way as those that respond to sensory input : they make snap judgments that allow us to respond quickly and get on with things .
The more elaborate ethical debates that we engage in are largely attempts at post - hoc rationalizations of our earlier decisions .
Within this perspective , the snap judgment is that an offer is unfair .
Sometimes , we can engage the post - hoc rationalization , in this case involving the economics of the situation , and override our ethical calculations .
But , in a substantial fraction of the cases , we never get the chance , as we act on our snap decisions before that process can occur .

Neuroplasticity is a relatively new concept for researchers .
Up until the 1970s , scientists held firm to the belief that once we exit childhood , our neurons are fixed and we are unable to grow any new ones , except for very select areas of the brain such as the hippocampus where memory is processed .
Since that time , new research and tools such as functional MRI have suggested that our brains are constantly being molded and shaped by our experiences , and maintain some degree of plasticity throughout life .
Indeed , the works of such pivotal researchers as Michael Merzenich , Ph.D. and William Jenkins , Ph.D. have demonstrated that our brains wish to conserve real estate , and will remap unused portions of the brain lost due to injury so that they can process different information .
As an example , if a patient lost their eye due to a traumatic accident , over time the area of the visual cortex responsible for processing that eye would convert and begin processing information for the remaining eye .
Current thinking in the field of neuroplasticity holds that our brain development is wholly dependent upon the sum of our experiences .
We all begin life as an infant with no particular skill sets or abilities to carry out tasks .
As our brains develop we steadily gain more sophisticated control of our bodies , but only in respond to challenges .
If a skill set is not required , then the brain has no need to invest any time or energy into developing a pathway for it .
Only through steady experience and repetition does our brain lay the groundwork for semi-permanent change .
As a result , when our experiences change , so do our brains .
Plasticity does not only apply to the brain , however .
In the body , our ability to adapt to new situations is equally staggering .
Evolution occurs on a micro scale with our everyday decisions , and our bodies have the capability to remake themselves to meet the demands placed upon them .
If our desire is to have a runner ’s body , then all we have to do is run .
In response to the increased physical demands of that activity , our bodies respond over time by improving cardiovascular output , trimming excess body fat , increasing lean muscle mass , and improving glycogen stores to cope with the changes .
Over a short period of time , the body can transform itself to serve its new purpose .
What lesson is to be learned from the study of plasticity ?
Human beings are very much in the driver ’s seat when it comes to our long term physiological outlook .
Even small changes in our lifestyle when applied consistently can fundamentally alter not only our way of thinking , but the actual biochemical composition of our bodies and brains .
The first question to ask is , “ Who do I want to be tomorrow ? ”

And it is extremely difficult to be free from authority - not only the authority imposed by another but also the authority of the experience which one has gathered , which is of the past , which is tradition .
And the religious mind has no beliefs ; it has no dogmas ; it moves from fact to fact , and therefore the religious mind is the scientific mind .
But the scientific mind is not the religious mind .
The religious mind includes the scientific mind , but the mind that is trained in the knowledge of science is not a religious mind .
A religious mind is concerned with the totality - not with a particular function , but with the total functioning of human existence .
The brain is concerned with a particular function ; it specializes .
It functions in specialization as a scientist , a doctor , an engineer , a musician , an artist , a writer .
It is these specialized , narrowed - down techniques that create division , not only inwardly but outwardly .
The scientist is probably regarded as the most important man required by society just now , as is the doctor .
So function becomes all - important ; and with it goes status , status being prestige .
So where there is specialization there must be contradiction and a narrowing - down , and that is the function of the brain .

Chunchun Kumar 's wound is still raw For Chunchun Kumar of Bihar 's Nawada district , it was just another evening as he lounged around at a tea stall in his village along with a friend .
But , then something happened that changed his life .
" It was 17 March of this year .
There were six of them .
When we first saw them , they were beating up the temple priest .
He was lying on the ground , they were kicking and punching him , " Kumar says .
" Then they started hitting two other men .
Then they came into the tea shop and they beat us black and blue .
Then they fired at us . "
Kumar lifts up his shirt to show a bullet mark on his abdomen .
The wound is still oozing .
The perpetrators were no ordinary criminals .
Says Kumar , " They were all policemen .
I do n't know why they were angry .
They were all drunk , they were like drunk elephants , they went on a rampage . "
The shocked villagers complained to the police authorities , and the offending policemen were suspended from duty and arrested .
' Very serious ' Additional director general of police in Bihar Anil Sinha confirmed the incident .
" Two of the policemen who were inebriated vandalised the tea shop and began firing despite protests from their other colleagues .
They were arrested and , although they have been released on bail , they are facing criminal charges . "
Kumar 's fight for justice recently brought him to the Indian capital , Delhi , where he narrated his story at India 's first National People 's Tribunal on Torture .
Activists say torture by police is rampant in India .
" The problem of torture is very serious .
Today we have around 1.8 million cases of police torture each year in India , " says Henri Tiphagne of People 's Watch , an NGO .
The police are often a law unto themselves , say campaigners Mr Tiphagne says the victims mostly are from the poorer sections of society .
" They are generally the ( low - caste ) Dalits , the tribals and the Muslims .
And torture is used by those who are in power , those who possess , the landlords and the companies who put pressure on the police to carry out torture , " Mr Tiphagne says .
Mr Anil Sinha says cases of human rights violations involving the police are " exaggerated " by activists .
" It 's a kind of stereotype being dished out by the NGOs and activists .
And because police have a bad reputation , so people take such allegations to be correct .
" We do not condone any human rights violations by police in any manner , and such cases are rare .
We have a mechanism in place to deal with such cases and penalise the guilty , " Mr Sinha says .
Shankar Sen , a retired police officer and former member of the human rights commission , says : " The policeman 's work is very complex , there are pressure on him to deliver results , the police are exposed to extraneous influences and pressures . "
But , he says , that does not condone torture .
" It 's illegal , and as a policeman I know it does n't work . "
Mr Sen admits that police torture is prevalent .
" Torture does take place , it 's very common , but it 's unacceptable .
Some allegations against the police are shocking . "
Meenakshi Ganguly of Human Rights
Watch says nearly every police station in India can be held guilty of torture .
' Arbiter of justice '
In many parts of the country , she says , the situation is so bad that people will not got to a police station to file a case fearing prosecution and retribution .
" There is this pattern of impunity .
The fact that police believe they can get away with it has added to the problem , " Ms Ganguly says .
" The greater problem is that an average policeman believes himself to be the arbiter of justice .
Instead of going to the court , he himself is delivering justice .
Arun Kumar 's mental age has been reduced to one year " The policeman is not supposed to punish the criminal , he is supposed to catch the criminal , " she says .
For the victims of torture and their families , it is a long haul .
Arun Kumar of the southern city of Bangalore was picked up by the police after his employer suspected him of having an affair with his wife .
Kumar 's parents , PP Raju and Lakshmi , say their family home was ransacked , Kumar was taken to the police station where he was beaten up and tortured for days .
Unable to bear the pain and the trauma , Kumar drank pesticides in an attempt to kill himself .
He survived , but his parents say their son's mental age has been reduced to one year - he is on medication and requires constant care .
The guilty policeman was suspended for a week , but reinstated later .
The family has a long fight ahead of them .
' Deterrence ' Says Mr Tiphagne , " A case I initiated in 1981 ended in 2007 with the dismissal of the officer .
So I have hope in Arun Kumar 's case too . "
But , he says , this long wait can be a huge deterrence for even the most determined .
Mr Tiphagne says nearly 2 million cases of torture take place in India every year " The torture at the police station ends , but the torture of institutions continues .
It 's more of a psychological and mental nature , it is very challenging .
Most people do n't have the courage to withstand that , very few survive that , " Mr Tiphagne says .
So while the victims continue to live with the trauma , most of the perpetrators get away .
They are also emboldened by the fact that India has no clear law on torture .
The country signed the UN Convention on Torture in 1997 , but even 10 years later , it has not ratified it .
" We have to change our culture .
We have to create awareness that torture is illegal .
The civil society will have to get involved , " says Meenakshi Ganguly .
" People will have to get past the fact that torture happens only to other people .
And once that happens , it will change , " she says .

A Subliminal Solution to Road Rage ?
Creator says his music hath charms to soothe the savage beast behind the wheel .
March 17 , 2009  --
" I am a safe , courteous and considerate driver ...
I remain relaxed , even in rush hour traffic . "
In the commuter 's world of gridlock , blaring horns and middle - fingered gestures , it may come as little surprise that some will soon look to these mantras to control their road rage tendencies .
What is surprising , though , is the way in which these messages are delivered .
Developers of a new CD called " DriveTime Rx , " due on shelves in April , say that these and other phrases are mixed into music on the disc in such a way that they are completely drowned out by the instrumental tracks .
But they say that even though drivers will never hear the " affirmations " being spoken , the messages will subliminally register in drivers ' minds -- and possibly lead to safer , less aggressive driving .
Researchers in the field of subliminal messages panned the idea behind the new musical offering , maintaining that there is no research yet to suggest that hiding verbal cues in music affects behavior .
" I know of no good evidence that sub-audible messages have any effect on behavior at all , " said Nicholas Epley , professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago 's Booth School of Business .
But Steven Halpern , the mind behind the 15 - track compilation , said he believes the brain is able to pick out these messages .
" The brain is able to decode and perceive information when it is upside - down , backwards and even distorted , " he said .
" In some ways , it is able to perceive information that is even below the threshold of conscious awareness . "
Reading Between the ( Traffic ) Lines
Subliminal persuasion refers to the use of messages presented to individuals beneath their threshold of awareness aimed at influencing their attitudes , decisions or actions .
By their very nature , subliminal messages are designed to be unnoticeable , flying under the radar of consciousness and setting up shop in the mind .
" The whole key is that you do n't want to hear the words , " Halpern said .
" You want to blend the words into the music . "
If , indeed , subliminal messages do work to change behavior , there could be little argument that road rage would be a good place to start .
One 1997 report by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety lists a gruesome assortment of cases of road rage gone wild .
In a case in Massachusetts in 1994 , a 54 - year - old bookkeeper shot another man dead with a crossbow after the two had antagonized each other on the Interstate for several miles .
In another , from 1996 , road rage led to a vehicular duel between two 26 - year - old drivers in the Washington , D.C. , area , which ultimately led to an accident that killed three people .
According to AAA statistics , road rage is a problem that kills or injures 1,500 people in the United States each year .
Still , Epley said most of the evidence that exists on subliminal messages deals solely with what we see , not what we hear .
" Our visual system is extremely sensitive , " he said .
" We can notice and attend to information to an excruciating degree of sensitivity . "
But he said that as humans , our ears are not as finely tuned to bring in the same wealth of information that our eyes do .
Anthony Greenwald , a professor of psychology at the University of Washington , who has conducted research in the past on subliminal self - help audiotapes , agreed that there is a dearth of similar research on such products that shows any kind of effect .
" There is a very simple message I have on this -- to determine whether something works , you do the research on it , " Greenwald said .
" It turns out that almost all the products marketed as subliminal products have not been the subject of peer - reviewed research . "
Halpern said he has tried the CD out informally on drivers in New York , Florida and Los Angeles .
He said that those who listened to the CD reported that they felt they noticed more as they drove and were more alert and aware of their fellow drivers .
But beyond this , Hapern admits , there is no conclusive scientific evidence that the CD will actually work to quell aggressive driving .
" Can you test this in a lab ?
Yes you can , but it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars that I do n't have , " he said .
But Greenwald said that anecdotal evidence from driver testimonials is " pretty much the same as no evidence at all . "
And Epley said that a double - blind , placebo - controlled test for this music could easily be done on the cheap , simply by creating a version of the songs without the subliminal content and comparing the experiences of drivers listening to either version .
" There are almost an infinite number of ways to test this , " he said .
" If there was research , it would show that this would not work . "
Greenwald , however , takes a less conclusive approach .
He said that he and other researchers in the field have " published research showing some subliminal effects , so we 're not 100 percent skeptical about the possibility . "
Drivers May Get What They Expect
Regardless of whether the subliminal content on the CDs lodges itself in the mind , both Epley and Greenwald said that those who purchase the album might still reap some of its purported benefits , thanks to what he refers to as the " expectancy effect . "
" If [ consumers ] listen to the tapes and think they contain messages that reduce road rage , they may be effective -- but only because of the expectation you have for what 's on the tape , " Epley said .
Indeed , Greenwald co-authored a 1991 study in the Journal of the American Psychological Society that seems to back up this idea .
In a study of 237 people who listened to tapes that supposedly contained subliminal messages designed to enhance either memory or self - esteem , all of the subjects who listened to the tapes after seeing their labels reported improvements in these areas -- what the researchers termed a non-specific placebo effect .
Plus , Epley added , " Calming or soothing music can calm people down without any sub-audible signals at all .
...
You should n't delude yourself into thinking that whatever help you 're getting from this particular method is from the subliminal content . "
However , Halpern said sub -par subliminal audio products in the past have " perpetuated the message that all subliminals are a hoax . "
Specifically , he said , some companies in the 1980s sold tapes that they claimed contained helpful subliminal messages , when , in fact , they did not .
" Just because one company was a sham does not mean all companies were a sham , " he said .
The DriveTime Rx CD will join about a dozen other titles Halpern has mixed with subliminal message - laced tracks .
A spokesperson for Inner Peace Music , the company that sells Halpern 's CDs , said the titles have racked up about 750,000 sales so far .
Best - sellers have been a CD that Halpern said would help accelerate learning , and another aimed at helping people achieve an ideal weight .
And then there is one that he said should never be slipped into your car 's stereo .
" The one that helps you go to sleep , you should never listen to while driving , " he said .

“ If Democrats push a health bill through the Senate using budget reconciliation procedures , the bill would lack Republican support and would lack the support of key constituencies  certainly the business community , ” said E. Neil Trautwein , a vice president of the National Retail Federation , a trade group .
“ Health care reform would crater for this year . ”
House Democrats say the Republican protests are overheated .
The fast - track procedures have been used 19 times since 1980 to pass major legislation , including much of President Ronald Reagan ’s domestic policy agenda in 1981 , welfare overhaul in 1996 and President George W. Bush ’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 .
The committee chairmen writing the Senate health bill , Max Baucus of Montana and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , both Democrats , have been assiduously courting business groups and labor unions , consumer groups , doctors , hospital executives and other health care providers .
Those groups  eager for a seat at the table , eager to sound constructive  have been remarkably restrained so far .
They have held back in their criticism of proposals being seriously considered by Congress and the White House .
But the strains are beginning to show .
Labor leaders have conveyed their concern about taxing health benefits to Mr. Baucus in the strongest possible terms .
Employers have warned Congress against requiring them to provide any specific amount of insurance .
Steven Kreisberg , director of collective bargaining and health care policy at the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , said : “ We absolutely oppose a change in the tax treatment of employee health benefits .
It would endanger the current employer - based health care system at a time when we are trying to sustain it . ”
Helen Darling , president of the National Business Group on Health , said , “ Most of our members are big employers , and they offer health benefits , but they do not like an employer mandate . ”
If the government specifies a minimum package of benefits , Ms. Darling said , it could quickly become more comprehensive , without any significant cost controls .
Many lawmakers have promised to give all Americans access to the same health insurance they have as members of Congress .
But the package of benefits available to Congress and other federal employees is more generous and more costly than what many private employers offer .
A while back I read Christophe Rhodes 's paper “ SBCL : A Sanely - Bootstrappable Common Lisp ” which describes SBCL 's bootstrap procedures .
The paper includes a bunch of diagrams for each build stage .
These were pretty helpful in improving my understanding of the build process .
So , I tried to take them a step further and create a single diagram that provides a global overview of the build process :
I 'm interested in hearing any comments you might have .
If you already know how the build process works , does it make you cringe ?
If you are vaguely familiar with ( parts of ) the process , does it provide you with some sort of new insight ?
Given that I have n't included a legend , does it make any sense at all ?
Welcome Traveler !
Geocaching has been around for a while now however as technological advances occur , the way in which we geocache evolves as well .
We ’ve gone from basic log books and sharing cache locations in web forums to being able to utilize GPS to find the caches others hide for us .
What is Geocaching ?
Geocaching is the outdoor social movement of placing objects in miscellaneous areas around the world for others to find .
Sometimes this occurs in more urban areas , other times some of the most rural places you can imagine .
I actually found a geocache in rural Idaho up the Selway River ! was crazy to see all the others who have found it there and where they ’ve come from .
If you ’re looking for more detail on what Geocaching is , I ’d recommend checking out the book the Complete Idiot ’s Guide to Geocaching .
It provide a simple overview and lets you know what you need to get started .
Or if you ’re not into reading here is a short Geocache Documentary DVD on the sport .
GoGeocaching has a great video to introduce you to the topic as well .
Where did Geocaching Start ?
The first documented placement of a GPS - located cache was placed by Dave Ulmer of Beavercreek , Oregon in 2000 .
The location was posted online and by May 6 , 2000 , it had been found twice and logged once .
According to Dave Ulmer ’s message , this cache was a black plastic bucket partially buried containing software , videos , books , food , money , and a slingshot .
There is now a plaque called the Original Stash Tribute Plaque at the site .
According to GeoCache ’s website there are now over 1.4 million caches hidden around the world !
A far progression since 2000 .
What am I Looking For ?
Geocaching has evolved over the years to include a wide range of caches and missions .
It started with simple placement of items in waterproof containters such as ammo cans , with various trinkets in them that you would exchange for your own .
To accompany these items left in the containers you would sign a logbook sharing your experience finding the cache .
Since these traditional caches , many other types have been introduced including virtual , puzzle , earth , and many others .
I ’ll describe the various types in a later post .
I honestly would n’t be surprised if eventually drones are brought into the sport of geocaching more and more frequently for harder to reach locations as this site points out ( Best Personal Drones ) .
Does this seem like a sport you ’d be into ?
If so read along to learn more about Geocaching , the supplies used , and where to get them !
One of the interesting things about being a scientist is seeing how unexpected observations can galvanize the community into looking at a problem in a different way than before .
A good example of this is the unexpectedly low Arctic sea ice minimum in 2007 and the near - repeat in 2008 .
What was unexpected was not the long term decline of summer ice ( this has long been a robust prediction ) , but the size of 2007 and 2008 decreases which were much larger than any model had hinted at .
This model - data mismatch raises a number of obvious questions – were the data reliable ?
are the models missing some key physics ?
is the comparison being done appropriately ?
– and some less obvious ones – to what extent is the summer sea ice minimum even predictable ?
what is the role of pre-conditioning from the previous year vs. the stochastic nature of the weather patterns in any particular summer ?
The concentration of polar expertise on the last couple of questions has increased enormously in the last couple of years , and the summer minimum of 2009 will be a good test of some of the ideas that are being discussed .
The point is that whether 2009 is or is not a record - setting or near - record setting minimum , the science behind what happens is going to be a lot more interesting than the September headline .
In the wake of the 2007 minimum , a lot of energy went in to discussing what this meant for 2008 .
Had the Arctic moved into a different regime where such minima would become normal or was this an outlier caused by exceptional weather patterns ?
Actually this is a bit of false dichotomy since they are n’t exclusive .
Exceptional patterns of winds are always going to be the proximate cause of any extreme ice extent , but the regime provides a background upon which those patterns act .
For instance , in the paper by Nghiem et al , they showed the influence of wind patterns in moving a lot of thick ice out of the Arctic in early 2007 , but also showed that similar patterns had not had the same impact in other years with higher background amounts of ice .
This ‘ background ’ influence implies that there might indeed be the possibility of forecasting the sea ice minimum a few months ahead of time .
And anytime there is the potential to make and test predictions in seasonal forecasting , scientists usually jump at the chance .
So it proved for 2008 .
Some forecasting efforts were organised through the SEARCH group of polar researchers , and I am aware of at least two informal betting pools that were set up .
Another group of forecasts can be found from the Arctic ice forecasting center at the University of Colorado .
I personally do n’t think that the intrinsic worth of a successful prediction of overall sea ice extent or area is that societally relevant – interest in open shipping lanes that might be commercially important need much more fine - grained information for instance – but I think the predictions are interesting for improving understanding of Arctic processes themselves ( and hopefully that improved understanding will eventually feed into the models and provide better tests and targets for their simulations ) .
What was particularly interesting about last years forecasts was the vast range of forecasting strategies .
Some were just expert guestimates , some people used linear regression on past data , some were simply based on persistence , or persistence of the trend .
In more mature forecasting endeavours , the methods tend to be more clustered around one or two proven strategies , but in this case the background work is still underway .
Estimates made in June 2008 for the September minimum extent showed a wide range – from around 2.9 to 5.6 M km2 .
One of the lowest estimates assumed that the key criteria was the survivability of first year ice .
If one took that to be a fixed percentage based on past behaviour , then because there was so much first year ice around in early 2008 , the minimum would be very low ( see also Drobot et al , 2008 ) .
This turned out not to be a great approach – much more first year ice survived than was predicted by this method .
The key difference was the much greater amount of first year ice there was near the pole .
Some of the higher values assumed a simple reversion to trend ( i.e. extrapolation forward from the long - term trend to 2008 ) .
Only a couple of the forecasts used physics - based models to make the prediction ( for instance , Zhang et al , 2008 ) .
This is somewhat surprising until one realises how much work is needed to do this properly .
You need real time data to initialise the models , you need to do multiple realisations to average over any sensitivity to the weather , and even then you might not get a range of values that was tight enough to provide useful information .
So how did people do ?
The actual 2008 September minimum was 4.7 M km2 , which was close to the median of the June forecasts ( 4.4 M km2 ) – and remember that the 2007 minimum was 4.3 M km2 .
However , the spread was quite wide .
The best estimates used both numerical models and statistical predictors ( for instance the amount of ice thicker than 1 m ) .
But have these approaches matured this time around ?
In this year ’s June outlook , there is significantly more clustering around the median , and a smaller spread ( 3.2 to 5.0 M km2 ) than last year .
As with last year , the lowest forecast is based on a low survivability criteria for first year ice and I expect that this ( as with last year ) will not pan out – things have changed too much for previous decades ’ statistical fits on this metric to be applicable .
However , the group with the low forecast have put in a ‘ less aggressive ’ forecast ( 4.7 M km2 ) which is right at the median .
That would be equal to last year ’s minimum , but not a new record .
It would still be well below the sea ice trend expected by the IPCC AR4 models ( Stroeve et al , 2008 ) .
There is an obvious excitement related to how this will pan out , but it ’s important that the thrill of getting a prediction right does n’t translate into actually wanting the situation to get worse .
Arctic ice cover is not just a number , but rather a metric of a profound and disruptive change in an important ecosystem and element of the climate .
While it does n’t look at all likely , the best outcome would be for all the estimates to be too low .

Humans project their own emotions onto dogs , researchers found That " guilty look " on a dog's face is all in the imagination of the human owner , suggests research .
Dog owners have often claimed they can read the expressions of their pets - particularly that tell - tale look when they have done something wrong .
But researchers at a New York college tricked owners into thinking innocent pets had misbehaved - with the owners still claiming to see this guilty look .
The study found that the expression had no relation to the dogs ' behaviour .
And researchers found that pet owners ' belief that they could read their dogs ' " body language " was often entirely unfounded .
Stolen treats
The study from Alexandra Horowitz , assistant professor at Barnard College in New York , showed that owners were projecting human values onto their pets .
GUILTY LOOKS ?
Your guilty dog pictures The One Show 's dogs in hats
The research , Canine Behaviour and Cognition , looked at how dog owners interpreted their pets ' expressions , when they believed that the dog had stolen and eaten a forbidden treat .
In a series of tests , owners were sometimes given accurate and sometimes false information about whether their dog had stolen the treat .
But the research , published in Behavioural Processes , found that owners ' interpretations of whether their dog looked guilty bore no reliable link with whether the dog had really stolen the treat .
When the owners had been told their dog had misbehaved , they saw this guilty expression , even when the dog had not really done anything wrong .
Where there was any change in the dogs ' expression , it was seen to be a subsequent reflection of the human 's emotions .
If an owner thought the dog had misbehaved and then told the dog off , some dogs showed an " admonished " look , which humans then misunderstood as an admission of guilt .
The dogs which were most likely to " look guilty " , according to their owners , were those who were entirely innocent and had then been told off by owners who believed that they had stolen treats .
Researchers concluded that any such " guilty look " is a response to human behaviour and has no relation with the dog 's actions or sense of having broken any rules .

April 8 , 2009 ( PARIS ) —
Darfur rebel groups slammed the Sudanese President ’s call for reconciliation in Darfur and asked him to cooperate with international justice .
People living in Kalma camp , one of the biggest internally displaced camps of Darfur , hold up a sign in protest , ( file photo June 2005 )
President Omer Hassan Al - Bashir – who is wanted by the International Criminal Court – pledged yesterday in a speech delivered in Zalingei , West Darfur , to investigate and prosecute those who committed war crimes in the region .
However , he said that trials and compensations can only be commenced after reconciliation is achieved .
Ahmed Hussein Adam , the spokesperson of the rebel Justice and Equality Movement downplayed Bashir ’s offer saying such statement are " nonsense " because they had been repeated in the past but never been implemented .
Abdelwahid Al - Nur , the leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement added that tribal reconciliation is a process well known by Darfur people to settle traditional conflicts but " genocide and crimes against humanity committed by the regime should be tried by the ICC because they were committed by the government . "
" What Bashir says is irrelevant " said Al - Nur .
The SLM founder also stressed that the first thing Khartoum should start with is to disarm its militia and then they could speak about reconciliation or compensation .
He pointed out that nobody can return to his homeland or village without the disarmament of militia , because " the Janjaweed will attack them to collect their compensations even if so - called reconciliation conferences are held . "
Adam also said that Bashir launches such promises just to avoid international pressure after the ICC decision .
He stressed that justice is part and parcel of the peace process .
The Sudanese government has mobilized local militias and conducted counter - insurgency campaigns in Darfur since 2003 .
According to the UN , some 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 displaced as a result of this repression .
On March 4 , the ICC pre-trial chamber issued an arrest warrant for the Sudanese president on war crimes and crimes against humanity .
The government immediately retaliated by ordering some 13 international non-governmental organizations out of the country .
The two rebel officials said Bashir has to reverse his decision and allow the return of the expelled aid groups .
They pointed to the critical situation created by the eviction of the aid groups and deplored the international lack of action in this regard .
Adam stressed that these ousted groups are administrating 60 % of the international aid to the Darfur people while Al - Nur underscored the need for water and health service saying that Darfur needs more aid groups because the camps are receiving news waves of IDPs .
The UN humanitarian official , Ameera Haq last month said that the government and UN partners are working to cover gaps .
However she stressed that the " risks of increased morbidity and mortality are high . "
Haq underlined the need for concrete plans in order to bridge the gaps in the coming weeks .
The Sudanese government said at different times since March 4 , that its decision is irreversible .
Also the Sudanese president Omer Al - Bashir said he intends to “ sudanize ” the humanitarian activities by the end of the year .

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Iran 's Guardian Council spokesman Abbasali Kadkhodai said the council will set up a special commission to draft a report on the June 12 presidential election , local ISNA news agency reported on Friday .
" The Guardian Council decided to set up a special commission , including political and social figures and representatives of candidates who protest ( vote results ) , to draft a report on the election , " Kadkhodai was quoted as saying .
" The recount of 10 percent vote will be done in the presence of the commission , " he said , " and the result will be published for the public . "
" We have invited candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi to introduce their representatives for the commission within 24 hours , " Kadkhodai said , " and we hope there will be no ambiguity over the election . "
He added that the partial recount of vote will be done in the presence of media .
The official IRNA news agency earlier quoted Kadkhodai as saying that the 10th presidential election on June 12 was the healthiest one held in the country since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
" After 10 days of investigation , no major irregularities were found besides some minor ones that are usual in every election , " Kadkhodai said , " we did n't see any fraud in the election . "
Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday accepted the Guardian Council 's request to extend by five days the deadline for the investigation into the complaints over vote irregularities .
In a letter to the supreme leader , the election watchdog has asked for more time to remove any ambiguity over the disputed election .
On June 13 , Iran 's Interior Minister Sadeq Mahsouli said incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won 62.63 percent of the total ballots , while his main rival Mir-Hossein Mousavi got 33.75 percent .
After the official declaration , all the three defeated candidates filed complaints over irregularities in the election , while Mousavi and former Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karroubi have demanded an annulment of the election .
Mousavi 's supporters have participated in massive rallies in Tehran and other cities over the past days .
Khamenei called for calm and patience last Friday and ruled out any vote rigging in the recent presidential election .

Of course , it is not wrong to be snuggled up next to his mother .
This picture is recognized the world over as one of the most tender scenes .
But when the baby insists on getting up through the night , the mother will not get her rest .
The mother sometimes hands the baby over to the father .
They both start losing sleep .
In order to avoid confrontation or out of just plain ignorance , some parents resort to having their child sleep with them .
This leads to other problems .
When problems are avoided instead of being resolved , greater troubles are created .
If the parent is not careful to discern these cries , the child is able to learn to manipulate his or her parents .
The baby , for example , likes the warmth of his mother .
If he cries , then he is rewarded by being picked up and held close to his warm , soft Mom - maybe he will even get an extra snack !
My wife says that a baby has several kinds of cries : a hungry cry , a distressed ( hurting ) cry , a dirty diaper cry , a stunned cry and then the " I want my own way " cry .
All would agree that a baby should be loved and cared for .
The wise mother learns early on that some cries are for legitimate needs while others are used to control and manipulate .
At only a few weeks old , the baby will already assert his or her will by crying .
Making loud noises with tears is the only ability the baby really has control of .
The tendency to control the environment through crying , in order to please their own desires , is the first expression of a child 's sinful nature .
The earlier a parent starts training the child , the better .
We should think about training as something that is always going on .
From our child 's earliest days , we will always be training them one way or another .
If we establish our routines early on , then we can have a relatively peaceful and quiet home , a home where parents have wonderful relationships with their child .
They tell them to do something , " Come here " but allow the child to run the other way sometimes , even thinking it is ' cute ' .
Disobedience is never cute .
Every time the parents are inconsistent , they send a mixed message to their child .
Inconsistency in making them obey communicates that obedience is not that important .
So the child disobeys more .
This in turn causes more disobedience , more chastisement and a longer time to train the child .
The caring parent can avoid this by being absolutely consistent .
Be true to your word .
Mean what you say and say what you men .
It might help the parent to view this ' half - baked ' child training as disobedience training .
Many parents fight against the idea that a child must always obey his parents .
Or somehow they do not understand it is an obedience issue .
Perhaps they think that they love the child by tolerating his bad behavior .
They think that somehow this pressure will hurt the child .
In fact , the opposite is true .
Let 's assume that almost all parents will instruct their child in some things .
Most parents are unsuccessful in training because they are inconsistent ; they do n't always carry through to compel their child to obey each instruction or command that they give .
Self - control or self - discipline is developed by lots of repetitive training .
The most important area to tackle first is the child 's response to his parent 's word or instruction .
When the parent speaks , the child should obey .
If we start when our babies are but tiny little infants , they will know no other alternative .
This resolves much of the parents and child 's frustration .
In any case , the training takes time and repetition .
In the last chapter we looked at several important general principles for how to train our children .
In this chapter we will look specific training steps , illustrated by example .
We will also develop routines and schedules and show how they all support and reinforce one another .
In order to effectively develop self - control in our children , we need to set up good routines and develop a flexible schedule .
We must take the time and initiative to train them to comply with the routine .
The repetition of routines goes a long way toward building up confidence , experience and acceptance of what needs to be done in life .
The very patterns that they are familiar with will become the same patterns that they will naturally adopt for their own , as they get older .
The heart of the issue is " Who is leading whom ? "
Either we will train our children to be self - controlled or we will train them to be demanding and self - centered .
We can ask a different set of questions to help us see this more clearly .
Is the child setting the schedule and demanding things go his own way ?
Or is the parent , ( appointed by God ) leading the child , setting the daily routine ?
Do you as a parent require that your child conform to your desires ?
Or do you allow him to rule your time with his desires ?
He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty , And he who rules his spirit , than he who captures a city .
( Proverbs 16:32 )
A city that is broken into and without walls is a man who has no control over his spirit .
( Proverbs 25:28 )
Self - control is all important .
If a person lacks self - control in only one area of his life it can bring his marriage or family down .
Whether it is gambling , immorality , anger or stealing , any of these areas that are out of control will control him .
Destruction follows .
King Solomon 's willingness to disobey
God in the one area of sensuality caused the kingdom to be torn in two .
Two verses in scripture remind us of that of self - control is essential .
Once there was a world famous king .
He had everything he could ever have asked for .
He had power ; he even had peace .
On top of all that he was a profound philosopher known for his writings and wise sayings .
People took tours from around the world just to see how great his kingdom was .
There was just one problem .
Although he excelled in just about everything , there was one area he did n't master .
The downfall of his kingdom came within the next generation just because he did n't exercise self - control in that one area .
Application :
When we put our children in the playpen or some contained area , do they fuss and fuss until you take them out ?
Our children should be content wherever we put them .
Yes , they do go through certain testing times , but on the whole , they learn to be satisfied with wherever their parents put them , whether it be the playpen , potty , room or car seat .
There might be an initial fuss , but it should diminish in less than two minutes .
When you put your child in the high chair to eat , do they cry and fuss until you have to take them out and hold them ?
Or even worse you do n't even try to put them in the chair any more .
You are avoiding the scene that occurred when you put him in the chair in the past .
Our young children should know how to contentedly play by themselves .
This does n't happen automatically .
They have to be trained that way .
So many people have come up to us and said that your children are naturally quiet .
They think it is just the way we are .
They do n't understand all the hard work to get them to be that way !
Application : Does your child exhibit the self - control necessary to play contentedly by himself ?
What can we expect from our toddlers ?
Let us mention a few things .
You can expand your own list .
Pause for Reflection :
Does your child whine or complain ?
First examine your own life for a complaining spirit .
Plead with God that He would give you joy in your heart instead !
Then think : " How am I rewarding my child by giving him what he wants when he makes complaints or demands . "
" Do I reward his whining , crying or screaming ? "
If the parent does not train the child , then the child effectively trains the parent to meet his every wish and desire !
I passed by the field of the sluggard , And by the vineyard of the man lacking sense ;
And behold , it was completely overgrown with thistles , Its surface was covered with nettles , And its stone wall was broken down .
( Proverbs 24:30 - 34 )
Parents are always training their children !
Whenever we do not deliberately train our child , bad and frustrating habits always occur .
It is like a neglected garden where little weeds become large plants that choke out the good plants .
The child needs to respect his parents by honoring the parents ' schedule and purposes .
Of course , the schedule should be made with the child 's needs in mind .
We must help the child obey God by honoring his parents .
Consistency by the parents will make it easy for them ( and us too ) .
Do n't make exceptions .
Every exception exponentially increases the difficulty in training the child .
A child says , " I want to watch that certain program . "
Parent responds , " Not today . "
The child protests , " But I want to watch it !!! "
The parent calmly reminds the child , " You know that anytime you shout at daddy or mommy , you will not get what you want .
If you ask again , then you will not be able to watch it tomorrow either . "
As we deal with older children , we should recognize that crying , complaining and whining are plants from the same seed of discontent and demand , the seed of self - centeredness .
Their demands for attention should not be rewarded .
They should never get what they demand .
If the child fusses when asking , they should never get that item ; otherwise , we are training them that whining gets results and they will use whining more .
With a regular ' feed , awake and sleep ' routine , the parent is more easily able to discern the precious baby 's cries and appropriately respond to them .
What should we do , then , when the baby is fine , not sick , not hungry , no dirty diaper , etc. but still cries ?
We need to allow the baby to cry .
By allowing the baby to cry , the baby learns that his desires are not the most important matter in the world .
Other people are more important than the baby 's demand .
They can learn to wait or even suspend such desires .
What are the results ?
Inside : Does n't touch ' valuables '
Children must learn early in life to respect the property of others .
We should not need to child proof our homes by removing our valuables .
They know their child does not have the necessary self - control to keep from pulling over the plant or breaking the beautiful vase .
They can be trained not to touch certain things .
Application :
Have you removed things from your living room because you did not want your child to break them ?
Outside : Remains where told
When we send our child outside , we need to know that he will do what we will tell him .
We have a front porch , a walk by our house in our yard , a sidewalk and then the street .
Depending upon the age , we train our child to obey us to stay within those certain boundaries .
Application :
Do you find that you need to accompany your child everywhere to keep him or her safe ?
Let me give you an example .
When my little Rebekah was about 15 months she came to play in my office / study .
She sees lots of interesting things going on in the hallway : Siblings playing , lots of coming and going etc .
She wants to go chase after them but she stays in the study playing .
She will stay by the door and watch but will not go beyond the boundary into the hallway .
I let her open and close the door .
I do n't need to keep it shut to keep her in .
We do n't use a gate either .
I can still get work done because she has built in rules ( self - control ) that govern her .
I do n't need to be her police force keeping an eye on her .
How does it work ?
Two simple things are functioning when a child has self - control .
(1) She is content to play by herself .
She is willing to be by herself and amuse herself .
We have a supply of toys in the study for her use .
She likes the mundane little container or a pencil and a piece of paper .
Experienced parents know this !
But she will play with these things for a long time .
Not only 5 minutes but until it is dinner time .
She has been playing for an hour in my study while I write this article on self - control .
She plays around with the different toys and books in my study .
I do n't have to entertain her .
She entertains herself .
(2) She governs herself according to the rules .
She constrains herself to go by the rules .
She is only 15 months old , but she will not go through that door unless I give permission or someone comes to get her .
She knows the rules .
What are the rules ?
The most important one is not to go out the doorway , but there are many others .
I need to clarify some of them .
Sometimes she will come by and touch my computer mouse or something on my desk .
I have not set rules for some of these things .
If it is there temporarily , I just move it out of reach .
But if it is one of my many books or keyboard , I instruct her , " No , no . "
Sometimes to emphasize it I need only to clap my hands two times .
She does often pout and cry for about 15 seconds but then goes and play with other things .
You might think she is a super - passive child .
This would be a very wrong conclusion !
She is our child and we think she is special as all parents would think of their own sweet child .
Our point is rather that your child can do these things just as well .
Ours are not worse or better just trained .
Every child can be trained .
Let us look at the specific steps for how to establish these built - in controls in all of our children .
C. Specific Steps for Training
Let us start with a certain scenario .
Upon reaching the toddler stage , a child is mobile and instantly introduced to new fields of exploration .
Our situations are different in some ways , but they are very similar .
For example , we have a living room woodstove that heats the house and runs very hot 24 hours a day on cold days .
This is not a simple fireplace that is constructed in the wall .
It protrudes out into the living room by about four feet including the hearth .
What would you do ?
Your child is just starting to crawl .
You foresee the danger .
Some people would put up gates to divide their living room .
We would need a fifteen - foot gate !
Others might stop using the woodstove altogether .
This would be safe but not to our liking .
After all , how long will it be before the child learns not to touch the woodstove ?
Other ideas are ineffective .
A child only needs to pull over a vase or touch a woodstove once to make a lot of damage .
Let 's tell you how to resolve this problem that eventually confronts every family .
The woodstove is only one example .
Substitute your own precious thing for the woodstove .
Linda was clever .
The woodstove is a dangerous thing to small hands .
The boundary had to be broader for safety 's sake .
We hardly wanted her to face such dire consequences during training .
Training includes correcting failure .
We needed a more neutral boundary .
She chose to have our baby stay off the small rug in front of the hearth .
She pointed out the curve of the rug to our child and then instructed her not to go on the rug or even touch .
She pointed and said , " No . "
She had a tiny stick and would tap her on her hand if she even touched the rug .
She then would remove the baby 's hand from the rug .
Do notice that she needed to stay with the child for the first couple days of training .
You know what would happen once Mom turned her head , do n't you ?
The child would look at that rug and crawl back over toward it .
At that point Linda would repeat the command " No , do n't touch . "
Sometimes Rebekah would stop and crawl away .
Sometimes she got a sting on her hand for touching .
But once Mom responds consistently , the child soon learns that it always a bad idea to touch that rug .
After that , she did n't touch the rug .
Our stove was red hot , but she would not go near the rug .
Those were her crawling days .
What about when she walks ?
What happened ?
In the same way she carefully avoids the hearthrug and the whole woodstove area .
She applied the same lesson on self - control to when she was walking .
Since she was trained from early on , she knew what ' No ' meant .
Words were not enough , however to counter her desires .
We just need to connect the most gentle swat from a tiny switch ( branch ) on her hand with the word , " No . '
And of course we would remove her hand to where it should be .
She would fuss and cry not because it hurt but because she was prevented from carrying out her will .
In this way , the word ' no ' was associated with the slight discomfort of the switch .
After doing this in a number of settings , we would no longer need to use the switch but simply say ' no . '
She would still have the same " I do n't like this ! " kind of cry , but would humble herself , and do what she was suppose to do .
Let 's summarize these points with a chart .
We are asking , " What should you do when your young child starts crawling and then walking ? "
We will list five steps of training .
We need to be proactive rather than reactive .
Proactive allows us to calmly strategize and plan .
Reactive usually implies shouting , yelling or even screaming .
" No , do n't do that !!! "
" Did n't I tell you before ! ! "
Once the child can crawl , evaluate the whole room .
What will be off limits ?
Notice those things that might be dangerous or could easily break .
The parent needs to decide and then make rules for those areas .
The child will need to be instructed for each rule .
With the switch in hand , clearly state " No " and show them what they are not to touch .
Once the pattern of training is done several times , it is easier to train in other situations .
This proactive search will be repeatedly used as we visit friends , stores or church .
Children will learn at home and apply it elsewhere .
When we take the child to a new place or they are mobile , we need to remind them that the boundaries are similar to the boundaries at home .
In the above scenario , we chose to make the rug off limits rather than just the hearth .
The older children know that the rug is okay if one is careful .
That is fine with us .
This is where we first trained her when she became mobile .
We knew she would test us .
If there is a vase on a tall table , we should make the table off limits , perhaps even the area .
We just need to make sure the child can understand what is wrong and right .
In my study , the boundary is quite obvious - different carpet in the study and hall .
We can use masking tape or even lay a rod on the carpet at the boundary .
If we are going to make boundaries , then we are also deciding to enforce them` .
Inconsistency says that the boundary is only a boundary some of the time .
Although we have specifically stated these steps already , let us summarize them .
We need to rehearse them until we no longer say to ourselves , " I do n't know what to do ! "
We need to consistently train our child .
If we do keep them doing the right thing ninety percent of the time , it is not enough .
The child will then in the future struggle much more with the parent because they know they can get their own way ten percent of the time .
So the heightened struggle occurs one hundred percent of the time .
5 ) Enforce : How can we make resistance counterproductive ?
Never give what they fuss for .
In fact , make it counterproductive .
This means that they actually lose out from whining , rebelling or just having an attitude about some rule .
We often just tell the child that they cannot do what they are wrongly asking for not only today but also the next day .
General training Principles
Have good routine and schedule
Have a good routine .
In this way the child and parent will learn what is normal .
The parent can then see more quickly when something is wrong .
We will discuss this more later in the session .
Start very early in life
By the time a baby is staying awake a little longer , give him time to be by himself not entertained or held by grandma .
This goes for sleeping too .
Do n't bring the baby into bed with you except for fun .
This also applies to his wake time .
If there is nothing needed , allow the baby to cry a bit .
Sometimes they are overtired and need to cry it out a bit .
The earlier we start , the easier it will be for the child and ourselves .
A tap with a little switch or branch will train the child .
Their wills will be trained earlier on so that they will more quickly obey .
The parent does not need to be frustrated and feel like giving up .
Join in family activities ( e.g. pray )
Have the baby and young child join in a daily prayer time with the family if he is awake .
One of us usually holds the baby in our lap and holds his hands in prayer .
If the child is not yet sitting by himself , we simply hold the baby or have him nearby .
Even our two year old attends the main session of our home school !
And yes , of course we have moderated expectations .
Train what not to touch / do or go
As the baby grows , there are things that he should not bite , hold or touch .
We do our best not to tempt the child , but sometimes a rule is in order .
When the child is doing some inappropriate action , we usually highlight the action ( point to it ) and gently say , " No , no . "
As we take it away , the child knows what is happening .
The child learns that there are things they desire but can't have .
There are places they would like to go , but are not allowed to .
They learn this important lesson of life .
This is where patience is developed .
" No , no "
This sets up a special verbal clue as to what they cannot do .
They will associate the tap of the rod with our words , which they hear .
Eventually , they will quickly respond just to our verbal clue .
Slight tap .
The slight tap refers to taking a little straight branch off the tree , making it smooth and gently tapping him .
If he is reaching for things that he is not suppose to touch , we tap his hand .
If he goes where he should n't , we tap his foot .
If he sits where he should n't ( like on his brother 's hand ) , then we tap his bottom .
Make him return it .
If a child takes something , they should know they are responsible to put it back .
If we teach them early on , this can be like a game .
" Where does it go ? " the parent teasingly asks the child .
The child puts the book back and the parent praises the child 's right response .
Other consequences .
The parents must make sure that negative consequence for doing the wrong thing outweighs the pleasure of getting what he wants .
If the child learn that it will not be profitable , then they will give it up .
The more consistent parents are in their training , the quicker their children will learn these things .
Let 's give a few real life examples .
Getting in a High Chair
A little girl gave her Mom trouble about getting in her high chair for supper .
She fussed and squirmed when Mom tried to sit her down .
She wanted to sit in a big chair .
It would have been easier to allow her to sit in the big chair , but there would be a lost opportunity for training .
That would be the end of the highchair .
Mom got her little stick ( a switch is a small young branch ) .
When the young daughter saw it , she quietly sat down as if nothing unusual had happened .
Mom did not use it on her .
Once she saw the stick , she without doubt knew Mom was serious and gave up her ' testy ' spirit .
Putting on a Nice Hat
Once we tried to put a fancy coat and hat , that someone had given us , on our daughter .
We wanted to put it on her .
Our child thought it best to wear her jacket instead .
She fussed but was willing for us to help her put the coat on .
Her siblings were saying how nice the coat and hat looked , but it did n't make any difference for the hat .
She would not accept it .
She pulled it off ( this happened on the way out the door to church ) .
In my heart I knew that if we gave in here to her wishes , we would have problems from here on .
We went to get the switch , and she quickly complied not only to wearing the hat but also leaving it on .
Even more importantly is that her testy rebellious spirit instantly changed into a compliant and cheerful spirit .
Summary
Rules and limits are demonstrations of love .
If we do n't teach our children self - control , then we are creating a child who will constantly run into conflict with authority .
There will be times when the child goes through stages of challenging the rules .
This often happens when they become aware of other ways of doing things like when they become conscious of their own wills ( two - year olds ) or see a friend get away with something .
Those who have not properly trained their children often end up calling them troublesome toddlers .
( We do n't allow name calling in our home ) .
Although it might seem that we have failed , the opposite is true .
Just carefully affirm your rules .
Discipline him ( more on this at a later time ) .
Endure a bit more crying and fussing , and the child will return to the former compliant attitude .
He will apologize , and of course we will forgive .
All is restored .
We have blended truth with grace .
The child is happy again !
Pause for Reflection :
We are humbled by how much we have failed our Lord and most of our children by not having trained our children from the beginning when it does n't hurt so much .
" Please God , forgive us .
But now help us be consistent that so that we can minimize ' extra ' grief to our children .
Amen . "
The earlier we start , the easier it is for everyone involved .
D. Setting up Childhood Routines
A routine is a group of regularly performed specific activities .
Children need to be trained to do each of these behaviors .
Self - control is cultivated by having a good routine from the very earliest baby days .
Routine sets the stage for good habits to be formed and is the context in which self - control can flourish .
If there is no routine , the baby or child will not know what to expect .
He will then see this as an opportunity to get his way and indulge his desires .
Having a routine is essential to training .
What do we mean by routine ?
Routines occur when we carry out activities in a same and timely manner .
For instance , from the very first time you sit him / her in the high chair , you always say , " Time to eat .
Let 's get in your chair . "
This is instruction .
Then cheerfully sit him down and always buckle him in even if he fusses , squirms or you think he does n't like it .
Do it anyways .
If you always do the same thing in the same order , he will know no difference and will accept this as the way we do things .
God has routines in nature too .
We see the sun , night , stars and moon all perform their duties .
They change at times but the process is the same .
During the winter the sun goes down earlier .
The sun , however , still goes down .
The shadows creep in .
People and animals go to sleep .
The process just starts earlier .
Seasons include a variety of events .
One comes , the other goes .
There will be times when the child will balk .
Do n't ever give him what he wants .
If he fusses , balks , cries or whines , still do what the routine demands .
If he knows you will always be consistent , he will get past his fussing .
Do n't change the routine .
He is trying to get his own way against yours .
Parents must decide what is right .
Once we make an exception , we have just made things much more difficult .
Be consistent .
There are a myriad of things that ought to be included in a child 's routine .
Routine is established with the child 's needs in mind .
Routines change as a baby / child grows .
Always introduce the next routine with pleasant words and tone of voice .
A tired child will be glad for a nap if it is associated with pleasant words and calm routine .
If you have neglected a certain routine , and the baby / child has been dictating what you do in regards to feeding time , sleep time , play time , etc. , you need to take back the authority you gave away .
Decide what you want with his needs in mind and take steps of getting into a routine .
Here are some areas that need routine :
Potty training is perfected by routine .
Good eating habits
Proper sleeping habits
Obedience is assisted by routines
The above chart highlights the many routines that are necessary to help the child know what his role is .
If routines are initiated when the baby is tiny , they do n't know any differently and the absence of struggle is noticeable .
They accept " This is the way we do it in our family " .
Breakdown of Routines
We need to remember that every routine is made up of a number of individual components .
Note the ' Rise and Shine ' or waking routine .
Wake up ( How does one wake up ?
Self , alarm , be called ? )
Get up ( How much time to actually get out of bed ? )
Make Bed ( Making the bed to Mom 's satisfaction ) .
Dress ( Putting on the right clothes the right way ) .
Put away clothes ( Putting away bed clothes and dirty laundry ) .
Hygiene ( Toilet ( mini- routine ) , brush teeth , hair , wash ) .
Each of the routines can be broken into their specific tasks .
A routine will go smoothly when the child is trained in each specific set of tasks .
Our children , for example , get upset if they do n't brush their teeth .
Sometimes the training process takes a while .
Brushing the teeth routine includes : going to the bathroom when told , reaching the brush , getting a small cup of water , wetting the brush a bit , putting a tiny bit of toothpaste on the brush , putting the tube back covered , brushing correctly , spitting out the toothpaste , taking a little drink of water , rinsing off the toothbrush , putting the toothbrush away in its proper place , putting cup back and leave the room for what is next .
The parent shows the child by explaining things and encouraging the child 's ability to do it .
The parent will do it for the child for a while until the child seems to be able to do it on his own .
The child then takes over while being supervised .
Self - control is fully implemented when the child does the specific task , and later the whole routine without any parental observation .
Points of Frustration
When you feel frustrated , you probably have either discovered a task within a routine that is not being rightly done or a missing routine .
Training is required .
For example , what happens to coats , boots and hats when your child arrives home ?
If you find yourself upset about where they end up , then you need to train them more effectively .
It would be helpful to review the whole routine ( coming home routine ) and each task that you want completed .
This will help you more clearly see what tasks are needed and the overall purpose of the ' coming home ' routine .
Remember , a parental attitude of joy and patience along with firmness is important to gaining a child 's co-operation .
No one wants to be around a grouch , including your child .
Routines are tools not masters
It is easy to see our routines as our end goal to happy parenting .
This approach will cause difficulty .
God has placed the parents in charge rather than some set of routines .
Routines serve parents and children .
God set parents in charge because they have the wisdom to discern God 's goals and make the necessary adjustments .
We have discovered good routines enable parents to have more flexibility when needed .
This Friday we have an evening Thanksgiving service .
Because our children go to bed at regular times , does this mean we should not go to the service ?
Not at all .
We might add a nap to their day or plan to let them sleep a little later the next day , but it is important to be with God 's people celebrating God 's goodness .
That is more important .
So we adjust to God 's schedule .
There will be times that it is impossible for them to attend ( because of sickness , conflict , etc. ) , but it should not be because we want to strictly keep some routine .
We need to allow God 's will to govern our lives .
We make adjustments and the children see that we make the Lord 's way a priority .
They learn that they also should make Him a priority .
E. Children 's Daily Schedule
A mother can easily get overwhelmed with the many things to do during a day .
Having a good schedule greatly clarifies her goals and helps her keep attentive when interruptions occur .
A daily schedule includes a combination of routines .
We might have nine regular routines such as getting up , eating lunch , etc. throughout each day and several irregular ones depending on what day of the week it is .
We might want to include going shopping or visiting a friend .
The schedule helps put things in order so that parent and child know where they are headed .
This schedule is an example of one we use for our home - school children .
It is not exact .
As children get older , their school days extend well into the afternoon .
Our older children keep their own schedules .
At times we need to make sure we are working with each other such as in giving rides or having family devotions .
They , however , have their own routine .
7:30 Rise & shine : Wake Up ( Get up , make bed , dress , put away clothes , hygiene )
8:00 Family devotions at breakfast table : Devotions ( Assemble , pray , sing , scripture )
8 -9 Breakfast ( Eat , do assigned jobs )
9 - 12 School ( joint and separate )
Noon Lunch ( arrive , eat , do assigned jobs )
1:00 Nap routine
2:00 Computer time
2:30 - 5 Friends / library / play
5:00 Pick up designated areas / PBS Tv or video
5:30 Set table ( assigned )
6:00 Supper ( arrive , eat , do assigned jobs )
7:20 Bed routine ( Dress , hygiene , pick up )
7:45 Family Devotions ( Assemble , sing , scripture , pray )
8:15 Rebekah to bed
8:30 Benjamin , Kathryn , Isaac to bed
8:45 Daniel to bed
9:15 Allison to bed
Build in flexibility .
We remind our children that just because we regularly do a certain activity it does not mean that we will always do it this way .
Children will try to insist on the authority of the schedule rather than the parent .
We need to make clear that the parents are always in charge and can change things if they so desire .
Job Routines
My wife keeps a small whiteboard in the kitchen entrance where daily jobs are added on to the above schedule .
This is the ' Who does what board . '
This way she does not need to hear the famous , " But I did n't hear you " excuse .
She does n't have to tell anyone .
We simply train them to read the board .
The above is the semi - fixed school day schedule .
There are many other things not mentioned in it .
Dad and Mom also have schedules .
Parents do not rotate around the child 's schedule , but the child around the parents .
This helps simplify life .
Of course , as the children grow older they will have more activities , and these can seem to dominate things .
We have purposed to keep life simple .
Sports and entertainment
Some parents feel compelled to give their child every opportunity that comes around .
Soon sports , classes and entertainment - activities ( seeing movies , parties ) have almost suffocated family life .
The family ends up never being together except to escort the child to the next activity .
Our suggestion is to purposely build a home - based family .
Our children can get their exercise riding a bike around the neighborhood .
A sports team is too demanding .
As a pastor I am humbled at the many parents who involve themselves and their children in regular sports activities on the Lord 's Day .
" Yea , my son has a match .
I ca n't make it to church . "
I wonder if they know that they are training their child in a secular mindset .
It is more important to please the coach than to worship God ?
The father needs to decide what is appropriate for his family .
He is accountable to the Lord Almighty .
May
God help us make wise decisions rather than follow the pathway of the world .
Summary
God has given us the tools we need to train our children to do the right thing even when we are not around .
We do not need to accompany our children everywhere .
( It 's a good thing with eight children ! )
By training , routines and schedules they pretty much operate as we wish without much fuss .
Like a technician , we identify the routine and the different elements that we want accomplished , we spot the problem , add training and the routine is up and running .
This enables our children to accomplish what we see is best .
This kind of training , along with time scheduling , provides us with plenty of time to do what we need to do at work and at home .
We also allocate time to be with our children and just enjoy them .
Dad might take them to the park .
Mom might bake a special desert .
We focus on developing a relationship with them rather than ' always ' criticizing them for things they are not doing right .
Parenting Principles
You ’re a coalition of multinational corporations .
Imagine this deal : Invest $ 1 in lobbying .
Get a return on investment of $ 220 .
Save $ 100 billion on taxes , too .
Nice , eh ?
That ’s the conclusion of three University of Kansas professors who undertook an empirical analysis of the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 to study rates of return for money spent on lobbying , reported The Washington Post in an April 12 story by Dan Eggen .
This law — this shady excuse for a law with a name only charlatans could love — allowed companies that had earned profits overseas to inexpensively bring that money back into the States .
The customary tax rate on such profits was 35 percent .
But this elegantly named process — repatriation of profits — gave companies a one - time chance four years ago to haul the money home , paying only 5.25 percent .
The act was a tax holiday sought by a coalition of companies , primarily big pharmaceutical and high - technology corporations , all because they sought to pay little or no taxes on profits generated overseas — and they concocted a successful scheme to pull it off .
Mr. Eggen summarized the Kansas professors ’ study :
The largest recipients of tax breaks were concentrated in the pharmaceutical and technology fields , including Pfizer , Merck , Hewlett Packard , Johnson & Johnson and IBM .
Pfizer alone repatriated $ 37 billion , representing 70 percent of its revenue in 2004 , the study found .
The now - beleaguered financial industry also benefited from the provision , including Citigroup , J.P. Morgan Chase , Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch , all of which have since received tens of billions of dollars in federal bailout money .
[ emphasis added ]
Critics argued that the act would benefit multinational corporations to the detriment of domestic firms , reported Jonathan Weisman of the Post in August 2005 .
Even the Bush White House was dubious over the alleged economic benefits of the bill :
“ There will be some stimulative effect because it pumps money into the economy , ” said Phillip L. Swagel , a former chief of staff on President Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisers , which had opposed the tax holiday .
“ But you might as well have taken a helicopter over 90210 [ Beverly Hills ] and pushed the money out the door .
That would have stimulated the economy as well . ”
In 2006 , Washington Post business columnist Allan Sloan wrote of Ford Motor Co. ’s abuse of the misnamed act :
It ’s almost enough to make you laugh — bitterly , of course .
Here was Ford Motor Co. announcing yesterday that it had cut 10,000 jobs last year and that it will cut up to 30,000 more .
But shedding jobs at muscle - car acceleration rates did n’t stop Ford from pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars courtesy of the American Jobs Creation Act. … Hello ?
How can you simultaneously cut jobs and benefit from the American Jobs Creation Act ?
Welcome to the wonderful world of Washington nomenclature .
[ emphasis added ]
Mr. Sloan estimated that Ford saved $ 850 million in taxes , not the $ 250 million the company suggested in its press release .
So how did corporations that do n’t believe in paying their appropriate share of taxes finagle this ?
Here ’s one story , as reported by Mr. Eggen :
The provision was championed in part by the Homeland Investment Coalition , a group of companies and trade associations that was formed to push for the repatriation holiday .
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) , one of the disbanded coalition ’s members , said in a statement Friday that “ repatriation of profits provided a new source of investment for American companies . ”
“ PhRMA supported the legislation four years ago as part of a broad business coalition because of the additional economic benefits the bill would provide , ” senior vice president Ken Johnson said .
“ It meant jobs and skilled training for American workers , as well as a shot in the arm for local economies . ” [ emphasis added ]
This coalition of multinationals had worked on getting its profits home earlier — and falsely articulated its intent regarding jobs .
In 2003 , seeking support for the then - named Invest in the U.S.A .
Act of 2003 , the coalition sent a letter to Sen.
Chuck Grassley , chair of the Senate Finance Committee , and Sen. Max Baucus , ranking member .
The letter said that “ The $ 135 billion currently offshore that would be invested in America would benefit the U.S. economy by increasing domestic investment in plant , equipment , R&D and job creation ” among other benefits , including investments in emerging technologies , funding for pension plans hurt by stock market declines , and , especially :
“ [ i ] mproving the long term financial strength of U.S. - based companies by reducing domestic debt loads , strengthening corporate balance sheets , and lowering corporate bond rates ; increasing dividends to shareholders ( which can be productively redeployed ) ; and raising equity market valuations by increasing funds available for share repurchases . ”
Parse it any way you wish — creating jobs was the intended political cover for any member of Congress to sign on as a co-sponsor of the legislation .
But did the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 actually lead to a net gain in jobs ?
Nope .
Did it provide “ a new source of investment for American companies ” ?
Not even close .
And supporters of this tax holiday tried to get another such tax break .
Reported Mr. Eggen :
… the Congressional Research Service and others have since found that many companies cut jobs in the wake of the tax break and that nearly all the money was used for stock buybacks or dividends .
Supporters failed in a bid to include a similar tax break in this year ’s stimulus legislation , and a Senate subcommittee has launched an investigation into how companies used their tax savings under the 2004 program .
[ emphasis added ]
Any congressional investigation lags reporting by The New York Times by four years .
An August 2005 Times editorial said :
A month ago , Hewlett - Packard announced it would lay off 14,500 workers by November 2006 .
Meanwhile , the company is about to repatriate $ 14.5 billion in profits it has in overseas accounts at a measly tax of 5.25 percent — an 85 percent discount off the normal corporate rate .
The cut -rate repatriation , offered by Congress to American companies that bring profits held in foreign lands home in 2005 , was sold to the public as a one - shot deal to generate cash for new hiring .
But as its critics warned , the tax cut is functioning instead as a handout for America ’s most profitable companies .
Hewlett is just one example .
Normally , the tax on a $ 14.5 billion repatriation would be about $ 5 billion .
Because of the bargain rate in 2005 , Hewlett expects to pay roughly $ 800 million .
Hewlett also expects its layoffs to cost the company about $ 1 billion .
Thus , in Hewlett ’s case , the tax holiday has not only failed to create jobs , but has also more than covered the cost of cutting workers from the payroll .
Dozens of other companies are also bringing billions home with no mention of new hiring .
[ emphasis added ]
Drug companies especially needed to bring the overseas profits home — but not , as the act ’s name suggests , to create jobs .
They had big financial problems looming .
Patents on brand - name drugs worth billions in sales were about to expire , leading to competition by companies producing generic versions .
Upcoming patent expirations for [ Pfizer ] include Lipitor in 2011 , ‘ the little blue pill ’ Viagra in 2012 , and the allergy medicine Zyrtec in 2012 as well .
The loss of these patents would see Pfizer losing more than $ 14 billion in revenue .
[ emphasis added ]
During the last six months of 2004 , as the bill was manuevered successfully through Congress , the stock prices of drug companies were falling , in part because of scandals over the safety of drugs that had long been approved by the FDA .
For example , government regulators said Merck & Co. ’s arthritis drug Vioxx may have led to more than 27,000 heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths before it was pulled from the market in October 2004 .
That happened just two weeks before the American Jobs Creation Act was signed into law by President Bush .
Merck badly needed its overseas profits , if only to deal with what might be a litigation bill of $ 10 billion to $ 15 billion .
Merck , like other companies , also had developed what Motley Fool columnist Robert Steyer in February called
a version of Pfizer ’s “ Lipitor disease ” — a best - selling drug with limited remaining patent life accounting for a huge percentage of revenue :
• Merck lost protection on Fosamax early last year .
• Merck is seeing protection disappear by 2012 on the two drugs that made up 40 percent of revenue through the first nine months of 2008 — Cozaar / Hyzaar and Singulair .
• Bristol - Myers ’ Plavix , creating 27 percent of 2008 revenue , gets chopped in 2011 .
• Lilly ’s Zyprexa , bringing in 23 percent of last year ’s revenue , is also done for in 2011 .
Big Pharma knew long before 2004 it needed to get every last dollar of overseas profits back into the States — at the lowest tax rate possible .
It had to shore up declining revenues and dividends to stockholders — and to fuel big mergers , which it saw as the best cure for Lipitor disease .
But job creation ?
Merely a fig leaf for public consumption to make this tax holiday palatable to politicians .
Jobs were lost , not created .
By August 2007 , as the AP graphic shows , pharmaceutical companies had announced thousands of jobs cuts just two years after the repatriation of overseas profits .
Four years ago , Mr. Weisman of the Post reported others were lining up at the tax - break trough :
Procter & Gamble Co. intends to bring home $ 10.7 billion , and Johnson & Johnson Inc. has an $ 11 billion plan .
Schering - Plough Corp. could bring back $ 9 billion .
This week , Hewlett - Packard Co. announced it will repatriate $ 14.5 billion in the second half of the year , mainly for “ strategic acquisitions , ” said Ryan Donovan , an HP spokesman .
Strategic acquisitions made possible by a jobs creation act ?
More than 800 companies took advantage of the tax break .
Here ’s another way to examine passage of the 2004 act .
Cui bono politically ?
Apparently , the congressional sponsor and 40 co-sponsors did .
Let ’s look at how just one member of the coalition — the pharmaceutical industry — sought to influence members of Congress through donations to their campaigns .
The Ways and Means Committee , by constitutional fiat , is the chief tax - writing committee of the House of Representatives .
The 2004 bill was primarily a creation of the House .
Former congressman Bill Thomas ( R - Calif ) served as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee during the run-up to the bill ’s passage .
He ’s listed as the prime House sponsor of the American Jobs Creation Act .
During his congressional career , the pharmaceutical industry gave his campaign more than $ 407,000 .
The bill had 40 sponsors .
All but one were Republicans .
A review of the campaign contributions records of these 40 men and women aggregated by the Center for Responsive Politics showed that since 1998 , the pharmaceutical industry has given their campaign committees $ 4.49 million .
Of those 40 co-sponsors , 14 served on the Ways and Means Committee :
They have received , since 1998 , $ 2.5 million from Big Pharma .
Recall that , thanks to the act ’s tax break , Pfizer repatriated $ 37 billion .
Former Rep. Nancy L. Johnson , Democrat of Connecticut ( where drug - maker Pfizer has a significant research and development presence ) , received more than $ 692,000 from Big Pharma between 1998 and her departure from office .
She is now a senior public policy adviser ( er , lobbyist ) for Baker , Donelson , Bearman , Caldwell & Berkowitz and serves on the Pfizer U.S. Health Advisory Board .
The bill had no serious opposition in Congress .
The Senate voted 69 - 17 on the bill ; The House , 207 - 16 .
Their acquiesance allowed an average rate of return of 22,000 percent for the corporations who lobbied for this bill , say the Kansas professors .
If $ 1 invested in lobbying earns a $ 220 return , as the Kansas study suggests , then the pharmaceutical industry has invested , for the 41 sponsors and co-sponsors of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 , about $ 4.5 million .
That ’s a return of $ 990 million .
That ’s pretty good ROI for buying only 7 percent of the members of Congress .

Memoization takes a function and gives back a semantically equivalent function that reuses rather than recomputes when applied to the same argument more than once .
Variations include not - quite - equivalence due to added strictness , and replacing value equality with pointer equality .
Memoization is often packaged up polymorphically :
memo :: (??? ) => ( k -> v ) -> ( k -> v)
For pointer - based ( “ lazy ” ) memoization , the type constraint ( “ ??? ” ) is empty .
For equality - based memoization , we ’d need at least Eq k , and probably Ord k or HasTrie k for efficient lookup ( in a finite map or a possibly infinite memo trie ) .
Although memo is polymorphic , its argument is a monomorphic function .
Implementations that use maps or tries exploit that monomorphism in that they use a type like Map k v or Trie k v .
Each map or trie is built around a particular ( monomorphic ) type of keys .
That is , a single map or trie does not mix keys of different types .
Now I find myself wanting to memoize polymorphic functions , and I do n’t know how to do it .
Flavors of polymorphism
If a recursively defined function f is polymorphic , then the recursion may still be monomorphic .
That is , recursive calls may be restricted to the same type instance as the parent call .
Most recursive polymorphic functions fit this form , because most polymorphic recursive data types are “ regular ” , meaning that a polymorphic data type is included in itself only at the same type instance .
For instance , the usual polymorphic lists and trees are regular .
Example : GADTs
Among other places , non-regular , or “ nested data types ” arise in statically typed encodings of typed languages .
For instance , here ’s a GADT ( generalized algebraic data type ) for typed lambda calculus expressions :
-- Variables data V a = V String ( Type a ) -- Expressions data E :: * -> * where Lit :: a -> E a -- literal Var :: V a -> E a -- variable ( :^ ) :: E ( a -> b ) -> E a -> E b -- application Lam :: V a -> E b -> E ( a -> b ) -- abstraction
The Type type is sort of like TypeRep , except that it is statically typed .
data Type :: * -> * where Bool :: Type Bool Float :: Type Float ... (:*:) :: Type a -> Type b ->
Type ( a , b ) ( :->:) :: Type a -> Type b -> Type ( a -> b)
These GADTs ( E and Type ) are both non-regular , and so recursive functions over them will involve more than one argument type .
So how can we memoize ?
A first try
Let ’s consider a specific case of polymorphic functions :
type k :--> v = ∀ a .
HasType a => k a -> v a
HasType is to Typeable as Type is to TypeRep .
The memo implementation I ’m playing with relies on HasType .
The memoizer can have type
memo :: ( k :--> v ) -> ( k :--> v)
which uses rank 2 polymorphism ( because of the argument type ’s ∀ , which cannot be moved to the outside ) .
My implementation of memo is similar to the discussion in Stretching the storage manager : weak pointers and stable names in Haskell , but modernized a bit and adapted for polymorphism .
It uses an IntMap of lists of pairs of stable names ( akin to pointers ) for arguments and values for results .
The idea is to first use hashStableName to get an Int to use as an IntMap key , and then linearly traverse the resulting list of binding pairs , comparing stable keys for equality .
( StableName has Eq but not Ord .)
Although hashStableName can map different stable names to the same hash value , collisions are rare , so the StableBind lists rarely have more than one element and the linear search is cheap .
type SM k v = I.IntMap [ StableBind k v] --
Stable map data StableBind k v = ∀ a .
HasType a => SB ( StableName ( k a ) ) ( v a )
The reason for hiding the type parameter a in StableName is so that different bindings can be for different types .
The key tricky bit is managing static typing while searching for a particular StableName a in a [ StableBind ] .
Here ’s my implementation :
blookup :: ∀ k v a .
HasType a => StableName ( k a ) -> [ StableBind k v ] ->
Maybe ( v a ) blookup stk = look where look :: [ StableBind k v ] ->
Maybe ( v a ) look [ ] =
Nothing look ( SB stk ' v : binds ' ) | Just Refl <- tya `tyEq` typeOf2 stk ' , stk == stk ' =
Just v | otherwise = look binds ' tya ::
Type a tya = typeT
The crucial magic bit is
tyEq :: Type a -> Type b ->
Maybe ( a := : b)
where a := : b represents a proof that the types a and b are the same type .
The proof type has a simple GADT representation :
data (:=:) :: * -> * -> * where Refl :: a := : a
This simple type definition ensures that only valid type - equality proofs can exist .
Well , except for ⊥ .
The guard ’s pattern match with Just Refl will force evaluation , so that ⊥ ca n’t sneak by us .
That match also informs the type - checker that stk and stk ' are stable names of the same type in that clause , which then makes stk == stk ' be well - typed , and makes Just v have the required type , i.e. , Maybe ( v a ) .
Finally , the typeOf2 function is a simple helper that peels off two type constructors and extracts a Type :
typeOf2 :: HasType a => g ( f a ) ->
Type a
Wishing for more
The type of memo above is too restrictive for my uses .
It only handles polymorphic functions of type k a -> v a , and only with the single constraint HasType a .
The reason I want lazy memoization now is that I ’m compressing expressions to maximize representation sharing , as John Hughes described in Lazy Memo- functions .
Once sharing is maximized , pointer - based memoization works better , because equal values are pointer - equal .
To compress an expression , simply use a memoized copy function , as John suggested .
compress :: HasType a => E a ->
E a compress e = mcopy e where mcopy , copy :: HasType b => E b -> E b --
Memo version mcopy = memo copy -- Copier , with memo - copied components copy ( u :^ v ) = appM ( mcopy u ) ( mcopy v ) copy ( Lam v b ) = lamM v ( mcopy b ) copy e = e -- memoized constructors appM :: ( HasType a , HasType b ) => E ( a -> b ) -> E a -> E b appM = memo2 ( :^ ) lamM :: ( HasType a , HasType b ) => V a -> E b -> E ( a -> b ) lamM = memo2 Lam
The memo2 function is defined in terms of memo , using some some newtype trickery .
Its type :
memo2 :: HasType a => ( k a -> l a -> v a ) -> ( k a -> l a -> v a )
But , sigh , the ( :^ ) and Lam constructors I ’m trying to memoize do not have the required types .
My higher - order - polymorphic memo functions do not have flexible enough types .
And this is where I ’m stuck .
I ’d appreciate your ideas and suggestions .
Memoization takes a function and gives back a semantically equivalent function that reuses rather than recomputes when applied to the same argument more than once .
Variations include not - quite - equivalence due to ...

This past week was the United States Society for Ecological Economics bi-annual conference ( at American University near Washington DC ) .
Herman Daly was honored for his many and longstanding contributions .
He also gave an amazing speech which he has graciously allowed us to reproduce as a guest post on theoildrum .
In it he outlines 10 prescriptions for changing the course of our current socio- economic system , along the lines of the steady state themes he has been writing about for decades .
I feel like keeping it on our main page for a week straight - it is n't perfect ( nothing is ) , but these are the concepts that should be percolating among our nations / worlds decision - makers - please read it and pass it on .
I sincerely hope ideas like these will soon be acknowledged not only as mainstream but as urgent - in the opinion of many it is past time for Herman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics ....
From a Failed Growth Economy to a Steady - State Economy
USSEE lecture , June 1 , 2009
Herman E. Daly
School of Public Policy
University of Maryland
A steady - state economy is incompatible with continuous growth — either positive or negative growth .
The goal of a steady state is to sustain a constant , sufficient stock of real wealth and people for a long time .
A downward spiral of negative growth , a depression such as we are entering now , is a failed growth economy , not a steady - state economy .
Halting an accelerating downward spiral is necessary , but is not the same thing as resuming continuous positive growth .
The growth economy now fails in two ways : ( 1 ) positive growth becomes uneconomic in our full - world economy ; ( 2 ) negative growth , resulting from the bursting of financial bubbles inflated beyond physical limits , though temporarily necessary , soon becomes self - destructive .
That leaves a non-growing or steady - state economy as the only long run alternative .
The level of physical wealth that the biosphere can sustain in a steady state may well be below the present level .
The fact that recent efforts at growth have resulted mainly in bubbles suggests that this is so .
Nevertheless , current policies all aim for the full re-establishment of the growth economy .
No one denies that our problems would be easier to solve if we were richer .
The question is , does growth any longer make us richer , or is it now making us poorer ?
I will spend a few more minutes cursing the darkness of growth , but will then try to light ten little candles along the path to a steady state .
Some advise me to forget the darkness and focus on the policy candles .
But I find that without a dark background the light of my little candles is not visible in the false dawn projected by the economists , whose campaigning optimism never gives hope a chance to emerge from the shadows .
We have many problems ( poverty , unemployment , environmental destruction , budget deficit , trade deficit , bailouts , bankruptcy , foreclosures , etc. ) , but apparently only one solution : economic growth , or as the pundits now like to say , “ to grow the economy ” -- as if it were a potted plant with healing leaves , like aloe vera or marijuana .
But let us stop right there and ask two questions that all students should put to their economics professors .
First , there is a deep theorem in mathematics that says when something grows it gets bigger !
So , when the economy grows it too gets bigger .
How big can the economy be , Professor ?
How big is it now ?
How big should it be ?
Have economists ever considered these questions ?
And most pointedly , what makes them think that growth ( i.e. , physical expansion of the economic subsystem into the finite containing biosphere ) , is not already increasing environmental and social costs faster than production benefits , thereby becoming uneconomic growth , making us poorer , not richer ?
After all , real GDP , the measure of “ economic ” growth so - called , does not separate costs from benefits , but conflates them as “ economic ” activity .
How would we know when growth became uneconomic ?
Remedial and defensive activity becomes ever greater as we grow from an “ empty - world ” to a “ full - world ” economy , characterized by congestion , interference , displacement , depletion and pollution .
The defensive expenditures induced by these negatives are all added to GDP , not subtracted .
Be prepared , students , for some hand waving , throat clearing , and subject changing .
But do n’t be bluffed .
Second question ; do you then , Professor , see growth as a continuing process , desirable in itself -- or as a temporary process required to reach a sufficient level of wealth which would thereafter be maintained more or less in a steady state ?
At least 99 % of modern neoclassical economists hold the growth forever view .
We have to go back to John Stuart Mill and the earlier Classical Economists to find serious treatment of the idea of a non-growing economy , the Stationary State .
What makes modern economists so sure that the Classical Economists were wrong ?
Just dropping history of economic thought from the curriculum is not a refutation !
Here are some reasons to think that the Classical Economists are right .
A long run norm of continuous growth could make sense , only if one of the three following conditions were true :
( a ) if the economy were not an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing biophysical system ,
( b ) if the economy were growing in a non physical dimension , or
( c ) if the laws of thermodynamics did not hold .
Let us consider each of these three logical alternatives .
( If you can think of a fourth one let me know . )
( a) Some economists in fact think of nature as the set of extractive subsectors of the economy ( forests , fisheries , mines , wells , pastures , and even agriculture …. ) .
The economy , not the ecosystem or biosphere , is seen as the whole ; nature is a collection of parts .
If the economy is the whole then it is not a part of any larger thing or system that might restrain its expansion .
If some extractive natural subsector gets scarce we will just substitute other sectors for it and growth of the whole economy will continue , not into any restraining biospheric envelope , but into sidereal space presumably full of resource - bearing asteroids and friendly highly - evolved aliens eager to teach us how to grow forever into their territory .
Sources and sinks are considered infinite .
( b) Some economists say that what is growing in economic growth is value , and value is not reducible to physical units .
The latter is true of course , but that does not mean that value is independent of physics !
After all , value is price times quantity , and quantity is always basically physical .
Even services are always the service of something or somebody for some time period , and people who render services have to eat .
The value unit of GDP is not dollars , but dollar ’s worth .
A dollar ’s worth of gasoline is a physical amount , currently about half a gallon .
The aggregation of the dollar ’s worth amounts of many different physical commodities ( GDP ) does not abolish the physicality of the measure even though the aggregate can no longer be expressed in physical units .
True , $ /q x q = $ .
But the fact that q cancels out mathematically does not mean that the aggregate measure , “ dollars ’ worth ” , is just a pile of dollars .
And it does n’t help to speak instead of “ value added ” ( by labor and capital ) because we must ask , to what is the value added ?
And the answer is natural resources , low - entropy matter / energy — not fairy dust or frog ’s hair !
Development ( squeezing more welfare from the same throughput of resources ) is a good thing .
Growth ( pushing more resources through a physically larger economy ) is the problem .
Limiting quantitative growth is the way to force qualitative development .
( c) If resources could be created out of nothing , and wastes could be annihilated into nothing , then we could have an ever - growing resource throughput by which to fuel the continuous growth of the economy .
But the first law of thermodynamics says NO .
Or if we could just recycle the same matter and energy through the economy faster and faster we could keep growth going .
The circular flow diagram of all economics principles texts unfortunately comes very close to affirming this .
But the second law of thermodynamics says NO .
So — if we can’t grow our way out of all problems , then maybe we should reconsider the logic and virtues of non-growth , the steady - state economy .
Why this refusal by neoclassical economists both to face common sense , and to reconsider the ideas of the early Classical Economists ?
I think the answer is distressingly simple .
Without growth the only way to cure poverty is by sharing .
But redistribution is anathema .
Without growth to push the hoped for demographic transition , the only way to cure overpopulation is by population control .
A second anathema .
Without growth the only way to increase funds to invest in environmental repair is by reducing current consumption .
Anathema number three .
Three anathemas and you are damned — go to hell !
And without growth how will we build up arsenals to protect democracy ( and remaining petroleum reserves ) ?
How will we go to Mars and Saturn and “ conquer ” space ?
Where can technical progress come from if not from unintended spin - offs from the military and from space research ?
Gnostic techno - fantasies of escaping earth to outer space , and of abolishing disease and death itself , feed on the perpetual growth myth of no limits .
Digital - brained tekkies , who have never heard of the problem of evil , see heaven on earth ( eternal growth ) just around the corner .
Without growth we must face the difficult religious task of finding a different god to worship .
Too scary , we say , let ’s try to grow some more instead !
Let ’s jump - start the GDP and the Dow - Jones !
Let ’s build another tower of Babel with obfuscating technical terms like sub - prime mortgage , derivative , securitized investment vehicle , collateralized debt obligation , credit default swap , “ toxic ” assets , and insider slang like the “ dead cat bounce ” .
( If you drop it from a high enough tower of Babel even a dead cat will bounce enough to make some profit . )
Well , let us not do that .
Let us ignore the anathemas and instead think about what policies would be required to move to a steady - state economy .
They are a bit radical by present standards , but not as insanely unrealistic as any of the three alternatives for validating continuous growth , just discussed .
________________________________________________________________________________________________
Let us look briefly at ten specific policy proposals for moving to a steady - state economy , i.e. , an economy that maintains a constant metabolic flow of resources from depletion to pollution — a throughput that is within the assimilative and regenerative capacities of the ecosystem .
1. Cap-auction - trade systems for basic resources .
Caps limit biophysical scale by quotas on depletion or pollution , whichever is more limiting .
Auctioning the quotas captures scarcity rents for equitable redistribution .
Trade allows efficient allocation to highest uses .
This policy has the advantage of transparency .
There is a limit to the amount and rate of depletion and pollution that the economy can be allowed to impose on the ecosystem .
Caps are quotas , limits to the throughput of basic resources , especially fossil fuels .
The quota usually should be applied at the input end because depletion is more spatially concentrated than pollution and hence easier to monitor .
Also the higher price of basic resources will induce their more economical use at each upstream stage of production .
It may be that the effective limit in use of a resource comes from the pollution it causes rather than from depletion — no matter , we indirectly limit pollution by restricting depletion of the resource that ultimately is converted into wastes .
Limiting barrels , tons , and cubic feet of carbon fuels extracted will limit tons of CO2 emitted .
This scale limit serves the goal of biophysical sustainability .
Ownership of the quotas is initially public — the government auctions them to the individuals and firms .
The revenues go to the treasury and are used to replace regressive taxes , such as the payroll tax , and to reduce income tax on the lowest incomes .
Once purchased at auction the quotas can be freely bought and sold by third parties , just as can the resources whose rate of depletion they limit .
The trading allows efficient allocation ; the auction serves just distribution , and the cap serves the goal of sustainable scale .
The same logic can be applied to limiting the off - take from fisheries and forests .
2. Ecological tax reform — shift tax base from value added ( labor and capital ) and on to “ that to which value is added ” , namely the entropic throughput of resources extracted from nature ( depletion ) , and returned to nature ( pollution ) .
This internalizes external costs as well as raises revenue more equitably .
It prices the scarce but previously un-priced contribution of nature .
Value added is something we want to encourage , so stop taxing it .
Depletion and pollution are things we want to discourage , so tax them .
Ecological tax reform can be an alternative or a supplement to cap - auction - trade systems .
3 . Limit the range of inequality in income distribution — a minimum income and a maximum income .
Without aggregate growth poverty reduction requires redistribution .
Complete equality is unfair ; unlimited inequality is unfair .
Seek fair limits to the range of inequality .
The civil service , the military , and the university manage with a range of inequality of a factor of 15 or 20 .
Corporate America has a range of 500 or more .
Many industrial nations are below 25 .
Could we not limit the range to , say , 100 , and see how it works ?
People who have reached the limit could either work for nothing at the margin if they enjoy their work , or devote their extra time to hobbies or public service .
The demand left unmet by those at the top will be filled by those who are below the maximum .
A sense of community necessary for democracy is hard to maintain across the vast income differences current in the US .
Rich and poor separated by a factor of 500 become almost different species .
The main justification for such differences has been that they stimulate growth , which will one day make everyone rich .
This may have had superficial plausibility in an empty world , but in our full world it is a fairy tale .
4 . Free up the length of the working day , week , and year — allow greater option for part - time or personal work .
Full - time external employment for all is hard to provide without growth .
Other industrial countries have much longer vacations and maternity leaves than the US .
For the Classical Economists the length of the working day was a key variable by which the worker ( self - employed yeoman or artisan ) balanced the marginal disutility of labor with the marginal utility of income and of leisure so as to maximize enjoyment of life .
Under industrialism the length of the working day became a parameter rather than a variable ( and for Karl Marx was the key determinant of the rate of exploitation ) .
We need to make it more of a variable subject to choice by the worker .
And we should stop biasing the labor–leisure choice by advertising to stimulate more consumption and more labor to pay for it .
Advertising should no longer be treated as a tax deductible ordinary expense of production .
5 . Re-regulate international commerce — move away from free trade , free capital mobility and globalization , adopt compensating tariffs to protect , not inefficient firms , but efficient national policies of cost internalization from standards - lowering competition .
We cannot integrate with the global economy and at the same time have higher wages , environmental standards , and social safety nets than the rest of the world .
Trade and capital mobility must be balanced and fair , not deregulated or “ free ” .
Tariffs are also a good source of revenue that could substitute for other taxes .
6.Downgrade the IMF - WB - WTO to something like Keynes ’ original plan for a multilateral payments clearing union , charging penalty rates on surplus as well as deficit balances — seek balance on current account , and thereby avoid large foreign debts and capital account transfers .
For example , under Keynes ’ plan the US would pay a penalty charge to the clearing union for its large deficit with the rest of the world , and China would also pay a similar penalty for its surplus .
Both sides of the imbalance would be pressured to balance their current accounts by financial penalties , and if need be by exchange rate adjustments relative to the clearing account unit , called the bancor by Keynes .
The bancor would serve as world reserve currency , a privilege that should not be enjoyed by any national currency .
The IMF preaches free trade based on comparative advantage , and has done so for a long time .
More recently the IMF - WB - WTO have started preaching the gospel of globalization , which , in addition to free trade , means free capital mobility internationally .
The classical comparative advantage argument , however , explicitly assumes international capital immobility !
When confronted with this contradiction the IMF waves its hands , suggests that you might be a xenophobe , and changes the subject .
The IMF - WB - WTO contradict themselves in service to the interests of transnational corporations .
International capital mobility , coupled with free trade , allows corporations to escape from national regulation in the public interest , playing one nation off against another .
Since there is no global government they are in effect uncontrolled .
The nearest thing we have to a global government ( IMF - WB - WTO ) has shown no interest in regulating transnational capital for the common good .
7 . Move away from fractional reserve banking toward a system of 100 % reserve requirements .
This would put control of the money supply and seigniorage in hands of the government rather than private banks , which would no longer be able to create money out of nothing and lend it at interest .
All quasi - bank financial institutions should be brought under this rule , regulated as commercial banks subject to 100 % reserve requirements .
Banks would earn their profit by financial intermediation only , lending savers ’ money for them ( charging a loan rate higher than the rate paid to savings account depositors ) and providing checking , safekeeping , and other services .
With 100 % reserves every dollar loaned would be a dollar previously saved , re-establishing the classical balance between abstinence and investment .
The government can pay its expenses by issuing more non interest - bearing fiat money to make up for the eliminated bank - created , interest - bearing money .
However , it can only do this up to a strict limit imposed by inflation .
If the government issues more money than the public wants to hold , the public will trade it for goods , driving the price level up .
As soon as the price index begins to rise the government must print less and tax more .
Thus a policy of maintaining a constant price index would govern the internal value of the dollar .
The external value of the dollar could be left to freely fluctuating exchange rates ( or preferably to the rate against the bancor in Keynes ’ clearing union ) .
8 . Stop treating the scarce as if it were non-scarce , but also stop treating the non-scarce as if it were scarce .
Enclose the remaining commons of rival natural capital ( e.g. atmosphere , electromagnetic spectrum , public lands ) in public trusts , and price it by a cap - auction–trade system , or by taxes , while freeing from private enclosure and prices the non-rival commonwealth of knowledge and information .
Knowledge , unlike throughput , is not divided in the sharing , but multiplied .
Once knowledge exists , the opportunity cost of sharing it is zero and its allocative price should be zero .
International development aid should more and more take the form of freely and actively shared knowledge , along with small grants , and less and less the form of large interest - bearing loans .
Sharing knowledge costs little , does not create un - repayable debts , and it increases the productivity of the truly rival and scarce factors of production .
Existing knowledge is the most important input to the production of new knowledge , and keeping it artificially scarce and expensive is perverse .
Patent monopolies ( aka “ intellectual property rights ” ) should be given for fewer “ inventions ” , and for fewer years .
Costs of production of new knowledge should , more and more , be publicly financed and then the knowledge freely shared .
9. Stabilize population .
Work toward a balance in which births plus in - migrants equals deaths plus out - migrants .
This is controversial and difficult , but as a start contraception should be made available for voluntary use everywhere .
And while each nation can debate whether it should accept many or few immigrants , such a debate is rendered moot if immigration laws are not enforced .
Support voluntary family planning , and enforcement of reasonable immigration laws , democratically enacted in spite of the cheap labor lobby .
10 . Reform national accounts — separate GDP into a cost account and a benefits account .
Compare them at the margin , stop throughput growth when marginal costs equal marginal benefits .
In addition to this objective approach , recognize the importance of the subjective studies that show that , beyond a threshold , further GDP growth does not increase self - evaluated happiness .
Beyond a level already reached in many countries GDP growth delivers no more happiness , but continues to generate depletion and pollution .
At a minimum we must not just assume that GDP growth is “ economic growth ” , but prove it .
And start by trying to refute the mountain of contrary evidence .
While these policies will appear radical to many , it is worth remembering that they are amenable to gradual application .
One hundred percent reserves can be approached gradually , the range of distribution can be restricted gradually , caps can be adjusted gradually , etc .
Also these measures are based on the conservative institutions of private property and decentralized market allocation .
They simply recognize that private property loses its legitimacy if too unequally distributed , and that markets lose their legitimacy if prices do not tell the whole truth about opportunity costs .
In addition , the macro-economy becomes an absurdity if its scale is structurally required to grow beyond the biophysical limits of the Earth .
And well before reaching that radical physical limit we are encountering the conservative economic limit in which extra costs of growth become greater than the extra benefits , ushering in the era of uneconomic growth , so far unrecognized .

“ The big difference here , ” said Robert L. Emerson , the state budget director , “ is that we have very little to fall back on .
Michigan has already done a lot of the things that other states are only thinking about doing now .
Every reserve fund in the state government has been drained long ago .
Our rainy - day fund ?
There ’s $ 2 million in there .
That wo n’t last you 30 seconds . ”
Just to cope with the most recent slipping revenue projections , Michigan is preparing to close eight prisons or prison camps ( and despite the political risks , release some inmates as soon as they are eligible for release ) , as well as drop state support for dental and podiatric care , glasses and hearing aids for poor adults .
State grants for doctors who agree to live in rural , underserved places and counseling for teenage parents will likely end , too .
On the revenue side , all sorts of notions have been entertained  Michigan , the new Hollywood ?
Michigan , the wind turbine state ?
 even an idea offered in a closed meeting this year by John Engler , the former governor , that Michigan ponder housing detainees from the prison in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , raising perhaps $ 1 billion .
( Mr. Engler , through a spokesman , declined to discuss the matter . )
Most people tie the state ’s lasting fiscal woes to the collapsing auto industry , and by some measures , Michigan seems to be marching backward .
While much of the country emerged from a downturn that started in 2001 , Michigan never really seemed to do the same .
The state has cut 10,000 employees since 2000 , leaving it with a staff comparable to the early 1970s .
Annual general fund revenues , when adjusted for inflation , have shrunk in all but one of the last nine years .
They are expected to be $ 6.9 billion next year , a level last seen in 1991 ( and with the inflation adjustment , more like the 1960s ) .
Here 's a quick way to improve golf telecasts .
Give fans something , anything , to yell besides " You da man ! " and " Get in the hole ! " During Sunday 's WGC - Accenture Match Play Championship on NBC , two fans were in such a hurry to shout " Get in the hole ! " after Tiger Woods hit his tee shot , they screamed it in unison .
Fans should be free to boo or cheer whoever they want .
But fans are now screaming " Get in the hole ! " when Woods , Phil Mickelson and others tee off on par - 4 and par - 5 holes , ESPN 's Jim Rome says .
" If you 're saying these things , stop doing it immediately , " Rome said during Friday 's Jim Rome Is Burning .
" The players hate you , other fans hate you and , most importantly , I hate you .
You 're bringing everybody down , and you 're embarrassing yourself . "
TV networks can't edit out the screams without losing audio of player reactions and conversations with their caddies , NBC spokesman Brian Walker says .
" You ca n't stop the gallery , you can only contain them , " he jokes .
After Woods thumped Stewart Cink with an 8 - and - 7 victory Sunday , NBC's Roger Maltbie nailed Cink with a pretty tough question : " What 's it like standing on the first tee when you know your opponent is better than you , he knows he 's better than you and everybody else knows he 's better than you ? "
Cink admitted it was " a tough task . "
Best documentary : HBO Sports ' new documentary , Joe Louis : America 's Hero … Betrayed , premiered Saturday night .
Replaying several times this week on HBO and HBO2 , it 's a must - see .
The show explores Louis ' fights with Germany 's Max Schmeling that took on racial and political overtones on the eve of World War II .
Schmeling 's victory over Louis in 1936 made him a darling of Adolf Hitler 's Nazi regime .
Louis regrouped , beat James Braddock for the heavyweight crown in 1937 , then knocked out Schmeling in the first round of their rematch in 1938 .
Today 's pro athletes think they 're under the microscope .
But as Louis ' friend Walter Smith recalls : " He had more pressure than any fighter ever had in his life .
Because he was carrying the country . "
As comedian / activist Dick Gregory says : " This was probably the first time and the only time in the history of America that a black man ends up being a white hope . "
The rest of the documentary chronicles Louis ' decline and fall .
While he served four years in the Army and raised money for the war , the Internal Revenue Service hounded him for years over back taxes .
Louis ' son , Joe Louis Barrow Jr. , recalls , " He was n't running from his debt .
He was just trying to deal with it in a civil fashion , in a responsible way , and they just dogged him forever . "
Most boring :
The brief clips of Louis ' classic bouts blew away HBO 's telecast of the Wladimir Klitschko - Sultan Ibragimov fight Saturday night .
How dull was it ?
Even Klitschko's trainer , part - time HBO analyst Emanuel Steward , pleaded with him between rounds : " You ca n't knock him out if you do n't throw punches . "
Best game : ESPN did a nice job Saturday night letting the non-stop action tell the story in Tennessee 's thrilling 66 - 62 men 's basketball victory against Memphis .
There was Memphis ' Derrick
Rose bent over on the court and gasping for breath .
On the Volunteers sideline , viewers saw a trainer using ice bags to massage the leg cramps of an exhausted JaJuan Smith .
" It 's physical .
These players are just giving it their all out there , " reporter Erin Andrews said .
Analyst Dick Vitale agreed .
" That 's why I love college basketball , " he said .
" The kids play with such passion . "
ESPN repeatedly mentioned that Peyton Manning , Priscilla Presley and other celebrities were in the house .
Not necessary .
This game sold itself .
Most prescient : NBC 's Johnny Miller on his prediction a then - amateur Woods would win at least 50 tournaments , including 10 major championships : " All the Tour guys said , ' Miller , you are the stupidest guy .
Nobody will ever win that many again . '
All those guys who said that , eat crow . "
Best lines : Asked by TNT's Cheryl Miller about his Mohawk hairdo during Thursday 's Portland Trail Blazers - Seattle SuperSonics game , Blazers injured rookie Greg Oden said , " I felt like I needed to lose some weight . "
TNT 's Charles Barkley countered , " That 's exactly what happens when you 've got millions of dollars and you 're bored and have to sit out the season . "

The argument that policies to address environmental problems such as global warming will harm economic progress is not new :
London 's Historic " Pea - Soupers " , by David Urbinato , EPA Journal : ... Shakespeare , whose witches in Macbeth chant , " fair is foul , and foul is fair : Hover through the fog and filthy air . "
Smog in London predates Shakespeare by four centuries .
Until the 12th century , most Londoners burned wood for fuel .
But as the city grew and the forests shrank , wood became scarce and increasingly expensive .
Large deposits of " sea - coal " off the northeast coast provided a cheap alternative .
Soon , Londoners were burning the soft , bituminous coal to heat their homes and fuel their factories .
Sea -coal was plentiful , but it did n't burn efficiently .
A lot of its energy was spent making smoke , not heat .
Coal smoke drifting through thousands of London chimneys combined with clean natural fog to make smog .
If the weather conditions were right , it would last for days .
Early on , no one had the scientific tools to correlate smog with adverse health effects , but complaints about the smoky air as an annoyance date back to at least 1272 , when King Edward I , on the urging of important noblemen and clerics , banned the burning of sea-coal .
Anyone caught burning or selling the stuff was to be tortured or executed .
The first offender caught was summarily put to death .
This deterred nobody .
Of necessity , citizens continued to burn sea-coal in violation of the law , which required the burning of wood few could afford .
Following Edward , Richard III ( 1377-1399 ) and Henry V ( 1413 - 1422 ) also tried to curb the use of sea-coal , as did a number of non-royal crusaders .
In 1661 , John Evelyn , a noted diarist of the day , wrote his anticoal treatise FUMIFUNGIUM : or the Inconvenience of the Aer and Smoake of London Dissipated , in which he pleaded with the King and Parliament to do something about the burning of coal in London .
" And what is all this , but that Hellish and dismall Cloud of SEACOALE ? " he wrote , " so universally mixed with the otherwise wholesome and excellent Aer , that her Inhabitants breathe nothing but an impure and thick Mist accompanied with a fuliginous and filthy vapour ... "
Laws and treatises failed to stop citizens from burning coal , however .
Too many people burned it and there were no real alternatives .
Anthracite coal was much cleaner but too expensive ...
At the turn of the century , cries to reduce the smoke faced a tough opponent .
Coal was fueling the industrial revolution .
To be against coal burning was to be against progress .
" Progress " won out .
Not until the 1950s , when a four - day fog in 1952 killed roughly 4,000 Londoners was any real reform passed ...
The Viper will stay in the Chrysler family .
Chrysler Group said today that it is no longer trying to sell its Viper sports car business , which it put on the block last summer in an attempt to raise cash and stave off bankruptcy .
Industry - watchers had speculated in recent weeks that Chrysler ’s new owners , Fiat of Italy , would opt to keep the hand - built super - car in its lineup , at least for the time being .
That , and the fact that no viable buyer emerged , may have pushed Chrysler to hang on to the Viper .
That ’s good news for fans of the distinctive growler , which , according to one press report , holds the unofficial sports car lap record at the Nurburgring course in Germany of 7 minutes , 22 seconds .
Viper sales slumped badly in 2007 but rebounded strongly last year after Dodge put a new 8.4 liter V - 10 engine under the hood .
Last year , Dodge sold 1,172 Vipers , which have a starting sticker price of around $ 88,500 , although sales slumped 48 % in the first half of this year amid a general collapse in auto sales .
“ The Dodge Viper has successfully captured the hearts and imagination of performance enthusiasts around the globe , ” said Mike Accavitti , head of Dodge .
“ We ’re extremely proud that the ultimate American - built sports car with its world - class performance will live on as the iconic image leader for the Dodge brand . ”

Since this was the first time in almost one and a half centuries that a French president had been allowed to address parliament , President Nicolas Sarkozy 's speech was already on course to ruffle a few feathers .
The Greens and Communists refused to attend and the Socialists left early , claiming the venue for the address - the Chateau of Versailles , which was home to King Louis XIV - smacked of monarchy and a thirst for power .
But it was the French leader 's attack on the burka that really caused a stir .
He expressed his strong distaste for the head - to - toe Islamic veil , calling it not a sign of religion but a sign of subservience .
" It will not be welcome on French soil , " he said . "
We cannot accept , in our country , women imprisoned behind a mesh , cut off from society , deprived of all identity .
That is not the French republic 's idea of women 's dignity . "
More on the Hijab President Sarkozy 's comments have not come out of the blue .
They are in response to a call last week by a group of 65 cross- party MPs , led by the Communist Andre Gerin , who wants a parliamentary commission set up to investigate the spread of the burka in France .
They want to see whether such a spread is indicative of a radicalisation of Islam , whether women are being forced to cover themselves or are doing so voluntarily , and whether wearing the burka undermines French secularism .
Mr Gerin believes the burka " amounts to a breach of individual freedom on our national territory " .
Because , if the mention of monarchy triggers warning bells in France , the mention of religion triggers much louder ones .
Ban in schools
The concept of secularism or " laicite " is sacred in France .
We must not fight the wrong battle .
In the republic , the Muslim faith must be respected as much as other religions
Nicolas Sarkozy ,
French President
The separation of church and state is jealously guarded by everyone from school teachers to government ministers - and the constitution states the republic " does not recognise , subsidise or remunerate any religious body " .
It underpinned the French Revolution , and has been a basic tenet of the country 's progressive thought since the 18th century when French Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire , Diderot and Montesquieu regarded religion as divisive , benighted and intolerant .
It was this same concept that was invoked five years ago to ban conspicuous signs of religion - including Islamic headscarves - from schools .
That decision sparked controversy and debate across Europe , with critics claiming it stigmatised Muslims at a time when France needed to be stepping up its fight against rife discrimination in the job market , which had caused so many youths of Muslim origin to feel forgotten by French society .
This latest call for a potential ban of the burka has prompted the head of the French Council for the Muslim Religion to warn MPs they risk stigmatising Muslims again .
But the special inquiry does have the backing of Dalil Boubakeur , rector of the Paris Mosque and a former head of the Muslim council , who insists that Islam in France should be an " open and convivial Islam that allows people to live side by side " .
He fears that anecdotal evidence that more women are wearing the burka in France is linked to an " excess , a radicalisation " among some Muslims .

With five million Muslims living here , France is home to Western Europe 's largest Islamic community and the government will be anxious not to isolate the Muslim population by being seen to be trying to dictate to women what they should wear .
The issue has even split the French cabinet .
Rama
Yade , the Muslim human rights minister , said she would be open to a ban if it was aimed at protecting women who wore a burka against their will .
The immigration minister , Eric Besson , believes a ban will only create tensions .
President Sarkozy may have given his backing to an open debate on the burka , but he also insisted France needed to make sure it knew exactly what it was debating .
" We must not fight the wrong battle , " he said .
" In the republic , the Muslim faith must be respected as much as other religions . "

In the Malakand region of Pakistan , the Taliban have started correcting the " moral wrongs " of society by banning women from shopping in public areas , as it is believed to be obscene .
They have have punished men by shaving their hair and moustaches for listening to music , seen as un-Islamic .
As non-Muslims living under sharia law , the Sikh community in Orakzai Agency is being forced to pay 15 m rupees , approximately £ 130,000 , in tax to live in peace .
If Sikhs refuse , then the Taliban will occupy their properties .
The Taliban are , of course , not the first to attempt to implement sharia law .
Governments in Saudi Arabia , Iran , Taliban - ruled Afghanistan and northern Nigeria have implemented " Islamic " laws that have resulted in systematic human rights abuses by employing medieval punishments for transgressing God 's " boundaries " , such as death for apostasy and stoning for adultery .
The implementation of such sharia laws leads people to question the compatibility of Islam and human rights .
Muslims who want to lead a life based on God 's guidance from the Quran and Sunnah ( Prophetic tradition ) comply with sharia , which literally means " way " , not law .
Central to sharia are the aims of preserving life , property , intellect , progeny and religion .
Going against this traditional understanding , extreme elements like the Taliban incorporate concepts of state and law into sharia by claiming that God 's law is sacrosanct .
Questions then arise as to who decides which Islamic schools of thought or practice are to be followed , and which criteria used to determine what is " Islamic " or not .
When and where sharia law has been adopted , the tendency has been to force narrow and backward opinions upon society , in contravention of sharia 's aims as well as human rights standards .
If the Taliban were to contextualise the Qur'an and Sunnah , they would realise that Islam 's Prophet Muhammad aimed to reform 7th - century Arab society by giving women and weaker groups greater rights and relative equality .
For instance , women were granted rights to hold property and slavery was discouraged .
Whilst maintaining sharia as a set of norms , bearing in mind that it is not God but humans who legislate , Islamic practices can be re-interpreted to meet today 's moral standards , where freedom and equality can and should form the basis of sharia principles .
To legislate and structure society based on medieval rules and norms now actually contradicts Muhammad 's message , which is avoid tyranny , oppression and injustice .
Down the centuries Islam has maintained and promoted pluralism , which extremists like the Taliban deny .
That is why we see such a diversity of Muslim practice today , because Islamic scholars have understood that the eternal message of God needs to be interpreted in reference to geographical and temporal contexts .
By legalising a twisted understanding of sharia , the Taliban are actually politicising religion .
There is nothing un -Islamic in allowing individuals to follow and practice Islam as they choose without it being incorporated as state law ( pdf ) .
Muslims in Malakand should be able to choose freely how to follow Islam out of personal conviction , regardless of whether their interpretations conform to majority or minority opinion .
They should be allowed to believe that listening to music is not un -Islamic ; that women can shop in public without wronging Islam ; and that Sikhs should be protected based on common nationality , not religion .
The Pakistani government has made itself responsible for the human rights abuses committed by the Taliban by formalising its interpretation of sharia law .
It is a moral imperative to challenge such laws that discriminate along sectarian religious lines .

They are out there somewhere , tens of thousands of them -- growth companies , companies that will one day replace the millions of jobs down , or circling , the drain .
In a new research report , the Kauffman Foundation concludes that nearly half of the 2008 Inc. 500 and more than half of the 2008 Fortune 500 were born during recessions or bear markets .
Editor - at - large Leigh Buchanan asked Kauffman president Carl Schramm about reasons to be cheerful .
With large corporations retrenching , is this a good time to start a car company or introduce some cool new manufacturing technology ?
The most important message of our research is : Do n't despair .
Good things grow even in the darkest times .
And not all recessions are the same .
Some are the aftermath of euphoria - driven speculation , like the 2001 downturn .
Others -- like this one -- are debt - and finance - led .
Some recessions mark breaks in economic development .
The early 1980s , for example , marked the decisive transition from the industrial to the knowledge economy .
But most of this becomes apparent in hindsight , and no entrepreneur is going to wait for the dust to settle .
The energy crunch has given the nudge to car companies like Tesla .
And nascent entrepreneurs may be waiting to pick up business left behind by GM and Chrysler .
Recessions create pent - up demand that feeds businesses as the economy revives .
How has that prospect influenced start - up rates during down times ?
The pattern of start - ups emerging stronger from a downturn seems to hold .
In the mid-1970s , early 1980s , and early 1990s , start - ups rebounded strongly after recessions .
And recent Department of Labor data suggest that monthly firm - formation data may be a leading indicator .
Start - ups began to decline in the months before the 2001 recession and to increase before it was over , possibly indicating this ebb and flow of demand not fully captured in other statistics .
How much of the current start - up activity is likely to be in health care and energy ?
There 's never a bad time to start a health care company , and billions of VC dollars were already flowing into clean - tech before this recession .
But if we look at the fastest - growing firms in recent years as ranked by Inc. , we see all sorts : pet food , alternative energy , online gaming , cybersecurity .
Many were founded during the 2001 recession or the bear market that continued into 2002 .
Looking at past recessions , we see that start - up activity is often shaped by whatever is the main technology focus .
Today , that is still IT .
Are the start - ups born in these dark periods different ?
Are they more cautious , more frugal , able to survive on fewer calories ?
That 's one thesis about recession start - ups , and examples are easy to find : UPS , Allstate , Amgen , Electronic Arts , Whole Foods .
But looking at survival rates of new companies back to 1977 , we did n't really see any difference between recessionary and expansionary years .
What needs to happen in the public and private sectors to make sure as many healthy saplings as possible get planted ?
The biggest thing is to refrain from anything that may stunt start - up growth .
Overly restrictive immigration policies spring to mind , as do actions like the auto bailouts and Buy American campaigns that seek to preserve a nostalgic past .
From the long - term perspective , the most important areas of reform are education and health care .
Our educational system grew up at the dawn of the industrial economy and needs serious innovation to evolve further .
We can't afford to educate our children in artifacts .
As for health care , there 's evidence that the employer - based system and the absence of stripped - down " entrepreneurs ' plans " deter people from striking out on their own .
Health care also must evolve in the direction of a flexible and mobile labor force .

Filed under : June 20 , 2009 , 1:29 pmFiled under : Uncategorized
Today I have two days worth of research to sum up that covers two different areas .
One is general semantic web stuff , the other is practical stuff for publishing data in .
Net .
I ’ll start with the higher level stuff .
I found this interesting page from 2003 written up by Tim Bray who was involved with coming up with the specification RDF .
It ’s made me realise that this stuff is not a recent occurrence , RDF has been around for 10 years at least ( which makes it positively ancient in our little web world ) .
In fact it ’s been around long enough , that my research has dug up several sites that have been dedicated to the semantic web / linked data / rdf that were maintained for years , but now have been abandoned as the authors obviously did n’t see enough of this stuff actually happening .
I might just be flushed with the enthusiasm of a someone who ’s new to this , but I think that I ’ve picked the right time to get on board with this stuff .
I feel like the word is getting out and people are listening .
Semantic technologies are getting more main stream press like the PwC technology forecast to TBL being bought in to help show the UK government how to do open data .
This is in turn getting more developers interested .
This will hopefully lead to more data sets being available ( this is the area I ’m hoping to contribute to ) and once there ’s enough useful data someone will build that killer app that will drag everyone in .
The killer app is n’t here yet so it ’s still a “ build it and they will come ” mentality .
I ’m happy with that for now .
One of the better wikis on this stuff that I ’ve found so far is from semanticweb.org , it has sections on tools and ontologies which looks promising even if there entry on the resume ontology is a remarkably sparse for some reason .
If you ’re looking for something on the semantic web sindice.com seems like a good place to start .
In order to get your site spidered you can just ping them and they ’ll do the rest .
As they ’re still building up their index they ’re more than happy for you to ping them as much as you want .
A project for a future date would be to compare this with Yahoo ’s Search Monkey .
After digging up all of this really interesting information , I thought my brain would explode , so I ’d take a break and think about how I could actually do some of this stuff .
I thought I ’d start with looking what others have done in the .
Net space .
It was pretty sparse pickings .
The two things that I did find was a C# library for dealing with RDF triples which may or may not be useful to me as I wo n’t have a RDF data store and I ’m expecting the writting out of RDF to be fairly trivial .
This library is one of the projects that has fallen by the way side thanks to lack of take up after 4 years of work .
An interesting project that has been built on top of this library is this LINQ to RDF that allows you to eaisily create SPARQL queries ( if you like using LINQ , I ’m an old school SQL guy , so it ’s not really my thing ) .
Still on the practical trip , I started to discuss with one of my colleagues how we can implement some of the recomended features of linked data like cool URIs and content negotiation given that ASP .
Net webform apps do n’t really lend themselves to this sort of architecture .
For cool URIs we have the choice between using the new feature URL rewriting feature in IIS7 , the other was to use the ( also reasonably new ) .
Net MVC framework .
I know neither of these ideas are particularly novel to those of you used to the LAMP stack , but it can take a while to convince MS that something is a good idea if it ’s not their own .
In our case we ’ll probably go with MVC for two reasons .
We ’re developers , if we use MVC then all of the rewriting is more within our control rather than the person who ’s maintaining IIS .
I have n’t had a reason to do anything with MVC and I ’m always looking for something new to learn
So once I ’ve gotten past “ Hello World ” my plan is to :
Publish some dummy data in RDF format Publish some dummy data in RDFa format Work on some content negotiation routing so I can display the above data based on the appropriate request Publish some real data
I ’d like to pretend that I wo n’t go trawling the net for even more articles to read while I ’m doing this , but I know that wo n’t happen .
I ’ll keep you all up to date with my progress on both .
If you subscribe to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben BernankeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ green shoots of recoveryÃ¢â‚ ¬Â theory Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ or believe that the recent speculation and run-up in oil prices provides further evidence that the global economic crisis is easing Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ then you will be further encouraged by news that ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s manufacturing output has increased for three straight months now .
As the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s third largest economy , China is heavily dependent on the sales of its exports so an early recovery in China must mean that its global trading partners are also seeing an end to the crisis .
By way of evidence , ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s most recent Purchase ManagerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Index ( PMI ) for the month of May came in at 53.1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ down slightly from AprilÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 53.2 but any value over 50 indicates positive growth .
Continued growth is critical for ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s future and the countryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s policymakers have long targeted 8 percent annual growth as the minimum level of growth required to raise the standard of living for millions of ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s poor while still ensuring stable social conditions for the entire country .
In the past twenty years , China has worked to remake itself as a capitalist market Ã¢â‚¬â€œ albeit one that still operates within the confines of a communist government .
One phenomenon from this push towards freer markets , is the rise of an educated middle - class .
Prior to this , unless part of the ruling class , options for most Chinese citizens were pretty - much limited to a life of working the land or toiling in a factory .
In general , workers faced a meager lifestyle where most of oneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s efforts went to pay for food and housing and luxuries like electronic goods and certainly a personal automobile were beyond the scope of the vast majority of most individuals .
But things began to change as China became an increasingly important center for the production of consumer goods ultimately destined for sale in the US and Europe .
Originally consisting of cheap , mass - produced items and simple electronics , ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exports have grown in sophistication and this has forced China to improve education and training opportunities for its people .
Better pay resulting in additional discretionary income has given rise to a more discerning consumer and many of the goods and products that earlier generations could only dream about are now commonplace .
Growth Mostly From Government Spending
Last November , ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s government committed 4 trillion yuan ( US $ 568 billion ) to stimulus spending .
According to ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s National Development and Reform Commission , government money has resulted in the construction of over 12,000 miles of new roads , 200,000 new low - rental dwellings , and billions of dollars spent to improve airports and other public infrastructure projects .
Meanwhile , external demand for ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exports remained stagnant with no indication that the traditional export markets will return to previous buying levels any time soon .
Worse still , consumer spending in China is actually shrinking as money earned through government stimulus projects finds its way into personal savings accounts rather than the local economy .
According to Stephen Roach Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the lack of a social safety net in China has forced workers to increase their contributions to what he refers to as Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ precautionary savingsÃ¢â‚
¬
Â over growing fears that the economy will get worse in China before it gets better .
( China View Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ May 30th , 2009 )
Like any jurisdiction resorting to direct stimulus spending to see its way through a difficult patch , China is discovering that once the spending ends , so does the positive growth associated with the spending .
Actual recovery will not take place until global economies improve and demand for ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exports rebounds .
In the meantime , ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s government is faced with a difficult decision Ã¢â‚¬â€œ continue throwing billions at the economy , or endure a sharp decline in growth .

A judge has sentenced Phil Spector to 19 years to life in prison for the 2003 murder of actress Lana Clarkson .
Before the sentencing , the victim ’s mother , Donna Clarkson , told the judge she was heartbroken over the death of her daughter .
“ All our plans together are destroyed .
Now I can only visit her in the cemetery , ” she said .
Spector ’s attorney said the defense sympathized with the family “ with its loss . ”
But attorney Doron Weinberg maintained that Spector was convicted wrongly .
“ The evidence did not establish Mr. Spector ’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , ” the lawyer said .
The 69 - year - old music producer , his normally pale face even more wan after a month and a half in jail , stared impassively at the judge as he spoke .
Spector was convicted last month of second - degree murder in the death of Clarkson , 40 , who was shot in the music producer ’s Alhambra mansion .
Many British soldiers have been killed by roadside bombs , which critics say have taken an unacceptably high toll because the troops have had to track down the Taliban in vehicles , instead of going into combat aboard helicopters .
There have been recriminations , too , about the British troops ’ reliance for transportation on aging , poorly protected Land Rovers from the time of Britain ’s military involvement in Northern Ireland .
The criticism has come from the opposition leaders in Parliament and retired British commanders who oversaw earlier stages of the Afghan conflict .
American generals , too , have spoken privately about the mismatch between Britain ’s military commitments and the British forces ’ manpower and equipment .
The Americans say this situation has often contributed to decisions by British commanders in the field to back off from confrontations with the Taliban , or yield ground the British forces have lost soldiers in gaining .
But perhaps the most damaging recriminations have come from the families of the dead .
“ They continue to allow the army to operate in those ridiculous tin- can Land Rovers when they should have been equipped three years ago with American Humvees , ” Tony Phillipson , father of a 29 - year - old army captain killed in 2006 , told the BBC on Friday .
“ The Afghan Army has 4,500 Humvees .
Why have n’t our soldiers got them ? ”
Last week , the political consensus fragmented when Nick Clegg , leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats , used a House of Commons speech to say the government should either finance the war properly , giving the troops the force numbers and equipment they need , or withdraw .
“ We ca n’t give them the worst of both worlds  put them in harm ’s way , but not give them the backing they need , ” he said .
It has been an open secret at Whitehall for years that top generals have been frustrated by being ordered to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as handle overseas peacekeeping commitments , with a budget that is one of the lowest among leading Western nations , at 2.5 per cent of Britain ’s gross domestic product .
Alexander Armstrong and Martin Freeman are to star in a new BBC4 factual - based comedy drama about the rise of the home computer market in the 1980s .
The show , which is currently in production with an expected broadcast date later this year , will focus on the rivalry between the maverick Sir Clive Sinclair , played by Armstrong , and his former colleague Chris Curry , portrayed by Freeman .
It has the working title Syntax Era .
Made by Darlow Smithson , the independent producer behind Touching the Void and The Diary of Anne Frank , it is described as an " affectionately comic account " of the race for home computer supremacy , with Sinclair 's ZX Spectrum and C5 battling Curry 's BBC Micro .
Richard Klein , controller of BBC4 , said : " Those of us who lived through the 1980s will remember the sense of excitement when gadgets and technology started to appear in our homes , but not many of us will know the fascinating stories behind their arrival .
" Alexander Armstrong and Martin Freeman are excellent choices to portray Sir Clive Sinclair and Chris Curry at a time when battling to have the UK 's most - loved home computer was their number one priority . "
Written by Tony Saint , the 90 - minute drama will use archive footage to illustrate the buzz around Sinclair and Curry 's inventions , with classic clips from programmes such as John Craven 's Newsround .
Syntax Era will be directed by Saul Metzstein and produced by Andrea Cornwell , with Jamie Laurenson executive producing .

It 's the first week of the BBC Proms , an annual summer season of orchestral concerts in London , and many people will be having an introduction to classical music .
But there 's a whole lot of etiquette to be learned .
There are few things more acutely embarrassing than realising you are the only person making a noise in a crowded room .
But the world of classical music regularly presents just such a horrific scenario to the uninitiated attendee .
It 's not pop music , it 's not about waving your lighter around - there is no physical participation for the audience
Jonathan Lennie
At a rock concert it is considered acceptable to applaud like a maniac , whoop , holler , punch the air , and even shout " rock ' n ' roll " at the end of every song , should you see fit .
But this is not the case in the world of classical music .
You will find aficionados who sneer at " those people who clap after every movement " .
And the Time Out listing magazine 's classical editor Jonathan Lennie has caused a minor kerfuffle in this rarefied world by going one step further and criticising those people who clap the microsecond a concert is over .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It is a phenomenon that was satirised in the 2005 short film The Clap .
An obsessive classical music fan recalls the lengths he used to go to , studying scores and previous performances , to identify the precise millisecond the concert was over , so he could be the first to clap .
Like a maniac .
The protagonist 's real - life counterparts are apparently a regular and annoying phenomenon .
In an open letter to the " Loud Clapping Man Who Sits Behind Me At Concerts " , Lennie wrote : " Having sat through a long and profound work , why do you have to start making a racket as soon as you perceive it to be over ? "
They want your applause .
In the right places
He insists that for some sombre pieces , a period of dignified silence after the last note is played is essential to appreciation .
" The last note is n't the end of the music , the silence completes the music .
In Beethoven 's 9th , a massive choral outpouring , you can't help but clap , but in other works like Mahler 9 these are the final symphonies , the end of the life .
They end in silence . "
Take Schubert 's bleak song cycle Winterreise .
You should apparently not be yelling " bravo " between the songs , or going bananas at the end .
Lennie has some advice on what you should do .
" [ Leave ] a few seconds to let the music die away and a moment to recognise what Schubert has achieved in setting out this existential bleakness .
And then applaud the performer . "
BASIC ETIQUETTE
People do n't normally clap between movements
If everybody else is clapping , you probably can Switch off mobile phone
No food in the auditorium Avoid hacking cough during quiet bits Lennie emphasises that he was not referring to the Proms audience - who are very knowledgeable - when he wrote his open letter .
But he has identified a problem in the wider world that is having a malign influence on the classical music world .
" Everybody seems to be texting and tweeting and nobody seems to spend any time in contemplation .
It 's not pop music .
It 's not about waving your lighter around .
There is no physical participation for the audience .
It is a quiet involvement .
One or two people clapping can spoil it for everyone . "
He does acknowledge that there are occasions when you can clap whenever you want .
" Clapping in between the movements was common in Beethoven 's day - it is n't a religious service . "
Immediate appreciation
And how do the performers feel about people not clapping , either between movements or at the end ?
Georgia Browne , a historical flute specialist who has played with the Academy of Ancient Music and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment , concedes that there are certain serious pieces where salvos of ill - timed applause are inappropriate .
Some people find classical concerts a little intimidating " [ But ] as a performer I 'm in favour of an audience showing their appreciation immediately .
It 's quite delightful to have that . "
And , she suggests , the whole taboo about clapping in between the movements is a recent development .
" I 'm a specialist in 18th and 19th Century music .
It was customary to not only applaud but to stop and do other things between movements in concerts .
" At the premieres of Haydn and Beethoven they would do two movements and then have a ballet or a singer .
Often they would have refreshments .
And they did n't listen to everything in complete silence . "
Martin Cullingford , deputy editor of Gramophone magazine , also admits things have changed .
" Up until the beginning of the 20th Century applause between movements was normal .
Mozart certainly appreciated it .
That changed - now it 's not the thing that 's expected to happen .
When people do it 's always slightly embarrassing . "
The Proms is the gateway for many to a new world
There are of course times when it is OK to go mad at the end of a movement .
" [ In ] the Rachmaninov second piano concerto , there is such a flash it feels unnatural not to clap , " says Cullingford .
" The best advice is not to clap unless there is spontaneous uproarious applause , in which case it is safe to do so . "
Apart from clapping , classical music newcomers may worry over what to wear .
Do people wear black tie ?
" The last thing you want to do is to reinforce this totally wrong view that there are strict rules if you are attending a classical concert , " says Cullingford .
" In Covent Garden [ the Royal Opera House in London ] you would find people [ in the audience ] were dressing quite formally .
But you hardly ever see people in evening wear .
At the Royal Festival Hall [ on London 's South Bank ] it 's more relaxed - people wearing jeans . "
The premiere of Stravinsky 's Rites of Spring saw a riot , but not over clapping
In concert halls outside London , it also might be common to see some people dressed formally , says Ms Browne .
But for all the controversy about clapping and the confusion that some novices might have over what to wear , there is one faux pas of epic proportions - the rogue mobile .
If Schubert 's Winterreise can be spoiled by inappropriate clapping , think what happens if your phone starts playing the Crazy Frog tune in a quiet bit .
" That 's happened plenty of times .
It is a direct insult , " says Ms Browne .
And trailing in a close second is people who have chosen to attend despite having a hacking and uncontrollable cough .
Or people whose garrulousness cannot be tamed even for a couple of hours .
" You need to have a foundation of silence .
Coughing in quiet bits is just so rough .
And talking during the playing , that 's just not on . "
In short , going to a concert is a bit like going to the cinema .
An ordinary experience , but with some basic etiquette rules .
And the uninitiated should always keep in mind that the aficionados are apparently very keen to make them very welcome .
As long as their mobile is off .

Just the sort of pomposity that puts me off clasical music .
Tim , Bath , UK Surely the Proms is all about bringing us common folk and classical music together and removing the stuffiness from violins , oboes and dinner - suited conductors .
In Western culture it is the norm to applaud something we think is good , sadly even to the extent of clapping a charter airline pilot when he lands us in foreign parts .
This of course may be due to the relief of stress at landing .
Why not at the end of a piece of music when the tension of a very good music performance is relieved ?
burysafetybloke , Bury
As a musician , I am keen to see more people attend performances .
The best rule of thumb for the novice concert goer as to when to clap is as follows : you will see the conductor still has his / her arms up and the players are still after the last note .
Wait until the conductor and the players have moved from this pose , then start clapping .
Rachel , Harpenden
Oh , come on .
Actually answering and talking / texting on a phone would be a direct insult .
Merely letting it ring is an embarrassing oversight .
Talking during the performance , well , those people should just be forcibly removed .
It 's annoying enough at rock concerts .
All the other vague etiquette rules are just there to make it difficult to enter the club .
Rob Watkins , Brighton , UK A bit like going to the cinema , hey ?
Well last time I went to the cinema I had to suffer idiots kicking the back of my seat every 2 minutes ; the permanent rustle of sweet wrappers ( so much so you could barely hear the quieter speech ) ; an almost constant whispering ; and a few numpties who seemed to think it was ok to stand in front of the screen periodically ... So , " basic etiquette rules " seem to be out of the window then ?

Instead of shooting the dais during a congressional hearing on health care reform , NPR ’s photographer , in a very clever move , shot the audience .
And now NPR is asking for help identifying the lobbyists and other players in attendance .
Very smart .
WIMBLEDON , England --
The new roof was n't tested .
Roger Federer was -- briefly .
The retractable roof stayed open Monday for the first match on Centre Court at Wimbledon , and Federer fell behind early before charging past Yen-hsun Lu of Taiwan 7 - 5 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 .
Novak Djokovic also advanced to the second round by beating Julien Benneteau 6 - 7 ( 8 ) , 7 - 6 ( 1 ) , 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 .
In his first match since winning the French Open , Federer failed to convert his first four break - point chances and then lost serve to trail 3 - 2 .
But he immediately broke back , broke again in the final game of the opening set and dominated from there .
" I 'm very happy with my first round , " Federer said .
" I thought it was a very solid performance . "
Seeking his sixth Wimbledon title , Federer won for the 41st time in his past 42 matches at the All England Club .
The lone loss came in last year 's final to Rafael Nadal , a match hailed by some as the sport 's best ever .
The tournament began in cloudy but dry weather .
When it rains , the translucent roof on the 87 - year - old stadium will be closed so play can continue .
" I guess the moment will come that I 'll play indoors here , " Federer said .
" But you do n't really hope for it during the match . "
The No. 2 - seeded Federer is a strong favorite to win his 15th major title , which would break the record he shares with Pete Sampras .
Federer made his entrance sporting a sleek new white warm - up outfit with gold trim that included a jacket with a turned - up collar , a vest , slacks and two - toned shoes .
The crowd roared when he appeared , and he responded with a wave and smile .
There were more cheers -- and a few whistles of approval -- when he removed his jacket to reveal the vest .
" Kind of a little bit more modern look -- a bit more military jacket this time , but obviously staying true to Wimbledon with the white colors , " Federer said .
" I hope people like it . "
By the time the match started , Federer had stripped down to shorts and a short - sleeve shirt .
He was assigned to play the first match on Centre Court after defending champion Nadal withdrew Friday because of sore knees .
" Rafa deserves it obviously more than I do this year , " Federer said .
" But somebody had to do it , so I 'm very happy that they chose me .
It gets your heart beating , that 's for sure . "
After being broken early , Federer held every service game .
He finished with 10 unforced errors and hit 42 winners from all over the court .
One winner was a running backhand from several steps beyond the sideline , which he ripped up the line into the corner to win the point .
It was a spectacular shot even by Federer 's standards , and the stoic Swiss celebrated with a raised fist as the crowd roared .
Djokovic converted his third match point on Monday when Benneteau pulled a backhand wide .
Djokovic looked to the sky and crossed himself , relieved to advance after more than 3 ½ hours of play .
Benneteau hurt his left knee in the final game when he slid into the back wall chasing a shot .
Sprawled on the grass , he iced the knee , and play resumed following a six - minute delay .
Three points later , Djokovic closed out the win .
He 's seeded fourth and considered one of the biggest threats to Federer 's bid for a sixth Wimbledon title .
No. 17 James Blake was the first seeded player eliminated , but fellow Americans Mardy Fish and Vince Spadea advanced .
Blake failed to convert a set point in the third set , squandered a 5 - 0 lead in the ensuing tiebreak and lost to Andreas Seppi 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 ( 5 ) .
Blake was also eliminated in the first round at the French Open last month .
" I still feel like I can play with anyone in the world , but it 's just for some reason lately it has been very inconsistent , " Blake said .
" I know I still have the ability .
It 's just frustrating , because it 's happening at big tournaments where I 'm having my not - so - good performances . "
No. 28 - seeded Fish never lost serve and led 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 , 4 - 1 when Sergio Roitman retired with a right shoulder injury .
Roitman , ranked 124th , fell to 0 - 12 in Grand Slam matches .
" There 's nothing that I can do about it , " he said .
" It 's not that I 'm not going to sleep at night because of that . "
The 34 - year - old Spadea , who has been eliminated in the first round at Wimbledon nine times , defeated Paul Capdeville 6 - 0 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 .
Surprise French Open runner - up Robin Soderling , seeded 13th , rallied to beat Gilles Muller 6 - 7 ( 4 ) , 7 - 5 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 . No. 21 Feliciano Lopez lost to Karol Beck 1 - 6 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 3 , 4 - 6 , 10-8 .
Soderling again relied on the big serve and booming forehand that helped him beat Nadal at Roland Garros , hitting 31 aces and saving all eight break points on Monday .
Soderling is an eight - year veteran on the tour but had his big breakthrough when he beat Nadal in the fourth round in Paris .
He lost to Federer in straight sets in the final and could face the Swiss star again in the fourth round here .
No. 7 Fernando Verdasco , No. 9 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga , No. 11 Marin Cilic , No. 15 Tommy Robredo , No. 18 Rainer Schuettler , No. 22 Ivo Karlovic , No. 27 Philipp Kohlschreiber , No. 29 Igor Andreev and No. 32 Albert Montanes also advanced .

The Bulgarian media have been using the weather , as well as music and literary charts , as a fairly obvious code to get around a law that forbids the publishing of exit polls before the end of the elections .
On a day where the temperatures have in reality reached above 35 degrees , the temperature at the city hall – home to the mayor and leader of the centre - right Gerb party , Boyko Borisov - has oddly dropped to 25.5 degrees , the Bgnes news agency reports .
Meanwhile , near the governing Socialists ' headquarters the temperature is an even chillier 20 degrees , it says .

Albany , NY – Senator José M. Serrano moved quickly to ensure safety at state parks , in the wake of a reckless pro-gun provision that moved through Congress last month .
The provision , tucked into a bill on credit card rules , allows park visitors to carry concealed weapons in national parks unless otherwise prohibited by state law .
The Serrano bill ( S.4753 ) would expressly ban concealed weapons in state parks , and thus ban them in New York ’s national parks as well .
On Thursday , it passed the Cultural Affairs , Tourism , Parks & Recreation Committee – chaired by the Senator – and will now proceed to the Codes Committee .
“ State parks are safe havens for New York families , and we intend to keep them that way , ” said Senator Serrano .
“ The gun lobby cannot expect to ram guns into New York parks the very same way it rams language into federal legislation .
My colleagues and I will work tirelessly to strengthen laws and close loopholes . ”
The United States registers more than 30,000 gun deaths per year .
“ If anyone thinks that easing gun control , especially in places with so many children and families , is going to reduce violence : they are dead wrong , ” said the Senator .
He added that state parks are not confined to sparsley populated areas .
“ I am fortunate to represent Roberto Clemente State Park , located in the West Bronx portion of my district , ” said the Senator .
“ Parents and community leaders made tremendous strides to reduce crime in recent years .
The last thing they need is a refuge for guns in their backyard . ”

New research indicates that natural selection may shape the human genome much more slowly than previously thought .
Other factors -- the movements of humans within and among continents , the expansions and contractions of populations , and the vagaries of genetic chance – have heavily influenced the distribution of genetic variations in populations around the world .
The study , conducted by a team from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , the University of Chicago , the University of California and Stanford University , is published June 5 in the open- access journalGenetics .
In recent years , geneticists have identified a handful of genes that have helped human populations adapt to new environments within just a few thousand years — a strikingly short timescale in evolutionary terms .
However , the team found that for most genes , it can take at least 50,000 - 100,000 years for natural selection to spread favourable traits through a human population .
According to their analysis , gene variants tend to be distributed throughout the world in patterns that reflect ancient population movements and other aspects of population history .
" We do n't think that selection has been strong enough to completely fine - tune the adaptation of individual human populations to their local environments , " says co-author Jonathan Pritchard .
" In addition to selection , demographic history -- how populations have moved around -- has exerted a strong effect on the distribution of variants . "
To determine whether the frequency of a particular variant resulted from natural selection , Pritchard and his colleagues compared the distribution of variants in parts of the genome that affect the structure and regulation of proteins to the distribution of variants in parts of the genome that do not affect proteins .
Since these neutral parts of the genome are less likely to be affected by natural selection , they reasoned that studying variants in these regions should reflect the demographic history of populations .
The researchers found that many previously identified genetic signals of selection may have been created by historical and demographic factors rather than by selection .
When the team compared closely related populations they found few large genetic differences .
If the individual populations ' environments were exerting strong selective pressure , such differences should have been apparent .
Selection may still be occurring in many regions of the genome , says Pritchard .
But if so , it is exerting a moderate effect on many genes that together influence a biological characteristic .
" We do n't know enough yet about the genetics of most human traits to be able to pick out all of the relevant variation , " says Pritchard .
" As functional studies go forward , people will start figuring out the phenotypes that are associated with selective signals , " says lead author Graham Coop .
" That will be very important , because then we can figure out what selection pressures underlie these episodes of natural selection . "
But even with further research , much will remain unknown about the processes that have resulted in human traits .
In particular , Pritchard and Coop urge great caution in trying to link selection with complex characteristics like intelligence .
" We 're in the infancy of trying to understand what signals of selection are telling us , " says Coop , " so it 's a very long jump to attribute cultural features and group characteristics to selection . "
When I read about the clojure performance tips , I was quite amused .
Well , the first two tips are OK .
Clojure tries to be dynamic , and I cannot think of a dynamic language living in the JVM not using reflection in some cases .
So type hints can be a good thing to optimize .
Not using Wrapper - Classes but using primitive types also seems like something plausible – tell the Compiler that your number stays small enough so it can optimize .
But then …
Use binary arithmetic operators .
WTF ?
It is slower to say (+ 2 3 4 ) than to say (+ 2 (+ 3 4 ) ) ?
Because „ For a while now , Clojure has supported inlining of certain expressions .
For arithmetic operations , only the calls with exactly two arguments will be inlined . “
In his example , I thought , maybe passing the thing directly to the REPL makes it slower because it doesnt compile the expression .
So I defined functions doing the same :
Clojure 1.0.0- user= > ( def hallo ( fn [ ] ( dotimes [ _ 1e7 ] (+ 2 4 5 ) ) ) ) # 'user / hallo user= > ( def hall o2 ( fn [ ] ( dotimes [ _ 1e7 ] (+ 2 (+ 4 5 ) ) ) ) ) #'user / hallo2 user= > ( time ( hallo ) ) " Elapsed time : 5008.579881 msecs " nil user= > ( time ( hallo2 ) ) " Elapsed time : 1650.281717 msecs " nil user= >
So actually , it seems true – sorry , to me this just shows that that compiler isnt really sufficiently intelligent for being a lisp - compiler – remember : lisp programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing ( Alan Perlis ) .
The other thing is that these functions are constant – they do not depend on any arguments or side - effects .
Even a C - Compiler would just have replaced our definitions with something that just always returns the same value , nil in our case .
And at least an arithmetic expression should be replaced if its constant ( if not the whole loop ) .
Then … why the fuck is destructing binding slower than accessing a vector directly ?
Running the example from the above link gives other times ( my computer may be slower ) , but the same outcome :
user= > ( let [ v [ 1 2 3 ] ] ( time ( dotimes [ _ 1e7 ] ( let [ [ a b c ] v] a b c ) ) ) )
" Elapsed time : 2438.966297 msecs " nil user= > user= > ( let [ v [ 1 2 3 ] ] ( time ( dotimes [ _ 1e7 ] ( let [ a ( v 0 ) b ( v 1 ) c ( v 2 ) ] a b c ) ) ) )
" Elapsed time : 1649.46514 msecs " nil
Actually , I do not understand why both codes are not doing exactly the same ?
The first one should – imho – only be short for the second one , shouldnt it ?
And wtf ?
Making code less readable for performance issues ?
I thought this wants to be a lisp !
In lisp you fit the language to your problem , not your problem to the language !
Anyway , its version 1.0 now – I hope they will optimize it soon .
Before it becomes 2.0 .
I dont like clojure ( for other reasons ) , its a step into a direction I dont really like , but at least it is a new step .
Edit :
I am surprized that this post became that popular , and actually , this makes me a little sad , because I have already written more interesting stuff ( at least as far as I think ) noone cared about .
It is criticism about a few misfeatures in the language , which I think are major issues and should be corrected as soon as possible , but dont make clojure worse .
I dont like clojure much , I have reasons for it ( already posted a few of them – and no , the JVM is not a reason ) , but as I said , it is a step into a direction I dont like , but at least it is a step – and Lisp needs new steps .
And of course , this post is meant to be provocative ( in an ironical way – I thought that was clear ) , so the fact that it raised discussions shows that it served its purpose .

Facebook says images are removed from its servers immediately .
User photographs can still be found on many social networking sites even after people have deleted them , Cambridge University researchers have said .
They put photos on 16 popular websites - noting the web addresses where the images were stored - and deleted them .
The team said it was able to find them on seven sites - including Facebook - using the direct addresses , even after the photos appeared to have gone .
Facebook says deleted photos are removed from its servers " immediately " .
The Cambridge University researchers said special photo - sharing sites , such as Flickr and Google 's Picasa , did better and Microsoft 's Windows Live Spaces removed the photos instantly .
You may have put your pictures in Facebook 's bin , but you will still have to wait for the content delivery network to delete them
BBC Technology correspondent Rory Cellan- Jones

To perform their experiment , the researchers uploaded photos to each of the sites , then deleted them , but kept a note of direct URLs to the photos from the sites ' content delivery networks .
When they checked 30 days later , these links continued to work for seven of the sites even though a typical user might think the photos had been removed .
Lazy approach Joseph Bonneau , one of the PhD students who carried out the study , said : " This demonstrates how social networking sites often take a lazy approach to user privacy , doing what 's simpler rather than what is correct .
" It 's imperative to view privacy as a design constraint , not a legal add - on . "
But a Facebook spokesman defended the company 's approach saying ; " When a user deletes a photograph from Facebook it is removed from our servers immediately .
" However , URLs to photographs may continue to exist on the Content Delivery Network ( CDN ) after users delete them from Facebook , until they are overwritten .
" Overwriting usually happens after a short period of time . "
Users of Facebook staged a revolt recently over rules which would have given the site permanent ownership of their data .

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Catholic Bishops said Thursday ( March 26 ) that Catholic chaplains , health care facilities and retreat centers should not promote or support Reiki therapy , a Japanese alternative healing practice .
Reiki " finds no support either in the findings of natural science or in Christian belief , " the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Doctrine said in six pages of guidelines .
" For a Catholic to believe in Reiki therapy presents insoluble problems , " said the committee , which is chaired by Bishop William Lori of Bridgeport , Conn .
Sr. Mary Ann Walsh , a spokeswoman for the bishops ' conference , said that over the last 18 months a number of bishops have asked the doctrine committee to evaluate the use of Reiki and make a judgment on its suitability for Catholic institutions .
About 2 million Americans have used Reiki , according to a 2002 survey by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine .
Practitioners believe that a salutary life energy flows through the body and fosters well - being , the center said .
The energy is often transmitted through experienced Reiki practitioners who lightly touch or place their hands above the patient 's body .
But the bishops said " Reiki lacks scientific credibility " and " has not been accepted by the scientific and medical communities as an effective therapy . "
The Japanese practice differs from Christian faith healing because " the healing power is at human disposal , " the bishops said .
In contrast , " for Christians the access to divine healing is by prayer to Christ as Lord and Savior . "
Moreover , practicing Reiki puts Catholics ' spiritual health in danger , the bishops said , by corrupting worship of God and turning religious devotion " in a false direction . "
" A Catholic who puts his or her trust in Reiki would be operating in the realm of superstition , " the bishops said , " the no - man 's - land that is neither faith nor science . "
Ernest Bevin , I think it was , once said that in an ideal world , you could buy a ticket at Cannon Street station to anywhere in the world and travel there without a passport .
My father actually believed this was the case before 1914 ; it was n't .
Even to sail to Beirut , you needed a piece of paper from the Sublime Porte .
I guess the European Union , with the Schengen Agreement , is now closest to Bevin 's aspiration – but you still need an identity card or a passport to cross many EU frontiers .
And the madness of foreign visas haunts all us journos .
Even to cover yesterday 's Iranian elections , it took two weeks of desperate whingeing by yours truly to line up a visa for Tehran .
Countless calls were made from London to Tehran and by me to friends in Tehran who had friends – or friends of friends – in the Iranian Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Islamic Guidance ( yes , Orwell should have lived long enough to hear about that one ) before the visa finally arrived in Beirut .
It was produced less than 15 minutes before the embassy was to close , and only two hours before the last flight from Lebanon to Iran prior to the elections .
" Have a great time in Iran , " the diplomats cheerfully told me .
They meant it .
I like them .
But visas are heart attacks on a page .
I have spent hours – nay , days – of my life sitting in the visa offices of hot and overcrowded embassies in Beirut , sweat trickling through my hair , pleading with diplomats for visas to countries I did n't want to go to .
In the Iran - Iraq war , a visa to visit the battlefront could be a one - way trip .
Sometimes the Iranians issued only two - day visas – to show us their latest victory over Saddam 's legions and then get us out before Iraq started its counter - offensive .

My favourite was Saudi Arabia .
Repeatedly , and always in broiling summer , I would be invited to Riyadh or Jeddah to observe some new political reforms ( almost always abandoned within weeks ) with which they wished to curry favour with the West .
It was an American colleague who told me how to avoid this .
For on every Saudi visa application , there is a box , ominously marked : " Religion " .
Well , I was Church of England was n't I ? Protestant .
Christian .
And the visa would arrive .
But if I left the box empty , the Saudis would assume I was Jewish and the visa would not arrive .
And I 'd be sunbathing in Beirut while my colleagues headed off to an inferno of Saudi summer days .
Of course , by the time Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1990 , I was ready to declare myself a fully - fledged Wahabi to get to Dhahran .
I still remember turning up at the Saudi embassy in Beirut and handing my visiting card to the press counsellor .
" Robert Fisk , Middle East Correspondent " was printed in English and Arabic .
And the English - speaking diplomat looked at me quizzically .
" What is ' Middle East ' ? " he asked .
Jesus wept .
It is a fact universally acknowledged that rich countries will usually give you tiny stamps in your passport while poorer countries – or anti-Western countries – will plaster a whole precious page of your passport with elaborately embossed visas , Take Tajikistan or Iran or even little Armenia .
The Taliban used to give me full - page visa stickers with " In the Name of God " " printed at the top .
After Hamid Karzai's post - American government took over , the same Afghan embassy in Islamabad would give me identical visa printouts – after scissoring " In the Name of God " off the top .
Long ago , on The Times , a foreign editor sent me off to Chad .
Visas were easy .
You went to the French embassy in London and they stamped in a visa for France .
And then a French diplomat would write " Chad " in biro over the top .
And off you 'd trot .
The Empire was n't striking back .
It was still obviously running Chad .
The fatal word " deport " has been heard by many of us scribes – even when our visas have been legally issued .
I once got a visa to Tehran during the Iran - Iraq war from a friendly diplomat who wrote " religious pilgrim " in the box for profession .
I got three days covering Saddam 's long - range rocket attacks on Iran before a little man at the aforementioned Ministry of Islamic Guidance summoned me to his dark office and announced : " Some people of the Islamic Republic came here .
They were angry .
You have 12 hours to leave . "
I did , driven to the airport by the Irish ambassador .
All is now changed , changed utterly – apart from the fingerprints taken at Imam Khomeini International Airport ( do they share them with the Americans ? ) .
The Turks reneged on my visa in 1991 when they objected to my report on the looting of blankets by Turkish troops from Kurdish refugees .
All true , of course .
And did n't Turkey want to join the EU ?
No point in arguing .
But I had to comfort the sullen detective accompanying me from Diyarbakir to Ankara when we flew into turbulence .
He was frightened .
He had never been on a plane before .
Yes , I know it can be a pain in the arse for others to get a visa to London – and in the past I 've watched some of our lovely visa officers treating applicants like scum – but my favourite memory was at San Francisco International Airport , where Homeland Security spotted all the pariah visas in my passport .
" Have you ever met a terrorist ? " one of them asked me with a frown .
Yes , I said .
I met Osama bin Laden and I met Ariel Sharon .
They were concerned about the bin Laden admission .
But they were terrified of the political implications of discussing Sharon and terrorism .
" Have a nice day , Sir , " the guy with the frown said .
And stamped me through in three seconds .
There must be a lesson there somewhere ...

But last week ’s agreement between Nigeria and Russia on a joint gas venture has a name that tops all of those for awkardness :
It probably seemed a good idea at the time .
But Russia ’s attempt to create a joint gas venture with Nigeria is set to become one of the classic branding disasters of all time — after the new company was named Nigaz .
The venture was agreed last week during a four - day trip by Russia ’s president Dmitry Medvedev to Africa .
The deal between Russia ’s Gazprom and Nigeria ’s state oil company was supposed to show off the Kremlin ’s growing interest in Africa ’s energy reserves .
Instead , the venture is now likely to be remembered for all the wrong reasons — as a memorable PR blunder , worse than Chevrolet ’s Nova , which failed to sell in South America because it translates as “ does n’t go ” in Spanish [ … ]

The “ Anti-For ” Campaign Friday , June 26 , 2009
Recently , there has been an effort launched called the “ Anti - If Campaign ” in which they deride the use of if statements and instead , focus on Object Oriented Principles in order to create more flexible designs .
Now certainly , I have a sympathetic ear to this cause as I ’ve seen code that literally walks off the side of the screen due to nesting of if statements .
Pattern matching to me , especially at the top level of the function is actually quite beautiful in a way , such as the implementations in Haskell :
-- Haskell lucas :: Int ->
Integer lucas 0 = 2 lucas 1 = 1 lucas n = lucas ( n - 2 ) + lucas ( n - 1 )
And in Erlang , this also holds true :
% Erlang - module ( lucascalc ) .
- export ( [ lucas / 1 ] ) .
lucas ( 0 ) -> 2 ; lucas ( 1 ) -> 1 ; lucas ( N ) -> lucas ( N - 2 ) + lucas ( N - 1 ) .
Simple , easy to understand and best of all , no if statements .
But , instead of focus on this debate , I ’d like to propose another which strikes closer to this functional programmers heart , the “ Anti-For Campaign ” .
This is simply to say that we should create and use composable functions instead of explicit for loops .
This is actually an old post I had written months ago and until now had been unfinished , but now with some inspiration , it ’ll finally be done .
What and Why ?
Before you throw all sorts of questions asking what and why , let me instead ask a question .
When you ’re writing a loop , ask yourself the question , “ What am I accomplishing in this loop ? ”
Chances are , it might be one of the following :
Query ( Map , Filter , etc )
Aggregation ( Sum , Count , etc )
Perform some side effect
If you ’re doing more than one of those in a single loop , then well , you ’re probably doing too much .
In fact , Martin Fowler ’s Refactoring site has a refactoring called “ Split Loop ” which would solve that issue .
It is better for future refactorings and readability if we keep those loops pointed to do one thing , and one thing only .
Better yet , we could rid ourselves of that loop altogether , and that ’s what we ’ll focus on here .
Looking at first two bullet points , you ’ll notice most of LINQ is indeed built around those two to be able to query data as well as aggregate .
The final bullet point , we perform some sort of side effect , perhaps writing to a file , printing to the console , or even perhaps sending messages .
So , what ’s my problem with them ?
My problem is that it focuses more on the How instead of the What .
Let ’s look at a quick example down below of what I mean .
First , we ’ll attempt to find all prime numbers under 100 using C# as an example language .
First in the How :
static bool Is Prime ( int i ) { var lim = Math .
Sqrt(i ) ; Func < int , bool > check = null ; check = j => j > lim || ( i % j != 0 && check ( j + 1 ) ; return check ( 2 ) ; } static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { var numbers = Enumerable .
Range ( 1 , 100 ) ; var output = new List < int > ( ) ; foreach ( var number in numbers ) if ( IsPrime ( number ) ) output .
Add( number ) ; }
The problem is that if we then want to compose another operation , well , it ’s really hard to do inside of these for loops .
We ’re too focused on the how at this point .
Instead , getting to know generics and lazy evaluation , in .NET 2.0 and beyond , we were able to write generic functions to take advantage of some functional constructs .
This will give us a more declarative style that we can now focus on the what .
static IEnumerable < T > Filter < T > ( this IEnumerable < T > items , Func < T , bool > predicate ) { foreach ( var item in items ) if ( predicate ( item ) ) yield return item ; } static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { var numbers = Enumerable .
Range ( 1 , 100 ) ; var primes = items .
Filter(x => Is Prime(x ) ) ; }
Of course we realize that LINQ already has such constructs built in , so we could rewrite the entire code above in just one statement .
var primes = Enumerable .
Range ( 1 , 100 ) . Where(x => Is Prime ( x ) ) ;
And what ’s better is that it is composable that we could do other operations such as aggregations ( sum , count , etc ) without much additional code :
var primesCount = Enumerable .
Range ( 1 , 100 ) . Where(x => Is Prime(x ) ) . Count ( ) ;
And there you have it .
We not only have a query , but also an aggregation .
Try doing that with those non-composable loops !
Justin Etheredge has a nice writeup as well recently on the subject .
Coping Strategies
Functional languages tend to deemphasize the use of such constructs .
In fact , Haskell has neither a for loop nor a while loop , and languages such as F# and OCaml have limited support for such constructs in terms of no break and continue .
We tend to look at those two in particular with suspicion due to the fact that it cannot return a value and instead it mutates state in some fashion .
With that in mind , how do we cope with the fact that those are n’t available to us ?
Above I showed a basic concept of a filter instead of an explicit loop , but what about some other considerations ?
Some things we might want to consider with some links to some of my previous posts on the subject :
Explicit Recursion
Transforming each item ( Map / Select & SelectMany in LINQ )
Selecting items ( Filter / Where in LINQ )
Aggregating Data ( Folds / Aggregate in LINQ )
In fact , many times that people could consider using explicit recursion could instead use a fold to aggregate the data which then cuts out the issue of tail call optimization .
By truly understanding the goals of LINQ as well as the concepts of functional programming , we can realize that most of the looping that we do can indeed be replaced by the above , outside of side effects of course .
Now What About Those Side Effects ?
Is there a place where we draw the line and say that explicit loops are ok ?
Eric Lippert was recently asked about the reasoning of the lack of the ForEach extension method on IEnumerable < T > .
His response was that he was philosophically opposed to such an endeavor as the whole approach is to cause a side effect .
As IEnumerable < T> collections are immutable , he does n’t believe it makes as much sense because you would n’t be side effecting the collection itself .
Not only that , but introducing closures can complicate object lifetimes and all sorts of potential reference issues .
What about me ?
I understand his concerns , and in C# , I can certainly see where he is coming from .
However , in F # we have such constructs readily available to us in the iter and iteri functions as shown below in F# Interactive :
> let flip f y x = f x y - [ 1 .. 10 ] - |> List.map (( * ) 2 ) - |> List.filter( flip ( % ) 3 >> ( = ) 0 ) - |> List.iter ( printfn " %d " ) ; ; 6 12 18 > [ 1 .. 10 ] - |> List.map (( * ) 2 ) - |> List.filter( flip ( % ) 3 >> ( = ) 0 ) - |> List.iteri( printfn " % d\t %d " ) ; ; 0 6 1 12 2 18
Outside of logging , writing to the console and such are rare in functional programming , so once again , I can certainly understand the concern .
Conclusion
I hope by going through some basic scenarios that we will indeed question our code the next time we see that we are writing that explicit loop with a for and a while .
With a tool chest filled with such functions as transforming every item , to filtering content , to aggregating data and so on , we can realize that we can create composable solutions instead of creating mutable collections or mutable variables and aggregating to them which are not as much .
So , come and join me in the “ Anti-For Campaign ” .
Two years , after we launched the United States ’ first universal health care program , Healthy San Francisco , almost 70 % of previously uninsured San Franciscans are now enrolled in our public program .
Our experience in San Francisco is proving what most Americans already know - it is much less expensive to keep people well than it is to treat their sickness .
This is particularly true when much of the treatment for uninsured Americans is provided in costly emergency rooms .
We are providing health care at a cheaper rate than similar private care options and we are doing this in the middle of one of the worst recessions in history .
The President is making the case for a public plan across the country .
But he needs your help if we are going to defeat the special interests and get Congress to act in our best interests .
As the chair of U.S. Conference of Mayors Health Care Reform Task Force , I am working with both Republican and Democratic mayors to make the case for the President ’s plan to reform the health care system .
As Congress gets closer to taking action on national health care reform we need to make our voices heard .
The stakes are too high .
The health of our nation and its economic recovery depend on it .
We need a public option .
Sign our petition and show your support for President Obama ’s plan to reform the health care system .

For those who have already been there , then you might know how their canteen looks like .
But hey , not many people know how it looks .
Here ’s a look at the beautiful canteen of Harvard University .
Second trip to Kadikchan town – lost city of Russia .

Reader Maria
Thomas writes in regarding my post The Morality of Zeroes :
I once heard Rahm Emanuel ’s brother , Zeke talk about just how hazy our understanding of numbers really is .
His way of putting figures into perspective was the following example :
1 million seconds ago : last week
1 billion seconds ago : Richard Nixon resigns
1 trillion seconds ago : 30,000 B.C .
I thought it was a fabulous illustration and one worth sharing .
State Public Defender Bill Ward recommended against reappointing Mary Moriarty because of her " inability to work " with others .
The full Board of Public Defense is expected to vote at a meeting beginning at noon .
President Obama just hosted the now famous Beer Summit at the White House , where he invited African American Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates and Sergeant Crowley , the two guys at the heart of a controversial misunderstanding , to the White House to hash out their differences over a couple of beers .
Crowley arrested Gates for disorderly conduct on July 16 after a confrontation at the professor ’s home , sparking a media frenzy as Gates accused the policeman of racial profiling .
The Prez was upbeat about how things went .
“ I am confident that has happened here tonight , and I am hopeful that all of us are able to draw this positive lesson from this episode . ”
After reading Sgt. Crowley ’s quote , I ’m not so sure they totally cleared up their issues :
“ I think what you had today was two gentlemen who agreed to disagree on a particular issue , ” Crowley told reporters .
“ I do n’t think that we spent too much time dwelling on the past .
We spent a lot of time discussing the future . ”
I guess that ’s OK for the first of such summit .
I wonder if President Obama busted out a smoke during the summit .
The president has been famously trying to kick the habit since his campaign .
“ I only smoke when I drink , ” I think I overheard the president say .
I guess the President has found a way to tackle all of the issues – global warming , the economy and the crisis in the Middle East – all could be hashed out over a few beers .
Since this Beer Summit was such a success , I suggest President Obama get on Air Force One and point that puppy toward Bourbonnais , IL , where the Chicago Bears open training camp today .
Obama could hold a “ Bear Summit ” with Brian Urlacher and Jay Cutler to get to the bottom of this latest controversy between the Bears linebacker and quarterback .
Former Bears receiver Bobby
Wade created quite a stir when he went on the radio and said that Urlacher called Cutler a “ pussy ” when discussing the new Bears signal caller .
Heck , Obama might even invite the instigator , Bobby Wade , to participate .
I think it could go well , unless the Commander in Chief offers Urlacher a wine cooler .
“ Wine coolers are for pussies , Mr. President , ” Urlacher would probably say .
These Beer Summits could be a regular thing .
A few other suggestions off the top of my head …
Carlos Zambrano and the Gatorade machine .
The Cubs ’ idea of a solution was to take the machine out of the locker room .
Obama could do better .

1. " Suicide is Painless " - M*A*S*H *
You know them and love them ( or maybe you hate them ) - those T.V. theme songs that are so catchy they get in your head for days and refuse to leave .
But how did they come to be in the first place ?
Here are the stories behind 10 of the most famous T.V. theme songs of all time .
I could do 10 more pretty easily - if I missed your favorite , leave it in the comments and I 'll try to include it next time .
The
song was written by Robert Altman 's son , Mike Altman , when he was only 14
years old .
The tune was written by Johnny Mandel , a musician who worked
with Count Basie , Frank Sinatra and Peggy Lee ( among others ) .
Mandel sings
the song as well .
When Altman wrote the lyrics , he told producer Ingo Preminger
that he just wanted a guitar in return , but Preminger insisted that he be
paid the regular way and set up a contract that would give Altman royalties .
He ended up making more than a million dollars , at least according to his
dad , who directed the movie .
Incidentally , Robert only received $ 75,000
for directing it .
2. " Those Were The Days " - All in the Family
According
to series producer Norman Lear , the reason Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton
sang the theme song themselves was simply to save costs .
Although it was
the same thing at the beginning of every episode , there were a few different
versions .
In one , Archie hugs Edith at the end .
In another , Edith smiles
at Archie and he returns the look with one of irritation .
And we should n't
be surprised that the lyrics and music were so memorable : songwriting
duo Charles Strouse and Lee Adams were very good at their jobs , having
already won a couple of Tony Awards ( Bye Bye Birdie and Applause ) .
Another interesting tidbit : after the theme song aired for the first few
times , viewers wrote in and complained that they could n't understand what
the actors were supposed to be saying , especially the line " Gee our old
LaSalle ran great . "
If you 've ever wondered why that line is so clearly
enunciated in the theme song , that 's why - Jean Stapleton recorded her
part again and made sure to speak ridiculously clearly during those words .
3. " The Addams Family Theme " - The Addams Family
Composer
Vic Mizzy wrote the theme song , which is pretty well known , but what is n't
as commonly known is that he wrote the theme song for another very popular
sitcom from the same era .
" The Munsters ? " you might be wondering .
Nope - the other theme song is a true testament to Mizzy 's versatility
- it was Green Acres .
Mizzy also contributed parts to the Mr.
Ed and Petticoat Junction theme songs .
He still receives
royalties every time The Addams Family theme is played , even
when it's on an organ at a baseball game .

4. " The Ballad of Jed Clampett " - The Beverly Hillbillies
This
tune joins the elite group of T.V. theme songs that were so popular they
actually ended up on the mainstream music charts .
The song was written
and composed by Paul Henning , who was also the series ' creator .
The man
who sang the song , Jerry Scoggins , was a stockbroker trying to break into
the music business when he landed " The Ballad of Jed Clampett . "
This luck
break paired him with the legendary Foggy Mountain Boys , who played the
music that backed him .
The Foggy Mountain Boys , Lester Flatt and Earl
Scruggs , were already well established in the country and bluegrass world
and had been members of the Grand Ole Opry for years ... which probably
helped the theme song reach # 44 on the charts in 1962 .
5 . " The Ballad of Gilligan 's Isle " - Gilligan 's Island
What
ended up being one of the most recognizable theme songs of all time started
out as a very amateur recording done in a noisy house .
Sherwood Schwartz ,
the show 's creator , could n't afford to rent a recording studio to get
the theme down , so he called in a favor from a friend with the necessary
equipment .
The only day they could all do it in time for the pilot was
a day that his friends were preparing for a big charity event at their
house , so the song had to be recorded when waiters were n't clattering
silverware and plates and serving trays around .
It took forever to adjust
the levels just right ; they finally got a usable take just as guests were
arriving for the event .
It 's not exactly the one we know today - Sherwood
had injected a sort of calypso solo that did n't make the cut - but it's
the general theme .
And for the first season , the portion of the lyrics
that served as a roll call completely neglected poor Mary Ann and the
professor , saying , " The movie star and the rest , here on Gilligan 's Isle ! "
Schwartz said he never had an inkling that the professor and Mary Ann
would become such popular characters and therefore did n't think to name
them in the theme song .
Although this changed by the second season , Dawn
Wells and Russell Johnson liked to send each other birthday cards and
presents with the signature " The Rest " as a nod to the first theme song .
6. " Happy Days " - Happy Days
For the first two seasons of the show , the theme song was simply an oldie
but goodie - Bill Haley and the Comets ' " Rock Around the Clock . "
And it
served the purpose just fine - it was so popular , in fact , that the song
recharted after nearly 20 years .
After season two , though , they decided
to use an original song instead of Bill Haley's , and fans were already
familiar with it since it was being used as the closing theme music .
" Happy
Days " got bumped up from the end of the show to the front , and the song
has been stuck in our heads ever since .
It was written by Charles Fox
and Norman Gimbel , who gave us the lyrics and music to a ton of other
memorable theme songs : Laverne and Shirley , Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous , Wonder Woman and the score for H.R. Pufnstuf .
" Happy Days " was performed by a roster of studio musicians , including
some of the same guys who sang The Partridge Family theme song .
As popular as the Happy Days theme song was , they decided to
record a new version of it for the show 's final season .
It did n't go over
as well , and I can see why ... check it out for yourself :
7. " Where Everybody Knows Your Name " - Cheers
The
famous theme song was nearly just a recycled song from a Broadway musical
called Preppies .
The producers of Cheers heard it and
thought it would be perfect for their new show if the lyrics were just changed
up a little .
Gary Portnoy and Judy Hart Angelo , the songwriters , were understandably
thrilled - but the producers of Preppies were n't .
They refused
to give up rights to the song .
Portnoy and Angelo were devastated , but the
producers of Cheers told them not to worry - they should just take
a shot at writing something totally new .
The first version , a pretty blatant
rip - off of their first song , was quickly rejected .
After reading a script ,
the duo took a third shot , which was closer - the producers loved some of
the lyrics - but still no cigar .
Version # 3 was rejected .
Portnoy and Hart
were getting a little dejected and concerned that they were going to get
fired any second , and to make matters worse , Gary and his girlfriend had
just broken up .
This set the mood for version # 4 , a melancholy little tune
about the Red Sox losing , being too poor to pay the electric bill and needy
girlfriends who wanted to get married .
They almost decided it was too depressing
for a sitcom , when they came up with the line " Sometimes you wanna go where
everybody knows your name , " and the whole song turned from depressing to
hopeful .
The folks at Cheers loved it , but changed the opening
lines from " Singing the blues when the Red Sox lose , it 's a crisis in your
life , " to the now - famous , " Making your way in the world today takes everything
you 've got . "
The rest is history .
8. " Jeannie " - I Dream of Jeannie
There were three theme
songs composed for the show about a blonde genie and her Master - the first
season featured an instrumental waltz over the opening credits .
And no less
than Carole King wrote a theme song for the series , but Sidney Sheldon rejected
it .
The winning song that we know as the I Dream of Jeannie theme
song today was composed by Hugo Montenegro .
And , believe it or not , there
were lyrics to the song .
Written by Buddy Kaye , this gem was never used
for the show :
Jeannie , fresh as a daisy .
Just love how she obeys me , Does things that just amaze me so .
She smiles , Presto the rain goes .
She blinks , up come the rainbows .
Cars stop , even the train goes slow .
When she goes by , she paints sunshine on every rafter , sprinkles the air with laughter , we 're close as a quarter after three .
There 's no one like Jeannie .
I 'll introduce her to you , but it 's no use sir , cause my Jeannie 's in love with me .
9 . " Thank You For Being a Friend " - Golden Girls
Unbeknownst
to me , this song was n't original to our four happening grannies .
It was
first recorded in 1978 by Andrew Gold , who hit # 25 on the Billboard charts
the same year .
Cynthia
Fee sang it for the show , though .
The song was later reworked a third time for the opening credits to The
Golden Palace .
I hate it .
But check it out !
Don Cheadle !
10 . " The Facts of Life " - The Facts of Life
If you did n't already know this , prepared to be floored : Alan Thicke , better known as Jason Seaver to legions of kids who grew up in the late ' 80s and early ' 90s , co-wrote " The Facts of Life . "
He also co-wrote and sang the theme song to Diff 'rent Strokes .
At the time , Thicke was married to his co-writer Gloria Loring , who sang the " Facts " song you probably remember .
There was also an earlier version that featured the cast of the show singing the wise lyrics , but it was only used for the first season .

I really think this is a bad idea .
Every other site I 've become a member on had / got a membership feature .
And every time the same thing happens .
Suddenly , because of the special forums , privileges , etc. , If you do n't / cant pay for membership , its not really as fun anymore .
All the older members who are more devoted to the either can buy membership or have it donated by adoring fans , so all the " cool people " get membership .
Then all the new people decide the best way for them to get started and be recognized is to buy membership , because that 's what all the older members have .
So the members forum gets spammed up with stupid people ( NOTE : I did n't say " new people " here , as most new members to Instructables actually have a neuron to fire .
But the ones who feel they really need to buy membership to get people to recognize them are usually the dumb ones ) who cant post their bug topics or " AMAZING AIM CONVO !!1 !! " to the " mere mortals " section , and the members forum begins to get annoying .
At the same time , the other forums are full of people who want membership begging for it however they can , complaining about it , etc. , because they all think that its awesome to be pro .
Of course , none of the pro users will admit that its starting to suck , so people finally get it from someone so that they will finally stop begging or break down and BUY it , get access , and after a few hours , agree with the other pro members .
Of course , now they can brag and act godly around normal members because they have a stupid badge / colored name / other member benefits .
I 'm not saying that this will happen to Instructables necessarily , as the membership comes with other benefits besides forum access .
But it will have side effects , just look at all the protesters already .
Instead , I would just have a donate button ( With some thing like a badge , but no real benefits .
Most people would donate just to keep this site running . ) , coupled with new merchandise in the store and more advertising for the store .
You can order wristbands printed with custom words and images to sell , hold design and product contests , sell " Instructables " kits with the parts for popular Instructables ( giving a cut to the authors , of course ) .
All said , I do n't think this pro thing is a good idea .
It might work , but its too much of a deterrent ( in my humble opionion ) , when you charge for half of a free show and tell .
SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - Financier George Soros said on Sunday that China ’s global influence is set to grow faster than most people expect , with its isolation from the global financial system and a heavy state role in banking aiding a relatively swift economic recovery .

He reiterated his cautious views regarding the surge in global stock markets , although he said it may have further to go given liquidity in the markets and that many investors are still sitting on the sidelines .
“ In many ways , Chinese banking has benefited from being isolated from the rest of the world and is in better shape than the international banking system , ” he told an audience at Shanghai ’s Fudan University .
China ’s extensive capital controls have helped to shield its financial institutions from the worst of the global financial crisis .
“ The influence of the state is also greater .
So when the government says ‘ lend ’ , banks lend , ” Soros added .
“ This puts China in a better position to recover from the recession and that is in fact what has happened . ”
New loans by Chinese banks surged to record levels in the first quarter , spurring optimism over recovery prospects for the world ’s third - largest economy .
POSITIVE FORCE
“ China is going to be a positive force in the world and the market , and as a consequence , its power and influence are likely to grow .
Personally , I believe it ’s going to grow faster than most people currently expect , ” Soros said .
He acknowledged that some doubts remain over China ’s economic recovery , however , noting data such as a continued fall in electricity consumption .
He also noted that China ’s aggressive 4 trillion yuan ( $ 586 billion ) economic stimulus program , announced last year , had bolstered the economy .
“ If that program proves inadequate , it is in a position to apply additional stimulus .
China is also in a position to foster a revival of its exports by extending credit and investing abroad , ” he said .
He reiterated his view that because China ’s economy is only one - quarter the size of the U.S. economy , it cannot replace the American consumer as the motor of the global economy , so global growth will be slower than in the past .
He sounded a more upbeat note for China ’s asset markets than for global markets overall , where he remained wary .
“ I ’m pretty cautious .
Even though I ’ve said prices are cheap , I ’m not so optimistic as to put all my money into stocks or assets because I think that the outlook is fairly uncertain .
“ I do , however , think that the Chinese economy is a promising economy .
I think here it is more a matter of finding the right assets rather than saying that I ’m not interested in investing . ”
Asked if the recent climb in global stock markets was a bear market rally , he said : “ It may have further to go because there is a lot of liquidity , a lot of investors are on the sidelines .
If the market keeps on going up , more of them may decide to join in .
You never know how far the rally goes . ”
“ But I certainly do n’t think we are at the beginning of a big bull market worldwide . ”

Ew Factor :
Over the top ...
Maybe it 's because Brooks is just too attractive to resist .
I did NOT just say that .
We just witnessed the beginning of the end for RC planes .
I predict that someone will use of these to attack someone .
Needless to say , RC planes will be banned forever after that .
Never mind that it will do nothing to prevent real terrorists from building and using them .
After nearly hitting a patrol car , the Burn Notice star fails a field sobriety test , police say
With bloodshot and watery eyes and breath reeking of alcohol , Jeffrey Donovan told police he did n’t think he was that impaired when he nearly hit a patrol car in Miami Beach , according to authorities .
“ I really think I ’m only borderline and not too drunk , ” the Burn Notice star said to officers , according to a report .
He also allegedly said : “ The only mistake I made tonight was drinking Benadryl and three glasses of wine . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
That , and failing a roadside sobriety test , police said .
Donovan , 41 , was arrested July 11 after a late - night incident in which his 2009 Audi “ quickly swerved in order to avoid striking the rear of the patrol car , ” his arrest affidavit states .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Air France flight 447 may have stalled at 35,000 feet as it was slowing down to enter a turbulent storm over the Atlantic , leading to its crash .
According to a Paris - based Le Monde story on Thursday , Airbus is preparing new advice for operators of its A330 on flying into storms , warning them to maintain adequate thrust when entering heavy turbulence .
Aircraft typically slow down as they enter storms to minimize turbulence .
The Airbus warning suggests that the A330 flown by Air France and crashed , killing all aboard , may have slowed too much for a storm it was approaching and stalled .
A stall at 35,000 feet would be difficult to recover from for a large , wide - body aircraft , according to media reports .

The news is full of stories about the newly released report made by five Inspectors General regarding additional , previously unknown federal surveillance .
Each inspector contributed to a declassified 38 page report , and also made separate , classified individual reports on behalf of their respective agencies : Department of Justice , NSA , CIA , Department of Defense , and Office of National Intelligence .
This program goes far beyond the Warrantless Wiretapping that made news coverage over the past several years .
The report itself can be read at eff.org
The surveillance we are talking about here includes phone calls , emails , internet activity , text messaging and any other form of communication the government decides they feel a need to inspect , including ‘ snail mail ’ .
The breaking news is in ADDITION to the earlier NSA warrantless wiretapping controversy , not merely a further elaboration on the original surveillance .
This comes on top of the news that Leon Panetta , President Obama ’ s head of the Central Intelligence Agency , has ordered the discontinuation of an eight year program that had not been reported to Congress for oversight as required by law .
House Intelligence Committee members , including subcommittee Congresswoman Jan Schackowsky ( D – IL ) described the program as “ shocking and serious ” , and indicated the program was deliberately kept secret from Congress .

Here is the video of Schackowsky on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show :
The same “ usual suspects ” appear in this new controversy .
Interviewed by the five Inspectors General for the newest report were David Addington , top aide to former Vice President Cheney ; George Tenet , former head of the CIA ; John Ashcroft , former Attorney General .
John Yoo , the former Assistant Deputy Attorney General whose incompetence in the Department of Justice has already received much public attention .
They all REFUSED to be interviewed .
( Oh , and does n’t THAT speak well for the legality of this super - secret surveillance program ? )
New York Times reporters Eric Lichtblau and James Risen in an article appearing July 10th indicate that this newly exposed surveillance was pretty much for nothing in terms of protecting us from terrorism .
And let ’s not forget , in considering our national security efforts , the cyber attacks over the 4th of July weekend that targeted the White House , the Pentagon , the Federal Trade Commission and the Treasury Department .
In May President Obama spoke about his newly proposed security plan , a plan which has been criticized as short on details , but long on spending , costing billions , a plan which is receiving some fairly intense criticism for its questionable privacy guarantees .
But fear not ! for our government is recruiting …. high school hackers to protect us .
Well , to be fair , THAT might actually make us safer , if they ’re given adequate supervision .
Supervision ?
Is n’t that the crux of the issue : Supervision .
Adequate supervision .
Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi and others want to expand the House oversight , to make it actually WORK .
President Obama has threatened to veto those provisions being included in current proposed legislation .
There are a lot of very busy people , poking around in our daily business .
We can only hope that not only are there many many people watching us , but that some of them might actually be watching the bad guys , the dangerous terrorists .
Given that the House of Representatives holds the power of the purse to pay for those federally employed spies and spooks , let us seriously hope that they are given more power to oversee and fund those efforts to defend us from harm , and that they do as much as possible to safeguard our privacy while safeguarding our security .
Security and privacy are not , mutually exclusive .
It is possible to both keep the nation secure and respect the privacy of its citizens .
The night before Barack Obama 's Cairo speech , Max Blumenthal took to the streets of Jerusalem to ask young Israelis and American Jews what they thought of Obama .
Blumenthal calls the results " the most shocking footage I have ever filmed . "
Blumenthal , an American documentary film director and writer , is certainly right , the video is shocking , but not so much for what is said , though it 's all definitely quite jarring to hear , but more for who is saying it .
You just do n't expect ( At least we do n't ! ) young , educated Israelis and American Jews to be saying things on camera like " white power , fuck the niggers " and " anyone who wants to take away my gun rights is an asshole and deserves to get shot " and " he 's a Muslim for sure , he 's like a terrorist . "
You 'd expect them to be a bit more enlightened , but we suppose that this certainly proves that ignorance truly knows no borders , for what follows in this probably worse than any of the Youtube videos of red state right - wingers spouting ignorance to emerge during the election last year or after any of the recent tax day tea parties held around the country .
Blumenthal was assisted with the interviews last night by his friend Joseph Dana , who said this about what they captured on film .
Max and I went on to the streets of Jerusalem at ten o'clock on a Wednesday to ascertain the feelings of the young population about Obama 's upcoming speech in Cairo .
As is often the case , the streets of central Jerusalem were not filled with native Israelis but American Jews .
Doubtlessly anyone who has visited Jerusalem has encountered the droves of American Jewish kids that are sent to Israel to study for a period of time from Teaneck or Westchester .
We asked people a simple question , " What do you think of Obama and Israel ? "
Most of the people that we talked to were dual American Israeli citizens .
The answers in this video reflect the education and worrisome perspectives that many American Jews harbor towards Israeli politics .
The sense of entitlement that the American Jewish community has when it comes to Israeli policy is on full raw display in the words of these young adults .
Based on our interviews these people were from high socio economic backgrounds and had developed thoughts about current Israeli politics .
The question is why more journalists are not covering this story .
All you have to do is walk the streets of Jerusalem and you will find dozens of people that harbor the same beliefs .
As a resident of Jerusalem , I can say that the people represented in this video are not members of a fringe group or simply drunk college kids .
These people reflect the sentiments shared by many people in this country and this city .
These people and their families are the core of the opposition to meaningful peace between Israel and her neighbors .
This is what Obama is up against .
We can't help but wonder if any of these people bothered to watch Obama 's address this morning .
( Ed. note — - This should go without saying , but the drunken , misguided opinions of a few should not be used to pass judgment on a large swath of Jewish / Israeli young people , just as it should n't on all Southerners when similar videos emerge from below the Mason / Dixon line from time to time .
Also , we 've emailed Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Dana with some questions about the video , but being it 's the middle of the night and all , we have n't heard back from either of them yet .
We 'll update the post when and if we do . )

50 million copies will be installed in Europe by 2010 analysts predict
The latest version of Microsoft 's flagship operating system , Windows 7 , is available for pre-order in the UK .
Amazon said that sales of Windows 7 in the first eight hours it was available outstripped those of Windows Vista 's entire 17 week pre-order period .
The home version of the operating system costs around £ 50 , while the professional version costs around £ 100 .
The limited number of pre-ordered copies will be shipped on 22 October , the same day it goes on sale in stores .
Pre-orders are available from a number of retailers , with the period ending on 9 August .
Analysts IDC predict that some 177 million copies of the operating system will be in place by the end of 2010 , 50 million of which will be in Europe .
The firm estimates that products and services surrounding Windows 7 will generate $ 320 bn ( £ 195bn ) .
Discount
The software requires a " clean install " , meaning that prior versions of Windows will have to be removed before Windows 7 can be installed .
Because of a recent European Commission anti-trust ruling , Windows 7 's European version will not be integrated with Windows ' Internet Explorer , meaning that a browser will have to be installed separately .
" Both Windows 7 upgrade packages shot to the top of the Amazon.com software bestsellers chart over in the US as soon as they were made available for pre-order at the end of June , " said Chris Poad , software director at Amazon UK .
" With the significant discount currently on offer , a similar level of high demand was expected in the UK for what is undoubtedly the biggest software release for many years . "

If this is done properly , it ’s a great way to get a guy frothing at the mouth and straining to get loose and ravage you–yes , it is recommended that you restrain him with rope or handcuffs because :
it ’s a huge turn - on for a lot of guys to be restrained while their woman does ‘ naughty ’ things to them , if it ’s done right
for a lot of guys to be restrained while their woman does ‘ naughty ’ things to them , if it ’s done right it keeps him from losing control and jumping all over you part way through your routine before you ’ve finished ( believe me , if you do a good job this is a very real possibility )
We ’re not going to get too complicated here , just some essential bullets on what you ’ll need to have and do , and a couple of instructional videos –you really can learn this in about 10 minutes , the moves are neither complicated nor difficult , and if you can dance at all and have any sense of rhythm then you ’re already miles ahead .
Make It a Surprise or Plan It Out ?
Both Have Their Benefits …
Now , there are two possible ways to go about introducing the idea of a striptease : surprise him , or plan it out with him .
The benefit of surprise is , well , it ’s a surprise , and you probably know your man well enough so that you know whether or not something like this will go over well if you do n’t bring the idea up with him before hand .
The benefit of planning it out with him is that you can find out what sort of outfit or costume ( cheerleader , french maid , school girl , dominatrix , etc. ) , lighting , music , and location he would like to do it in , plus you can work out whether or not he might be ok with something like being restrained ( highly recommended , but if he ’s really against it definitely do n’t force it ) , being naked AND restrained ( oh , fun ) , possibly involving a friend ( female , obviously ) if you ’re both ok with that ( I ’m a guy–can you tell ?
😉 ) which will let you team up and choreograph something together .
If you do that , make sure you set up some guidelines and rules beforehand about who ’s allowed to do what ( touching , how much of her clothing comes off , how you ’re going to make him take a blood oath not to ever tell anyone beforehand , etc. ) .
Clothing and Props
It ’s important to remember that you need to have enough stuff on such that taking it off will give you enough time to do a good striptease , you do n’t want to get ridiculous , but you ’ll definitely want to start out fully dressed plus some sexy lingerie underneath , for example .
It does n’t much matter if what you ’ll be wearing is very uncomfortable or not , since you wo n’t have it on for very long : you can put it on right beforehand , and then you ’ll have it all off in about 30 or 45 minutes .
You do need to be able to move and wiggle about sufficiently –although it might be entertaining if you tripped and fell on your butt it ’s probably not the type of entertainment that you want .
* GREAT prop to have that most people do n’t think of : a straight back chair .
This is an extremely versatile prop that you can make your job ten times easier , as Carmen Electra demonstrates below :
Go with a skirt or a dress ( or a trench coat with just lingerie underneath and stiletto boots that match the coat , always a good choice ) , instead of tight jeans or pants since those will be much harder to take off in a sexy and smooth way .
Stilettos are a must : whether they ’re boots or shoes , they must have stilettos–can you imagine using anything else for a striptease , really ?
It ’s just not right , like drinking anything other than milk with chocolate chip cookies –you could , but it ’s still a terrible idea , and , frankly , downright blasphemous .
Skirts are great for a multitude of reasons : one great move you can do is to turn around and lift up your skirt and show him your panties and a bit of your tushy .
This is a very tantalizing angle ( if it matters , my opinion on this as a straight guy is YES , that is super hot ) .
You could even smack your bottom for him or wiggle it around in his face and tease him with it ( he ca n’t touch , not yet anyway ) .
Go all out on your hair and make up –you ’re putting on a performance for him so you should look the part , plus the better you look the more confident and sexy you ’ll feel and this will come through during your performance .
Also , remember to pull your hair to one side while you ’re dancing , as this shows off your neck and shoulder and is very seductive .

A costume is optional , and this is going to be based entirely on your mans ’ personal tastes : if you know of a certain fetish or preference he has that can be embodied in a cute costume ( cheerleader , dominatrix , french maid , etc. ) , then that would be a great option .
There ’s always the old reliable collared shirt with a pencil skirt , seamed stockings , heels and your hair in a chignon ( use a pencil to hold it up so you can pull it out and shake your lovely locks loose as part of your routine ) .
Great lingerie is essential , and very easy these days to come by , and inexpensively , too .
With the advent of Victoria ’s Secret and Fredericks of Hollywood , sexy cheap knickers are easily available almost anywhere .
Pick something that will show off your best assets and hide your flaws , and take your mans ’ personal taste into account : if you know that he just adores your lovely round rump , then be sure to get something that shows that off for him .

Stockings are great , here ’s why : you can slowly and sensually slide them off , and this is an especially great move if you ’ve got the recommended straight - backed chair to work with , as you can put your legs , one at a time , up on the chair and slowly slide the stocking off with both hands .
You can go even further , if you like , and get garters and suspender belts to go with the stockings , as well .
Also , you could put your foot right between your mans ’ legs or on the arm of his chair , and then slowly slide the stocking off .
Getting a bit of a tan , fake or real , can be a good thing to do a few days beforehand since , although it is a bit cliche , it does a great job of covering your imperfections and emphasizing your good parts , plus it makes you look slimmer and more toned .
Wear a shirt with buttons , it automatically gives you something ( the unbuttoning ) slow , sensual , and revealing that you can do .
Plus , when you take it off , turn around and shimmy it off your shoulders before dropping it to the floor .
Music
I ’ll tell you something that ’s very important but a little counter - intuitive here : choose the music based on what you would like , not him .
Pick the music that makes you feel sexy , seductive , and sultry .
The reason for this is that you ’re the one who ’s going to be dancing to it , he does n’t move , and if it does n’t make you feel sexy and hot , then it ’s really going to cramp your style .
If you want a few suggestions , I found this list on another site about how to striptease , and it ’s full of really great suggestions plus her # 1 suggestion is mine , too , I just could n’t agree more , check it :

What to Do
First , if you ’re really interested in getting into this beyond just a single striptease for someone special , the program that my girlfriend used and got great ( in my opinion 😀 ) results from was Carmen Electra ’s aerobic striptease dvds ( I ’ve got a couple short video clips from it below ) , she assumes you ’re a complete novice and she ’s ( according to my girlfriend ) a great teacher .
A few important tips , and then I ’ll let an expert here get into the specifics of it for you : smile and maintain eye contact as much as possible –this is very important and just makes a world of difference , trust me ( even if your back is turned–turn your head and look back at him coyly ) ; use your hips !
there ’s nothing more mesmerizing than a woman who knows what she ’s doing moving her hips ; it ’s a striptease : be slow , sensual , and …torturous ( in a nice , flirty sort of way ) .
You want him just on the edge of losing control , and , right before he reaches his wits ’ ends , then you finally satisfy him at the end ( we ’re presuming that you ’re doing this for your boyfriend or husband and that there will be sex at the end of it , logically ) .
So that ’s it , and now I ’ll hand it over to …whoever this hot chick is ( demo videos of proper strip teases are also below this , along with some links to exceptionally good sites that I found ) :
What a Well - Executed Strip Tease Looks Like
Carmen Electra does an awesome short strip tease ( notice the straight back chair , plus all the different things she has on that she can play with and take off , like the men ’s button - up shirt ) :
Additional Reading and Further Resources
In addition to Carmen Electra ’s Striptease Collection ( which , again , I highly recommend ) , there ’s also another excellent DVD that ’s focused specifically on stripping / exotic dancing without the aerobics or “ workout ” aspect of it called Exotic Dance : The Irresistible Art that ’s also very good .
This chick , Velma Candyass ( yes , really –love it 😀 ) has got a whole video series of “ How to Strip ” that is just excellent and you can see here : How to Strip Tease Part 1 ( all other parts are on there as well )
