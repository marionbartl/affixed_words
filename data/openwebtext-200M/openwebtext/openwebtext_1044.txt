Silvio Berlusconi says there is nothing in his private life he is ashamed of The escort at the centre of a sex scandal involving Silvio Berlusconi has said the Italian prime minister offered her a seat in the European Parliament .
Patrizia D'Addario told the BBC the plan was abandoned by his party , People of Freedom , after his wife complained .
He also did not pay her to sleep with him , but instead promised to resolve an issue over a building permit , she said .
The allegations follow the release of audio recordings purportedly of their liaison in his official Rome residence .
Mr Berlusconi has not denied that Ms D'Addario attended a party at the Palazzo Grazioli , but insists he did not pay for sex .
Mr Berlusconi 's personal life has been under scrutiny since his wife , Veronica Lario , filed for divorce in May .
She said she could not stay with a man " who consorts with minors " after he attended the 18th birthday party in Naples of an aspiring model , Noemi Letizia .
The prime minister faced further scandal when photos were published of topless women and a naked man at his villa on Sardinia , and also of a celebrity using the prime minister 's official jet to fly to the island .
' Construction project '
Ms D'Addario has said she was paid 1,000 euros ( £ 855 ; $ 1,413 ) by Giampaolo Tarantini to go to a party in October 2008 at the Palazzo Grazioli with 20 other women .
Mr Tarantini , a businessman from Bari , is being investigated on suspicion of corruption and abetting prostitution .

She alleged that she had been asked to return the following month and had spent the night with the prime minister , but was not paid .
In an interview with the BBC World Service 's Europe Today programme , Ms D'Addario said Mr Berlusconi had instead promised to help her " get a construction project moving " in Bari by resolving a problem with planning permission .
" There was an issue that was close to my heart and because of my father 's death , because of his suicide , " she said .
" It needed speeding up , " she added .
" The prime minister said he could help me and that 's why I stayed . "
The proposal to field a string of female candidates angered Veronica Lario But Ms D'Addario said nothing was done to resolve the planning issue and that she was instead offered the chance of being a candidate for Mr Berlusconi 's political party in June 's European parliamentary elections .
The proposal earlier this year that the People of Freedom field a string of female candidates with little political experience , including an actress and a reality TV show contestant , caused widespread criticism throughout Italy , led by Mr Berlusconi 's wife .
" They asked me for my CV , I gave them my CV .
Giampaolo Tarantini took my CV , " Ms D'Addario told the BBC .
" The next day , Giampaolo Tarantini 's secretary called me and said : ' Look , right now Tarantini is with the prime minister and there 's been a problem with the prime minister 's wife , Veronica Lario .
You ca n't be a candidate anymore . '
" ' Veronica Lario is angry , so let 's postpone this whole thing with the European Parliament and the actresses and starlets , ' " she added .
Tape recorder Ms D'Addario said she had decided to record her conversations with Mr Berlusconi independently because since enduring a " negative experience " with a former lover she never left home without a tape recorder and thought it would be prudent .
Ms D'Addario says she spent the night at the Palazzo Grazioli in Rome
She denied that she had been paid for the recordings published by left - wing Italian newspapers , as has been suggested by the prime minister 's allies , including Foreign Minister Franco Frattini .
" I have never been paid by the press to make any kind of interview or revelation , " she said .
" When Frattini accused me of being paid , then I said he should go to the magistrates and prove it .
And if he can't do that , then to stop making those accusations , " she added .
Neither the Italian foreign ministry nor the prime minister 's office were available on Friday for comment on Ms D'Addario 's allegations .
Mr Tarantini 's lawyer , Nicola Quaranta , told the BBC : " We are not going to comment on interviews that Patrizia D'Addario is giving to the media .
" It is strange that during a criminal probe she is even talking to the media about the allegations she made with the judicial authorities in Italy . "
" We do not know until the investigations are completed what Giampaolo Tarantini is accused of .
We do n't think Patrizia D'Addario is telling the truth , " he added .

We ’re on the verge of a serious evolution on the web .
Right now , the common way to include video on the web is by use of Flash , a closed - source technology that is a massive resource hog .
The answer is the HTML5 video tag , which allows you to embed video into HTML pages without the use of Flash or any other non-HTML technology ; combined with open video codecs , this could provide the perfect opportunity to further open up and standardise the web .
Sadly , not even Mozilla itself really seems to understand what it is supposed to do with the video tag , and actually advocates the use of JavaScript to implement it .
Kroc Camen , OSNews editor , is very involved in making / keeping the web open , and has written an open letter to Mozilla in which he urges them to not use JavaScript for HTML video .
Note that Kroc ’s website may not work properly in Internet Explorer .
( Update
The letter has been mirrored in the article , Read More for the full text )
The blog post by Mozilla is supposed to provide a method for website owners to use open video , but still allow browsers that do not support it to fall back to using Flash video .
While this in and of itself is a good idea , the implementation is bad , as it uses JavaScript .
Since the < video > tag is supposed to work like a glorified < img > , this does n’t seem to make an awful lot of sense .
“ Just as you would never expect JavaScript to be required just to view an image ( and bad code be responsible if so ) , the same should be true of video , ” Kroc writes in the open letter .
< video >
Is an element , not a JavaScript object .
The use of JavaScript conjures up a number of problems .
Accessibility is one of them , as screen readers may not be able to play nice with JavaScript code ; it may also hinder the use of WAI - ARIA .
Lesser - known browsers may struggle with JavaScript implementation as well , since web developers may use JS features rarer browsers do not support .
On top of that , the use of JavaScript may lead to security problems , for instance via XSS attacks .
A more philosophical – but no less valid – argument deals with the actual purpose of HTML .
HTML is not restricted to just browsers , and may be parsed by other applications as well , applications which may not support JavaScript at all ( RSS readers , for instance ) .
Robots and spiders could also be hindered by the use of JavaScript .
Merely pointing out an error in ways is easy ; it ’s much harder to come up with a valid alternative .
Kroc has done just that , and what makes it easier is that his “ Video for everybody ” is a far superior implementation than whatever the Mozilla boys and girls came up with .
It degrades peacefully across all platforms and browsers , and makes no use of JavaScript to do so .
Simply put , “ Video for everybody ” uses the < video > tag if your browser supports it , using OGG video .
If your browser does not support it , it falls back to Flash .
Is Flash not supported either ?
QuickTime will be used ( which allows playback on the iPhone ) .
Do n’t have QuickTime either ?
Internet Explorer in Windows Vista and up will switch to Windows Media Player .
But do n’t despair , if none of the above methods allow you to playback the video , a simple notice will appear , which will allow you to download the video in question and play it back from your hard drive .
All this quiet degrading is done with just HTML – no JavaScript required .
As a result , even OWB in AmigaOS4 works with Video for Everybody , showing me a nice download link .
What Mozilla should do
Kroc asks the following of Mozilla :
Remove the content of that blog post and replace it with new content that covers two main factors :
How to insert HTML5 video using HTML and providing levels of fallback for legacy systems
Why providing good fallback options / text is so important to a range of users and devices , and therefore why JavaScript should only be used to enhance a solution rather than be a requirement Adopt HTML5 video ( with fallbacks ) across all Mozilla branded blogs , sites and web properties , unilaterally I personally do n’t have Flash installed , it is – after all – an optional install , and I do n’t like what it does to my computer .
It seems counter to the work you are doing providing HTML5 video in your browser that I can not see your own announcements .
I believe Mozilla need to make a company - wide ( and community - wide ) commitment to using HTML5 video in all of their ventures – past , present and future .
Personally , I support Kroc ’s open letter , and he hopes that more of you will do so .
If you agree with Kroc that the < video > should be used properly , and that it is important to move towards a web that is more open and more standardised than it is now , you can contact Kroc ( Twitter | e-mail ) to have your name added to the list of undersigned .
In addition , you can spread the word , and propagate Kroc ’s open letter to Mozilla , Video for Everybody , or this OSNews item across the web .
The Letter ( Mirror ) : An Open Letter to Mozilla Regarding Their Use and Promotion of HTML5 Video
Dear Mozilla ,
The content of this letter is based upon
this blog post at the
hacks.mozilla.org initiative .
HTML5 video is coming , and a million web developers up and down the web will be soon looking for advice
and sample code to make use of HTML5 video .
Web developers vary massively in skill and understanding of
the open principles of web development , promoted by yourselves via the
Mozilla Manifesto .
We cannot expect all developers to understand the knock - on effect of code snippets that they are copy - pasting from
people ’s sites .
It is one thing to educate people with a piece of code , it is another to communicate effectively
the principles behind a piece of code .
Some developers do not care , and never willâ€ ” that is a fact of life .
In presenting a JavaScript - only method for using HTML5 video , you are promoting to
developers a number of major drawbacks , counter - intuitive to the points outlined in the Mozilla Manifesto .
Accessibility Screen - readers may be presented with a hurdle by a JavaScript solution .
Users may also be using
browsers that developers are very unlikely testing in , who may inadvertedly break support by using
JavaScript features that are either not present , or not compatible with JavaScript implementations in these browsers .
Requiring JavaScript may also hinder use of
WAI - ARIA . < video > is an element , not a JavaScript object
In other blog posts you have promoted the < video > element as a glorified
< img > elementâ€ ” being fundamentally a part of the document with all the same
capabilities CSS - wise .
Some
incredible examples have been
demonstrated that go well beyond what is possible with plugins .
Just as you would never expect JavaScript to be required just to view an image ( and
bad code be responsible if so ) , the same should be true of video .
JavaScript still has no solid security model
By requiring JavaScript , you are also requiring people to switch on JavaScript for
sites that they may otherwise not trust .
Viruses and malware have travelled far by hiding behind videos , and
XSS attacks could be done by forcing people to enable JavaScript for a site so
they can see a video .
Non-aggregatable , mashable
The use of JavaScript promotes a traditional browser - centric model .
As a document
format , HTML goes beyond just the traditional â€˜web - browser ’ and may be parsed in
many ways and environments outside of the traditional browser .
RSS aggregators ( particularly web - based ones ) may not execute JavaScript as a safety measure , thus preventing the user from seeing the content .
Robots and spiders also would not be able to spider HTML5 video content if it is only
present with JavaScript .
That alone could prevent all kinds of innovation that we
cannot yet conceive .
What if a TV station could be created using nothing but
< video > tags found on the web ?
Requiring JavaScript to see
< video > largely puts a stop to mash - ups wanting to pull video from the web .
A Solution Has Been Presented
A solution for using HTML5 video with fallbacks for Adobe Flash , QuickTime and
Windows Media
Player that works on a wide range of browsers without the need for JavaScript
has been developed , it ’s called â€œ Video for Everybody â€ .
The market is made up of more OS es , browsers and processor architectures than it was five years
ago .
More people ( especially geeks ) are browsing with AdBlock / NoScript /
FlashBlock than ever before .
We can no longer just assume people are going to have
Flash and are allowing you to use it .
The same rules apply to video .
If my platform / device / browser of choice cannot see your video , or you do
not offer me the means to download the video to view offline , then I do n’t see whatever it is you ’ve got
to show me .
It helps web developers promote HTML5 video as an equal citizen alongside Flash and
QuickTime .
The necessary playback is chosen automatically based on browser / operating system
capabilities , all without JavaScript .
If the video is not able to play within the browser helpful
fallback text is displayed to offer the users a means of downloading the video file , or how to get the video to play
in the webpage by installing an HTML5 - capable browser , Flash or QuickTime .
This means that it is almost impossible for the user to not be able to view the videoâ € ” one way or anotherâ € ” and they
are not hindered from viewing the content by bad design decisions such as requiring JavaScript to use a
native HTML tag .
What You Can Do
I ask you to please do the following :
The FSA also discourage ' supersize ' chocolate bars Manufacturers are being asked to cut the size of chocolate bars , confectionery and cans of fizzy drink to tackle rising rates of obesity .
By 2012 , the Food Standards Agency wants chocolate - based snacks such as Mars bars to be no bigger than 50g compared with the current 58g size .
Bars of chocolate should be no larger than 40g , a draft consultation warns .
Industry representatives said they were disappointed by continued moves to set " arbitrary targets " .
The voluntary proposals also call for manufacturers to reduce the amount of saturated fat and added sugar in biscuits , cakes , pastries , chocolate confectionery and soft drinks .
A report from the FSA said there had been some progress - such as moves by United Biscuits to cut saturated fat in Digestives , Hob Nobs and Rich Tea biscuits by 50 % .
What we want to do is to make it easier for people to make healthier choices
Gill Fine , FSA
Tesco was also highlighted for removing 110 tonnes of saturated fat from its cakes by the end of 2008 .
But when it comes to chocolate bars , EU rules restrict sugar and fat reductions , making reformulation difficult , the FSA said .
Reductions are however possible through cutting portion sizes , it added .
Chocolate bars , such as Dairy Milk and Yorkie , including those with added fruit and nuts , should weigh no more than 40g , the FSA said .
And chocolate products with " fillings " such as Mars bars , Twix and Snickers , should weigh no more than 50g and their saturated fat content be cut by at least 10 % .
HAVE YOUR SAY
How does the size of the bar matter - folks will buy two if they do n't get the kick they want Roger , Sheffield Cans of fizzy drinks should be cut from 330 ml to 250 ml by 2015 , the FSA recommended .
And single portions of sugar - containing still and juice drinks should also be no more than 250 ml .
Obesity epidemic
On current trends around 60 % of Britons will be obese by 2050 .
Health problems associated with obesity already cost the NHS £ 4.2bn a year , a figure that is set to double by 2050 .
Almost nine out of 10 children aged seven to 14 drink fizzy drinks and 34 % of 11 - 16 year - olds consume chocolate at least once a day , figures show .
CURRENT CHOCOLATE SIZES Mars bar 58g Snickers 58g Kit Kat Chunky 50g Dairy Milk 49g Galaxy 46g Yorkie 68g Gill Fine , director of consumer choice and dietary health at the FSA , said they recognised the achievements already made by some manufacturers .
" But to make even greater progress it 's important that everybody gets behind our recommendations on saturated fat , added sugar and portion sizes .
" What we are not doing is telling people what to eat .
" What we want to do is to make it easier for people to make healthier choices - to choose foods with reduced saturated fat and sugar - or smaller portion sizes . "
Julian Hunt , director of communications at the Food and Drink Federation , said manufacturers had been working on cutting sugar and fat in their products for a number of years but there were significant technical , financial and consumer challenges that companies have to overcome .
" Policy makers need to be realistic about the pace at which our members can be expected to keep delivering new innovations - particularly in the current recession , " he said .
He added that they were committed to working with the FSA but reformulation was just one option .
" We are disappointed that it appears to remain committed to setting arbitrary targets for specific nutrients in certain foods , rather than focusing on the need for everyone to achieve a balanced diet and lifestyle . "

A chat with Pete Yorn , Pete Yorn interview , Back and Forth , Scarlett Johansson
Music Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
It may seem like a while since we last heard from Pete Yorn , but the man has kept himself extremely busy .
He ’s on the road for the first time in two years – opening for Coldplay , no less , before starting a solo tour – and has not one but two new albums : Back and Fourth , his first album since 2006 , and Break Up , a duets record with the lovely Scarlett Johansson , set for release in September .
Bullz - Eye caught up with Yorn to talk about Scarlett ’s smoky voice , working with Mr. “ Welcome to the Boomtown , ” and how he only recently came to appreciate one of New Order ’s most popular songs .
Bullz - Eye : I realize that looking at your tour schedule , I am interrupting one of your days off , so I appreciate that .
Pete Yorn :
There are no real days off .
There ’s always something happening .
BE : True , true .
How is this tour going ?
PY : Great so far .
You know , it ’s early going , I think we just played our fifth show last night .
But it has been really great .
BE : I was wondering , one of the things that I was thinking about was with your new album , when you put it out on iTunes originally and you sent out , I think it was a Facebook message that I saw , that basically said this was your “ Letting Go ” .
So I was just wondering if you care to elaborate on what you meant by that and what this album Back and Fourth meant to you .
PY : Probably a few things .
In one way , just lyrically these are like the most straight - up lyrics I have ever written , I think .
And I purposely did that just because I was in a place where I was just curious how my songs would be if I just kind of laid stuff out there in a very straightforward way .
Because I do n’t know if you know my older stuff but it ’s pretty cryptic sometimes .
BE : Definitely .
" I woke up after having what seemed like a dream but more just like a shot of adrenaline , like ‘ Oh my god , I left the oven on ’ or ‘ I ’m late for school . ’
Instead it was ‘ Oh , I ’ve got to make a duets record . ’ "
PY : Yeah , so this was just a place in my life that I purposely did that .
I wanted to see what it would be like .
And I kind of was feeling like , if I ’m really straightforward about certain things I ’m feeling and I feel a certain way , I ’m curious if other people will respond to that or feel that way as well .
I figured that they would , to some regard .
Another aspect I think was the way I made the record .
I ’m usually so hands - on with the production and all the instrumentation .
This was a big departure from being there .
I brought in other players to play .
And even though that was also something I set out to do purposely , it was still hard for me when I was actually doing it .
I was like , “ Oh shit , I miss playing some of the stuff . ”
So it was an exercise for me in that regard .
It was kind of a stretch for me , but it was an interesting experiment , you know ?
BE : You talked about normally you want to play things and you are much more hands - on , yet you seem to collaborate quite a bit .
Everything from the upcoming Scarlett Johansson album to what you did on Nightcrawler especially , where you collaborated with a lot of folks .
Do you reach out to others to collaborate , or do they come to you ?
PY : It depends .
Obviously I reached out to Scarlett .
Well , maybe not obviously , I do n’t know , I reached out to Scarlett .
Sometimes people will suggest a producer or something .
Or someone I want to work with , you know , I ’ll reach out to .
Yeah , as far as that stuff , usually I ’ll just kind of have my eye on somebody and reach out to them .
BE : On Nightcrawler , the song “ Alive ” was credited to you and Baerwald .
Is that David Baerwald ?
PY : Yeah .
BE : I really enjoyed that .
PY : Yeah .
I was driving with Christy , who just connected us on the phone .
She was driving me to Anaheim , to our show there the other night .
And somewhere in her car , like in the side pocket of her door , she had the David & David CD .
Me and my friend were like , “ What the hell are you doing with this ? ”
She loves that record .
BE : Yeah , I still own it on vinyl , back in the day .
That ’s a great album .
PY : Yeah , he ’s an interesting cat , that guy David Baerwald .
He was fun to work with , we had a good time .
A lot of good conversation .
BE : I ’ve read in places that for Nightcrawler , you recorded something like 50 songs .
And you recorded the album with Scarlett three years ago .
It ’s been a while since you ’ve been on tour , correct ?
PY : Yeah , before I started with Coldplay in May I had n’t toured since 2007 .
September of [ 2007 ] was my last show at Austin City Limits Festival .
BE : Do you find that like being on tour actually inspires creativity and inspires your songwriting ?
Or is it more about just perfecting the show and that kind of thing ?
PY : In the past … right now , this new touring experience is new for me so I ’m still feeling it out .
I have a different approach to it .
But in the old days , traditionally , I would n’t really write much on tour .
I would come up with a few ideas here and there but it would be that kind of …also , when I ’d come home and everything would come to a grinding halt , and then I would start to get really restless and freaked out .
That ’s when I ’d start writing the songs .
So yeah , usually when I ’m on the road I ’m just moving too fast .
And I ’m taking it all in and I ’m focusing on the shows .
I think when I get a chance to slow down is when it all starts coming .
BE : You said this tour experience is new for you .
How is it new ?
PY : Well I ’ve got a great new band , and I ’m really loving the freshness of that .
You know , playing with them every night .
And my head is just a lot clearer these days , I ’m just more focused and not missing the road as it ’s going by .
I ’m able to take it all in and be present .
I ’m curious to see if it does end up affecting my writing , where I do start writing on the road .
BE : What , to you , makes a good touring experience ?
What makes a good show ?
I mean sure , the crowd being into it , but what do you look for to say , “ Yeah , that was successful ” ?
PY : You know , I think you ’ve got to be prepared to an extent , obviously .
And that helps me feel better about going into it .
And you need sparks , you know ?
I think that this band has a good balance of players who are just excellent technical players , but they have a really raw energy to them where we feed of each other and we ’re able to almost ride off the rails without riding off the rails .
So so far , I feel like the shows have had this kind of loose intensity that is bringing a really good dynamic to the overall live environment that we have .
Which I do n’t know if I ’ve had .
I think this is the best band I have ever toured with .
I think they are amazing .
" In the old days , I would n’t really write much on tour .
I ’d come home and everything would come to a grinding halt , and then I would start to get really restless and freaked out .
That ’s when I ’d start writing the songs . ”
BE : I do n’t know actually who is touring with you .
Who is in your band ?
PY : One guy who has been with me since the beginning is Joe Kennedy , he plays piano .
On guitar and playing a lot of mandolin too is Jonny Polonsky , who also came to Omaha and played on the record .
The drummer is this guy Scott Seiver , who is amazing .
The other guitar player is this guy Mark Noseworthy and the bass player is Zak Schaffer , who has actually played with me in the studio in the past a little bit .
He played on the studio version of “ Ice Age ” and “ The Man , ” also from Nightcrawler .
BE : Yeah .
“ Ice Age ” is definitely one of my favorites .
PY : Cool .
BE : So you did n’t have much time between the Coldplay tour and this tour , did you ?
PY : Let ’s see , that wrapped up June 5 , I think , something like that .
And then this started July 9th .
But in between that I had a little break , but I had two weeks of promo when the record came out , in New York and L.A .
So we were pretty busy through that middle June period .
BE : So are you happy with the album ?
I ’ve read in the past that sometimes you do n’t go back and listen to your old albums .
PY : I think it came out well .
A lot of it is a mood thing for me , so sometimes I ’m in the mood to listen to one thing and other times I ’m in the mood to listen to something else .
So there could be a morning where something from Back and Fourth will come on my shuffle and I ’m like “ Eh , ” skip and I want to hear something else .
Then sometimes the same song will come on and I ’m like “ Oh , this sounds great today . ”
You can view that as not being into …maybe I did n’t like it or something like that .
And then I realized some of my favorite Guided by Voices songs , or Smiths songs , or Springsteen songs will come on and some days I feel like skipping them , too .
So I ’ve got to put it in perspective for myself .
For me , it ’s the process .
You know , the process was a learning experience and once it ’s done , it ’s out there .
I ’ll tell you one thing , I really enjoy playing the songs live , so I think that ’s a good gauge .
BE : A number of the songs seem to refer to somebody specifically , or maybe multiple somebodys .
Is there somebody specific that you were thinking of ?
PY : Yeah , certainly , these are very personal songs .
[ Note : we were hoping Yorn might elaborate just a tad more than this .
Not to be . ]
BE : You probably have had questions in the past about what you consider your first three albums and the trilogy .
But if you look back on those now , and you reflect on what you were doing with your original work and where you are going now , how could you sum up what your first three studio albums were about , and how is that shifting now ?
" ’ Bizarre Love Triangle ” was never even one of my favorite New Order songs .
It might have been too popular for me .
Then I read the lyrics and I was like , ‘ Holy shit , these are great . ’ "
PY : It ’s always hard to know when you are in the moment , exactly what ’s going on .
Some people might be keener at figuring that out than me , I do n’t know .
But yeah , in hindsight it ’s easier to see what was going on .
Like with the first record , you only have that once , the first time .
There are no outside expectations going into it other than what you want to do yourself .
I remember making the first record and I see a parallel with that , kind of the freedom of making that first record and just the natural , really good flow that that had , the process .
I see a parallel with that and making the Break Up record that I made .
That is coming out in September .
Those two , for some reason , stick out in my head as the most enjoyable records that I made , process - wise .
I ’m not sure why , I just think those were where I was in a state where I just … I do n’t know .
I just kind of was keeping it closed , I was n’t really sharing it until it was almost done .
I do n’t know , they were good experiences .
But I ’m sorry , I cut you off .
BE : That ’s quite all right .
When you say you were keeping it close and not sharing it , were you talking about the first album or later ?
Or the Break Up album ?
PY : The Break Up record , for certain .
The Break Up record was the first one I made where I recorded it from beginning to end , and did n’t play it for anybody outside of me and Sunny [ Levine , the album ’s producer ] and Max , my cousin who was there making it with me , and Scarlett , until it was completely finished .
I just did n’t want anything from the outside influencing me on it .
I had fallen susceptible to that , for some reason .
I wanted to just take it all back , I remember , when I made that record , and just see what would happen .
BE : “ Relator ” is a phenomenal song .
You wrote all the songs for it ?
PY : Yeah , I wrote all the songs expect for there is one cover on there .
It was a Chris Bell song called “ I Am the Cosmos . ”
BE : And you reached out to Scarlett .
How did that happen ?
PY : I texted her .
I knew her from since she was , like , 17 .
I had n’t seen her in a few years at that point , but I do n’t know if you read about it …
I woke up after having kind of a weird , what seemed like a dream but more just like a shot of adrenaline .
I just kind of woke up with a start , like “ Oh my god , I left the oven on ” or “ Oh my god , I ’ve got to take out the garbage ” or “ I ’m late for school .
” Instead it was “ Oh , I ’ve got to make a duets record , ” it was like that type of thing , just in my head .
I thought Scarlett would be good .
At the time , it was awhile ago and it was before she made her record .
I did n’t know if she could sing or anything .
But for some reason I just thought of Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot , not that I even knew much of their music at the time , but I just … I do n’t know , it was just in my brain .
When I thought of Brigitte , I just thought of Scarlett .
And it was this big chain reaction of boom , boom , boom .
Next thing I know I texted Scarlett and said we ’ve got to make a record .
She texted me back and said all right , let ’s do it .
BE : Her voice has a smoky , almost bluegrass -y at times sound to at least the one song I have heard .
It makes me want to go pick up her own album .
PY : She sings a little differently on her record .
It ’s kind of playing a different part .
But I think on this record , we were just kind of doing something that worked with both our voices together .
And so I think it kind of just naturally evolved into something with a slightly different flavor .
BE : Are you two thinking of doing any live shows ?
PY : We ’re hoping to do some stuff .
Yeah , definitely hoping to do a few things .
You know , I would n’t expect any crazy , marathon tour or something like that .
But yeah , hopefully we ’ll get together .
It was cool , like the record just sat in my closet for a long time and then I started sharing it and it was sounding good .
And we talked about it and I had n’t seen her probably in the two years since we made the record .
So we got together with just my acoustic guitar just to hang out and sing and see what it felt like , and it was just right in there .
She sounds exactly like she sounds on the record naturally .
When I listened to the record after awhile , I was like , “ What was that effect we put on her voice ? ”
And there is really no effect on her voice , she just sounds like that naturally .
She sounds like she is singing out of an old microphone .
BE : I was going to ask that later , if you did an effect .
And you did n’t , that ’s amazing .
PY : Yeah .
It ’s real .
She just sounds like that .
She ’s got like a vintage voice box or something .
It ’s funny .
BE : Looking through your set list , you ’ve done a number of interesting covers .
How did the cover of “ Bizarre Love Triangle ” come up ?
PY : Somehow , that was never even one of my favorite New Order songs .
Even though I love New Order and I liked the song , but that was a cool song but it might have been too popular for me .
I do n’t know what the deal was with me .
Then I read the lyrics .
They somehow were in front of me a few months ago and I read the lyrics and I was just like , “ Holy shit , these are great ” .
And they just kind of …they really resonated with me so I started singing the song .
That ’s usually … it usually will be the lyrics .
BE : Well thank you very much .
I really appreciate your time here .
And good luck on the tour and I will hopefully see you soon .
PY : All right , take it easy , man .
Thank you .
BE : Thanks Pete , very much .
Bye - bye .
You dirty rat : Daring rodent shows puzzled leopard exactly who 's boss by stealing its lunch
Advertisement
It 's not so much snatching victory from the jaws of defeat as dinner from the jaws of danger .
But even the imposing presence of an adult leopard at feeding time is not enough to get between plucky young Rattus Norvegicus ( better known as the brown rat ) and a free meal .
This extraordinary series of images were captured by photography student Casey Gutteridge , as he trained his camera on the leopard for a course project .
Excuse me ?
A perturbed Sheena the leopard looks on as a cheeky mouse nibbles her food at the Santago Rare Leopard Project in Hertfordshire ...
The little rat - thought to be only two to three months old - was spotted scampering into the leopard 's enclosure shortly after feeding time at the Santago Rare Leopard Project , in Hertfordshire .
So intent was the plucky rodent on its mission to snatch a tasty snack , that it seemed not to notice that its path was taking it within a whisker 's breadth of 12 - year - old Sheena .
Clutching a corner of raw meat with its tiny paws , the rat busily tucked in , until it sensed one of those whiskers moving in .
Sheena , bemused by the interloper coming between her and the remains of dinner , padded over on paws big enough to wreak vengeance with a single swipe .
But rather than giving the thief at very least the hearty set down it deserved , she gingerly lowered her nose for an exploratory sniff .
Rattus paused , lifted its dainty pink claws in submission , then - obviously deciding on a nothing - ventured - nothing - gained approach - continued to tuck in .
And after another tentative investigation , Sheena gave the leopard equivalent of a shrug and turned away .
... but even a gentle shove does not deter the little creature from getting his fill ...
Mr Gutteridge , 19 , from Potters Bar , Hertfordshire , thought the rodent was a mouse .
Mr Gutteridge said : ' I have no idea where it came from - he just appeared in the enclosure after the keeper had dropped in the meat for the leopard .
' He did n't take any notice of the leopard , just went straight over to the meat and started feeding himself .
' But the leopard was pretty surprised - she bent down and sniffed at it and flinched a bit like she was scared .
' It was amazing , even the keeper who had thrown the meat into the enclosure was shocked - he said he'd never seen anything like it before . '
An expert at the Wildlife Trust said the creature was in fact a young and ' inexperienced rat ' , identifiable by its big paws and ears and more importantly its bald , scaly tail with a thick base .
Leopard project owner Jackie James added : ' My son threw meat in for the photographers and it just appeared .
Sheena batted it away but it just came back .
The determined little thing took no notice and just carried on . '
... so the mouse continued to eat the leopard 's lunch and show the leopard who was boss
Sheena was brought in to the Santago Rare Leopard Project from a UK zoo when she was just four months old .
She is one of 14 big cats in the private collection started by Jackie 's late husband Peter in 1989 .
The African leopard can be found in the continent 's forests , grasslands , savannas , and rainforests .
The leopard is the most elusive of all the big cats .
They are solitary animals and are primarily nocturnal - preferring to hunt at night .
The species is also a strong climber and is capable of killing prey larger than itself .
The leopard 's prey ranges from fish , reptiles and birds to smaller mammals such as hares and monkeys .
A stealthy hunter , leopards are known to stalk close to their prey and run a relatively short distance on the hunt .
1. African -American people
For a brilliant writer and perceptive chronicler of the human psyche , there ’s a whole lot that Woody Allen , or at least the Woody Allen we know from his movies , just does n’t seem to understand .
Allen ’s charming , maddening new movie , Whatever Works , provides another in - depth glimpse into the strengths and weaknesses of his neurotic , acerbic , New York - centric worldview .
Allen is a whiz at exposing the anxieties and desires of the upper - middle - class Manhattan smart - set , but his blind spots are legion .
Take African - Americans for example .
Allen named his son after the great pitcher Satchel Paige and has a deep abiding love for jazz .
But African - Americans have , by and large , been conspicuously absent from Allen ’s films .
Allen very tardily tried to rectify that situation by casting Chiwetel Ejiofor in 2004 ’s hopelessly muddled Melinda And Melinda — a veritable master class in all the shit Woody Allen does n’t get — as an impossibly suave , unthreatening musician so improbably perfect he makes Sidney Poitier look menacing .
Congratulations , your progressive treatment of race just caught up with 1967 ’s Guess Who ’s Coming To Dinner .
2. The American South
Complaining to a friend about the insularity of New York in Annie Hall , Allen says , “ Do n’t you see the rest of the country looks upon New York like we ’re left - wing , communist , Jewish , homosexual pornographers ?
I think of us that way sometimes and I live here . ”
So if that ’s how the rest of the country sees New York , how does New York see the rest of the country ?
Based on Whatever Works , Allen ’s vision of the South is pretty much the opposite of New York , populated by right - wing , Christian , uneducated yokels ( and closeted homosexuals ) who devote themselves to intellectually vapid pursuits like beauty pageants .
When teenage runaway Evan Rachel Wood arrives in Manhattan from backwater Mississippi , she ’s an empty vessel that David can fill with his misanthropic “ wisdom . ”
Her conservative parents ( Patricia Clarkson and Ed Begley , Jr. ) arrive later in their Sunday best , but their regressive Southern values are easily tamed by the bohemian polyamory and tolerance of the big city .
Being Southern is a disease that New York City can apparently cure .

3. Great Britain
Back in 2005 , Match Point was widely hailed as a major comeback for Allen , who seemed refreshed after leaving New York to stake out new territory in the British Isles .
British critics were not so kind : Allen ’s decision to repurpose a thriller set in the Hamptons for London made for a vivid change of scenery , but his cultural tone - deafness showed , too .
Guardian / Observer critic Peter Bradshaw dismissed his portrait of upper - crust Brits as “ quaintly conceived , ” took issue with dialogue that “ sounds clenched , stilted and occasionally plain bizarre ” ( and also contained lots of egregious mispronunciations and errors ) , and resented Allen ’s tourist ’s gloss on the city itself .
Allen did n’t much improve with 2007 ’s Cassandra ’s Dream , which attempted to tell the same reheated Crimes And Misdemeanors story from the other half of the class spectrum .
The two “ cockney ” brothers played by Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell sport accents so egregiously inauthentic that Uncut critic Stephen Trousse mocked them as “ wavering between Dick Van Dyke and Tony Curtis doing Cary Grant in Some Like It Hot . ”
And Allen ’s understanding of working - class South London is n’t much more nuanced .
The bickering family in Cassandra ’s Dream looks virtually interchangeable with their counterparts in Annie Hall or Radio Days ; the only difference is that the brothers in Cassandra ’s Dream have access to a yacht .
4. The Female Psyche ( post - Husbands And Wives )
Woody Allen is a fascinating paradox .
He ’s written some first - rate roles for women and guided multiple generations of actresses to their defining performances .
Then , in 1994 , the part of Allen ’s brain that understands women apparently exploded and his female characters became a thinly sketched parade of castrating shrews ( Christina Ricci in Anything Else being an especially egregious example ) and vapid , rampaging sexpots intent on bedding Allen and his countless surrogates .
With Melinda And Melinda ,
Allen set out to showcase the formidable talents of Australian actress Radha Mitchell and ended up giving her two terrible , borderline unplayable roles , one comic , one dramatic .
Mira Sorvino picked up an Oscar playing a sentient Playboy Party Joke of a hooker with a heart of gold in 1996 ’s Mighty Aphrodite .
But the ultimate late - period Allen female creation is Samantha Morton in 1999 ’s Sweet & Lowdown .
She ’s cute , sad , supportive , and completely mute .
On the upside :
The carefully crafted women of last year ’s Vicky Cristina Barcelona suggest that this situation might be righting itself .
5. Gentiles
Despite the fact that the goyim of America make up a large chunk of his audience , Woody Allen does n’t quite seem to get them , despite his romances with people named Farrow and Keaton .
In Annie Hall , it ’s easy to get the impression that Alvy Singer gets off on dating a non-Jewish girl from the Midwest in the same way he would if he showed up at a party with a space - alien on his arm .
Gentiles are so lacking in neurosis — which , in a Woody Allen movie , is essentially the trait that defines humanity — that they might as well be robots .
Indeed , Woody ’s robot butler in Sleeper seems more natural and unaffected than the chilly , affected Gentiles who populate films like September and Alice .
6. Los Angeles
Woody Allen ’s films seem to be funded by a mysterious cabal of Europeans , well - heeled New York comedy buffs , and clarinet aficionados .
He therefore has no use for the motion picture industry , or for its Los Angeles headquarters .
His characters seem vaguely aware that there is a place called Hollywood , and that it ’s geared towards the production of movies that people in Woody Allen movies would never see , but otherwise they react to any suggestion of La-La Land with the kind of revulsion that most people reserve for “ Best Fascist Dictator ” Adolf Hitler .
Woody ’s famous line about California — that its only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light — only rings false because obviously , he ’s never driven a car in his life , and would n’t know that you ca n’t do that in New York , too .
Speaking of …

7. Driving
It ’s hard to imagine Allen behind the wheel , but maybe that ’s because 1977 ’s Annie Hall made his driving neuroses a fundamental character trait .
As a kid , Allen ’s Alvy Singer worked out aggression via bumper cars , impeding his ability to drive as an adult .
When he attempts to drive during a trip to Los Angeles , he can’t leave a parking lot without ramming other cars and smarting off to a police officer .
He ’s uneasy as a passenger , too — first with a flighty Keaton behind the wheel , then with her potentially psychotic brother Christopher Walken , who confesses to him , “ Sometimes when I ’m driving on the road at night , I see two headlights coming toward me fast .
I have the sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly , head - on into the oncoming car .
I can anticipate the explosion .
The sound of shattering glass .
The flames rising out of the flowing gasoline . ”
Hmm , Allen should probably stay off the road .
8. Violence
For a guy who ’s made a handful of murder - mysteries , Woody Allen seems to have the same attitude toward violence that most people have toward sewage disposal :
They know it exists , but dwelling on the details is unpleasant and probably offensive .
Whenever his movies make reference to war , they might as well bring up “ Yakety Sax ” on the soundtrack ; references to the Holocaust are generally used as punchlines .
And in his murder - mysteries , the violence itself is usually handled with the lightest touch this side of Agatha Christie .
Crimes
And Misdemeanors begins this tradition , and it has n’t gotten any less ridiculous over time ; in Woody Allen movies , violence is something that happens to other people , and then it ’s only to get the plot rolling so he can do what he ’s really good at .
It ’s this reluctance to portray things that make him feel icky that made Joe Queenan observe : “ The only thing Woody Allen has in common with Ingmar Bergman is Sven Nykvist . ”

9. Bob Dylan
Give him this much credit :
It takes a certain kind of courage to mock one of the best loved and most respected musicians in the history of modern pop music .
In 1977 , Bob Dylan was still very much in the public eye .
He ’d released Blood On The Tracks , one of the all - time greats , only two years before , and was still touring regularly when Annie Hall hit theaters .
But despite Dylan ’s critical acclaim , Allen was n’t a fan , and there ’s no greater way to slander an artist than through the praise of an idiot .
While trying to get over his breakup with Diane Keaton , Woody Allen goes on a date with music reporter Shelley Duvall .
She throws out words like “ transplendent , ” she ’s nearly impossible to please sexually , and worst of all , she ’s a devoted Dylan fanatic , prone to quoting from “ Just Like A Woman ” in rapturous , vapid tones .
“ And she aches just like a woman / But she breaks just like a little girl , ” is beautiful when sung , but in this context , it sounds like the brain - dead meanderings of some college poet high on empty profundity .
10 . Modern music in general ; rock music in particular
The vast majority of Woody Allen ’s films are set in New York , a city that gave us Brill Building pop , American punk , and hip - hop .
But as far as he ’s concerned , the music scene stopped evolving approximately three years after he was born .
Every time contemporary music rears its ugly head in a Woody Allen movie , it ’s the subject of scorn and derision , from his mockery of Annie Hall ’s Fillmore East program to his reaction , in Hannah And Her Sisters , to Dianne Wiest ’s taking him to a punk club .
He acts like rock music was invented specifically to get on his nerves .
Even his famous love of jazz , documented in the inappropriately named Wild Man Blues , focuses on traditional New Orleans styles from the teens .
In Woody ’s universe , even post - bop and cool jazz seem like intolerable intrusions on music as it should be ; if Charles Mingus or Miles Davis ever showed up at one of his parties , he ’d probably call a cop .
Allen ’s beyond - arms - length distance from rock did lead to the one funny line in Hollywood Ending , though , when Allen told his silly cartoon of a punk - rock son , “ I love you Scumbag X . ”
Punk might just be silly names and abrasive noise to Allen , but the bond he shares with Scumbag X remains profound .

11 . Independent And International Cinema After 1975
Allen studied at the feet of the masters and makes no attempt to hide it .
Many of his films recall the style of great directors like Ingmar Bergman and John Cassavetes , paying homage while — usually , anyway — not letting the mimicry get in the way of his own artistic personality .
But the films of others , or at least others to which Allen likes to pay tribute , pretty much ends with late - period Federico Fellini .
Allen ’s casting choices could double as time capsules for which actors were bubbling up at the time of the film ’s production .
( If that ’s Juliette Lewis , this must be 1992 . )
But when he wants to try on another director ’s tricks , he tends to return to the same sources , the stuff that made the deepest impression while he was still finding his own voice .
12 . Recreational Drug Use
Woody Allen worships all things intellectual ; for him , life is n’t something to be experienced so much as catalogued , criticized , and over - considered .
It ’s not really a surprise then that he ’s not much into things that make analysis an after - thought .
But it ’s not just that Allen abstains from spirits and drugs ; the very concept of other people willingly clouding their judgment for pleasure baffles him to the core .
In one scene mid-way through Annie Hall , he tries to explain his reservations .
Diane Keaton is n’t much interested in sex , and wants to get high before they screw , and Allen is n’t having any of it .
First he dismisses pot ( “ Yeah , grass , right ?
The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday ” ) , then complains that making love to a woman who ’s high makes the whole experience a cheat , like getting a laugh from a stoned audience .
As always with Allen , he ’s a little ridiculous and a little right at the same time .
Graphene is an atomic - scale honeycomb lattice made of carbon atoms .
By Dr. Thomas Szkopek , via Wikipedia
Imagine a carbon sheet that 's only one atom thick but is stronger than diamond and conducts electricity 100 times faster than the silicon in computer chips .
That 's graphene , the latest wonder material coming out of science laboratories around the world .
It 's creating tremendous buzz among physicists , chemists and electronic engineers .
" It is the thinnest known material in the universe , and the strongest ever measured , " Andre Geim , a physicist at the University of Manchester , England , wrote in the June 19 issue of the journal Science .
" A few grams could cover a football field , " said Rod Ruoff , a graphene researcher at the University of Texas , Austin , in an e-mail .
A gram is about 1/30th of an ounce .
Like diamond , graphene is pure carbon .
It forms a six - sided mesh of atoms that , through an electron microscope , looks like a honeycomb or piece of chicken wire .
Despite its strength , it 's as flexible as plastic wrap and can be bent , folded or rolled up like a scroll .
Graphite , the lead in a pencil , is made of stacks of graphene layers .
Although each individual layer is tough , the bonds between them are weak , so they slip off easily and leave a dark mark when you write .
Potential graphene applications include touch screens , solar cells , energy storage devices , cell phones and , eventually , high - speed computer chips .
Replacing silicon , the basic electronic material in computer chips , however , " is a long way off ... far beyond the horizon , " said Geim , who first discovered how to produce graphene five years ago .
" In the near - and medium - term , it 's going to be extremely difficult for graphene to displace silicon as the main material in computer electronics , " said Tomas Palacios , a graphene researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
" Silicon is a multibillion - dollar industry that has been perfecting silicon processing for 40 years . "
Government and university laboratories , long - established companies such as IBM , and small start - ups are working to solve difficult problems in making graphene and turning it into useful products .
Ruoff founded a company in Austin called Graphene Energy , which is seeking ways to store renewable energy from solar cells or the energy captured from braking in autos .
The Pentagon is also interested in this new high - tech material .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is spending $ 22 million on research to make computer chips and transistors out of graphene .
Graphene was the leading topic at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society _ a leading organization of physicists _ in Pittsburgh in April .
Researchers packed 23 panel sessions on the topic .
About 1,500 scientific papers on graphene were published in 2008 alone .
Until last year , the only way to make graphene was to mount flakes of graphite on sticky tape and separate a single layer by carefully peeling away the tape .
They called it the " Scotch Tape technique . "
Recently , however , scientists have discovered a more efficient way to produce graphene on an underlying base of copper , nickel or silicon , which subsequently is etched away .
" There has been spectacular progress in the last two or three months , " Geim reported in the journal Science .
" Challenges that looked so daunting just two years ago have suddenly shrunk , if not evaporated . "
" I 'm confident there will be many commercial applications , " Ruoff said .
" We will begin to see hybrid devices -- mostly made from silicon , but with a critical part of the device being graphene -- in niche applications . "

Rather , the Obama plan is little more than an attempt to stick some new regulatory fingers into a very leaky financial dam rather than rebuild the dam itself .
Without question , the latter would be more difficult , more contentious and probably more expensive .
But it would also have more lasting value .
On the surface , there was no area of the financial industry the plan did n’t touch .
“ I was impressed by the real estate it covered , ” said Daniel Alpert , the managing partner of Westwood Capital .
The president ’s proposal addresses derivatives , mortgages , capital , and even , in the wake of the American International Group fiasco , insurance companies .
Among other things , it would give new regulatory powers to the Federal Reserve , create a new agency to help protect consumers of financial products , and make derivative - trading more transparent .
It would give the government the power to take over large bank holding companies or troubled investment banks  powers it does n’t have now  and would force banks to hold onto some of the mortgage - backed securities they create and sell to investors .
But it ’s what the plan does n’t do that is most notable .
Take , for instance , the handful of banks that are “ too big to fail ”  and which , in some cases , the government has had to spend tens of billions of dollars propping up .
In a recent speech in China , the former Federal Reserve chairman  and current Obama adviser  Paul Volcker called on the government to limit the functions of any financial institution , like the big banks , that will always be reliant on the taxpayer should they get into trouble .
Why , for instance , should they be allowed to trade for their own account  reaping huge profits and bonuses if they succeed  if the government has to bail them out if they make big mistakes , Mr. Volcker asked .
Many experts , even at the Federal Reserve , think that the country should not allow banks to become too big to fail .
Some of them suggest specific economic disincentives to prevent growing too big and requirements that would break them up before reaching that point .
Yet the Obama plan accepts the notion of “ too big to fail ”  in the plan those institutions are labeled “ Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies ”  and proposes to regulate them more “ robustly . ”
The idea of creating either market incentives or regulation that would effectively make banking safe and boring  and push risk - taking to institutions that are not too big to fail  is n’t even broached .
We 've already wondered whether Torchwood could possibly top its world - crashing " Children Of Earth " miniseries in 2010 , and we 're also dead curious about the rumored Doctor Who movie .
So we asked the BBC's Julie Gardner what 's in store for both institutions .
Advertisement
We were lucky enough to have a one - on - one interview with Gardner , who 's supervised both Who and Torchwood for the BBC , the other day .
And she shared her thoughts about both shows , going forward .
Plus she explained why , exactly , she 's moved to Los Angeles .
Advertisement
She says the BBC will fully try to top the current season of Torchwood , assuming it actually returns in 2010 .
That 's " part of the fun , and part of the adrenaline rush of working in TV drama . "
She adds , " The joy , for me , with Torchwood , is that it 's a show that , every single years , has reinvented itself . "
That 's certainly true with the new format of a five - part miniseries airing across five consecutive nights , which Jane Trantor suggested and Russell T. Davies found an exciting challenge .
We 're kind of having conversations now , about what the next step is , because I do think it 's fun working on a show that reinvents itself constantly .
We 're looking at all of this , whether another serial arc , or possibly something else .
As to whether series four will show the Torchwood team rebuilding after the challenging events of " Children Of Earth , " she says " You go where the story needs to take you .
I think it 's always possible to rebuild . "
" Children Of Earth " started from Davies " wanting to tell a first contact story , " says Gardner .
" It 's not the usual action adventure .
It 's a story about what could plausibly happen . "
And he looked at all the terrible atrocities happening in other countries , and how people behave when they 're pushed to their limits , and tried to imagine how that could happen in Britain .

So is there any truth to the idea that a Doctor Who movie is in the pipeline ?
Gardner says at this point , it 's mostly speculative .
" At the moment , we are absolutely concentrating on the new production of the Doctor Who series . "
She 'd love to see a Who movie , but does n't see it happening any time soon .
As to what Gardner 's doing in L.A. , she 's not actually working on bringing Doctor Who , or any other British show to American shores .
Rather , she 's looking at positioning the BBC as a production company , much like any other U.S. production studio , which can create new shows for American networks .
Rather than creating American versions of British shows , she says the BBC is " looking at new ideas . "
The U.S. production arm of the BBC has been there for a number of years , and now the time seems right to move it forward .
" The U.K. and American TV scripted industries have never been closer , " says Gardner .
" There is a shared culture . "
She may be able to bring some lessons from the BBC to American broadcasting , and she has a lot to learn from U.S. television as well .

Linda
Ware was told her tomato plants were a fire hazard for the block A grandmother growing two tomato plants in the entrance foyer to her council flat has been given a warning about her " anti-social behaviour " .
Linda Ware , 61 , of Cilfrew , Neath , was sent a letter a few days later reminding her to remove the plants .
The retired legal secretary has moved the plants to a communal garden but said it showed a " killjoy attitude " .
A council spokesman said : " Keeping staircases and foyers clear of clutter is a key fire safety precaution . "
Ms Ware said she already grew vegetables in the communal garden and did not use even slug pellets on her tomato plants .
She said she was handed a bright green slip of paper by a council official after claims that sprays on her plants were making people ill .
She added : " I did n't really pay too much attention at the time , I was so amazed by the killjoy attitude .
Even if items are not flammable , their presence will increase the risk of trips and falls for residents trying to escape in the event of a fire
Robert Rees , Neath Port Talbot council
" But when I picked it up it had : ' You have been visited concerning your anti-social behaviour ' written on it . "
She said the council operated a green , amber and red warning system which ultimately leads to an anti-social behaviour order .
Neath Port Talbot council 's head of housing and public protection , Robert Rees , said : " The housing service was contacted on behalf of another resident of the flats who is asthmatic and was concerned that the tomato plants in the public area were aggravating this condition .
" While I am not in a position to comment on alleged health implications , once the plants were brought to our attention our housing officers asked the tenant to move them either to the shared garden or into the flat itself .

Female figure was carved from a mammoth tusk 35,000 years ago .
The Hohle Fels Venus could be the oldest known example of figurative art .
H. Jensen / University of Tübingen
A 35,000 - year - old prehistoric sculpture of an exaggerated female form found in Germany could be mankind 's earliest artistic attempt to represent itself .
The Hohle Fels Venus , uncovered at the cave that shares her name in the southwest province of Swabia , is a 6 - centimetre long depiction of a woman carved from mammoth ivory .
In this week 's Nature , Nicholas Conard , an archaeologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany , reports finding her in six pieces in 20081 .
Conard says the discovery should radically change our thinking about Palaeolithic art ( see slideshow ) .
Previous sculptures from the Aurignacian culture found in Swabia have focused on animals or half - animal / half - human figures , with no female figures .
The Hohle Fels Venus predates the famous Gravettian Venuses by more than 5,000 years , blowing apart suggestions that it was that era that developed three - dimensional female idols .
The pieces of the Swabian figurine " were recovered in association with characteristic stone , bone and ivory tools belonging to a period , the Aurignacian , that represents the earliest settlement of Europe by fully anatomically and genetically modern human populations , and which saw the simultaneous demise of the preceding Neanderthals " , says Paul Mellars , an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge , UK2 .
“ The figure is explicitly — and blatantly — that of a woman . ”

" And the figure is explicitly — and blatantly — that of a woman , " he says , " with an exaggeration of sexual characteristics ( large , projecting breasts , a greatly enlarged and explicit vulva , and bloated belly and thighs ) that by twenty - first - century standards could be seen as bordering on the pornographic . "
Mellars adds that while symbolic expressions have been found in Africa dating back to at least 75,000 years ago , attempts to represent reality with ' figurative art ' currently appears to be an exclusively European phenomenon .
BOULDER — Advocates for an amnesia victim who has been trying to find his identity for nearly five years and has stray memories of being in Boulder have received about a dozen solid tips on who he might be after Colorado news outlets recently reported on his plight .
Several people who spent time in Boulder in the early 1980s have said they remember the unknown man working as a manager at Round the Corner , a former Boulder restaurant that had three locations , including one on University Hill .
Colleen Fitzpatrick , a forensic genealogist who has been helping the man since February , said none of the tipsters remembered the manager ’s name , but several people independently remembered him working there .
The man himself has said he has memories from the Hill eatery .
“ It was so weird , ” Fitzpatrick said .
“ So we are also in touch with the ( restaurant ) managers now . ”
The unknown man — who goes by Benjamin Kyle — was found at about 6 a.m. on Aug. 31 , 2004 , naked and badly beaten behind a Burger King in Richmond Hill , Ga. Managers found Kyle , who had no clothing or wallet to identify him .
Kyle was rushed to the emergency room , where he said he remembers nurses joking that they could n’t call him John Doe because they already had one .
They called him “ Burger King Doe ” instead — and , eventually , the fast - food chain ’s initials inspired the moniker that Kyle now goes by .
Kyle said he believes Benjamin is his real name , and he thinks he is about 60 years old .
If you have information regarding the man ’s identity , contact Colleen Fitzpatrick at cfitzp@aol.com or 714-296-3065 .

With a New Economy starting to emerge , how should we measure its strength ?
Using the old fashioned Gross Domestic Product , or the more holistic Genuine Progress Indicator ?
In other words , GPD vs GPI .
Stop me if you ’ve heard this one before :
A businessman is showing a potential investor around his factory .
The investor is very impressed and likes the businessman ’s figures .
These show that the factory produces $ 5.2 m worth of goods .
“ And what about your expenditure ? ” he asks the businessman .
The businessman looks back at him blankly .
“ You know : raw materials ; transport costs ; staff wages ; loan repayments ….. ”
The business man starts to dribble from the corner of his mouth .
In the end the investor storms off muttering darkly about how the gene pool needs to be reduced .
This is precisely how GDP – Gross Domestic Product – works .
It measures what is produced , but ignores what is required to create that production .
So long as the factory keeps churning stuff out to be flogged to consumers , nothing else matters .
GPI — An Alternative to GDP
In 1995 Redefining Progress introduced a new way of measuring economic strength : the Genuine Progress Indicator ( GPI ) .
This looks at economic activity from the point of view of the impact it has on the individual and society , not the impact it has on a bank balance .
The biggest difference between it and GDP is what they class as costs and what they class as benefits .
For instance :
Crime : GDP counts this as a benefit because it gives rise to property repairs , legal and medical fees etc ; GPI counts it as a cost because it damages to people ’s lives and leads to stress .
: GDP counts this as a benefit because it gives rise to property repairs , legal and medical fees etc ; GPI counts it as a cost because it damages to people ’s lives and leads to stress .
Volunteer Work and Education : GDP totally ignores these because no money changes hands ; GPI values of both as a benefit for a growing economy .
: GDP totally ignores these because no money changes hands ; GPI values of both as a benefit for a growing economy .
Resources and Pollution : GDP counts both of these as an income , pollution twice over ( once for creation and once for cleanup ! ) ; GPI counts both as costs .
So under GDP high crime rates , spending all hours at your desk and environmental damage are all good for the economy .
Conversely , under GPI low crime rates , pursuing amateur interests and education and careful stewardship of the environment are all good for the economy .
Which Do You Favour — GDP or GPI ?
A few months ago , Clark Williams - Derry , the research director for the Sightline Institute in Seattle , called for journalists to stop using GDP as a primary measure for economic performance .
But what do you think ?
Does it make better sense to take into account the softer things in life when measuring an economy ’s strength , or is the amount of money which changes hand all that matters ?

Super Talent , one of the world 's leading vendors of Flash - based storage solutions , has just announced the introduction of the world 's smallest 32 GB USB drive , coming to complete the company 's line of Pico Drives .
Weighing less than 6g , this small USB portable storage device is capable of providing you with just enough storage space to back up your most important digital content .
In addition , Super Talent has designed these drives to provide users with a unique and stylish look , while also delivering some critical features like water resistance and hardware encryption .
“ Our customers have an insatiable need for higher capacity flash drives , but they do n't want a big and bulky drive ” , Super Talent Director of Marketing Joe James said in a statement .
The Pico C drive measures only 31 x 12 x 3 mm and weighs less than an American nickel ( ~5g ) , and Super Talent used a COB manufacturing process for its Pico series to achieve the smallest possible size .
Pico drives are water resistant and they also support blazing fast read speeds up to 200X ( 30MB/sec ) .
The 32GB Pico C is offered in either a nickel plated or 24 K gold plated steel casing , while the 32 GB Pico E , with a patent - pending sliding lid , is available with 24 K gold plating .
“ Pico drives are feature rich and have an unmistakable aura of quality , ” Mr. James added .
With the launch of the new 32 GB Pico USB flashdrives , the San Jose , California - based Flash memory vendor also introduced the first three models that boast AES - 256 hardware encryption , providing users with a more secure way to store and transport data .
There are three models that come with this feature , in addition to the water resistance available for all six 32 GB Pico drives from Super Talent .
As far as pricing goes , the new USB drives come with a retail price of US$ 85 and US$ 99 , with the latter also covering the aforementioned AES encryption .

Buy the ingredients at your corner store : 2 liters of Diet Coke ( warm ) , one pack Mentos candy ( mint ) , and some rum ( cheap ) .
2 // Prep
Fill an ice tray with water and stick it in the icebox .
Just before the liquid solidifies , drop one candy into each cube .
Freeze .
3 // Mix
Combine four cubes and 8 oz. of Diet Coke .
Top with 2 oz . of rum .
Garnish with a naive smile and serve .
Wait five minutes .
4 // Flee
When the ice melts enough to expose the dense candy 's gum arabic to the cola , it 'll erupt like a fifth - grade science project .

The Federal Reserve chose a labor leader to succeed a former Goldman Sachs executive as the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of New York 's private - sector board of directors .

You 're going to need to practice on a lot more than Rock Band or Guitar Hero to fully make use of this rig , but Mac users looking to go a step beyond basic GarageBand recording may want to consider Apogee 's new GiO guitar interface and controller , which is fully compatible with GarageBand 09 , as well as Logic Studio 9 and MainStage 2 .
Designed to more or less give you full hands - free recording , the device packs five Stompbox buttons that are dynamically color coded to match software effects , plus five Transport control buttons that are dynamically lit when engaged , not to mention all the ports you 'd expect , including a 1/ 4 " instrument input , a 1/4 " MIDI Expression pedal input , a headphone jack , and that all - important USB port , which just so happens to also conveniently power the device .
You 're still going to have to make do with your current setup for a bit longer , however , as this one 's only set to launch sometime in September for a fairly reasonable ( as far as Apogee products go ) $ 395 .
Intel has announced two new solid state disk drives made on its leading - edge 34nm process .
The two new SSDs are X25M SATA parts weighing in at 80GB and 160GB , and they 're meant to replace Intel 's existing X25 M drives in those capacities , but at 60 percent less cost and with better performance .
The 80 GB X25 - M is $ 225 in lots of 1,000 ( down from $ 595 ) , and the 160GB is $ 440 ( from $ 945 ) .
That 's some serious discounting , and it may well drive even more SSD uptake in the coming quarters despite the ongoing IT spending crunch .
So what do you get for 60 percent less ?
In a word , speed .
The new drives boast a 25 percent reduction in read latency , which was already about 60 x the speed of an average hard disk ; write performance has also doubled with this new generation .
Incidentally , the yawning gap between SSD performance and HDD performance is behind the push to SSD - specific interfaces on I/ O hubs now , like with Intel 's upcoming Pine Trail platform .
The bottlenecks are really at the system level , and possibly in the OS , as well .
Aside from some halfway steps like Intel Turbo Memory , there has n't really been a major rethinking of PC system architecture that starts with the presumption of a very fast , large pool of nonvolatile storage ( e.g. , SSD ) that sits behind main memory .
There may have to be even more SSD adoption before such a rethink can become feasible , though .
Noticeably absent from the announcement is a high - capacity 320 GB drive , which many were expecting .
So why did Intel choose to hold off on pushing the SSD capacity envelope and instead produce drives that are direct replacements for existing 50nm products ?
Like most things nowadays , the answer has to do with the economy .
A 320 GB drive would be an expensive , premium product of the sort that nobody is buying right now — not tapped - out consumers , and not cash - strapped IT departments .
So instead of trying to sell a high - end SSD , Intel took advantage of Moore 's Law to massively cut the cost of making its existing flash products , so that it could lower the price and sell more of them into a price - sensitive market .
Intel could even be making a bit more profit on each drive even while passing considerable savings on to customers .
It 's also the case that the 34nm transition was in the works well before the financial crisis , and would have been in the latter stages of coming online when Intel 's revenues fell off a cliff in the last quarter of 2008 .
So Intel has gone ahead and brought that capacity online , and they 're going to use it to make what everyone wants right now , i.e. , cheaper storage that , as an added bonus , also performs a bit better .

At least 43 people - including 23 soldiers and 20 militants - have been killed in clashes in the southern Philippines , an army commander says .
Maj Gen Benjamin Dolorfino said 400 troops launched co-ordinated attacks on a camp belonging to Abu Sayyaf rebels on the southern island of Basilan .
He said soldiers recovered home - made bombs and 13 high - powered firearms .
Fighting has ceased , but troops were combing the area to see if two targeted Abu Sayyaf chieftains had been killed .
The rebel leaders were named as Khair Mundus and Furuji Indama by the Associated Press ( AP ) news agency , citing military officials .
' Slugfest ' Abu Sayyaf is one of several militant groups in the southern Philippines seeking independence or greater autonomy for Muslims in the region .
It was really close - quarter fighting so we could n't use our artillery
Maj Gen Benjamin Dolorfino
Guide to the Philippines conflict US military advisers have been helping to train the Philippines military to fight them .
Abu Sayyaf was once linked to regional Islamist networks , but has recently become better known for criminal brutality and high - profile kidnappings , mostly targeting Christians and foreigners .
In January , militants kidnapped three staff members of the International Committee of the Red Cross .
Two were freed in April , while the last hostage , 62 - year - old Italian Eugenio Vagni , was released in July after being held for nearly six months .
The troops " launched a decisive law enforcement operation targeting the Abu Sayyaf 's main training camp in the province " , said army spokeswoman Lt Steffani Cacho .
She said " sizeable quantities " of bombs were found , some already " rigged to explode " .
The army 's losses were the highest in a single day 's combat for some years .
The fighting was a " slugfest " , said Maj Gen Dolorfino .
" It was really close - quarter fighting so we could n't use our artillery , " he told AP .
Continuing conflict
The south of the Philippines remains vulnerable to fatal violence and tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting .
Analysts say this is due to the government 's failure to deliver on promises of resource - sharing and development aid , the military 's lack of professionalism , and rebel groups ' refusal to give up a lifestyle of resistance .
While Abu Sayyaf is largely a criminal gang , two other groups have pursued political autonomy or independence for Mindanao for decades .
The Moro National Liberation Front first appeared in the early 1970s , fighting for an independent Moro nation .
A 1996 autonomy deal faltered amid renewed violence in 2005 and 2007 .
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) is a more militant rebel group , which split from the MNLF in 1977 .
In November 2007 , the Philippine government said it had reached an agreement with the MILF on the boundaries for a Muslim homeland .
But the Supreme Court ruled that the draft agreement was unconstitutional .
The failure of the negotiations prompted renewed fighting , which by mid-October 2008 had displaced 390,000 people , according to the International Crisis Group .
The New People 's Army , the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines ( CPP ) , has also been active in the south .
Peace talks are due to resume , again , later this month .
Analysts have said they believe President Gloria Arroyo lacks the will or authority to achieve a breakthrough in any proposed negotiations with such long - standing insurgencies .
She is dependent on the military for political support , parts of which have a stake in continued fighting .
Although the country 's constitution bars the presence of foreign military bases on Philippine soil , the United States provides military training and equipment , and has a revolving presence of at about 500 troops on the ground in the South .

If you were around Earls Court this past weekend you might have spotted a unique sub species of human beings ; the fanboy .
Well , actually what you would have seen were Star Trek characters , storm troopers , superheroes and maybe even a Sim or two .
This is because Earls Court is home to the London Film and Comic Con and was besieged by tubby geeks wearing Spock ears , hoping to meet their sci - fi heroes .
Unlike my fellow nerds , I do n’t have all the time in the world to geek out and watch all of the Lord Of The Rings movies back to back , nor can I sit at my computer playing World Of Warcraft all day .
But not having a real social life frees up a lot of their time and allows for some unusual talents to appear .
If you ’ve ever tried to watch a movie trailer on YouTube then you ’ve probably seen a ‘ fan - made trailer ’ .
These are dotted annoyingly all over the site and can be hard to sift through to get to the real deal .
Taking footage from various films and TV shows , a fanboy will sift through hours of film and then spend a week trying to edit it together .
And since most of them are superhero related , we ’re starting off with a mock Green Lantern trailer , in honour of Ryan Reynolds being recently cast in the role .
You ’re welcome .
GREEN LANTERN
We ’ll show the best one first in case you do n’t believe me that they can be awesome .
This trailer has cast current hero of the fanboys , Nathan Fillion from Buffy , Firefly , Serenity and Dr. Horrible ’s Sing - Along Blog .
Even though Ryan Reynolds has officially been cast as Hal Jordan AKA The Green Lantern , you have to admit , it looks pretty sweet with Nathan .
The geek who made this clearly has superior computer skills and no life .
As well as a hell of a lot of patience ; he ’s ripped footage from 29 films in order to make this .
We ’re not quite sure why he ’s done it , but we ’re grateful .
HE - MAN : MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE
By the looks of this we’d be quite happy with a follow up to 1987 ’s Masters of the Universe movie and the animation negates the question of who to cast .
This is a bonus because there are n’t any famous muscle men around at the moment and all of the old - school ones are about 60 .
No sign of She - Ra , though we ’re pretty sure that ’s a good thing .
GHOSTBUSTERS 3
Year after year , we wait with baited breath for a new GB movie .
In an unusual move , the series stopped at just 2 films ; both were wildly successful and yet there was no third instalment .
And now , finally , a third movie has been announced .
Oh happy day , rejoice , rejoice !
Most of the original cast will be returning except Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver , despite what her IMDB profile says .
In this fake trailer we get badass modern effects with old school GB action .
The geeky creator made it in 2006 before GB3 was announced so there ’s no recent footage in there .
SUPERMAN REBORN
OK , you have to respect the skill of the geek that made this .
This trailer for an imaginary Superman movie featuring the head of Smallville ’s Tom Welling and the body of Christopher Reeve .
The editing is pretty amazing to be honest , not perfect , but hey , you think you could do better ?
The story for the trailer has the Man of Steel pitted against his worst enemies including Lex Luthor , General Zod and Doomsday .
If you could n’t decide who you liked better : Welling or Reeve , this will give you the best of both worlds .
Honestly , we preferred this one trailer over the entire Superman Returns movie .
Brandon Routh ?
Stop it , just stop it .
PAC - MAN : THE MOVIE
People were in danger .
The world cried out for a hero .
And Pac - Man was there to answer .
If that ’s a baritone voiced trailer intro that you ’d want to see , then this fan trailer is definitely for you .
It ’s not low budget , it ’s no budget .
Ghosts plague a city and apparently the police , the army and the Government are useless .
Pac - Man is the only one who can…um …eat a pill and make them change colour ?
The effects are shoddy and the acting is piss poor ; it ’s hilarious and rubbish .
We highly recommend it .
THUNDERCATS
From the fanboy who brought you Superman Reborn , comes Thundercats .
There seems to be a bit of a pattern emerging ; things from the 80’s make good fake trailers , apparently .
This geek has decided to take footage from the likes of Troy and Farscape and layer Thundercats make up over their faces .
Simple and brilliant .
This trailer , complete with CGI Snarf , is so badass you ’ll pray to the Gods that somebody actually makes this version .
Plus , Hugh Jackman as Tigra ?
There ’s just something so funny about that .
Vin Diesel has also been cast as Panthro and looks surprisingly natural as a grey skinned man-cat .
WORLD’S FINEST : BATMAN AND SUPERMAN
The Man of Steel and the Dark Knight team up for this fanboys ’ wet dream .
It combines the world of Metropolis and Gotham City and sees Two Face and Lex Luthor team up against the good guys .
This trailer does n’t use footage from any film as it ’s all acted out by an original cast .
It ’s actually pretty good ; it ’s like a low budget film student project but with capes .
An original storyline with a new cast and a good director ?
I kind of wish I had this on DVD .
THE LEGEND OF ZELDA
Now if you watched the last trailer and thought , ‘ Bloody hell they ’ve got sets and extras and everything ! ’ then brace yourself for this .
This bad boy is a full - on trailer complete with location shooting , decent special effects and acting that is n’t half bad .
With period costumes and real props and everything , I was actually pretty disappointed when I realised this was an April Fool ’s trailer by IGN.com .
All in all a bloody good fake trailer , but a bit excessive for an April Fool ’s gag .
If they really did make a Zelda movie then it probably would look a little something like this …
THE TWILIGHT SAGA : NEW MOON
If you thought Star Wars fanboys were the craziest then you obviously did n’t see Twilight in a cinema with screaming 12 year old girls .
These fangirls are friggin mental .
They are just as intense as fanboys but their desire is of a romantic nature .
I genuinely fear for the safety of Robert Pattinson , the lead vampire lover in the series .
The fangirls at the moment are all in a tizzy because the trailer for New Moon , the second in the saga , was released a little while ago and they can’t wait any longer .
So essentially one of them has made a trailer … of a trailer .
This one looks damn near professional as well , I had to double check to make sure it was fan made .
Still does n’t make me want to see the film , I do n’t have to ; I still remember Buffy .
DEAD NOON
If you saw the Grindhouse movies that Tarantino and Rodriguez did , then you saw the fake trailers that accompanied them .
Dead Noon is in that style and let me tell you , it rocks .
Hard .
You know you ’d totally see this if it was released for real .
‘ It ’s Sam Raimi meets Sam Peckinpah .
It ’s Dawn of the Dead meets High Noon . ’
Well that ’s good enough for me .
This was actually made for a Grindhouse trailer competition so it really has a Tarantino feel to it and it has wicked zombie murdering action in there too .
Zombies + cowboys = awesome .
Hot diggity dawg , this trailer sure is mighty fine .
I ca n’t really pull that off can I ?

In the words of Nomic 's creator ,
Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move .
In that respect it differs from almost every other game .
The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules , debating the wisdom of changing them in that way , voting on the changes , deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards , and doing it .
Even this core of the game , of course , can be changed .

Throw honey at your enemies , and have them attacked by a swarm of bees !
Honey ' n ' Beeeeeeees !
V2 !
Still made from the same great honey as before , but this time with added kick !
The honey you 're holding right here not only looks tastier , but packs a meaner punch !
Our last batch of honey jarates contained a few small flaws .
One of those being that the honey itself was n't real honey .
It was simply sniper pee , mixed with a small dollop of grade - D honey .
Some of you realised this was not a replacement for real honey , and demanded more !
So I am proud to present you with the second batch of honey pots , featuring REAL , STICKY , SHINY HONEY !
These will still leave your enemies covered in the sweet stuff , but now , there 'll be more bees on him than you knew existed .
These are n't like the old bees either , oh no .
These are REAL TF2 bees , and they know the difference between that old stuff and the new stuff .
They know it so well , they 'll appear the instant that jar smashes !
Changes : - New bee particles - more in fitting with TF2 style , less transparent , much better looking in general - New ground impact - more honey - like , and has a swarm of bees suddenly appearing from the cloud - Better bee particle actions - more bees swarming , much more aggressively - New honey texture - Ooh shiny !
Enjoy folks !
Note :
This skin will cause problems on ' pure ' servers , due to the new particle effect using a custom texture .
There will be no particles present on the affected player in these cases , and there will be a lot of errors in your console about not finding ' particles / bee ' .
This can not be fixed I 'm afraid , as these servers enforce consistency with textures , but not particle files .
Sorry !

Again , I said that if these Republicans think that the Latino community has their heads in the sand , think again .
The Republican Party 's poll numbers have fallen and just eroded with their racist remarks against Sonia Sotomayor within the Latino community .
Did they think these folks were asleep ?
Not hearing what is and was being said ?
Telemundo and Univision have been ON IT with all these comments and believe me , the Latino community is fully engaged and KNOWS what is going on , being said .
As we saw today with the Republican Senators during the confirmation , they praised Judge Sotomayor and then turned their guns to President Obama .
I do n't know if that will work , but the Republicans just need to get real here , they do n't have the votes and Judge Sotomayor is going to be the next sitting Associate Justice on the Supreme Court .
GUARANTEED .

Eric von Hippel ’s concept of early adopters versus lead users is well established .
How does it work in practice , though ?
And why is it so hard to cross that famous chasm ?
Let ’s have a look at how this process can unfold , looking at a real life example .
It is Easter weekend , a few months ago , and my friends and I have just had a delicious Chinese hot pot .
As we sit around and talk of everything and nothing , the conversation suddenly focuses on Twitter .
“ Twitter seems like unwanted noise , ” Bob declares , “ I do n’t need more noise in my life .
I ca n’t see any use for it and I do n’t think I ’ll ever use it . ”
Others echo his feelings .
“ Believe me , ” I reply , feeling the weariness of a conversation I ’ve had a hundred times with a whole variety of people , with little result , “ Twitter is worth your while .
You can use it to network with people , to find out what ’s going on , to get answers to obscure questions , express interesting thoughts … it ’s very versatile , and the way you end up using it wo n’t be quite the way that I use it , but you will use it . ”
“ Maybe Twitter is only useful for people like you , who feel a need to express themselves and communicate with lots of people online .
I do n’t need that extra distraction in my life .
I ’m happy with the way things are . ”
Here we go again …
Struggling for the right words
Why is it so hard to convince people that an application ( like Twitter ) is good for them ?
I ’ve been using Twitter for over a year .
Back in those days , I was skeptical too .
But some people that I trusted told me , “ look , just try it , it rocks . ”
I did try it , and they were right .
Now nary a day passes when I do n’t tweet about things ranging from articles that I ’ve read and liked to interesting ideas that have passed through my head .
I have 500 followers , and I follow as many .
Twitter feels as much a part of my social world as my mobile phone does — perhaps more .
I am an active , avid Twitter user .
Not a “ Social Media expert ” , desperate to gain huge amounts of followers .
Not a celebrity with a million followers .
Not a Twitter obsessive who tweets a hundred times a day .
I ’m a normal human being , using Twitter actively , but with moderation , for what it is , with no specific goal ( marketing , business , networking , etc ) in mind .
And to me , the value of Twitter is so blindingly obvious that I can’t quite explain it convincingly to others .
Shortly after MiniBar , a month or so ago , I was observing to a group of entrepreneur friends :
Is n’t it funny how at the same time , in one circle of “ real life ” friends , we struggle to convince people that Twitter is something worth their while , yet in another circle of more connected friends , the fact that Twitter is worthwhile is so obvious that to even bring up the subject is basically boring and tedious , lame old news not worth discussing ?
That , in fact , I believe , is the problem .
Many of us hackers are early adopters .
We ’re willing to jump into a new service on a whim , and figure out what to do with it as we go along .
We can see the potential of something as simple and basic as Twitter even without being told all the different ways we should use it .
We can make our own path .
To us , Twitter is a huge blank canvas that we can paint in whichever way we want , and we love it that way .
But because of this vision , we find it hard to distill the essence of what Twitter is to others .
Because to us , there is no singular essence , but a cornucopia of possible uses .
But this is not how other people function , they want concrete benefits before they will dip their toe .
By the time those more obvious benefits finally emerge , however , we ’ve lost interest in trying to convince others , because we ’ve already been trying so damn long .
And that ’s fine , because , here ’s the good news , we ’re not alone in this dynamic .
Lead users
The typical product adoption curve is broken up into multiple segments .
If we ’re the early adopters , who comes next ?
The leaders of the early majority , the people who wo n’t put up with a product that does n’t work , but are willing to dip their toe when the time is right , are called “ lead users ” .
They ’ll only use a new product when they can see a use for it , but once that use becomes obvious , they ’ll jump in and start to adapt the product to the uses they can see .
It turns out , Bob is a lead user .
Shorlty after declaring his eternal distaste for the additional distraction of Twitter , he gave in and created an account .
Like everyone else , he ignored it for the first month .
And then , one day , he started using it in earnest .
He spotted a use for it , when he noticed that a lot of influential architects ( people who are early adopters in the architectural space , like him ) are on Twitter .
Once he discovered that , he took to Twitter like a fish to water .
Soon he was following a hundred people , and a lot of them followed him back .
He made the effort of tweeting once or twice every day .
All the while , he declared that he was only using it for business , and could n’t see any personal purpose to it , that maybe this was just my cup of tea and not his ( does that discourse sound familiar yet ? ) .
Yet he used it , more and more .
And something else happened .
Bob started convincing others to join Twitter .
In the few weeks since he started using Twitter in earnest , he ’s convinced 3 times as many people to join Twitter as I did in a year .
Sure , they ’re not all that active yet , and they mostly have a very small circle of followers / followees , still , but I ’m not worried .
They ’ll get there ( such is the power of Twitter ) .
Everyone eventually gets there , once enough lights blink online in their social network .
Symbiosis
So why is this worth thinking about ?
What can we learn from this ?
Well , early adopters like myself can learn from people like Bob how to be better at convincing the next wave of people to adopt a new product or technology .
If you ’re an early adopter , you can probably think of a few people who tend to eventually adopt new technologies and gadgets that you ’ve unearthed in your jaunts through cyberspace ( or meatspace ) .
Talk to them .
Find out how they convince others , and you could become more effective at spreading the message when you want to .
That ’s an important caveat , because often we do n’t really want to .
For the most part , although we , early adopters , do care about convincing our friends to follow our lead towards progress and the greater good , we do n’t care that much .
We ’re far more interested in uncovering the next new fun thing and painting on that blank canvas than in spending all that tedious effort figuring out what will convince the masses to adopt something that we discovered a whole six months ago .
But we do care enough to try , at least with our close friends .
More importantly , I think , lead users can learn from this .
If you ’re a lead user , identify who the early adopters are in your social circle , and pay attention to them .
They ’ll lead you on to the next big thing .
What you ’ll get out of it is that you ’ll be able to catch those trends earlier and be even more of an influencer of the people who revolve around you .
And please , please , never declare that you see no use in something new that they bring you .
Otherwise , someone might bring up your comment about “ not using Twitter for personal purposes ” when you ’re caught tweeting pictures of defrosting watermelons .
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration ’s nominee to lead intelligence efforts at the Department of Homeland Security withdrew Friday after it became clear that lawmakers would raise questions about his role in the Bush administration ’s interrogation programs .
Philip Mudd , who has 24 years of intelligence experience , said in a letter to the White House that he worried that his nomination could become a “ distraction ” from President Obama ’s agenda .
Mr. Mudd is now a deputy in Federal Bureau of Investigation ’s counterterrorism unit .
Before that , he was deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency ’s Counterterrorism Center .
It was in the latter post that legislators believed Mr. Mudd became deeply involved with the government ’s enhanced interrogation efforts , including the use of the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding .
I am glad to welcome you to this modest site .
I have tried to assemble here a small legacy of songs left from the Soviet era .
All of them were at once widely known and popular in the cities and towns of our glorious Motherland .
Some of these songs , even now , are known to practically everyone who has been born and raised in the USSR and other socialistic countries .
Others , on the contrary , have been long forgotten , during the course of time .
These songs are a monument to our not too distant past , during which USSR tried to build a new socialist society .
It was an interesting time , a time not only of terror and the Gulags , but of " The Great Projects " , enthusiasm , victories , and faith in a " bright future for all of humanity . "
Even regardless of the fact that in the present day , a few of these songs are able to at least bring a smile to one 's face , I am convinced that we should not deny that which is a part of our history and culture .
A few words to the foreign visitor :
You are browsing a resource which is devoted first of all to the history and culture of the Soviet Union , the country which the West for a long time usually named as " The Empire of Evil " , the country to which some people in the West perceive as " something big and snowy " .
I offer you to try to look outside the frames of usual stereotypes , to try to understand life of a unique country , with its interesting history , beautiful culture and miraculous relations between people .
The music submitted on this site - is an evident sample of a totally new culture , which completely differs from all that , with what Hollywood and MTV supply us so much .
This culture , being free from the cult of money , platitude , violence and sex , was urged to not indulge low bents of a human soul but to help the person to become culturally enriched and to grow above himself .
Cheerful and optimistically by its nature , the Soviet music was spreading a cult of friendship , collectivism , mutual assistance and respect to the working people .
Not all songs appeared to be praiseworthy ; also some unsuccessful things came alone .
But nevertheless it is possible to tell with confidence , that the purposes , which were set upon the Soviet culture , namely spiritual education of the new , Soviet person , were achieved in much ways .
I would like to appeal individually to those young russian people who were raised and educated during the course of the last ten years by completely different values than those of their fathers .
The contents of this web page may seem to you to be , as they say " old rubbish " or else simply nonsense .
Please do n't be hasty to abuse this site with harsh words and then go off to a favourite porn site .
No one attempts to bind you with his / her views or persuasions .
This site only serves as a reminder of a past epoch , of a country , which independently and heroically attempted to build a " bright future " .
This site reminds us , as well , of its people .
Please listen to the music , read deeply into the song lyrics and try to understand , what people lived with during that time : what did they breathe , and what did they strive for ?

Parents may soon be able to read their children 's text messages as part of a plan to give them more control over rapidly developing technologies .
It is being billed as another tool in parents ' armouries , but civil libertarians say if you need to pry into your kids ' phones then you are not doing a good job as a parent .
The technology could be rolled out in Australia by August but privacy issues loom as the main obstacle .
Mobile phone bullying , ' sexting ' and the danger of sexual predators have all emerged as risks as young people use their mobile phones at younger ages .
Three weeks ago a serious case of cyber - bullying at an elite Sydney girls school prompted the principal to tell parents to confiscate their girls ' phones overnight .
American company My Mobile Watchdog says it has responded to this community concern by launching software that allows parents to see the text messages , calls , picture messages and emails sent to and from their children 's phones .
Geoff Sondergeld is the managing director of Device Connections , the exclusive Australian agent for the software , and he says parents have to face the reality of modern communication .
" The child is notified every time they power their device that their phone is being monitored and they must accept that notification before they can move on to use the phone in any normal use , " he said .
" The screen will say ' your phone is being monitored by mobile watchdog , press any key to continue ' . "
He insists the product is not spyware , because the child will know every time their parents access the records of their phone .
But Civil Liberties Council head Terry O'Gorman is not convinced .
" If this technology allows a parent at any time to in effect go and read any communication that is going to or from their child 's mobile phone , that is simply not acceptable , " he said .
" Children have certain rights of privacy , including certain rights of privacy in their communication , that their parents should not know about . "
He says parents should not rely on technology such as this to keep aware of what their children are doing .
" Those parents that argue they need that software ignore the reality , " he said .
" The best way of finding out what 's happening with your child is to talk to them and not access their phone communications behind their back .
" If there is cyber - bullying going on , a good parent - child relationship will have the child tell the parent that so that the parent can do something about it . "
Complex lives
But many parents would acknowledge it is not always that easy .
Parents often do not see their children except after work and for part of the weekend , and keeping on top of everything in their children 's private lives is a daunting task .
Susan Hetherington has an 11 - year - old son and she is also a media commentator on children 's issues .
" I think it is pandering a little bit to parent hysteria about issues like paedophilia and cyber - bullying but I do n't think it 's unreasonable for parents to be able to make some basic checks on who their children are talking to , depending on the ages of the kids , " she said .
" As long as you 're still paying the bills , you have rights to know how that phone is being used .
" In days gone by if someone wanted to talk to their child they 'd call the family home , you 'd answer it and you 'd decide if they could speak to them .
I do n't see how this is very different from that . "
Mr Sondergeld shares this point of view and says the technology should be used alongside traditional communication .
" I guess the opposite view to that would be that parents have the flexibility to change the level of monitoring , " he said .
" If they give their eight - year - old a phone they might choose to have everything monitored .
As the child grows to 15 or 16 they might choose to scale back the level of monitoring so their child can experience more . "
Mr Sondergeld has had detailed discussions with the Australian Privacy Commission , and says the technology complies with all 10 privacy guidelines .
Quite apart from the letter of the law though , Mr Sondergeld is keen to focus on the response he has had from focus groups with Australian parents and children .
" Overwhelmingly the children 's desire to have a mobile phone outweighs any impact on the parents being able to monitor them , " he said .
" Parents will certainly need to establish some ground rules with their children if they put it in , particularly children who may have had a phone for 12 months or so .
" But kids are saying they understand their parents might want to know if someone strange is trying to contact them . "
Communication between children and parents is the key according to Mr O'Gorman .
" This particular technology poses a special problem in respect of teenagers as they get older , " he said .
" There is general recognition that as a teenager gets older that teenager is entitled to more and more autonomy as they traverse that difficult but gray area from being a child to being an adult . "
If the technology is approved it should be available in Australia by August , and Mr Sondergeld anticipates it will cost between $ 10 and $ 15 per month .
According to various surveys around 40 per cent parents in Australia use filtering and monitoring software on their children 's computers .
Ms Hetheringtom says the mobile watchdog technology is something she would consider , but she would not use it unless she sat down and had a long discussion with her son about it first .
Here ’s the beef :
It ’s in KFC chicken .
The marinade on the chain ’s new grilled chicken contains beef powder and rendered beef fat .
And competitor El Pollo Loco wants you to know every finger - licking detail .

The plucky Costa Mesa restaurant company is making those beef byproducts the centerpiece of a new advertising campaign tweaking KFC .
FOR THE RECORD :
April 18 , 2013 : The web address given for the El Pollo Loco commercial , https://beefychicken.com, is no longer used by the company .

“ The use of beef ingredients in grilled chicken just seems wrong to me , and we believe most consumers would agree , ” said Steve Carley , chief executive of El Pollo Loco .
The Southern California chain learned that KFC was using beef thanks to a customer ’s tweet to El Pollo Loco ’s Twitter account .
In one television commercial , Carley stands in a cow pasture and talks about a “ fun fact ” concerning KFC ’s grilled chicken , then discloses the beef ingredients .
Advertisement
KFC pitches “ a new secret blend of herbs and spices ” when it talks about its recently introduced grilled chicken .
To learn what ’s in that secret blend , consumers have to turn to Page 14 of a 37 - page ingredient document posted by KFC on its website .
That disclosure is “ more than adequate , ” said Rick Maynard , a spokesman for the Louisville , Ky. , chain , which has 5,200 restaurants nationally .

“ Small amounts of beef flavors are commonly used in seasonings for many food products , for both restaurant and retail use , ” Maynard said .
“ For Kentucky Grilled Chicken ’s topical seasoning , beef flavors account for only 0.2 % of the total seasoning , ” he added .

El Pollo Loco , with 418 stores , thinks many chicken lovers wo n’t like that .
Starting Monday , it plans to spend several hundred thousand dollars advertising KFC ’s ingredients in 13 television markets , including Southern California .
Carley said his company ’s chicken was marinated in herbs , spices and fruit juices -- but no beef -- and cooked over an open flame .
He also says that KFC ’s chicken is n’t even grilled but rather is cooked in a closed oven .

Maynard said KFC restaurants had “ grill racks inside ovens ” that , combined with the spices and the cooking process , replicated “ grilled chicken that tastes ” as good as “ what comes off the backyard grill . ”

KFC launched its grilled chicken in April as an alternative to its higher - fat fried fare .

" Daddy , why did Jesus invent butterflies if they die after two weeks ? "
I just about hit the panic button when my six - year - old son
Theo put this question to me not long ago .
His mother , who is a Christian , had taught him that Jesus was God .
When Jesus 's visage appears in a painting or on television , Theo sometimes exclaims , " That 's God ! "
In his butterfly question he seemed to reason , syllogistically , that if Jesus was God , and God created the world and its life forms ( butterflies being one of them ) , Jesus " invented " the winged creatures .
Either that or God and Jesus are simply interchangeable in his mind .
" First , Theo , your question presumes that Jesus was God , " I responded .
" Many people , like mommy , believe he was , but many others do n't .
It also presumes that there is a God - we do n't know for sure that there is . "
" I think there is , " he retorted .
" There may very well be a God , Theo .
But not everyone agrees on that - there are many people who doubt there is a God .
We might never know for sure if there is or not , " I told him .
" When we die we 'll know , " he came back .
" Maybe , " I said .
" But maybe not . "
The literalism packed into Theo 's question alarmed me , but this was by no means my first encounter with the influence of religion on my progeny .
My ten - year - old son Elijah enjoys going to church with his mother - not every Sunday , but not infrequently .
I 've never discouraged it .
One Monday morning a few months ago , though , I saw him reading the Bible , a children 's Bible he'd been given at his mother 's church .
In no way did I discourage him from reading it .
But I confess ( as it were ) that I went to work that day a bit preoccupied .
To be sure , I 'd always been comfortable with our familial arrangement : our boys have parents with very different views on religion - their mother a Catholic , their father an agnostic humanist .
This is only one of the several ways in which our family is " mixed " : Nilsa is from Puerto Rico , I from the Midwestern US ; she grew up in a working - class family in the countryside , I in a middle - class one in the suburbs ; she speaks to the children in Spanish , I in English .
Our differences regarding religion must therefore seem , to the kids , par for the course , no ?
I 've also sensed ( hoped ? ) that having one religious parent and one secular one could be healthy for the boys ( " hmm , if mom believes x but dad does n't , I guess there are multiple perspectives to consider , and who knows which one is right ?
Maybe none has a monopoly on truth ... " ) .
Nonetheless , the sight of Elijah reading the Bible that morning did leave me with an uneasy feeling .
Of course it was wonderful to see him reading .
And the Bible is in any case a seminal world - historical text : familiarity with it is an essential form of cultural knowledge .
Churches , however , do n't typically dispense Bibles merely as cultural texts but rather as the Word of God .
It was in this register that I worried a bit about Elijah 's engagement with the book .
And it made me ask myself what exactly I was doing to share , or impart , my secular worldview to Elijah , as a counterbalance to the Catholicism he was imbibing from his mother .
She takes him to services .
What do I take him to ?
She has him reading the Bible .
What do I have him reading ?
I have read all sorts of books with Elijah that I think of as humanistic , broadly speaking : lots of poetry ( particularly Pablo Neruda , whose Book of Questions is ideal for children ) ; books like David A White 's Philosophy for Kids , and its sequel , The Examined Life : Advanced Philosophy for Kids .
I recall feeling especially proud one evening after doing a chapter of Philosophy for Kids , which is designed for discussion between parent and child - I think it was a chapter on the meaning of friendship - followed by some verses of Neruda .
I put Elijah to sleep that night thinking to myself , a diet of Aristotle and Neruda for my eight - year old - how cool is that ?
Cool though it may be , does it actually counterbalance the influence of the churchgoing and Bible - reading ?
Or does it operate on a parallel track from it altogether ?
Does Elijah juxtapose whatever he may be taking away from the philosophy and poetry with the stuff he hears at church ?
Does he consider one in relation to the other at all ?
Seeing his head buried in that Bible that morning really made me wonder if I was perhaps approaching the matter too sideways .
Maybe I needed to tackle the situation head - on .
But how ?
Are there any children 's books , I wondered , that directly address religious questions from a humanistic point of view ?
Not necessarily an anti-Bible , but a strong alternative or counterpart in a secular key .
I called a friend of mine , who works for a humanist charity and is a parent too , feeling sure he would have some sage advice .
His response surprised me .
Not only did he not know of any good humanist children 's books , he said , he did n't like the idea of such a thing .
Rather than attempt to counter - indoctrinate kids with explicitly anti-religious messages , he argued , far better simply to expose them to the widest range of reading as possible - were n't Roald Dahl and Dr Seuss essentially humanistic ? - and expose them to the manifold religions and philosophies in the world in order to nourish their imaginations and sense of wonder about the Universe , and help them view religion in a comparative context .
The antidote I was seeking , he suggested , was to be found in books of evolution and science fiction , not didactic manifestos .
Sounded wise , though I did n't expect to hear it from a full - time , professional humanist .
And I was disappointed that he did n't have a ready - made list of books of the sort I had in mind .
The dilemma remained : what if all the science and fantasy and comparative metaphysics fail to do the trick , and Christian literalism , despite my efforts , works its magic on my children 's minds ?
Call me intolerant , but I 'll admit it : I do n't want to tell my children what to believe or not to believe , but I would be displeased and disappointed if they were to embrace conventional religious views .
I just would be .
Is n't there a more direct way , I thought , to militate against that outcome ?
I turned to Amazon and found that there are several books in this register .
Many of them are published by Prometheus Books , an American press with a long history .
Within minutes I had found books such as Humanism , What 's That ?
A Book for Curious Kids by Helen Bennett and Dan Barker 's Maybe Yes , Maybe No : A Guide for Young Skeptics .
I particularly liked the title of this one .
Could I have found what I was looking for ?
I had liked the idea about exposing the kids to the array of religious traditions .
Would n't this naturally tend to weaken the notion that any one religion holds the key to Truth ?
Another friend of mine had challenged this idea - would n't this , he asked , merely sanction or naturalise the religious frame of understanding the world ?
Is n't the message , in effect , " Look at these various religious beliefs and practices - you are free to pick among them " ?
" What about the millions of people who live without religion ? " he asked .
" Why not present secular modes of thought alongside the religious traditions ? "
He had a point , but since I was already getting some explicitly secular books I added The Kids Book of World Religions to my shopping cart .
Well , we 've read the books , but I 'm afraid there 's nothing terribly interesting to report either about the texts as such or about my children 's reactions to them , which have been rather quiet , if not altogether bored - tough to tell , and I 'm strongly disinclined to go fishing for their thoughts .
I 've been tempted , but better , I think , to let them process it all in their own way ( assuming the books made an impression at all ) .
The books themselves are a mixed bag : at turns poignant and clunky , clever and awkward .
I might re-read them with the boys at some point .
Or maybe they 'll pick them up themselves and read them on their own .
We 'll see .
And I might look for other humanist books that engage my children more than this first batch did .
Raising my children as a secular father in a society saturated with religion , and in a home that is itself mixed ( up ? ) on the religious question , creates anxiety .
But maybe I should just relax .
" Kids mostly just want to play with their friends , and religion is n't that big a deal - though it is , unfortunately , to parents , " writes Emily Rosa , one of the contributors to the book Parenting Beyond Belief : On Raising Ethical , Caring Kids Without Religion , in an essay evocatively titled " Growing Up Godless : How I Survived Amateur Secular Parenting " .
All parents must confront the prospect that if we raise our children to be free , self - confident individuals , they may make choices that we do n't like .
Tough .
The companion volume to Parenting Beyond Belief bears the title Raising Freethinkers .
Sounds appealing - I 'd like to raise freethinkers .
But what if raising my kids to be truly free in their thinking results in their becoming religious ?
What if my efforts to instill scepticism in them lead them to become sceptical of my humanism ?
So be it .
" Teaching " your children ( about ) humanism can be a fool 's errand , plagued by some the same pitfalls involved in raising children " in " a particular faith tradition .
Richard Dawkins has provocatively argued that indoctrinating children with religion is a form of child abuse .
But could n't secularism , as Jeremy Stangroom recently wondered , constitute its own form of indoctrination ?
Might the attempt to impart one worldview or another to one 's children - whether religious or secular - itself be ill - conceived ?
And yet one does n't want to be passive , especially in the American context , in which religion in one form or another constitutes a kind of default position .
One can certainly understand the impulse behind the humanism - for - kids books , whatever their faults and limitations , and the desire of secular parents to get their hands on them .
They arise from and speak to a very real hunger , whether they satisfy it or not .

Hi there !
I have been having the same symptons that were described above for the last two days .
I had some pine nut mix with walnuts and seeds with breakfast for two days before this bitter taste started .
I have been searching the web to find the cause , before going to see my gp , but I am so relieved that it is only due to pine nuts .
Does anyone know if it is one particular type of pinenuts that causes this , as I had pine nuts in the past without any side effects .
How long does this bitter taste last for ?

Last week 's entry on How To : Stop A 500 Foot Monster seems to have struck a chord , judging from the number of suggestions for the best military hardware to take down rampaging Cloverfield - type beasts in our urban centers .
Several new options were put forward which deserve some serious consideration – ones we 'll be forwarding on to the secret monster - stopping divisions of the various defense ministries .
First there were the traditionalists who want to use standard anti-tank kinetic rounds .
One version of this takes us back to King Kong , only instead of Curtiss F8C - 4 biplanes you have A - 10 Warthogs strafing the beast with their 30 - mm GAU - 8 cannon .
This would be fine against smaller creatures , but a 500 - foot beast is liable to have a protective covering measured in feet .
The GAU - 8's projectilespenetrate less than three inches of armor at close range ( 69 mm at 500 meters , in fact ) .
They are effective against heavy tanks because they can go through side , rear or top armor , but with our beast I do n't think they 'd get through the skin .
As someone once put it : you 're going to need a bigger boat .
( Or something like that ) .
The 120 mm M828A1rounds fired by M1 Abrams tanks are tremendously effective against armored vehicles , but the round itself is still basically just a big dart made of depleted uranium with no explosive payload .
It 's about 20 mm in diameter and a metre long , so it 's equivalent to shooting a human - sized target with a needle about 0.2 mm diameter : it would take a lot of them even if the round went deep enough to hit a vital organ .
Some put forward the Navy 's new electromagnetic rail gun , which might offer a more powerful option , but it 's still a ways down the line .
Kudos to MachineMk2 for suggesting the kinetic LOSAT missile .
Otherwise known as the MGM - 166 Line Of Sight Anti-Tank missile , this delivers a kinetic punch about five times more powerful than a tank round .
Equally importantly , it is mounted on a Hummer , so it 's both air - portable by helicopter and fairly easy to drive around the streets of New York .
Deploying heavy tanks in central Manhattan in a hurry was always going to be a bit of a headache .
( This type of approach assumes that your monster actually has vital organs .
Although movie monsters are usually some sort of vertebrate – as far as we can tell – screenwriters might throw a curve ball with something lower down the scale like The Blob .
Creatures like man - of - war jellyfish , sponges and hydra are not centrally organized and this makes them very hard to kill .
Sponges can even reassemble themselvesafter being broken down into individual cells .
Shooting anything like that would be a waste of time . )
There were a few suggestions for the Active Denial Systemor " pain ray . "
This shows the right kind of instincts : against sci- fi monsters , a sci - fi ray gun feels about right .
Unfortunately , the depth - of - penetration problem is even more severe here , as it is carefully designed so that the beam only goes through about 1 /64 " of skin .
In fact this is one of the ADS ' selling points , that it will only have surface effects .
I have previously described some of the more unusual testsof the Active Denial System , including experiments with military dog teams , but I do n't think they ever tried it on anything larger .
It 's highly unlikely you could get any sort of a reaction from a very thick - skinned monster without redesigning the system from the ground up using a beam with a longer - wavelength .
( Previous non-lethal weapon developers were more adventurous , and went so far as testing LSD on an elephant - unfortunately , the elephant died .
Maybe there 's some monster - killing potential there ? )
Then there is the extreme option : " I say we take off and nuke the site from orbit .
It 's the only way to be sure , " suggested Ripley , apparently speaking from experience .
The problem here is the tradeoff between the damage done by a 500 - foot beast and the devastation likely to be caused your nuclear warhead .
A 150 - kiloton warhead would almost certainly do the job .
But it would be very unpopular with local residents , as this simulation of the effects on Manhattan of such an explosion shows - hundreds of thousands dead and injured .
What is needed here is something as small as possible – the suggestion of using the 1950's Davy Crockett nuclear bazooka sounds pretty smart , with its selectable yield from 10 - 20 tons to half a kiloton .
Unfortunately , they just do n’t make them like that any more : in 1991 the US took the decision to remove all ground - launched tactical nukesfrom the arsenal , and the 1994 Furse - Spratt amendmentprohibited the development of any new warheads of less than five kilotons .
There is still a stockpile of air - launched tactical nuclear weapons , but I do n't know if there 's anything quite suitable for tackling monsters in urban theaters .
It 's possible to de-tune nuclear warheads and reduce their yield .
But doing this in a hurry is liable to result in a very ' dirty ' explosion with a large anount of radioactive fallout .
And that would probably only mean more monsters …
“ And the weeds of the garden shall be visited upon the gardener . ”
I can certainly think of the 7 + weedy sins of the garden but knowing how to cleanse my garden of these weeds is even better .
Especially if it can be done cheaply and with household items .
Murdering weeds is a fun past time .
So , for your reading enjoyment , here are The 7 Deadly Homemade Weed Killers , guaranteed to help you eradicate the weeds you find in your garden .
Boiling Water – Yep , that ’s right .
Plain old H2O can be used as an extremely effective weed killer .
As a matter of fact , boiling water is more effective than many of your store bought weed killers in wiping out unwanted vegetation .
Easy - peasy to do .
Put a kettle of tap water on the stove and heat till boiling , then pour on the weeds you wish to kill .
You are effectively cooking the plant in the ground .
Boiling water is a great way to clear out vegetation on a wholesale basis , like driveways and sidewalks .
But be warned , boiling water is not selective .
It will cook and instantly kill any plant that it comes in contact with and this includes underground roots of nearby plants .
Bleach –
Not only is bleach a spot remover , it is a weed remover as well .
Place some bleach in a spray bottle and spray on the weed you wish to remove .
The bleach chemicals will evaporate or dissipate in about two days ( or less but better safe than sorry ) , making the area safe for planting .
Again , bleach will kill anything but if you do get some on a plant you want to keep , just wash the plant off .
Vinegar – Vinegar is a great organic homemade weed killer .
Either white or cider vinegar will work .
The acetic acid in the vinegar works to kill the leaves on the plant but not the root .
Vinegar will kill back ( kill the leaves but not the root ) any plant but works best on young plants because they do not have enough energy stored in the roots to regrow their leaves .
If vinegar is applied to more established weeds enough times , the plant will eventually deplete its stored energy reserves and die .
Salt –
It was once a known war tactic to salt the fields of enemies .
Salting the earth was also used as punishment for severe crimes in several countries throughout history .
The reason is because salt will kill plants and will make the ground unsuitable for future plant growth .
On a small scale , you can drop a small pinch of table salt at the base of the undesirable plants .
It will kill the plant but will dilute down to harmless in the next few rainfalls .
On a larger scale , you can cover your gravel driveway or your ex’s yard with a good amount of salt and nothing will grow there for months .
( FYI , it is illegal to salt another person ’s property .
It ’s called vandalism . )
Rubbing Alcohol – Rubbing alcohol is used around the house because it draws water out and helps to evaporate it quickly .
Guess what ?
If you put it on a plant , it will do the same thing .
You will be basically sucking the life blood out of the weed .
Makes you want to run right out and try it , huh ?
But again , rubbing alcohol is non-selective .
It will kill any vegetation it comes contact with .
Corn Meal – Corn meal does n’t really kill weeds , it just stops the weed seeds from ever developing .
Corn Gluten is a pre-emergent , which is a fancy way of saying that is it is a seed birth - control .
Corn meal scattered around an area will keep any seed in that area from growing into a plant .
This means a weed seed or a desirable seed .
This method is a good option for areas that you plan on planting grown plants in .
Newspaper –
If murdering your weeds with chemicals is not your style , you can always smother them .
Laying down a layer of newspaper at least 4 sheets thick ( the more the better ) will go a long way towards killing the weeds underneath .
The weeds that are already there will die from lack of sun and the weed seeds will not be able to sprout because they are not getting any sun to start with .
As an added bonus , many of these 7 homemade weed killers can be combined to produce super results .
For example , the boiling water can be mixed with the salt or the vinegar ( or both ) for a super weed killer .
Use common sense when combining chemicals and make sure that there are no adverse reactions .
You can also add a few drops of liquid dish soap to the liquid homemade weed killers for added effectiveness .
The soap is not harmful to the weeds but the soap acts as a sort of bonding agent and will help the weed killers to stick to the weed more effectively .
Since most of these homemade weed killers are all - or - nothing weed killers , you may want to use a weed killer shield with them to prevent sprays and splashes on desirable plants .
So , go forth and cleanse thy garden of its weedy sins .

In this post we bring to you an insightful interview with Maitreyee Kumar who is the founder of Dream School Foundation .
Before we get into the actual questions , here is a brief background about Maitreyee .
Maitreyee started her career as software professional and worked with multinational software development firms in India and abroad for over 8 years before she made a shift towards social development .
Her desire for social change and interest in child development through civil society mobilisation urged her to join CRY ( Child Rights and You ) .
She worked with CRY in the resource generation and volunteer management divisions for a decade and was instrumental in setting up and coordinating Volunteer Action at national level .
Educated at Pune University ( Masters in Computer Science ) , Maitreyee provides leadership and direction to the organisation and is primarily responsible for the overall management and administration of the organisation .
She was also a recipient of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust Fellowship .
Interview
The Better India ( TBI ) : Tell us about Dream School Foundation ( DSF ) and the work that it does ?
Maitreyee : Dream School Foundation ( DSF ) is a Bangalore based non-profit organisation working to ensure the child ’s right to quality education .
Our School Development Programmes help with holistic development of government schools while our initiative – HeadStart , addresses and assists a smooth transition from primary to secondary stages of education and strives to ensure continuity till the 10th grade for the vulnerable and underserved children .
We started as a group of committed individuals volunteering their time and skills for the cause of quality education for disadvantaged children in Govt. schools .
Later we formally registered the organization and now 4 years later , we are fairly established with organizational framework in place , focused school programmes and two Education and Development centres for High School students .
The underlying belief of our organisation is faith in people ’s ability to contribute towards the education and development of our children .
TBI : Who has benefited from your program and how have you made a difference ?
Maitreyee :
The objective of the our intervention at the school level is to enhance the learning levels of the children studying at the government schools through support and partnership with teachers , active participation of the community coupled with intensive class room and school level interventions through trained personnel , teachers & volunteers .
We believe that these interventions create an environment and processes , which ensures holistic development and enhanced performance of the school and its students .
Our initiative HeadStart aims to mentor and track individual students from the various schools , we support , through and beyond their Higher Primary / Middle school and High School Education .
The underlying driver of the programme is to ensure that children both continue into high school ( not drop out ) and make an informed choice of schooling in the neighbourhood schools that are willing to give them an opportunity to share a learning experience without being discouraged by the financial liabilities .
The programme is strengthened by volunteer - involvement to mentor and track the performance of the participant – students and motivate them through the commitment of financial support for 3 years of High School Education .
It is closely associated with our Learning Centres where the student - participants will have the opportunity to capitalise on Spoken English and Life – Skill Tutoring .
We have seen marked improvement in the academic performance as well as personality development of these students and they are much better equipped to face the challenges of the world today .
TBI : What inspired you to create an organization like DSF ?
Maitreyee :
My experience and exposure as a software professional and later work with CRY gave me lot of opportunity to have a world view of society and social development .
I came across several well meaning individuals who wanted to do something to bring about a change but very few ended up doing anything worthwhile .
Some of us who were really passionate for the cause of Education and felt it is the only sustainable tool that can empower the nation and bridge the economic divide between communities in India started getting together .
We saw that while govt .
efforts have ensured that most children have access to schools , quality education in these schools was still a dream .
Schools needed to be equipped to provide education that is more than just development of cognitive abilities and rote learning and make learning an exciting and stimulating experience for children .
Thus was born the idea of a Dream School which was developed by this group of passionate individuals with a keen desire to bring about a change .
TBI : How does DSF sustain itself ?
Maitreyee : A large percentage of our funding comes from CSR initiatives of corporate firms while another significant part is from individuals and groups .
TBI : What are the schools that are currently under the purview of DSF ?
Maitreyee : DSF partners around 20 schools across Bangalore for the Holistic school development and extends its services on smaller scale to several other needy schools .
Our schools are primarily located in North Bangalore – RT Nagar , Yeshwantpur , Rajajinagar areas , while we also work with some schools around HAL airport area .
Our Learning centres are situated at Yeshwantpur & RT Nagar .
TBI : What plans do you have for the future ?
Maitreyee :
This year we would primarily focus on strengthening our interventions both at our existing partner schools and Learning centres .
Meanwhile the public education scenario in the urban context is undergoing several reforms and changes .
We need to wait and watch before we step further in our programme expansion in urban areas .
Promotion
Instead it ’s the rural schools that are kind of orphan and need developmental support .
There we also have tremendous scope for enhancing community participation in the school development .
We plan to take on a pilot School development programme in the outskirts of Bangalore , extend our existing programmes to the rural community and then explore possibility of scaling up the initiative .
TBI : In what ways can our readers contribute to DSF ?
Maitreyee : DSF owes its beginning to few committed individuals who volunteered for the cause of quality education .
We have full faith in people ’s ability to contribute towards the nation building process .
Whether it is through volunteering your time or financial contributions , each one of you can reach out to underserved children .
One can be a member of our School Support teams and volunteer at a school or mentor / teach students at our centres .
We are in need of sponsors to contribute to the High School education of our HeadStart children .
One is also welcome to help in specialized areas like website & content development , financial accounts , counseling , child psychology , education etc .
TBI : Any other message you would want to provide or talk about ?
Maitreyee :
We believe that people at large are responsible for the situation of the state of education and children today .
And people should play a proactive role to change the situation through collective action .
We need to work on formation and strengthening of alliances that promote collective action which will finally result in influencing govt .
policies and bringing about constitutional changes .
We as educated citizens need to widen our perspective , get more aware and involved in the education system and advocate the right cause that would benefit a larger population than a narrow segment of society .
Maitreyee is ably supported by DSF ’s Co-Founder Sabu Joseph .
Sabu holds the post of Director – Strategy & Partnerships .
Here is a brief bio of Sabu :
Prior to initiation of DSF , Sabu worked with Centre for Environment Education ( CEE ) , in Bangalore where he initiated and managed projects in Environment and Sustainable Development .
He taught Social work and management in IIRM , MATS school of management and was visiting faculty in many management institutions and organisations .
His interest lies in training and development and has conducted various programmes in corporate , academic and NGO settings .
Sabu currently consults with global organisations on sustainability and business transformation .
He provides vision and direction to DSF and is responsible for strategic planning and partnerships .
He holds a Masters in Social Work and also a recipient of Common wealth Secretariat scholarship on Environment Education ( TEE ) .

This August marks the 40th anniversary of the Manson killings , which stunned the nation and effectively marked the end of the counter - culture , " flower power " era of the 1960s .
The photograph of the 74 - year - old cult leader was taken at Corcoran State Prison , where he is serving a life sentence and is part of periodic updates of inmate images by prison officials , said Terry Thornton , a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
Manson and other members of his so - called family were convicted of killing actress Sharon Tate and six other people during a bloody rampage in the Los Angeles area during two August nights in 1969 .
Prosecutors said that Manson and his followers were trying to incite a race war that he believed was prophesied in the Beatles ' song " Helter Skelter . "
Tate , the wife of director Roman Polanski , was 8 1/2 months ' pregnant when she was killed at her hilltop home in Benedict Canyon on Aug. 9 , 1969 .
Besides Tate , four others were stabbed and shot to death including Jay Sebring , 35 ; Voytek Frykowski , 32 ; Abigail Folger , 25 , a coffee heiress ; and Steven Parent , 18 , a friend of Tate 's caretaker .
The word " Pig " was written on the front door in blood .
The next night , Manson rode along with his so - called family members to the Los Feliz home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca , then left three of them to commit the murders .
" Death to pigs " was written on a wall , and " Healter Skelter , " which was misspelled , on the refrigerator door .
Manson was also convicted of the earlier murder of musician Gary Hinman in his Topanga Canyon home , and the slaying of former stuntman Donald " Shorty " Shea at the Spahn movie ranch in Chatsworth , where Manson had his commune .
Manson initially was sentenced to death .
A 1972 ruling by the California Supreme Court found the state 's death penalty law at the time unconstitutional and his death sentence was changed in 1977 to life in prison with the possibility of parole .
The septuagenarian has made 11 failed bids for parole since 1978 , the last in 2007 when he was ordered to continue serving life sentences .
Manson 's next parole hearing is scheduled for 2012 .

The FBI released their 2008 Mortgage Fraud Report today .
( ht Bob_in_MA )
Mortgage fraud trends in 2008 reflected the overall downturn in the US economy ... the mortgage loan industry reported a spike in foreclosures and defaults ; and financial markets continued to contract , diminishing credit to financial institutions , businesses , and homeowners .
These combined factors uncovered and fueled a rampant mortgage fraud climate fraught with opportunistic participants desperate to maintain or increase their current standard of living .
Industry employees sought to maintain the high standard of living they enjoyed during the boom years of the real estate market and overextended mortgage holders were often desperate to reduce or eliminate their bloated mortgage payments .
Mortgage fraud continues to be an escalating problem in the United States and a contributing factor to the billions of dollars in losses in the mortgage industry .
emphasis added
Builder - Bailout Schemes : Builders are employing builder - bailout schemes to offset losses , and circumvent excessive debt and potential bankruptcy , as home sales suffer from escalating foreclosures , rising inventory , and declining demand .
Builder - bailout schemes are common in any distressed real estate market and typically consist of builders offering excessive incentives to buyers , which are not disclosed on the mortgage loan documents .
Builder - bailout schemes often occur when a builder or developer experiences difficulty selling their inventory and uses fraudulent means to unload it .
In a common scenario , the builder has difficulty selling property and offers an incentive of a mortgage with no down payment .
For example , a builder wishes to sell a property for $ 200,000 .
He inflates the value of the property to $ 240,000 and finds a buyer .
The lender funds a mortgage loan of $ 200,000 believing that $ 40,000 was paid to the builder , thus creating home equity .
However , the lender is actually funding 100 percent of the home ’s value .
The builder acquires $ 200,000 from the sale of the home , pays off his building costs , forgives the buyer ’s $ 40,000 down payment , and keeps any profits .
If the home forecloses , the lender has no equity in the home and must pay foreclosure expenses .
Short - Sale Schemes : Short - sale schemes are desirable to mortgage fraud perpetrators because they do not have to competitively bid on the properties they purchase , as they do for foreclosure sales .
Perpetrators also use short sales to recycle properties for future mortgage fraud schemes .
Short - sale fraud schemes are difficult to detect since the lender agrees to the transaction , and the incident is not reported to internal bank investigators or the authorities .
As such , the extent of short sale fraud nationwide is unknown .
A real estate short sale is a type of pre-foreclosure sale in which the lender agrees to sell a property for less than the mortgage owed .
In a typical short sale scheme , the perpetrator uses a straw buyer to purchase a home for the purpose of defaulting on the mortgage .
The mortgage is secured with fraudulent documentation and information regarding the straw buyer .
Payments are not made on the property loan causing the mortgage to default .
Prior to the foreclosure sale , the perpetrator offers to purchase the property from the lender in a short - sale agreement .
The lender agrees without knowing that the short sale was premeditated .
The mortgage owed on the property often equals or exceeds 100 percent of the property ’s equity .
Foreclosure Rescue Schemes : Foreclosure rescue schemes are often used in association with advance fee / loan modification program schemes .
The perpetrators convince homeowners that they can save their homes from foreclosure through deed transfers and the payment of up - front fees .
This “ foreclosure rescue ” often involves a manipulated deed process that results in the preparation of forged deeds .
In extreme instances , perpetrators may sell the home or secure a second loan without the homeowners ’ knowledge , stripping the property ’s equity for personal enrichment .
Committing fraud to " maintain their high standard of living " ... hopefully these guys will enjoy some free state accomodations for a few years .
There is some state specific data and some discussion of some common schemes .
Here are a few ( there is much more detail in the report ) :
Robert Anson Heinlein ( July 7 , 1907 – May 8 , 1988 ) was an American science - fiction writer .
Often called the “ dean of science fiction writers ” , his controversial works continue to have an influential effect on the genre .
Heinlein became one of the first science - fiction writers to break into mainstream magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post in the late 1940s .
He was one of the best - selling science - fiction novelists for many decades , and he , Isaac Asimov , and Arthur C. Clarke are often considered the “ Big Three ” of science fiction authors .
Heinlein was named the first Science Fiction Writers Grand Master in 1974 .
He won Hugo Awards for four of his novels ; in addition , fifty years after publication , five of his works were awarded “ Retro Hugos ” — awards given retrospectively for works that were published before the Hugo Awards came into existence .
In his fiction , Heinlein coined terms that have become part of the English language , including “ grok ” , “ waldo ” , and “ speculative fiction ” , as well as popularizing existing terms like “ TANSTAAFL ” , “ pay it forward ” , and “ space marine ” .

It ’s a party that does n’t seem to care about anything other than devotion to a set of so - called principles that never amounted to more than cult - like rhetoric .
Waging unwarranted warfare while radically cutting taxes for the wealthy and turning the national economy into the equivalent of a Ponzi scheme may be evidence of many things , but none of them have to do with the so - called conservative principles the G.O.P. is always braying about .
When it came to looking out for the interests of ordinary working Americans , the party of just - say - no could hardly have cared less .
Referring to the catastrophic ordeal of Detroit ’s automakers , Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama , the senior Republican on the banking committee , told us last November , “ The financial situation facing the Big Three is not a national problem but their problem . ”
And Phil Gramm , John McCain ’s top financial adviser during the presidential campaign , was enshrined in the foot - in - mouth hall of fame last summer when he said the country was experiencing “ a mental recession . ”
After awhile , it became all but impossible to overlook the madness of these true believers and the incalculable damage they had done to the country .
Voters who had n’t sipped from the Kool - Aid themselves could n’t help but recognize that the G.O.P. was bizarrely detached from the real world .
It still is .
In the place of constructive alternatives to Obama administration policies , it has offered increasingly hysterical rhetoric .
Mr. Gingrich warned on television that the Democrats ’ moves to stem the banking crisis “ gives them the potential to basically create the equivalent of a dictatorship . ”
Senator Jim DeMint , a Republican from South Carolina , described President Obama as “ the world ’s best salesman of socialism . ”
And Mike Huckabee , a former Republican governor of Arkansas and presidential candidate , said of the administration ’s economic policies : “ Lenin and Stalin would love this stuff . ”
This is not a party that can be trusted with the leadership of the country .
John McCain was ready to have Sarah Palin a heartbeat away from the Oval Office and reportedly wanted Phil Gramm to be his Treasury secretary .
Michael Steele , chairman of the Republican National Committee , has the strategic sense and attention span that you ’d expect to find in a frat house on Saturday night .
“ I love the Oscars , ” he told GQ .
“ I ’m looking for who ’s got what dress on , you know ? ”
All the talk about the permanent marginalization of the Republican Party is silly .
It will be back .
Someday .
But first it will have to stop fooling itself and re-engage with the real world .
Bram Cohen is not only the creator of BitTorrent , the protocol responsible for between 25 % and 55 % of all internet traffic , but also the creator and co-creator of a number of great puzzles that he sells on his Shapeways Shop .
Intrigued by yet another Shapeways Community Member with their own wikipedia article ( 5 and counting ) and the obvious dichotomy between someone that has done more than almost anyone else to make Intellectual Property immediately and widely available for free while whilst now selling his own IP online , I decided to interview Bram .
You can find out more about Bram by checking out his Livejournal ( yes , replete with Evony ad ) , his website or by following him on Twitter ( insightful and fun ) .
Bram is above with two of the puzzles he has created .
The white one is called Looseness Burr and can be found on his Shapeways Shop .
Joris : Bit Torrent makes it possible for anyone to download content from the web .
People critical of it say that it is a tool for infringing Intellectual Property .
At the same time you have a Shapeways Shop where you basically sell models based on your own intellectual property ?
Do you see the duality ?
Continued below .
Bram : I have a lot less interesting in the subject of intellectual property
than most people seem to expect .
I have an interest in networking
protocols , and also one in puzzles , both of which happen to bring up
intellectual property issues , but I deal with such issues of necessity ,
not because I particularly care about them .
There is the interesting
question of how to get puzzles produced , and also how to try to make
money off of their production , which ideally I ’d like to do , but that ’s
a secondary issue , since obviously it ’s impossible to make money off a
puzzle which people are n’t very interested in even if it ’s free .
I know you ’re not really interested in the intellectual property issue but …
How would you feel if there was a “ The Shapeways Bay ” that offered your designs as a free download ?
In some sense that already exists and I post my own stuff to it – the
‘ Puzzle will be played ’ burr site has a huge collection of burr
puzzles , and most of my experience with burr puzzles comes from
rebuilding most of the puzzles from that site in Burrtools .
Only a tiny
fraction of all puzzles have any commercial value whatsoever , so piracy
is n’t really an issue for them .
Among the puzzles with a little bit of
commercial value , the few people and companies who make them are
generally quite strict about only producing things with permission ,
because the community is small enough that there ’s little gain and a
lot of potential ostracism from doing otherwise .
For the rare puzzle
which has so much commercial potential that it might attract real
knockoffs , the two approaches are to either make a brand - based premium
version , as the Rubik ’s Cube does these days , or to ramp up supply
ahead of the knockoffs while the fad moves along , as the Rubik ’s Cube
completely failed to do when it was first introduced .
Patents do n’t in
practice help all that much .
All of that is in the ‘ good problem to
have ’ category though – most mechanical puzzles simply fail
commercially , and it ’s unusual for one to succeed enough for knockoffs
to be a concern .
So how did you come to make a tool that is responsible for 35 % of all the internet traffic in the world ?
BitTorrent is a tool for file distribution which I wrote .
It ’s allows
people who are downloading something to automatically upload it at the
same time , so a very large piece of content can be delivered to a lot
of people without costing a huge amount of money to whoever made it
available initially .
It works very well , so it ’s wound up using a lot
of bandwidth .
How did you get people to use it in the beginning ?
I made a useful tool and gave it away for free .
It was handy enough to become popular .
Make any money off of it ?
The company raised some investment money , and I ’m currently employed working there .
How long have you been interested in puzzles ?
I got obsessed with the Rubik ’s Cube when I was in high school , and
figured out a solution to it on my own back then .
It was n’t a good
solution , and it took me several months of constant playing with it to
find , but for a pre-teen to find a solution without any help is pretty
good .
For the Rubik ’s cube aficionado ’s out there how does your solution work ?
I solve the bottom edges , then three of the bottom corners , then use
the missing bottom corner to quickly solve three of the middle layer
pieces , then do the last bottom corner , then use F - U2FU2RUR - to finish
the middle layer .
Then I orient the top edges using FURU - R - F- , then
orient the top corners using RUR - URUUR - , then position the top edges
using R2B-RL - U2R-LF2BR2 and finally position the top corners by
keyholing using F - BF and its inverse .
( When I teach people I show them
using FB2 F , because there ’s no inverse and alternating to learn with
that one ) .
How fast can you solve a Rubik ’s cube ?
A bit less than a minute and a half .
I ’m not particularly fast – I ’m very bad at spotting the positions of pieces .
Was it your fascination with mathematics that brought you to puzzles ?
Not really , I ’d say the same thing which makes me interested in math
makes me interested in puzzles , although they are n’t directly related .
My familiarity with computational complexity gives some important
insights into the fundamental nature of certain kinds of puzzles
though , particularly burrs .
What kind of puzzles do you make ?
My main interest started out being twisty puzzles , loosely defined as
‘ puzzles like the Rubik ’s Cube ’ .
It generally includes puzzles in which
there are a bunch of identical pieces and several operations which
permute those pieces , and you scramble it and the puzzle is to
unscramble it .
Puzzles of this form have a number of nice properties :
They ’re always physically one piece so parts do n’t get lost , they ’re
much easier to unsolve than to solve , and it ’s possible to invent one
without knowing how to solve it .
( You can see videos of twisty puzzles here . )
I ’ve more recently gotten interested in burrs , since I learned how to
use Burrtools .
I ’m too lazy to work on burrs unaided .
I generally try
to make my burrs be all identical pieces , for aesthetic reasons , and
because it ’s a criterion which forces me to actually do some work on
the puzzle myself instead of blindly giving Burrtools a set of
constraints and using whatever result it spits out .
( This is an example of a burr puzzle . )
My other strange puzzle interest is puzzle rings .
( Here is an example of a puzzle ring ) Almost all puzzle
rings made for the last several hundred years have been the exact same
design , which is a very good design but there are lots of other
possibilities to explore .
Puzzle rings turn out to be a very
distinctive genre of puzzle , which most closely resemble packing
puzzles in that they come apart easily and are hard to put back
together again , but they do n’t come apart completely and have subtle
aspects of how the rings interlock which are most of the interest of
the puzzle and which there really is n’t an analogue to in any other
type of puzzle .
Occasionally I ’ll do a puzzle which is in a genre other than one of
those , but my general approach is to take an interest in something and
go very deep in studying that one thing .
Most of my twisty puzzle inventions wind up being collaborations with
Oskar van Deventer , and he ’s done a bunch of work on instantiating my
puzzle ring designs as well , which is why so many of my designs are on
Oskar ’s shapeways shop .
Burrtools is able to export directly to stl ,
which is where all the files in my shop came from .
When designing a puzzle do you start at the end ?
or at the beginning ?
Do you start with the solution or the problem ?
Your question presupposes a process where the puzzle inventor comes up
with a secret which is then hidden from the solver .
Most of my designs
are so simple that it would be impossible to follow such a process –
the design constraints imposed by how it works make it challenging to
come up with a puzzle at all , much less one which follows very
preconceived notions of how it should work .
It ’s an extreme version of
form following function .
Explain the “ form following function ” issues behind puzzle design for us ..
A lot of my interest in puzzles is in trying to explain to people that
even very simple motions in 3 - space are much more mathematically
obscure than people think they are .
Even Cartesian coordinates are a
hack which happen to provide a simple construction of 3 - space , but wind
up making most of 3 - space ’s fundamental properties appear to be spooky
coincidences rather than being at the center of how it works .
When I
say this usually people have no idea what I ’m talking about , but when
people play with my puzzles the intuition gets across .
Most of my
puzzle ideas are based on some notion of movement , and that function
almost entirely dictates the form of the puzzles , because 3d movement
has very strong mathematical underpinning which it ’s impossible to make
small stylistic variants of .
What software do you use to make your puzzles ?
I generally use Burrtools for my burr puzzles .
For our collaborations
Oskar uses Solidworks , Rhino , and miscellaneous utilities .
For
specifying puzzle rings , I generally use ascii art 🙂
Above is an image of the Ascii art , because our CMS is not equipped to handle it .
Could you recommend any of the tools you use ?
Burrtools is an excellent tool for making burr puzzles , but it ’s
extremely special purpose .
Solidworks has a great history function ,
which allows you to parametrize your model so that individual
dimensions can be altered and everything they interact with can be
automatically adjusted to go along with it , which can make some changes
be done in literally seconds which would otherwise require redoing the
whole thing from scratch .
Rhino is good for some transforms done on
finished meshes which Solidworks is incapable of , like bending a helix .
Ascii art I ca n’t recommend in general 🙂
What brought you to Shapeways ?
I think I first saw it when Oskar started posting things on it .
Why are you interested in 3D fabrication ?
Many of my designs are so convoluted that it would be prohibitively
difficult to make them with any process other than 3d printing , and
even for ones which can be made in other ways , the amount of work
necessary to do multiple revisions or even sometimes to make a single
prototype is much less when done via 3d printing , and sometimes even
cost competitive if the pieces are made small .
Do you think that 3D printing will become mainstream or be for a niche ?
3D printing as already fairly mainstream , in that it ’s a common
practice to 3d print a master which is then cast afterwards for
commercial parts .
If prices get down to somewhere around a fifth to a
tenth where they are now you ’ll start seeing 3d printed parts as a
normal process for making consumer items , particularly if the Z axis
resolution is improved a lot .
The improvement of Z axis resolution ( in layer resolution ) is a good
point .
Do you see 3D printing moving forward with everyone having their
own printer ?
Or would limitations such as this hold back such a
development ?
3d printers are expensive enough that it does n’t make sense for people
to own them individually , since they mostly sit around unused and the amortized expenses are going up in smoke in that case ( this is actually
true of 2d printers as well – those things are a such a ripoff ) .
Moving
towards a person or company owning a printer and taking orders from
other people to do on it has been a huge improvement in how 3d printing
is done , so no , I do n’t see anyone owning their own 3d printer any time
soon .
If anything we ’ll see an extension to the outsource model , where
companies own geographically distributed printers and are able to print
something physically close to you to have it ship faster .
If 3D printing does become a process to make consumer items which items
do you see it being used for ?
Do you see it changing society ,
manufacturing etc. or will the impact be more limited ?
I think 3d printing is likely to result in a wider variety of products ,
made in shorter runs than they have been to date .
There might also
start being customization of shapes as well as colors like we have
today , and possibly a lot of shapes in products which cause serious
difficulties for traditional manufacturing processes , although the
technical limitations of traditional methods are n’t all that onerous ,
so I expect that to be a smaller phenomenon than one might hope .
Oskar informs me that you said the puzzle ring designs are all
printable in metal , and the price of the 6 - banded design is about $ 20 , which is
comparable to the cheapest puzzle rings bade with traditional
techniques and simpler designs , so it appears that there is now at
least one product for which 3d printing is just plain better and
cheaper .
Puzzle rings are a bit exceptional though , as they involve
very little material , very precise workmanship , and have shapes which
are uniquely challenging .
Any chance that white gold and platinum will
become available as printing materials ? 🙂
Gold maybe , white gold less sure , platinum not in the near term .
What do you think of Shapeways what should we change , what should stay the same ?
The process for people to order a piece if they are n’t uploading
anything needs to be streamlined a lot .
Individual sellers need more
control over how their shops look and are organised , for example right
now if Oskar were to upload multiple sizes of one of the ring designs
they ’d all be displayed on the top level and completely clutter up his
shop .
There are also needs to be better SEO .
For example , right now if
you make an improved version of a model you have to upload it
separately and take down the old version , completely breaking all
hyperlinks to the old one .
Finally , Shapeways is currently very
unforgiving about requiring absolutely watertight models for printing ,
and it would be nice if it did a reasonable job of accepting things
which were almost , but not quite , watertight .
We should be providing you guys with significant improvements to the organization of Shops and the multiple sizes in two weeks or so .
The “ versioning ” issue is rather complex for us to solve but we are working on it .
The watertight issue is also something we ’re trying to improve .
You ’ve said that “ my general approach is to take an interest in
something and go very deep in studying that one thing . ”
Do you think
that this way of doing things is typical of an inventor ?
a coder ?
A
puzzle person ?
I think you have to do that to some extent to come up with an original
invention .
It ’s hard to come up with an original idea about something
if you just give it a cursory examination while other people have
thought about it deeply for a long time .
The hardcore puzzle enthusiast
community tends to have broader interests , but I suppose that ’s a bit
misleading since they ’re vastly outnumbered by , for example , people who
are only interested in crosswords .
Programmers used to all be widely
diversified , but that ’s becoming less so since we now have clear
specialties in programming and languages which have meaningful
differences instead of just being worse versions of C .
Why is no one implementing IPv6 ?
There is n’t much clear benefit from it .
What I ’d really like to see is
for wireless router manufacturers to have UPnP port forwarding turned
on by default .
Most of them have it built but turned off by default ,
for no apparent reason .
With HTML5 will it be possible to use a code snippet that you can put
on any web page to turn that page into its own tracker , magnet URI , p2 p
client , player the whole shebang ?
Trackers need to have some persistent state , which I do n’t think HTML5
provides .
The embedded video functionality is interesting though , I
guess will soon find out if flash is more than just a video - playing gimmick .

As our new administration moves forward and the real adults in this country begin working on a solution to the mess we have had dumped upon us , the Republicans , GOP , Conservatives , Fundamentalists Greedy Old Bastards have realized that simply holding their breath and stamping their feet is not going to get them the attention they so badly need anymore .
And instead of redefining their methodology or attempting to put out the fire they 've created , they instead choose to throw more gasoline into the blaze .
Apparently Reagan 's tent has stopped checking ID at the door .
And whether they were invited or snuck in the maniacs who 've been making the headlines recently are undoubtedly linked to the Republican Party .
The party of fear and hate that paint any compassion as weakness , doubt as treason and xenophobia as patriotism and add an unnecessary " U " to the word " nuclear " has become the haven of Neal Horsley , Mustard Cops , Draft Dodging Hypocrites , and Lobotomized Lipstick Wearing Pit Bulls
With the the exception of Cho Seung - Hui , the following is an enumeration of the top 3 US mass murderers with a brief synopsis of their crimes and background .
This list is effectively a mirror of Wikipedia 's List of Mass Murderers and Spree Killers
George Hennard Oct. 16th , 1991 Killeen Texas 23 killed , 19 - 22 injured .
The massacre was carried out by George Jo Hennard , a 35 - year - old former seaman .
He was born on October 15 , 1956 in Sayre , Pennsylvania , the son of a surgeon and a homemaker .
Upon graduating from high school in 1974 , he enlisted in the U. S. Navy and served for two years until he was honorably discharged in 1976 .
He later enlisted in the Merchant Marines in 1977 , however he was court martialed in 1981 after he was arrested for drug possession .
His seaman 's papers were suspended the following year for racist remarks on altercation , and were later revoked in 1989 , after his second arrest .
James Oliver Huberty July 18th 1984 San Diego California 21 killed 19 injured .
Before Huberty left for McDonald's , his wife Etna asked him where he was going .
Huberty responded that he was " hunting humans " .
[ 1 ]
Earlier that day he had commented to his wife , " Society had its chance . " [ 2 ]
When questioned by police , Etna gave no explanation as to why she failed to report this bizarre behavior .
A witness , who spotted Huberty as he left his apartment and proceeded down San Ysidro Boulevard with two firearms , phoned police , but the dispatcher gave the reporting officers the wrong address .
Huberty used a 9 mm Uzi semi-automatic ( the primary weapon fired in the massacre ) , a Winchester pump- action 12 - gauge shotgun , and a 9 mm Browning HP in the restaurant , killing 21 people and wounding 19 others .
Huberty 's victims were predominantly Mexican and Mexican - American and ranged in age from 8 months to 74 years .
The massacre began at 3:40 p.m. and lasted for 77 minutes .
Huberty had spent 257 rounds of ammunition before he was fatally shot by a SWAT team sniper , Chuck Foster , perched on the roof of the Yum - Yum Donuts adjacent to the restaurant .
Initially , law enforcement and emergency crews responded to the McDonald 's located at the U.S. International Border with Tijuana at 3:15 p.m. , and 15 minutes later changed directions after they learned that the shooting was actually taking place at the McDonald 's next to the post office approximately 2 miles away .
Although Huberty stated during the massacre that he had killed thousands in Vietnam , he had never actually served in any military branch .
Eye - witnesses stated that he had previously been seen at the Big Bear supermarket and later at the U.S. Post Office .
It was surmised that he found the McDonald 's a better target .
Due to the number of victims , local funeral homes had to use the San Ysidro Civic Center in order to hold all of the wakes .
The local parish , Mount Carmel Church , had to have back - to - back funeral masses in order to accommodate all of the dead .
Jiverly Antares Wong April 3 2009 Binghamton New York 13 Killed 4 Injured
The Binghamton shootings took place on Friday , April 3 , 2009 , at the American Civic Association immigration center in Binghamton , New York , United States .
At approximately 10:30 a.m. EDT , a naturalized immigrant Jiverly Wong ( aka Jiverly Voong ) [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] entered the facility and shot numerous people inside . [ 6 ]
Fourteen people were ultimately confirmed dead , including the shooter , [ 2 ] and four were wounded in the incident . [ 3] [ 7 ]
The injured people , aged from twenty to mid-fifties , were treated for gunshot wounds at Wilson Medical Center in Johnson City and Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
The American Civic Association in Binghamton provides citizenship , cultural , and language assistance to the local immigrant community .
None of them killed because of Global Warming .
None of them took their guns down to the immigration center to get Universal Health Care .
What liberal has ever said an entire race of people need be eliminated ?
They killed out of hate and out of fear .
This is what the Republican Party is selling .

One of the people who was instrumental in pushing for laws to increase the legal drinking age to 21 now calls his actions " the single most regrettable decision " of his career .
Dr. Morris Chafetz , a psychiatrist who was on the presidential commission in the 1980s that recommended raising the drinking age to 21 , made his remarks in an editorial that he is shopping for publication and which he released to the advocacy group Choose Responsibility .
Chafetz wrote the editorial to mark the 25th anniversary of the law that was signed by President Ronald Reagan on July 17 , 1984 .
" Legal Age 21 has not worked , " Chafetz said in the piece .
" To be sure , drunk driving fatalities are lower now than they were in 1982 .
But they are lower in all age groups .
And they have declined just as much in Canada , where the age is 18 or 19 , as they have in the United States . "
Chafetz said the law instead has resulted in " collateral , off - road damage " such as binge drinking that occurs in underage youth and crimes like date rape , assaults and property damage .
Chafetz is not new to controversy .
A former presidential appointee at the White House Conference for a Drug - Free America , he is the author of two books that question the expertise of scientists , lawmakers and other experts : " Big Fat Liars , " and " The Tyranny of Experts . "
His latest remarks on the legal age drinking law were applauded by Choose Responsibility , which is a leading advocacy organization working to lower the legal age .
The group 's efforts , and opposition to it , were profiled last year by the Los Angeles Times .

Former ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam ( R ) oversaw the repressions
In the late 1970s Ethiopia 's Marxist military rulers tortured and murdered hundreds of thousands in brutal repressions .
Now , one survivor is trying to create a permanent online archive of the so - called Red Terror using the documents the Communist regime , known as the Derg , left behind , reports the BBC's Elizabeth Blunt .
Hirut Abebe - Jiri was in her early teens when Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown .
She had had a happy and privileged childhood , part of a well - off and well - connected family .
But the revolution made people like them liable to be viewed as suspicious .
Finally they started putting water on me - then after that when they hit you , your skin starts cracking , and the blood starts coming out
Hirut Abebe - Jiri
The revolutionary guards took her uncle first , then her father , then they came for her and her younger sister .
" I was shaking and my sister was holding my hand , " she says .
" They took us into a kind of office room , with two desks , and Kelbessa [ a senior official ] was there . "
They were greeted by a horrifying sight .
An 11 - year - old boy from their neighbourhood was trussed up on a broomstick and suspended between the desks .
He had been badly beaten and was bleeding and vomiting .
" When we saw him , we just froze .
And they asked him a question , when he was like that , in that position , they asked him : ' Which one ? '
And he said , ' Hirut ' . "
With that , Ms Hirut 's sister was taken away , Ms Hirut was trussed up between the tables and the beating started .
" They were asking me about this gun which the boy said he had given me , and until this day I did n't know anything about the gun , so honestly I could n't tell them , " she says .
" Finally they started putting water on me .
Then after that when they hit you , your skin starts cracking , and the blood starts coming out .
That was the painful time , and I was in and out of consciousness . "
The beating went on all night .
It was daylight by the time they dragged her out of the torture room , and round to a cellar under the building where the women prisoners were kept .
She had been beaten so badly it was several days before she could even walk as far as the toilet .
Hotel discovery Nowadays thick weeds grow round the back of the building - still used as the local government headquarters - and the door to the cellar where the women were kept is locked .
We need this archive , we need to study it - these people were not from another planet , these people were living in our neighbourhood
Hirut Abebe - Jiri
A faint slogan scrawled over the door is still visible : " Ka hullum belay , Abiotu ! "
It means : " And above everything , the Revolution ! "
At the far end , there is a small store room where they put Ms Hirut 's friend Elizabeth and her younger sister .
Ms Elizabeth 's sister , just 15 years old , was to die there , but the two other girls both survived .
On their release they left the country .
Ms Hirut went to Canada and Ms Elizabeth to the US , where they tried to forget the horrors they had suffered and build new lives .
And that might have been the end of it .
But one day Ms Hirut got a phone call from an Ethiopian friend who said she was sure she had seen Kelbessa Negewo , their torturer , in a hotel in Atlanta .
Ms Hirut and Ms Elizabeth travelled to Atlanta and sure enough , it was him .
" We were devastated because everything came back to our minds again .
We had worked so hard to bury it , " she says .
The three young women had no legal experience but they were determined to bring Kelbessa to justice .
It took 16 years , but in 2006 Kelbessa was put on a plane to Addis Ababa , where he is now serving a life sentence .
Rich archive Now Ms Hirut has a new campaign - to create a documentation centre of the Red Terror .
The Communists were overthrown in 1991 Ethiopia 's obsessive bureaucracy meant that everything was documented .
Every arrest , every execution , every act of torture was authorised , signed for and rubber - stamped - and every piece of paper was filed away and kept .
At the time it meant that the offiicals " covered their backs " .
If any of their acts was queried , they could prove someone else had authorised them to do it .
But in the last days of the military regime , when it was threatened by rebels advancing on the capital , no - one seems to have made any attempt to destroy these incriminating papers .
The special prosecutor 's office used around 600,000 documents to build cases against the leaders of the Derg , and there are thousands more files still on the shelves .
Now the special prosecutor 's job is almost done .
The prosecutor himself , Yosef Kiros , says he believes there are no more cases which can realistically be prosecuted .
But Ms Hirut is determined that the documents his office collected should not be lost .
Apart from anything else , many Derg officials had fled the country and were sentenced , like Mr Kelbessa , in absentia .
The documents may be needed to get them extradited and Ms Hirut has her eyes on the biggest prize of all , former head of state Mengistu Haile Mariam , who found refuge in Zimbabwe .
As well as preserving the documents and keeping them in one place , she also wants to put them online , as an academic resource .
" We need this archive , " says Ms Hirut .
" We need to study it .
These people were not from another planet .
These people were living in our neighbourhood , our families knew each other , we went to the same church , and then all of a sudden when the worst came , they did all these atrocities .
" We still do n't understand it .
We have to study it , so that it never happens again .
We will learn from it , and the younger generation will have a better life than we did .
That is our hope . "
To listen to Elizabeth Blunt 's full interview with Hirut Abebe - Jiri , tune in to African Perspectiveon the BBC World Service .
The programme is first broadcast on Saturday 8 August at 1106 GMT .
It will be available online from 2106 GMT , for one week .

Well , I thought that I had seen some fantastic data manipulation in the past , but today ’s release of the May employment report by the BLS was a real keeper .
It is one for the books ( the forensic accounting books , specifically ) .
Here ’s the news :
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) —
Job losses slowed dramatically in May , according to the latest government reading on the battered labor market , even as the unemployment rate rose to a 26 - year high .
Employers cut 345,000 jobs from their payrolls in the month , down from the revised 504,000 - job decline in April .
What spectacular news !
Stock futures vaulted , gold killed , the dollar rebounded – all in all a very favorable set of market outcomes that are certainly welcome in the marbled halls of DC and on Wall Street .
The problem is that this huge surprise to the upside is completely out of line with other sources of data and depends ( once again ) on an incredibly suspect boost from the Birth - Death Model .
Let ’s start there .
In the chart below , you are looking at the number of jobs that the BLS has " modeled " to have been created .
These are either added to or subtracted from the total that is reported and trumpeted across the financial - media spin machine .
I want you to note the blue arrows , which reveal that 43,000 construction jobs were somehow added in the month of May , along with 77,000 " leisure & hospitality " ( hotels and parks and such ) jobs and even 7,000 financial services jobs ( I bet there are more than a few banking industry folks wondering where those might be ! ) .
All told , this resulted in 220,000 jobs being added to the reported number , which came in at 345,000 where 520,000 were expected .
This is an enormous improvement of +175,000 jobs over the expected number ; the only problem is that 220,000 of these jobs cannot be counted , touched , or verified , as they were modeled .
Now I do n’t know about you , but in my neck of the woods , this year is much darker on the job front than last year .
Every piece of data I am reading suggests that this is a national phenomenon .
How many jobs were " modeled " and added last May ?
Only 176,000 .
So we might ask ourselves , again , what sort of a model is it that can find a way to add 25 % more jobs this May than last May ?
What exactly are the inputs that feed this model ?
One clue can be divined by looking at this chart of past Birth - Death job additions for the month of May , stretching back to the start of the decade .
Looking at the chart above , we might note that the Birth - Death model ramped up its additions from 2000 to 2004 and now seems " pegged " in a very narrow band .
Equally odd is the observation that the model ’s output is impervious to both growth and recessions .
Even more oddly , we might note that over the past ten years it is this May that has the highest modeled " addition " of them all .
How does this jibe with your sense of things ?
Do you feel dizzy when you try and compare your experience with this data ?
That dizziness is due to cognitive dissonance .
Another private source for employment data comes from ADP , which is a payroll processing company that services a very large number of businesses .
I have n’t been the biggest fan of the ADP data , especially since they started revising their methods to more closely track the BLS releases .
As Barry Rithotz so accurately put it a while ago :
ADP has their own proprietary data sources ; they track employees ( new and existing ) , they can track payroll dollars ( total gains and losses , and per employee changes ) , off of the actual payroll checks going to employees .
Why try to imitate the BLS output each month ?
ADP can create a very specific set of reports that ARE PURELY DRIVEN BY THEIR OWN PAYROLL RECEIPTS , that stands on its own .
Why even bother messing around with trying to imitate or forecast BLS data ?
The BLS Non-Farm Payroll numbers are somewhat flawed , subject to massive revisions , and fatally flawed due to how the Birth Death adjustment has been applied .
If ADP wants to contribute something valuable , they should stop trying to forecast BLS , and instead generate their own , proprietary , data driven monthly NFP numbers .
With that said , here was the ADP estimate for May :
The ADP National Employment Report May , 2009 Nonfarm private employment decreased 532,000 from April to May 2009 on a seasonally adjusted basis , according to the ADP National Employment Report® .
The estimated change of employment from March to April was revised by 54,000 , from a decline of 491,000 to a decline of 545,000 .
( Source )
The interesting part is that the ADP number does not include government workers , so I would have expected the BLS release ( which does ) to have tracked lower , not higher , than the ADP data .
I say this because every state I have looked at has either cut or frozen government jobs .
Yet the BLS report estimated that only 7,000 government jobs were lost across the entire country , which is mysterious , since quite a few of the temporary census jobs were terminated in May .
And not just a few either :
TOWNSHEND , Vt. ( AP ) —
For weeks , Greg Noel roamed the spine of the Green Mountains with a handheld GPS unit , walking dirt roads and chatting with people as he helped create a map of every housing unit in the United States .
Work was good :
The sun was out , the snow was gone and the blackflies had n’t begun to hatch .
But now that work is over and Noel , 60 , and more than 60,000 other Americans hired in April to help with the 2010 census are out of work once more .
( Source )
Given that 60,000 temporary census jobs went away , I am at a loss to figure out how all the other government hiring and firing collectively added up to a 53,000 job gain to secure the final - 7,000 reading .
As before , my assumption is that these numbers are quite fuzzy , not worth the paper they are printed on , and heavily falsified to achieve narrow political and market influencing aims .
While I can certainly understand , and even find some compassion for , the desire to manipulate the data to inject some confidence and optimism into the populace and markets , I must regretfully conclude that such efforts are more damaging than helpful .
We did ourselves no favors by fibbing to ourselves during the blowing of the credit bubble , and we do ourselves no favors by repeating that behavior now .
We need good and believable data .
I judge that our markets would respond better in the long run to believable data , and that we actually owe it to ourselves to provide the most honest and accurate assessments of reality that we can .
On bright days , the rooftop of the Anaheim Hilton is so blindingly white that it looks like a mirror positioned directly at the sun .
That dazzling glare might just be the greenest thing to happen to the top of a building since solar panels .
The white coating deflects nearly 85 % of the heat that hits it , reducing the surface temperature by as much as 50 degrees .
That means less energy is needed to cool the hotel ’s interior , cutting air - conditioning costs and carbon emissions .
This is no ordinary coat of paint .
Designed by an 82 - year - old former military scientist from the Inland Empire , the tinted topcoat is filled with tiny hollow glass balls that deflect heat , layered over a waterproof undercoat made of recycled rubber .
The Hilton spent more than $ 150,000 on the project , which was completed in March .
That ’s $ 300,000 less than the cost of a conventional repair to the old , leaky roof , said Jerome Annaloro , director of property operations at the hotel .
If the reflective material cuts utility costs this summer the way management anticipates it will , Annaloro said , he will recommend white roofs for the entire Hilton chain .

“ I was skeptical at first . . . but the product spoke for itself , ” he said .
“ It ’s a win -win . ”
Americans spend about $ 40 billion a year to cool buildings , according to U.S. government figures .
So - called cool roofs are being touted as a simple , inexpensive way of lowering surface temperatures on the tops of structures by as much as 100 degrees , cutting operating costs and slowing climate change .
Energy Secretary Steven Chu , a Nobel Prize winner in physics , recently called for all roofs to be painted white to promote saving energy .
Some scientists suggest that covering dark tar roofs with light - colored coatings could help mitigate the “ urban heat island ” effect .
Development has raised temperatures markedly in many cities , leading to more energy use and smog as well as greater numbers of deaths during heat waves , experts said .
But it will take more than the Hilton to make a dent .

“ To change an entire city and save energy all the way around , you need to get to a critical mass , ” said Scot Horst , senior vice president of the U.S. Green Building Council ’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system .
“ One or two buildings does n’t make that big of a difference . ”
Mass implementation of cool roofs in the 100 largest cities would offset 44 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions , or the equivalent of taking 600 million cars off the road for 18 years , researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found last year .
Some cities , including Chicago , already have ordinances that require light - colored roofs .
Skeptics say white roofs are n’t always the eco-friendly panacea they ’re sometimes made out to be .
The reflective component is most effective in sun-saturated regions like the Southwest .
And it could lead to higher heating bills in the winter because the sun ’s warmth can’t permeate the roof .
Still , the niche is booming .
The Energy Department and U.S. Green Building Council are pushing cool roofs to consumers and developers .
Entrepreneurs are developing a host of new products using metal , ceramic tile , reflective paints and coatings and even rooftop gardens to beat the heat .
Among them is Ronald R. Savin of Rancho Mirage , a serial inventor and holder of nearly 20 patents , who developed the paint atop the Anaheim Hilton .

An engineer and retired Air Force colonel who spent much of his military career creating coatings for spacecraft and airplanes , Savin started his own paint company in 1957 and later sold it to a British conglomerate .
He slowed down a bit when he reached his 70s , spending more time collecting first - edition books and ornate clocks and less time tinkering .
Then , three years ago , he saw a program on the History Channel about recycled rubber .
Inspired , he returned to his lab and spent six months experimenting before making a breakthrough on a new paint .
His Hyperglass top coat is designed like a Rice Krispies treat .
Glass “ microspheres , ” which are used to lighten airplane parts and bowling balls , are suspended in a paint that includes Teflon .
The whiter the titanium dioxide tint , the more heat bounces off .
Underneath , his Hyperflex primer serves as an insulation layer that also helps prevent water damage and erosion .
And because it uses powdered recycled rubber , it helps address another thorny environmental issue : the millions of tires discarded annually in the U.S .

The paint could spawn “ such a violent change in the paint industry that they wo n’t know what to do , ” Savin said .
Hyperseal paints are free of harmful volatile organic compounds known as VOCs and are relatively cheap to produce , but the company ’s Palm Desert factory can make only 5 million gallons a year .
Most large projects , such as bridges , require several hundred million gallons , Savin said .
So he ’s looking to license his formula to other companies .
He ’ll have plenty of competition .
Big players including Sherwin - Williams Co. and Benjamin Moore & Co. are also debuting eco-friendly paints .
Still , Savin ’s product is winning a following .
In addition to the Hilton and the roofs of dozens of homes , the rubberized undercoat now covers a large swath of pavement outside a Palm Desert Wal - Mart .

He also hopes to expand the use of the paint to other structures such as shipping cargo containers and dams to prevent rust .
Rancho Mirage resident David Baron credits
Hyperseal paint with helping him cut his $ 2,500 - a- month summer electricity bill by more than half .
Living without air conditioning in 110 - degree heat just was n’t an option .
“ I gave it a shot because I was looking for anything to help , ” said Baron , who spent $ 10,000 to cover the roof of his 5,600 - square - foot house .
“ We ’re talking huge energy savings .
This will pay for itself in a year or two . ”
It ’s those kind of stories that keep the octogenarian Savin going .
He claims to sometimes test new batches at 3 a.m .
His house is beset with swipes of paint -- on the rusted gate , on labeled bricks by the pool .
The mulch around an outdoor fountain consists of recycled rubber chunks .
Advertisement
His laundry room is a makeshift lab , where paint spackles the washer and dryer and rubber blackens the sink .
Even the parking lot at the 15,000 - square - foot factory is checkered with paint .
“ He ran out of room at his own house , ” said Loch Jones , Hyperseal Inc. 's director of marketing .
“ If you ’re a friend of the colonel ’s , watch your driveway . ”

In 1984 at the Los Angeles Olympics , the women ’s 3000 - meter final was marred by controversy when American Mary Decker fell after making contact with Zola Budd , a runner from South Africa who represented Britain ( due to the boycott of South African sport ) .
Although Budd had been setting the pace , she faded to seventh in the end and was booed by the partisan LA audience ( Decker would later say that she was inexperienced at running in a pack and , as the trailing runner , was responsible for their contact ) .
Maricica Puica of Romania won the event , and Britain ’s Wendy Sly took the silver in a final that was seared into my memory by the televised replays of a stricken Mary Decker , hip injured from her fall , shattered and crying on the infield .
In all of the drama , one of the things that left the greatest impression on me as a high school student and sometime athlete was the simple fact that Zola Budd ran without shoes , an almost unimaginable idea to me at the time .
Budd was one of a handful of famous barefoot runners , including Abebe Bikila , the Ethiopian marathoner who won his first Olympic gold in 1960 without shoes , Tegla Loroupe , the Kenyan women ’s running legend and multiple world record holder , and Ken Bob Saxton , aka ‘ Barefoot Ken Bob , ’ a marathoner and guru to the shoeless .
I ’ve been thinking about barefoot running for a while , oddly enough since I started writing about bare - knuckle punching in no-holds - barred fighting ( or ‘ mixed martial arts ’ like the Ultimate Fighting Championship in its early days ) .
Barefoot running , even more than bare - knuckle boxing , reveals the ways that very simple technologies , if used consistently enough , become part of the developmental niche of the human body , shaping the way that our bones , muscles , tissues , and nervous system develop .
Although this post is not strictly neuroanthropology , I thought I might share some of what I ’m working on , in part because I ’m interested to hear any feedback people have .
In particular , this will focus on how hard it is to sort out what ’s ‘ natural ’ when activity patterns , incredibly variable , are necessary ingredients in the development of biological systems .
But also , as it will become clearer in the post , the ways that our nervous system adapt to different situations , such as having heavily padded feet or being barefoot when we run , illustrates well how even unconscious training is a form of phenotypic , non-genetic , adaptation .
Before I go any further , though , if you have anything to say in response to this , I would love to read it .
This is my first attempt to put down some thoughts that will be in a chapter of an upcoming book …
I was sparked to finally put this down and post it by an item in Wired Science : ‘ To Run Better , Start by Ditching Your Nikes , ’ by Dylan Tweeny .
( See below for a number of other recent articles online . )
Tweeny writes :
Strong evidence shows that thickly cushioned running shoes have done nothing to prevent injury in the 30 - odd years since Nike founder Bill Bowerman invented them , researchers say .
Some smaller , earlier studies suggest that running in shoes may increase the risk of ankle sprains , plantar fasciitis and other injuries .
Runners who wear cheap running shoes have fewer injuries than those wearing expensive trainers .
Meanwhile , injuries plague 20 to 80 percent of regular runners every year .
The article shares quotes by a number of barefoot running advocates who argue strongly that running in minimalist shoes , or unshod , reduces the likelihood of injury : ‘ After all , ’ Tweeny writes in a discussion of the work of Daniel Lieberman , a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University , ‘we evolved without shoes . ’
In the passage , Tweeny refers to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine ( Clinghan et al. 2008 ) that found cheap running shoes correlated with better long - term health outcomes than more expensive footwear .
Runners who used more expensive running shoes had a pretty shocking 123 % higher rate of injury than those in less expensive shoes ( see Robbins and Waked 1997 ) .
The Robbins and Waked ( 1997 ) study directly focused on the relation between deceptive shoe advertising and the force of barefoot subjects ’ footfall when they came down on a surface designed to look like shoe padding .
Led to believe that the surface was protecting them , people changed their running style in ways that increased impact .
The rate of injuries among runners , including the relatively consistent injury rate despite ‘ improvements ’ in shoe technology , make some observers suspicious that shoes might be causing , rather than protecting against , injury , even if the link is indirect through shifts in technique or even the population that can participate .
Ross Tucker and Anthony Dugas of The Science of Sport point out that there are , in fact , many possible explanations for changes in injury rates – or changing reasons why rates remain constant – such as the demographic factor that many runners in the 1990s might be in significantly worse physical condition than runners in the 1970s as the hobby spread to less - fit individuals .
But Tucker and Dugas , too , conclude that certain types of running shoes may not be good for all distance runners , a conclusion supported by a range of research ( see , e.g. , Richards , Magin and Callister 2009 ) .
In a review of research on barefoot running and training , Michael Wharburton ( 2001 ) suggests that running and walking without shoes may decrease acute injury rates from accidents ( sprains ) , diminish chronic injuries from repeated shock ( among them , plantar fasciitis ) , and increase movement economy , because additional weight on the feet is harder to carry while running than weight elsewhere ( see Divert et al. 2008 ) .
Wharburton asks in his conclusion why more runners do n’t opt to run barefoot , suggesting it might be fear of puncture wounds , thermal problems , or even misperceptions about the dangers .
He does allow that in inclement weather and with certain biomechanical problems , shoes would be essential to compensate for lower limb issues ( see Burge 2001 for reservations about Wharburton ’s advice , especially with a range of medical conditions that she details – highly recommended if you ’re considering running barefoot but have some pre-existing foot problems or other health issues ) .
A number of groups advocate barefoot running for a host of reasons : health , injury prevention , greater sensation , enjoyment , and overall well - being ( e.g. , Driscoll 2004 ; Robbins and Gouw 1990 ) .
Especially prominent websites include
Barefoot Ken Bob , Barefoot Ted , and evangelist Barefoot Rick ( who ’s all about saving soles …
I know , ‘ ouch . ’
Sorry , Rick . ) .
A recent book , Born to Run : A Hidden Tribe , Superathletes , and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen , by Christopher McDougall specifically discusses the Tarahumara Indians , who run extraordinarily long races through rough country in sandals or barefoot .
The interest in barefoot running and the possibility that some types of shoes may be increasing problems for devoted runners has produced a spate of articles ( see the list at the end of this article for a few ) .
As Ross and Jonathan have written of their own series of posts on running shoes , the topic is extremely controversial , provoking heated discussion , enthusiastic discussion , and strong opinions , no doubt because ‘ shoes , more than any other topic , touches runners where it counts – their feet !
And , unfortunately , their wallets , for it ’s still the largest expense a runner incurs for the sport . ’
They suggest that the trend in shoe design is toward very neutral ( not motion controlling ) , cushioned shoes that are lighter than previous generations of footwear .
In addition , virtually every shoe company has produced a ‘ barefoot ’ shoe design , minimalist footwear designed to mimic the dynamics of barefoot running .
The Vibram Five Fingers , a glove - like light shoe , for example , was named by Time Magazine one of the Inventions of the Year in 2007 .
Vibram is even recruiting research subjects for Prof.
Lieberman ’s research on barefoot running dynamics .
I should point out that I have no personal interest in any shoe company , or in criticizing any shoe company .
I run with shoes ( when I run ) , but I do like to run barefoot on the beach whenever I can .
And my border collie , Louie , is a fanatic about barefoot running …
Shoes , padding and running technique
The padding in running shoes changes the way that we run , even though we may be completely unconscious that our gait has compensated for the change in the biomechanical properties of the feet produced by footgear ( see Divert et al. 2005 ; but c.f. De Wit et al. 2000 ) .
Robbins and Gouw ( 1991 ) argue that , with padded shoes , ‘ a perceptual illusion is created whereby perceived impact is lower than actual impact , which results in inadequate impact - moderating behavior and consequent injury . ’
That is , the perception of impact that is diminished by modern ‘ protection ’ causes runners to neglect basic biomechanical adaptations to decrease stress on the legs , such as shortening the stride , changing the point of footfall , or increasing bend in the knees slightly .
Joseph Froncioni , an orthopedic surgeon , describes at length the way that shoes change the dynamics of running .
Although the assertion that barefoot runners come down on the ball of the foot is controversial ( some proponents and scholars argue that barefoot runners come down on the middle - outside of the foot ; see Ross Tucker ’s post on this debate ) , quite a bit of his description stands up :
During barefoot running , the ball of the foot strikes the ground first and immediately starts sending signals to the spinal cord and brain about the magnitude of impact and shear , getting most of its clues about this from the skin contact with the surface irregularities of the ground .
Take away this contact by adding a cushioned substance and you immediately fool the system into underestimating the impact .
Add a raised heel and the shod runner is forced to land on it .
Strap the cushioning on tightly with the aid of a sophisticated lacing system and you block out shear as well , throwing the shock - absorption system even further into the dark … .
The cushioned midsole of the modern running shoe robs the system of important sensory information necessary for ankle , knee and hip response to impact .
The arch support ( or orthotic ) in modern running shoes not only prevents the arch suspension system from absorbing energy by preventing flattening but eventually leads to intrinsic muscle atrophy and complete loss of active muscular control of the arch leaving only the inelastic plantar fascia as a checkrein to flattening .
The barefoot runner ’s ‘ foot position awareness sense ’ which relies heavily on sensory input from the sole of the foot minimizes his risk of sustaining an ankle sprain on uneven ground .
The shod runner is at marked increased risk of ankle sprains because his ‘ foot position awareness sense ’ is handicapped by the paucity of sensations coming from his soles .
Froncioni highlights here three distinctive problems with shoes in the dynamics of running : the first , a decrease in sensory information available through the foot ; second , a shift in the position of the foot from a changed motion including an earlier heal strike and longer stride ; and , third , an erosion of the impact - absorbing dynamics of the lower body , especially of the arch of the foot arising from both mechanical properties of the shoe and the previous two problems .
Some of these detrimental effects are immediate , but others are gradual and cumulative , conditioning the body in patterns of behaviour and reaction that amount to a kind of adverse training that can result in chronic injury .
After a lengthy discussion in the comments on the Science of Sports blog posting on barefoot and shod running , Ross Tucker concludes that , in his opinion , the primary reason shoes cause injury is not the placement of the foot when it strikes the ground but the fact that heavily padded , stiff - soled shoes diminish sensation in the feet from the ground ( similar to what Robbins and Gouw 1991 conclude , though they do so on the basis of less data ) .
Without sufficient sensation , the foot and leg do not compensate as well for the mechanics of running ; the feedback cycle is stifled and the dynamic suffers .
Research on foot impact by Robbins and Waked ( 1997 ) suggests that balance and impact are closely related , that a person coming down on a soft surface ( like a gymnast landing on a thick pad or runner on a spongy shoe ) intentionally , though non-consciously , comes down harder in order to find a stable surface .
The spongier the landing material , theoretically , the harder the impact because the body seeks to compress the material to find some sort of stable footing .
According to Froncioni , shoes do n’t simply disrupt the sensory feedback - control cycle through proprioception or the sense of impact through the legs , but also because wearing shoes changes the way that runners actively pursue sensory information through vision and use their bodies .
That is , when we run in heavily cushioned shoes , we look differently and hurl our body against unknown surfaces .
The barefoot runner is constantly alert scanning the ground before him for irregularities and dangers that might cause him injury .
The barefoot runner is a cautious runner and actively changes his landing strategy to prevent injury .
He treads lightly .
The shod runner is bombarded by convincing advertising stating or implying that the shoe he is wearing will protect him well over any terrain and he becomes a careless runner .
He is heavy footed .
The loss of sensation in the feet is analogous to the effects of a degenerative disease , ironically enough .
That is , by mimicking the long - term effects of neuro - degenerative conditions , shoes may bring on other forms of degeneration in the lower limbs .
As Froncioni writes :
Finally , certain diseases in humans can cause a gradual destruction of the sensory nerve endings in the foot ( and elsewhere ) resulting in a significant increase in lower extremity injuries .
Diabetes and tertiary syphilis are two .
Extremities so affected are termed ‘ neuropathic ’ .
The shod runner , because of his sensory deprivation and high risk of injury may be termed as having ‘ pseudo - neuropathic ’ feet , a term coined by Robbins .
This and previous two drop quotes from Athletic Footwear and Running Injuries by Joseph Froncioni .
Conditions such as diabetes can throw off the fine orchestration of muscles in the feet that absorb and transfer force , as decreased sensitivity and response cause delays of dynamic reactions in the foot muscles ( see Abbound 2002 : 171 , and for a review ) .
As we ’ve already discussed here on Neuroanthropology .
net , some researchers who study loss of stability in older people point to diminished sensitivity in the feet as a potential contributing cause of falling .
Not surprisingly , one of the prescriptions for people with this condition is to wear thin - soled shoes or , if the condition is worse , ‘ high - tops ’ so that sensation on the ankles can substitute for sensation on the soles of the feet .
Shoes as developmental niche for feet
People who habitually wear shoes wind up shaping their feet developmentally in distinctive ways .
From the point of view of our feet – if I can be so anthropomorphizing – the shoe becomes the ‘ environment ’ in which feet are grown .
Factors like temperature , abrasion , constriction , and the like become the environment with which the foot must contend adapt to , and rely upon .
Shoes are a kind of developmental niche for feet , and like any ecological niche , exert their own influence on the anatomical unfolding of the foot ’s anatomy .
Of course , other factors in addition to shoes make up the foot ’s ‘ environment ’ , such as the very act and amount of walking we do , the surfaces we walk on , the sorts of forces exerted upon the bones in the feet by factors like our body size , built environment , athletic activities … and all of these can be affected by shoes , too .
In other words , from the point of view of the feet , a whole constellation of things make up the developmental environment , some of which are truly ‘ outside ’ us – like cold or wet or surfaces – but some of which are very much under human control , including activity patterns and habitual footwear .
To the foot , the leg is part of the environment , and how the leg is used becomes one of the environmental factors feeding into how the feet develop .
If we wear a pair of shoes that changes how our legs work ( such as high heels or thickly - soled running shoes ) , these shoes affect the feet directly , but they also impact the feet indirectly through what they do to the leg and the dynamics of our gait and our patterns of activity .
In the simplest sense , shoes are designed to address what the shoe designers perceive as inadequacies in the human foot , whether these inadequacies are mechanical or aesthetic .
Adam Sternbergh ( 2008 ) explained :
For decades , the guiding principle of shoe design has been to compensate for the perceived deficiencies of the human foot .
Since it hurts to strike your heel on the ground , nearly all shoes provide a structure to lift the heel .
And because walking on hard surfaces can be painful , we wrap our feet in padding .
Many people suffer from flat feet or fallen arches , so we wear shoes with built - in arch supports , to help hold our arches up .
Of course , other design elements enter the mix along the way : the desire to be colour coordinated , the elongation of the leg provided by high heels , the undeniable cool of the tassel , the practicality of Velcro quick - release closures on kids shoes .
But the basic ‘ functional ’ design elements of shoes are relatively consistent since the advent of modern , protective footwear ( that is , providing more than simply insulation against cold by wrapping fabric or skin around the foot ) .
The basic effect of shoes on feet is relatively consistent as well .
First , the sole of the shod foot does not develop the hardness that the unshod develop .
Anyone who has ever lived in a variable climate ( like I did growing up in St. Louis ) probably has the experience of their feet fluctuating seasonally in toughness , going from soft and tender when constantly protected during the winter , swaddled in thick socks and insulating shoes , to toughened when barefoot or wearing sandals in the summer .
When I worked as a lifeguard , by mid-July I could walk across the sun-heated asphalt parking lot at midday without my shoes .
At the start of the summer , pampered winter feet were sensitive to every pebble or crack in the pavement .
In a study of shoe - wearing and habitually barefoot Chinese populations , Sim - Fook and Hodgson ( 1958 : 1059 ) found :
The feet of the non -shoe - wearing populations showed thick soles with prominent skin creases apart from many minor lacerations due to traumata .
The pachydermatous [!!] skin on the sole of the foot had an extraordinarily thick keratinized layer about 0.5 to one centimeter thick which permitted the individual to walk about without any discomfort .
Although thick and tough , the skin was pliable and was marked by deep transverse folds which were similar to the lines of joint flexion found on the palm of the hand …
( Before I go any further , ‘ pachydermatous ’ is the coolest word EVER … )
Even though the groups studied spent quite a bit of time standing in water and unshod , Sim - Fook and Hodgson did not find many complaints about foot health , in part because their soles were so resilient and pliable , but also because the unshod did not have the constant low level friction on their feet provided by shoes .
Ironically , this constant , low pressure against the foot can produce more severe chronic injury and malformation than the once - in - a - while and completely varied traumas of walking around with naked feet .
Since the bones and tissue are , in a sense , being grown inside the shoes , they struggle to conform to some of the spaces and mechanical environments that we give them .
The second effect of shoes on foot development is that they influence the performance and architecture of the arch of the foot .
As Dudley Morton ( 1964 : 145 ) argued decades ago :
The natural foot is the naked , unclothed foot ; and its arched conformation is not an element of weakness in design calling for artificial help , but of structural strength acquired through countless generations of unaided weightbearing .
Occasionally we hear shoes referred to as a “ natural support for the arch . ”
The suggestion should move our hearts in pity toward all primitive peoples were it not for the fact that they have no foot troubles , as well as no shoes .
The phrase is one of many in which glibness overshadows accuracy , and unfortunately tends to promote erroneous ideas about the foot and its welfare .
The arch of the foot absorbs force when the feet impact the ground , stretching tendons in multiple directions , flattening and deflecting momentum .
‘ Supporting ’ the arch of the foot by placing it on a convex orthotic would make it virtually impossible for it to function as a shock absorber .
The arch support , which is present in all running footwear , would interfere with the downward deflection of the medial arch on loading .
Furthermore , the use of orthodics , or other structures that are fitted to the mold of the soft tissues of the foot , could cause similar difficulty .
Such designs occur when an engineer looks at the foot as an inflexible lever which is delicate and thus requires packaging .
Various myths persist about foot behavior due to poor understanding of its biology .
( Robbins and Hanna 1987 )
Shoes also bind together the toes , making it very difficult for them to move , let alone engage in the grasping motions that habitually unshod people make when they walk ( see Robbins and Gouw 1990 ; more on this below ) .
To return to Morton ( 1964 : 218 ) , the bare toes move relative to each other to bear the weight of the body , and shoes affect their angle of spread :
‘ The toes of non - shoe - wearing natives are separated when weight is borne on the feet ; but any light , closely fitted foot covering will prevent their separation , owing to the lateral mobility of the toes and the small size of the muscles that abduct them . ’
Sim - Fook and Hodgson ( 1958 : 1060 ) also found ‘ a tendency to spread ’ in the forefoot , especially between the first and second toes ( see also Funakoshi 2005 ) .
Normally , the big toe ( or hallux ) diverges from the second toe at an angle of 5 to 10 degrees .
But , in a condition referred to as hallux valgus , the big toe angles toward the small toes .
When the condition is also accompanied by hypermobility , it is often congenital and referred to as ‘ atavistic ’ ( although I suspect that this designation is not evolutionarily accurate ) .
But the condition is often caused by wearing ill - fitting shoes , and it occurs 10 times more often in women as in men according to Richardson , Hansen , and Kilcoyne ( 2000 ; see also this source for astonishing X - rays of the effects of shoes on bone configuration …
I was gobsmacked by a couple of the images ) .
Morton believes that shoes have no noticeable effect on the functioning of toes , but we do know that habitually binding together the toes does affect the skeletal structure of the feet , and the evidence of pathology from shoes seems to me to be pretty compelling .
Patterns of bone growth and remodeling due to use ( commonly referred to loosely as ‘ Wolff ’s law , ’ see Ruff et al. 2006 ) suggest that a shift in toe use and the increased support for the bones of the feet provided by habitually worn shoes , will lead to differences in bone structure between habitually shod and unshod populations ( see , for example , Sim - Fook and Hodgson 1958 ) .
Bound together laterally and ‘ supported ’ by an arched shoes , the foot cannot act as efficiently as a shock absorber ; at the same time , less dynamic loading on the bones means that the bones will be less robust .
Shoes , then , have a range of developmental effects , from low - level , constant pressure and abrasion to a form of protection which leads to greater fragility .
As a result , Zipfel and Berger ( 2007 ) recorded substantially higher rates of bone pathology in the feet of shod populations that they studied ( European , Sotho and Zulu ) than in pre-pastoralist South African populations who likely were habitually barefoot foragers .
Although Erik Trinkaus ’ work ( see below ) suggests that pathologies caused by shoes might be uneven distributed among the bones of the feet , Zipfel and Berger ( ibid. : 209 ) found ‘ the foot on the pre-pastoralist group is uniformly “ healthier ” than the modern groups . ’
Ironically , even though Zipfel and Berger acknowledge that pre-pastoralist people show some signs of ‘ wear and tear ’ that might arise from much greater amounts of walking , constant travel and nomadic foraging , this heavy use pattern did not correlate with higher rates of a wide range of bone pathologies .
The results presented here suggest that the unshod lifestyle of the pre-pastoral group was associated with a lower frequency of osteological modification .
The influence of modern lifestyle including the use of footwear , appears to have some significant negative effect on foot function , potentially resulting in an increase in pathological changes .
( ibid. : 212 )
I found it especially curious that the relative rates of pathology types and locations tended to be pretty similar across the different groups , but the overall frequency of pathological conditions varied , with shod populations ’ rates of most disorders higher .
This suggests that the wear pattern on feet is pretty similar , whether a population wears shoes or not ; they get the same sorts of disorders , but less frequently without shoes .
The only way I can explain this is to assume that the shoes themselves do n’t cause pathologies ( otherwise , we ’d notice some abnormally frequent disorders ) , but that shoes uniformly make the foot susceptible to disordered development .
In other words , it ’s not the shoes doing the damage , it ’s that they throw off the foot ’s ability to cope with normal movement , making the organ more fragile and susceptible to all pathologies ( but note that this was only a study of bones , not soft tissue lesions ) .
The problem is not simply that we wear shoes , but that we often do n’t wear the right shoes .
Abboud ( 2002:176 ) reports that ,
Since its inception in 1993 , most patients seen at the Foot Pressure Analysis Clinic ( FPAC ) in Dundee , regardless of how minor or complex their problem was , were using ill - fitting footwear with discrepancies in shoe width and size when compared to their feet .
In some cases , there was a difference of up to 3 UK sizes and 4 cm in width across the metatarsal head area , needless to say causing abnormal biomechanical force through the foot joints .
The cumulative damage caused by footwear over the years goes inmost cases unnoticed and gets ignored despite clear signs of pain and dorsal callus formation , the latter can only develop as a result of friction with the inner shoe .
I probably do n’t need to remind you that , as an anthropologist , I make little distinction between what people ‘ should ’ be wearing and what they actually are wearing .
From the point of view of the feet , ill - fitting shoes are just as much a part of the developmental niche as perfectly chosen footwear .
Sternbergh explains the developmental influence of shoes simply : ‘ This is the shoe paradox :
We ’ve come to believe that shoes , not bare feet , are natural and comfortable , when in fact wearing shoes simply creates the need for wearing shoes . ’
Shoe designers are convinced that feet need to be protected against the ground , and the result is that our feet are so sheltered that they do become fragile .
The earliest shoes
Otzi the Iceman , discovered in the Tyrolean Alps in 1991 , was wearing shoes , but he was only 5000 years old .
Even older remains suggest shoes had been around for a while : mummies in the Americas as old as 9000 years have shoes , footprints left by moccasins have been found in the Upper Paleolithic , cave paintings suggest footwear , and burials sometimes have beads on the feet and ankles that might have been sewn to leather shoes of some sort .
Archaeologist Erik Trinkaus has written a number of articles on the evidence for footwear in prehistoric populations , arguing that , in order to survive the cold of glacial periods , hominins would have necessarily figured out how to create insulating protection of some sort : a kind of prehistoric Ugg boot .
But more modern - style , mechanically supportive shoes would have been a later development , evident in the bones of the feet because a semi- rigid sole will alter the distribution of force on the foot ( see Trinkaus 2005 : 1516 ) .
When walking barefoot , the toes flex , making the bones on the outside of the foot stronger through remodelling ( as mentioned in the previous section ) ;
Trinkaus hypothesized that a shift in the robusticity of bones in the hallux ( big toe ) relative to the smaller toes ( or the outside of the foot ) would be a possible sign of habitual hard - soled shoe wearing .
Trinkaus compared bones from three different recent North American populations to test the hypothesis that shoes caused shifts in the relative strength of the toe bones ( Pecos Pueblo Native American , Inuit , and Euro - Americans ) .
Within these samples , predictions about the robustness of the phalanges in the feet based upon their shoe - wearing patterns turned out to be accurate ; Pecos Pueblo Native Americans wearing soft - soled moccasins had the most robust lateral toes , Inuit in harder soled boots had more gracile bones , and Euro - Americans in hard - soled shoes had the most marked disparity .
The more support offered by the footwear , the less robust the bones of the feet associated with the smaller toes ( especially the pedal proximal phalanges in the middle of the foot ) .
Trinkaus has used beam model analysis , a technique that scans cross sections of bones across their axis to get some idea of their density and configuration .
These donut - like images gives some sense of the stresses placed upon the bones because they remodel to compensate for these stresses , get stronger , in general , to withstand habitual strains .
A similar comparison might provide insight into the earliest rigid footwear because , as Trinkaus puts it , ‘ relative robusticity of human lateral toes might provide insight into the frequency of use of footwear ’ ( 2005 : 1515 ) .
Because the organic materials likely used to make the first shoes would not endure in the archaeological record , Trinkaus ’ method is as intriguing as it is ingenuous .
In the archaeological remains Trinkaus examined , the evidence from the feet suggest that shoes became more and more prevalent from the Middle Paleolithic to the middle Upper Paleolithic ; he suggests supportive footwear is likely around 30,000 years old in his earlier work ( 2005 ) , but some of his later work with Shang ( 2008 ) may push that date back closer to 40,000 years .
I ’m not going to go into all of Trinkaus ’ analysis here .
Blogger Afarensis has a number of posts on the issue of prehistoric footwear including here , here and here .
Please read Afarensis , especially What You Can Learn From Bones : When Did We Start Wearing Shoes ? for a more complete discussion of Trinkaus ’ work .
By comparing the shoes to an ‘ environment , ’ I do n’t mean to suggest that 40,000 years of being shod is a form of ‘ unnatural selection ’ that has shifted the genetic contributors to the anatomy of our feet .
Rather , I just mean to suggest that , if shoes are affecting the anatomy of our feet , we have been transmitting certain kinds of crucial traits through the artificial environment that we ’ve created .
We place our children in little training shoes so that their feet are sculpted into a configuration that fits within , and virtually demands the support of shoes .
So should we lose our shoes and go back to ‘ natural ’ feet , unwinding perhaps 40,000 years of non-genetic biophysical heredity ?
Paleo - nostalgia and lifestyle advice
I often get students who come up to me after a lecture and want to know where I stand on some lifestyle movement that purports to be ‘ getting back to ’ some earlier human way of life .
When I lecture on human dietary change , they come up to me to ask about the Paleolithic Diet or whether vegetarianism is more ‘ natural ’ ; when I talk about pregnancy , brain evolution , and altricial infants , they ask my opinion of different approaches to child rearing , or issues like breast feeding or co-sleeping .
I suspect that I usually disappoint my students , who can be pretty fervent about these ideas .
Most paleo - nostalgia movements seem to me to be very selective – for example , the whole Paleolithic Diet movement seems to overlook a host of problems , such as changes in activity patterns , the difference between wild and domesticated meat animals , the high incidence of parasites and low life expectancy in prehistoric periods , and the likelihood that much of human protein was not coming from delicious medium - rare steak or grilled chicken breasts but rather invertebrates , shell fish , small vertebrates , offal and carrion ( that ’s right , maybe it should be the ‘ Bugs , Clams , Lizards and Roadkill Diet ’ – not quite the same marketing potential as ‘ Eat All the Steak and Chicken You Can ! ’ ) .
I ’ve discussed this in Paleofantasies of the perfect diet – Marlene Zuk in NYTimes .
So what about shoes and foot health ?
Is there anyone out there preaching the Paleolithic Podiatry program ?
Zinjanthropus shares my scepticism of podiatric paleo - nostalgia , asking why one period of our evolutionary history is privileged over others .
Zinjanthropus writes :
Either way , I ’m usually very cautious about shaping my lifestyle to fit the needs of a paleolithic savannah - scape .
We ’ve done a lot of evolving since then , after all !
If I push my lifestyle back to the Paleolithic , then who ’s to say that I ’m not even BETTER evolved for the Pliocene ?
If a hunter and gatherer diet , for example , is allegedly ‘ healthier , ’ why not push back to a diet of astringent fruit like our arboreal ancestors ( as Richard Wranger points out , you ’d be able to look forward to hours every day of chewing to get enough calories , for example ) .
Paleonostalgia suffers from a number of deep problems .
As Zinjanthropus suggests , how to choose which period in time to use as a model .
Hominins have evolved over millions of years through a whole range of environments ; paleonostalgia tends to arbitrarily pick a point of time in the past , which is not necessarily more valid as a lifestyle model than any other .
In addition , paleonostalgists tend to ignore the likelihood that human niches were varied – not as varied as later humans – but the ability to occupy diverse environmental niches has been a hallmark of our ancestors .
Too much dietary and environmental specialization has n’t really been a hallmark of our genus ; arguably , the members of our genus and closely allied ones who have become too specialized and inflexible , have all gone extinct ( I do n’t want to argue this too strenuously , as many of the ones we tend to consider highly specialized a ) lasted a hell of a long time , longer than Homo sapiens in some cases , and b ) we ’re increasingly uncertain that we can know for certain adaptive behaviours from anatomy , as the case of Paranthropus teeth suggests . ) .
Similarly , discussions of evidence from foraging peoples is often just as selective and slanted .
Although we hear about the running capabilities of foraging people ( and I , too , firmly believe that they were much more active than technologically - dependent sedentary people ) , we do n’t hear about their injuries , including disabling ones , or their chronic health problems , including things like parasites that enter the body through the feet .
Alfred Gell , for example ( I ’m pretty sure , but I ca n’t remember in which text ) , wrote about travelling quickly through the rainforest with barefoot colleagues ; although they were swift and sure - footed , they also had to stop every once in a while when one of them had to dig a thorn out of his or her foot .
One problem with paleonostalgia for barefoot running is the fact that we do not run in a paleolithic environment .
As Trimble writes in Popular Mechanics :
The problem modern - day runners face , according to Hugh Herr , Popular Mechanics 2005 Breakthrough Award winner and head of the biomechatronic group at MIT , is n’t presented by our bodies but by the evolution of running surfaces .
Humans that ran to scavenge or hunt for their food were n’t pounding concrete .
Running shoes offer a trade - off :
In his research , Herr focused on two problems with both shod and barefoot running - pronation angle and impact force .
While barefoot running is best for a natural , stress - free pronation angle , Herr says , it is not ideal for coping with roads and sidewalks that can lead to stress - impact injuries .
Shoes , on the other hand , excel at diminishing the force of impact on hard ground .
But they do so at the cost of the natural stride - all the padding added to the shoe exaggerates the foot ’s rotation .
So just throw away your shoes , right , and let your feet be free ?
Well , even the proponents of barefoot running caution that the transition from being habitually shod to running around au naturale can take some time because ‘ the change in biomechanics and loading of joints , muscles and tendons threatens injury if you ’re not careful ’ ( Tucker and Dugas , Running Shoes ) .
If running barefoot is so ‘ natural ’ to humans , why do we have to take it slowly ?
Because our feet become well adapted , as best they can , to wearing shoes .
For all of the discussion of evolution having shaped human bodies and our feet for running , the body that habitually walks and runs in shoes has very much adapted to that niche .
( See , for example , Tucker on attempts to change running techniques . )
But an interesting example of just how adaptable the feet can be comes from Shulman ’s ( 1949 ) study of Chinese and Indian populations , in particular some individuals who might be expected to have the most damaged feet ( if shoes were necessary to save our feet ) :
One hundred and eighteen of those interviewed were rickshaw coolies .
Because these men spend very long hours each day on cobblestone or other hard roads pulling their passengers at a run it was of particular interest to survey them .
If anything , their feet were more perfect than the others .
All of them , however , gave a history of much pain and swelling of the foot and ankle during the first few days of work as a rickshaw puller .
But after either a rest of two days or a week ’s more work on their feet , the pain and swelling passed away and never returned again .
There is no occupation more strenuous for the feet than trotting a rickshaw on hard pavement for many hours each day yet these men do it without pain or pathology .
Were n’t our feet designed for running barefoot ?
In fact , a number of recent articles suggest that some of the traits of the foot ( and other parts of the body ) indicate that an ability to run barefoot might have offered a selective advantage during human evolution ( e.g. , Bramble & Lieberman 2004 ; see also Wired Science , These toes were made for running ) .
But I do n’t think that the issue is simply a debate between the running shoe industry and the growing ‘ natural ’ barefoot running movement .
Instead , the anatomy of the foot , its sensitivity in development to the presence of shoes , and the evolutionary development of shoes and bipedalism , all illustrate how hard it is to talk about the natural human body at all or what the human body is ‘ designed ’ to do .
Patterns of activity , the most minimal technology , and the way we restructure our living environments all shape our physiological development .
In fact , the role of activity , motor experience , and sense perception is so crucial in the development of so much of the human body and nervous system that I suspect we cannot even imagine how a person ‘ without ’ these sorts of influences might develop .
Because humans are inherently adaptable — through culture , learning , technology , and even physiological change – it makes sense that plasticity itself would be a trait likely selected for in humans ( an idea I take from Mary Jane West - Eberhard [ e.g. , 2005 ] ) .
Faced with the evidence that something as simple as wearing shoes can affect our soft tissue physiology , skeletal structure , gait kinetics , and the like , we can ask whether being shod or unshod is our ‘ natural ’ state .
In a number of the internet postings about barefoot running , I find assertions about what sorts of surfaces or types of locomotion the human foot was ‘ designed ’ to accomplish .
I think it ’s too easy to just say , ‘ barefoot is natural ; shoes are artificial ; feet were designed to run . ’
In fact , the human foot and lege were not ‘ designed ’ for running or walking , barefoot or otherwise .
They were not ‘ designed ’ at all .
Evolution does n’t design anything .
Legs and feet are built by natural selection out of an appendage that , a very very long time ago , was a fin .
If you were going to ‘ design ’ a limb and foot for running , you could do a lot better than the human architecture .
Our knees , for example , are really lousy ; they ’re basically a rejiggered hinge joint and could certainly have been engineered better by a benevolent Creator .
And She could have given us a more elastic set - up of tendons , too , something like kangaroos have .
Oh , man , if some genetic engineer could just work on that kanga - human hybrid ( a ‘ kanga - hu ’ ? ) , Olympic steeplechase would be so cool ; no more of that stepping on top of the jump and landing in the water – but I digress .
Most of our readers will , of course , be completely familiar with the problems of the ‘ Natural Selection as Designer ’ metaphor , but it ’s one that still crops up again and again in discussions of the evolution of traits .
Normally , we can get by with the ‘ design ’ metaphor without too much trouble , but in the case of something like the role of activity in shaping the emergence of a physiological trait .
You see , human feet are n’t just good for running .
They ’re good for walking , standing , swimming , lifting , kicking , and a host of other functions .
Like most primates , our limb use is actually pretty versatile ; the arboreal niche of our ancestor presented a wide variety of challenges – hanging , swinging , walking on top of branches , standing bipedally , standing on all four .
In addition , our primate ancestors , like us , do n’t just use their limbs for locomotion ; they use their limbs to manipulate objects , process food , hold offspring , interact socially , protect themselves , and a host of other activities .
Wait , you say , but we do n’t use our feet this way .
We ’re humans .
Feet are for walking and running …
Well , here ’s the thing .
Feet are n’t just ‘ designed for ’ walking or running ; they turn out to be useful for all sorts of things .
In the Chinese populations that Sim - Fook and Hodgson ( 1958 : 1061 ) studied , habitually unshod people used their big toes often ‘ to hold fishing nets and fishing lines taut so that the hands were free . ’
The result was that these individuals developed ‘ a remarkable degree of prehensile strength ’ in the big toe ( ibid. : 1060 - 1061 ) .
They conclude their discussion of the ‘ unshod foot ’ with the summary : ‘ The unshod foot had laxity of the joints and tissues producing , in its natural form , a flexible foot with a degree of metatarsus latus , metatarsus primus varus , and hypermobility . ’
You or I or the next guy may not be using our feet for things like peeling fruit or dialing the phone , but that does n’t mean it ca n’t be done .
In fact , many individuals congenitally born without arms or unable to control their arms due to a condition like cerebral palsy develop extraordinary dexterity with their feet , not only using them to do everyday tasks , but even activities like painting or playing an instrument .
Painter Chan Tung -mui , for example , paints watercolours with her feet because she cannot control her hands due to cerebral palsy .
Other prominent people who do a lot with their feet include painter and dancer Simona Atzori , Barbara Guerra ( seen here on Medical Incredible ) , Mark Goffeney ( guitarist for the rock band , Big Toe ) , Tony Meléndez ( barefoot guitarist , seen in this video playing ‘ Let It Be ’ ) , and the late Bonnie Consolo , featured in the Academy Award nominated film A Day in the Life of Bonnie Consolo ( released 1975 ) ( here you can find a video of Bonnie Consolo typing with her feet ( see also the site of the Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World ) .
Pravda carried the story of a Ukranian man , Sergei Vasyura , born without arms , who learned to shave , ride a bicycle , swim , build cars , bait a fishhook , weld , and even repair alarm clocks with his feet .
In most humans , especially shoe - wearing humans , the hallux is adducted , that is , in line with the other toes ; but some degree of abduction is present in many of us , especially if habitually unshod , and may even develop to a slightly greater degree with use .
Of course , no one approaches the abduction angles of our primate cousins who dwell in trees and have fully - functioning prehensile feet , but this crucial detail of human anatomy , one that distinguishes us from others , may be more variable than we think .
Shulman ( 1949 ) makes an off - handed remark about this that I found incredibly interesting : ‘ Almost everyone surveyed showed a marked spacing between the first and second toes such as that found on young babies . ’
I do n’t know about the developmental dynamics , but it would n’t surprise me too much if , absent the adducting influence of shoes for more than half of our lives , and an even greater proportion of the time in which our feet were weight bearing , the angle of the toes found in infants was closer to the habitually unshod .
Although we may think that the Chinese practice of foot - binding is a kind of aberration , Zipfel and Berger ( 2007 : 205-206 ) suggest on the basis of previous research that many Asian populations reveal the degree to which conventional shoes bind feet : ‘ Studies of Asian populations whose feet were habitually either unshod , in thong - type sandals or encased in non-constrictive coverings have shown increased forefoot widths when compared to those of shod populations . ’
As I wrote in the paper I presented at Univesité Montpellier ( Downey 2009 ) , just as Clifford Geertz ( 1973:67 - 68 ) argued that an uncultured human being would be a ‘ mindless and consequently unworkable monstrosity , ’ a skill - less human would not be capable of the most basic , defining ‘ human ’ physical acts .
The fact that skills like foot painting or feeding oneself with one ’s feet are rare does not mean that our feet were not ‘ designed ’ to do them .
If we were looking for a ‘ natural ’ foot , one without any influence of activity , we should probably focus on infants or on those who are disabled .
We should realize that our feet were not ‘ designed ’ to do one thing or another ; caring for them , and shaping them in ways that we desire , requires more than just figuring out what our ‘ nature ’ might be .
UPDATE : In January 2010 , this issue was in the news due to the release of a new study suggesting that knee , ankle and hip damage might be greater for shod than unshod runners .
Some sources have made the leap to the likelihood of osteo - arthritis , although the original study was biomechanical in nature .

FreeBSD 8.0-BETA1
Available
The first public test build of the FreeBSD 8.0 - RELEASE test cycle is now available , 8.0 - BETA1 .
Through the next week or so more information about the release will be posted but here is the current target schedule for the other ' major events ' : BETA2 : July 13 , 2009 BETA3 : July 20 , 2009 RC1 : July 27 , 2009 RC2 : August 17 , 2009 RELEASE : August 31 , 2009 People with the resources to do so ( test machines ... ) are encouraged to give 8.0 - BETA1 a try .
At this point it is not quite ready for production systems but mostly because there is still some ongoing work in a few areas that may cause some changes in things like ABI / API .
Debugging support ( WITNESS , malloc debugging , etc. ) are also still turned on and those tend to cause a performance hit .
As far as we know there are no known issues that would cause data corruption or anything like that , just the issues with performance and potential for changes caused by ongoing work .
If you find problems they can be reported through the normal Gnats based PR system or posted to the mailing lists .
Note that for BETA1 no packages were included with any of the images .
The amd64 and i386 architectures include a file named : 8.0 - BETA1 -< arch>-memstick.img
If you copy that to a USB memory stick newer machines should be able to boot from it and use it to install from .
Note that you need to overwrite the contents of the memory stick completely , not copy it into an existing filesystem on the memory stick .
Exactly how you do that depends on your machine but just to give you an example this works on the machine I tested it with : dd if =8.0 - BETA1-amd64-memstick.img of=/dev/da0 bs=10240 conv=sync
Be careful if you have SCSI drives , more USB disks than just the memory stick , etc - make sure / dev/ da0 ( or whatever you use ) is the memory stick .
Using this image for livefs based rescue mode is known to not work , that is one of the things still being worked on .
FreeBSD
Update was not ready for updates to 8.0 at the point this message was sent but it is also being worked on .
A separate message will be posted when it 's ready .

“ We are just a small little company that has gone through some challenging times that is trying to find a way to come up with ideas that will connect with an audience , ” he said , smiling , when I bumped into him on a tour of the office .
Mr. Armstrong does n’t think it ’s important that customers of Black Voices , BloggingStocks or Stylelist need to know it was all brought to you by AOL .
“ I am not sure that is important to the audience that Disney owns ABC or ESPN , so in the same way , FanHouse , our sports site , will live or die on its connection to the audience , ” he said .
“ We can light a fuse , but whether or not it comes to fruition is reliant on the content . ”
It is not unlike how all the major brewers responded to the influx of microbrews .
They simply brewed up their own small - label brands or bought existing ones , and kept their own brand in very tiny print deep in the label where most beer drinkers ca n’t be bothered to look .
Nick Denton , who has had some success at Gawker Media on a smaller scale with federated blogs , said it makes sense for AOL to minimize its imprimatur .
“ If the sites are to seem authentic , they ca n’t be so obviously the product of an unimaginative conglomerate , ” he said in an instant message .
“ That said , they did n’t do themselves any favors with some of the names .
Politics Daily ? Snore . ”
Of course , as many newspapers have found out , you ca n’t create a blogger simply by having someone from mainstream media work in their pajamas .
But building from its purchase of Weblogs from Jason Calacanis and Brian Alvey in 2005 , AOL has managed to develop a number of sites with rabid fans and traffic that comes from all corners , not just the portal .
“ Advertisers want reach , engagement and scale , and we want this to work , ” said Rob Norman , chief executive of GroupM Interaction , a unit of ad giant WPP .
He said that in spite of the many fizzled efforts to remake AOL , “ you now have leadership in place who has a clear understanding of the economics and strategies for creating great content . ”
WHEN Death of a Salesman was revived on Broadway 50 years after its celebrated debut , its director asked for help .
In an effort to flesh out its frame for a contemporary audience , the play was diagnosed .
Two psychiatrists offered their assessment of Willy Loman .
In each case , Loman was pronounced manic - depressive with hallucinatory aspects .
Arthur Miller soon received word that this newest Loman was in therapy .
The playwright was aghast .
The hapless everyman , Miller said , was not a subject for psychiatric study .
He was simply beaten down by life .
Loman was , and should remain , a victim of circumstances ; not one of disease .
" There are social reasons for why he is where he is , " Miller said .
Any analysis other than Miller 's might seem ridiculous ; particularly to fans of theatre .
But there is a real shift in the way we understand our weakness .
We increasingly see ourselves , and fictional characters , not as social casualties but as people with psychiatric disorders .
As reported earlier by many sources , the Marlins have acquired Nick Johnson from the Washington Nationals for Double - A lefty Aaron Thompson .
With our awesome projection analysis powers and the Trade Value Calculator , we can analyze the dollar worth of this trade .
But I ’ll go a step beyond that and look at the implications this move has for the Marlins chances at a playoff birth .
Offensive Value :
Obviously , the side of the playing field from which the Marlins gain the most value from acquiring Johnson is the offensive side .
At the plate , Johnson is far superior than the player he is replacing , the offensive black hole that is Emilio Bonifacio .
I ’m glad that the Marlins staff finally recognized that Bonifacio is hurting the ballclub with his bat and needed to be replaced .
It may be too little too late in terms of making the playoffs ( we ’ll get to that later ) , but it ’s a step in the right direction for the organization for the rest of the season .
ZiPS has Johnson projected as a .379 wOBA hitter the rest of the season , but this may be a bit optimistic .
Throughout the season Johnson has shown a distinct loss of power ; currently he holds an OBP higher than his SLG .
This is n’t particularly a problem , as the Marlins do have plenty of power , but it does diminish the potential of him slugging .441 off of a . 161 ISO the remainder of the season .
ZiPS also has his BABIP dropping from a high .341 so far this season to a more modest .319 the rest of the way , which I believe is fair .
I ’d say it ’s more likely he remains at the pace that he ’s at so far this season , but let ’s use a midway approximation of .371 wOBA the rest of the way .
Let ’s say Johnson gets through another 180 PA , giving him just over 600 PA for the season , which is an optimistic expectation given Johnson ’s well - known health issues .
Calculating that over Bonifacio ’s ZiPS .288 wOBA projection over the remainder of the season , you get a value of 13 runs above Bonifacio ’s worth over the course of the rest of the year .
Defensive Value
The offensive value , even for such a short period of time , is great .
That ’s over a win above replacement just with Johnson ’s bat in the order over Bonifacio .
But of course , offense is n’t the only thing that we need to evaluate .
Johnson ’s acquisition forces current Marlins first baseman Jorge Cantu over to third base , the position he occupied last season .
Unfortunately , Cantu was horrendous in his time at third base , amassing - 7.3 runs in 1066 innings and 123 games last season at the position , a UZR / 150 of 9.1 .
Giving Cantu some regression in the department , I think it would be fair to rate him at - 8/150 defensive games at the position .
If we take that rate and apply it to the remaining 55 games ( assuming some rest for Cantu ) , he ’d be worth about three runs below average over the remainder of the season .
Comparing this to Bonifacio ’s performance and giving Boni credit for a - 4/150 games , we ’d lose about 1.5 runs switching Cantu for Bonifacio at third .
But that itself does n’t take into account Johnson ’s defense .
In the past , Johnson has been a Gold Glove - caliber defensive player at first base , but this season it ’s been a rough stretch based on UZR ; Johnson ’s been worth - 6.4 runs at first base so far this season .
Giving Johnson some regression based on his previous years at first by first halving the production he had with the glove in the years prior to his two full seasons with the Nationals then using a standard 8/4/2/1 regression ( I went back far enough to get a 32 multiplier in there for his current season ) , you ’d expect a value of 0.4 runs above average over the course of 150 games .
Given this regression , a fair one given his previous value with the glove but one that does n’t seem to agree with his current year performance in terms of scouting and metrics , Johnson would be just around neutral on UZR .
With Cantu having not played a significant amount of first base , it ’s difficult to weight his values as they stand , but I think giving him a neutral score probably agrees with the “ eye test ” for Cantu at first base .
This makes no significant difference over the remainder of the season .
Let ’s tally up the final value :
13 run offense – 1.5 runs defense = +10.5 runs or +1.05 wins , worth $ 4.5 M
This of course assumes that the Marlins do n’t plan on resigning Johnson .
Since Johnson ’s contract is paid for by the Nats this season , that theoretical value is all profit .
Also , since Johnson does n’t project as a Type B free agent , we are n’t likely to receive any draft picks from him walking .
All in all , his acquisition yielded $ 4.5 M of surplus value .
Now , a quick rundown of what we gave up .
Thompson had lost a lot of ground as a player of worth in the Marlins ’ organization .
What was once a heralded draft class including Chris Volstad , Brett Sinkbeil , and Thompson headlining the pitching , only Volstad now remains as a viable player for the major league level .
John Sickels rated Thompson in the preseason as a C+ prospect , which according to Victor Wang ’s research is worth $ 2.1 M given his age and level .
This yields the Marlins a net surplus of $ 2.4 M .
That looks like a good deal right ?
Well , it would be , if the Marlins figured that +1 WAR over the course of the season .
Unfortunately , according to vivaelpujols ’ Playoff Odds calculations , the addition of a +1 WAR player to the Marlins would yield only a 2 % increase in the playoff odds .
I ’d say this underestimates the Marlins slightly , but not by much given their status as an overachieving team .
The Marlins have a negative run differential and have a theoretical Pythagenpat expectation , based on their batting , pitching , and fielding runs above / below average , of .462 .
This is a rough approximation of third - order win percentage for the Marlins , and a poor one at that .
The odds the Marlins make the playoffs are slim , and perhaps the potential worth of Thompson should have more than outweighed the addition of Johnson for the stretch run , given that it would not improve the Marlins odds anytime other than this season .
Sure , it makes the Fish better by a good margin , but it may not be enough for the playoffs without significant improvement from the rest of the team , which I think is far harder to achieve over the course of 50 + games .
That being said , as a fan , it ’s hard not to like the deal .
Thompson had theoretical value , but had fallen so low in most scouts ’ eyes that he essentially only had worth to the team , if that .
His dealing was like dealing little to nothing qualitatively , and the addition of Johnson to a team that , despite its true talent level , is still in the playoff hunt , is hard to ignore .
The Marlins have a long , uphill climb left , but crazier things have happened I suppose , and as a fan you just ca n’t give up hope , especially since the move ’s already been made .
Let ’s ride the storm out .
Aw - kward .
ABC ’s Jake Tapper : Former President Bill Clinton recently said that he ’s basically in support of same - sex marriage .
“ I think it ’s wrong , ” he said , “ for someone to stop someone else from getting involved in same - sex marriage . ”
Has President Obama heard these comments ?
Does he have a reaction ?
And why is Bill Clinton wrong about this issue ?
White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs :
Well , I ’m not going to get into anybody ’s opinion —
I ’m not going to criticize anybody ’s opinion , least of all a former President of the United States , on something like this .
I am not clear whether the President has seen that .
I do n’t know where that was from , so I do n’t know if the President has seen it .
Tapper : But President Obama holds a different opinion ?
Gibbs : President Obama holds the same opinion he has earlier today .
Tapper :
Which is that same - sex marriage is wrong .
Gibbs :
He does not support it .
He supports civil unions .
Tapper :
Why does he feel differently than President Bill Clinton ?
Gibbs : Because they do n’t agree on the issue .
( Laughter . )
I ’ve not obviously spent a lot of —
Tapper :
That ’s not really an explanation of why he feels differently .
That ’s another word for it .
Gibbs :
Well , I mean , I ’m happy to — I mean , I think the President has answered this question a number of times .
I ca n’t form a basis for why former President Clinton —
I ’ve obviously not had a conversation with him on this issue , so I do n’t know what — it ’s hard for me to compare some of this because I do n’t have the basis by which he ’s making that decision .
PRINTS AVAILABLE !
You can purchase an 11x17 " gloss print for $ 7 , plus an additional $ 5 for mailing costs .
Send me a note here on deviantArt or e-mail me if you 're interested .
I accept payment through PayPal .-------------------------------------------------------------------------I 've had to be patient , since I wanted this to look just right .
But believe me , I 've been very eager during the whole process to see this end result .
What started out as a simple drawing grew a lot more complex , especially after the sudden popularity of the original .
So I decided to add some more characters and arrange it with the intent of making prints .
I 've still got to drive over to the printers sometime to make sure , but I 'm confident that it will go smoothly .
When I 'm positive I 'll be sure to let you all know , so you can purchase 11x17 " prints of this .
And of course they wo n't have the watermarks .
Most of these characters I 'm sure you 'll recognize , but I 'll go down the list and attribute each one to their respective fast food chain .
Also , I figured it might be special to include a few thoughts I had while creating each of them .
Going from top to bottom , left to right :
After seeing those commercials with the bus collision that results in Jack 's temporary coma , specifically the amateur report that reveals the accident was a hit job involving " The King " and " R. McD. " , it seemed very appropriate .
Not to mention this is the second time he's had facial reconstructive surgery , according to the commercials , after certain company board members had tried to dispose of him earlier .
So leaving the scars seemed like a good touch .
Right off I knew to be careful not to make Ron McDonald look like a rip - off of 's Joker .
Still , comparisons have and will be made , but that can't be helped .
After all , they both wear suits and clown makeup .
Actually , I tried to go a very different direction with Ronald and his crew .
I kept thinking how = lazymills 1986 might design them .
( She 's an awesome artist , for those who do n't know .
Check her out . )
Felt like a cross between Colombian drug lord and robber baron with his design .
If B.K. had a voice , he 'd sound like Señor Esteban Vihaio from .
However , B.K. is not a pimp .
Just making that known .
Went for a more Victorian aristocrat feel in her design , but with a touch of Southern belle .
" The Colonel " was the easiest .
Did n't do anything to him , save for changing his suit gray and adding pinstripes .
Like " the Colonel " , there was n't much to do with " Papa " John .
Honestly , having a real person to model them after takes the fun out of the creative process .
Sort of looks like Clemenza from Francis Ford Coppola's , does n't he ?
I did n't really see it ' til now .
That was probably subconscious , since I 'm a die hardfan .
Okay , yes , the resemblance here was definitely intentional .
Think Tony Montana , but with a Napoleon complex .
The nickname comes from a combination of his short stature and the fact that he twitches constantly , since he 's a user .
Yes friends , he 's a junk food junkie .
As Frank Lopez says , " Rule number two : do n't get high on your own supply .
" This was fun to do , since all I had to go on was the panda in their logo .
If you 're curious about the front of her dress , it 's part of a traditional Chinese ( or traditional Chinese - style , at least ) painting I found depicting a family , I 'm assuming , of pandas amongst some vegetation .
You catch just part of a tree , here .
Alright , now Troy " the Trojan " here is your legitimate pimp in the group .
I did n't want to make it particularly obvious , since he 's not your cheap street hustler .
He 's a man among the top of the flesh peddling hierarchy .
And yes , the nickname has a few meanings behind it .
Also , = Arada was pushing for a presence for Sonic 's because of the girl carhops .
She asked for some " roller hoes " , so she got it .
Sonic 's apparently had an advertisement character called Katie the carhop , but I 'm buggered on where to find any actual pictures or footage of her .
Remember those Quizno commercials with the talking baby , Bob ?
Just took him and made him up like George Nelson .
I still can't help thinking of the latter in
He 's so bipolar in that movie , but that 's what makes him memorable .
Jared Fogle made this one interesting , since it presented me with the opportunity of doing a thin and thick version of the character as twin brothers .
Reminded me a little bit of Laurel and Hardy .
Also , note that the thin brother is wearing suspenders while the other is not .
When you see those red lips on the DQ commercials , and if you 've seen , your mind can't help jumping to that .

Arada had a big part in this character 's creation , since she was the one who introduced me to the film in the first place .
The makeup was modeled to be like Tim Curry's .
I 'm not into the drag queen scene myself , but that dude makes it work somehow .

I ’d like to thank President Obama for giving me a $ 400 payroll tax cut .
I ’d sure like to help out with the economic recovery .
But that tax cut , thanks to 41 consecutive days of gasoline price increases , now amounts to only $ 150 .
Figuring my local commuting habits and trips to visit family and friends , I ’ll pay about $ 700 to fill up my little Scion for the rest of the year at the current national average of $ 2.62 a gallon .
I ’ll be spending about $ 250 more at this price than I would if gasoline had remained near the December average of $ 1.62 .
If the price of gasoline rises more ( wanna bet ? ) over summer , I ’ll be handing even more of my payroll tax cut to Big Oil .
So why the sharp , 62 percent increase ?
Why did the “ experts ” who are supposed to understand gasoline and oil markets get it wrong ?
Journalists have indeed been telling us the “ experts ” were wrong and what factors have been driving gasoline prices higher — but not why the “ experts ” erred in missing those factors .
According to New York Times reporter Clifford Krauss :
Analysts say the increase is being driven by investor expectations of an economic recovery , the recent fall of the dollar against other currencies and , to a lesser extent , the success of oil - exporting countries in curtailing supplies .
In other words , these are the issues that helped drive gasoline costs well beyond $ 4 last year .
Motorists are accustomed to gasoline prices spiking as the summer driving season arrives .
But 62 % higher this year when “ experts ” predicted far less ?
Journalists depend on “ experts ” and base conclusions on their analyses .
Here ’s CNN business correspondent Christine Romans on March 17 :
Gas prices are rising .
Experts say they wo n’t rise much more and the Energy Department sees a summer high of $ 2.30 .
Do n’t worry : this recent run up is no stepping stone to $ 3.00 and $ 4.00 a gallon gasoline .
[ emphasis added ]
From the Energy Information Administration ’s “ Short - Term Energy and Summer Fuels Outlook ” published April 14 :
Regular‐grade gasoline prices have increased to more than $ 2 per gallon , rising slowly but steadily since the beginning of the year in conjunction with rising crude oil prices and refiner margins recovering from recent near‐historic lows .
During this summer driving season ( April through September ) regular gasoline retail prices are projected to average $ 2.23 per gallon , down almost $ 1.60 from last summer .
The average regular gasoline price for all of 2009 is expected to be $ 2.17 per gallon , increasing to an average of $ 2.42 in 2010 .
Diesel prices are projected to average about $ 2.27 per gallon during this driving season and to average $ 2.30 and $ 2.69 per gallon annually in 2009 and 2010 , respectively .
[ emphasis added ]
( Not surprisingly , EIA in its June 3 “ This Week in Petroleum ” reported the price of gasoline as passing $ 2.50 nationally .
Some wag put this hed on its release : “ EIA ‘ Stimulated ’ to Revise the Annual Energy Outlook 2009 . ” )
Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service , at least ‘ fessed up on May 22 that he was wrong that gasoline prices would not pass $ 2.50 :
Prices have moved further and faster than I thought possible five months ago , or five days ago .
What did he miss ?
What did other “ experts ” miss ?
Why ?
Mr. Kloza did add perspective about the impact of much - higher - than - predicted gasoline prices on economic recovery :
The increases probably mean that American ’s will spend about $ 925 - million or more each day on gasoline through the rest of May .
That still compares favorably with last year , when the figure was closer to $ 1.5 - billion per day .
I ’m not the only person handing back my payroll tax cut , it seems .
Here ’s Ms. Romans again on June 8 :
[ The experts ] were saying , “ Do n’t worry . ”
They were saying again and again , “ Do n’t worry because demand is not increasing . ” …
Because of the bailout and now concern in global markets about how much money the United States is borrowing and spending , it ’s weakening the dollar .
And as the dollar weakens , people are concerned about inflation .
And the hedge against inflation is commodities .
And so you ’re seeing money flowing into crude oil because of concerns about the dollar and the future of this country .
So even though you have demand down , we have a recession , we ’re using less oil , oil prices are rising .
…
And [ $ 18 ] is how much more you ’re paying to fill up your gas tank this year from the beginning of the year to now .
…
Now , it ’s still much less than it was last year . …
But keep in mind that takes away pretty much the president ’s Making Work Pay tax cut .
[ emphasis added ]
Is Ms. Romans ’ report that experts say demand is heading down accurate ?
She did not say , perhaps because cable news gives her mere seconds to report on a complicated issue , demand is down from what ?
Or from when ?
According to Reuters , a May EIA analysis said differently :
The EIA forecast last month U.S. gasoline demand would rise to average of 9.15 million barrels per day ( bpd ) in June , up from the 9.07 million bpd consumed in June 2008 .
It ’s difficult for the audiences of journalists ( or pundits or “ experts ” ) to know whom to find credible .
Yes , predicting the costs of oil at the wellhead and gasoline at the pump is tricky business .
And journalists such as Ms. Romans rely heavily on government “ experts ” or Wall Street “ analysts ” to forecast such costs accurately .
Why have n’t they ?
The government collects enormous amounts of data on energy .
So do investment bankers and other economists .
Why the misfired analyses in the past six months ?
Analyzing the reasons for a misdiagnosis of an oil - driven economy is a news story .
Where is it ?
There ’s some , but it ’s soundbite - driven and occasional .
Good journalists should be teaching their audiences much more about the economics of oil and gasoline and the impacts on the broader economy ( journalism that is difficult ) instead of merely telling audiences that they ’re miserable ( journalism that is easy and obvious ) .
The oil and gasoline beats ought to consist of much more “ eat - your - spinach ” journalism rather than video of Joe or Jane Consumer at the gasoline pump , filling the family sedan and complaining about the rising cost .
Oh , I forgot .
The newspaper industry has been shedding experienced journalists for nearly a decade .
Perhaps there ’s no one left to consistently and expertly report on economic issues that are difficult .
The Science and Politics of Raw Milk Odom Fanning Slogans vied with science at an informal FDA hearing on raw vs. pasteurized milk held in Washington , D.C. , on October 11th and 12th , 1984 .
The hearing ’s purpose was to help the Secretary of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) decide whether new rule - making is needed .
Pasteurization is accomplished by heating milk for specified time / temperature combinations , most commonly 161º ( 71.6 ºC ) for 15 seconds .
This kills microorganisms that can transmit disease to humans through milk , and also kills almost all spoilage bacteria .
The process does not sterilize milk , but does make it safe to drink and extends shelf life .
Unpasteurized ( raw ) milk may be certified or uncertified .
Certified raw milk ( CRM ) is the trademark designation of milk produced according to standards set by the American Association of Medical Milk Commissions , an industry organization .
CRM is produced by three large dairies and can be sold through retail food stores in 24 states .
In 6 other states , sale is limited to direct farm sales , while in 20 it is prohibited .
Uncertified raw milk is typically produced in small quantities by individual dairy farmers and sold on the farm or by home delivery .
Even though a final regulation mandating pasteurization was proposed by the FDA 11 years ago , it was never issued .
Last April , Public Citizen ’s Health Research Group ( HRG ) , an organization founded by Ralph Nader , petitioned HHS to ban all raw milk sales in the United States .
Then in September , joined by the American Public Health Association , HRG filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to force the agency to respond .
The hearing was held before FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young , M.D. , Ph.D. , Walton B. Read , M.D. , of the FDA Bureau of Foods , and HHS attorney Fred Degman .
Witnesses were not allowed to question the panel or one another - but were interrogated by the panel after giving testimony on two pre-announced questions :
Is the consumption of raw milk , including certified raw milk ( CRM ) and raw milk products , of public health concern ?
Would requiring pasteurization of raw milk , including CRM and such products , be the most reasonable regulatory option ?
The Commissioner also asked witnesses whether labeling CRM as to its risks would provide adequate protection for the public .
Should he make a finding of fact that consumption of raw milk is of public health concern , he would then make a recommendation to the HHS Secretary - presumably for either compulsory pasteurization or mandatory labeling of milk in interstate commerce .
Before a proposed regulation could be published , it would have to be approved by the Office of Management and Budget - and presumably the President .
A final regulation is unlikely to be developed and take effect within the next year .
The political strength of raw milk advocates can be judged by the string of witnesses produced for the FDA hearing by Alta - Dena Certified Dairy , of City of Industry , California .
According to a press kit distributed by the company , it is the largest producer - dairy in the world .
It spans 600 acres and has 8,000 milking cows , 7,000 stock cows , 800 employees , and annual sales of $ 100 million .
Twenty percent of its production is sold as raw milk or raw milk products .
About 90 % of all raw milk sold in California comes from Alta - Dena , which also funds the Los Angeles County Milk Commission , a certifying body .
Press reports assign to Alta - Dena a high political profile in California , where between 100,000 and 200,000 residents are said to drink certified raw milk or feed it to their children daily .
The dairy and its supporters once marshalled 17,000 letters to the governor , against only a handful opposing its position .
One witness at the hearing was Harold Stueve , Alta - Dena ’s founder and co-owner .
More than 60 members of the Stueve family are said to work for the company .
Another witness was Rep. William E. Dannemeyer ( R - Calif. ) , who was an attorney for Alta - Dena from the early 1960s until he entered Congress in 1978 .
Last Spring Dannemeyer got 36 of the other 44 Congressional representatives from California to join him in signing a letter to HHS urging FDA to back off from regulating certified raw milk .
( Some have since withdrawn their support . )
“ This ostensibly is a battle over public health , ” he testified at the hearing .
“ Disabuse yourself .
It ’s a battle over the politics of public health .
We are in this controversy because the medical profession for decades has produced doctors who are taught that all milk should be pasteurized .
They do n’t get into the whys .
It is only natural that people who achieve positions of responsibility then base their actions on what they were taught .
These are dedicated people who believe that milk should be pasteurized . ”
Dannemeyer traced the history of opposition to Alta - Dena and CRM from 1966 and said that the public has lost respect for public health authorities in California in regard to this issue .
He claimed that health department records show that 3.6 million human cases of salmonellosis were reported between 1971 and 1982 in California , and that almost half of them were attributed to food service establishments , most of the remainder to meat and poultry , and only 103 to certified raw milk .
He asked , “ If it is the intention of public health authorities to eliminate Salmonellas from humans in the United States , how is it they ignore all except CRM ? ”
Another witness for Alta - Dena was Joseph L. Fleiss , Ph.D. , head of the Division of Biostatistics at Columbia University ’s School of Public Health .
He described an “ odds ratio ” scheme for controlled retrospective studies , with relative risks from 1 to 15 .
A value of 1 means “ no associated risk . ”
A value of 5 means “ important public health risks , ” while 6 to 15 mean “ probable cause and effect . ”
Asked to rate certified raw milk on that scale , Dr. Fleiss responded : “ My experience is that , if all things were known , it would not come down to 1 , it would come down to 5 . ” Another Alta -Dena witness was John M. Douglass , M.D. , an internist from Los Angeles .
“ Is n’t it better to maintain control in the marketing of certified raw milk than to lose control ? ” he asked .
“ We might want to label it with some of the pros and some of the cons .
That gives people freedom of choice .
The label should be informative .
Some people tolerate raw milk better than others .
It may contain deleterious antigens . ”
Also testifying was William Campbell Douglass , M.D. ( no relation to John Douglass ) , president of the Douglass Center for Nutrition and Preventive Medicine and author of The Milk of Human Kindness - Is Not Pasteurized .
“ For rapid , healthy growth in young children , there is no substitute for raw , certified milk , ” he asserted .
“ Pasteurized milk is dead milk , which will rot on standing .
One of nature ’s most perfect foods has been murdered .
At the turn of the century , 5,000 babies died annually from drinking raw milk , but instead of requiring dairymen to clean up their act they required pasteurization .
Today , milk producers are clinging to outdated methods such as heat treatment to cover up sloppy production methods . ”
[ Editor ’s note : Pasteurization is not the only public health measure opposed by Dr. Douglass .
A recent article by him in the National Health Federation ’s monthly magazine states that chlorinated - fluoridated water causes cancer , chronic fatigue , atherosclerosis , allergy , heart attacks and strokes .
Clinton Ray Miller , NHF ’s Washington lobbyist , also testified . ]
Paul M. Fleiss , M.D. ( a cousin of Joseph L. Fleiss ) , a pediatrician from Hollywood , California , admitted that he had been “ repelled ” to discover that in Hollywood there was a large group of consumers of raw milk .
For a number of years , he said , he tried to dissuade mothers from feeding their infants and children a product with such a bad reputation .
Finally , he investigated for himself , read the literature , visited dairies , “ became a convert , ” and now heads the Los Angeles County Milk Commission .
“ I have a very busy pediatrics practice , and many mothers tell me that their children do better on raw milk , ” he said .
“ Some dairies are heating milk far beyond the heating required for pasteurization - they ’re sterilizing it .
This destroys some important nutrients .
And you can taste the difference . ”
He also claimed that immunoglobulins and enzymes such as lactases and lipases are destroyed by sterilization .
“ Raw milk contains lipase , free fatty acids , which when absorbed help the body utilize fat better , ” he explained .
“ This is why some allergies might be due to pasteurized milk . ”
Another witness at the hearing was Mrs. Sandy Gooch , author of the book , If You Love Me , Do n’t Feed Me Junk .
She identified herself as the proprietor of a California health food store which in June sold 5,319 gallons of raw milk , and as vice president of the Natural Foods Network [ NF 1:16 ] , which she said has three million customers nationwide .
She asserted that she knew of no report of illness ever attributed to raw milk consumption .
Other supporters of raw milk marketing said repeatedly that mandatory pasteurization would threaten consumers ’ “ freedom of choice . ”
One contended that everybody knows that cigarettes cause cancer , but government has not banned them , and everybody knows that passive restraints in automobiles save lives , but government has not mandated them .
Another said , “ We tried prohibition ( of liquor ) once , and it did n’t work .
Is raw milk next ? ”
The witnesses against raw milk were equally outspoken .
One was public health veterinarian Morris E. Potter who , with three others from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , published a state - of - the - art report on the hazards of unpasteurized milk in the October 19th Journal of the American Medical Association .
The report lists seven supposed benefits claimed by raw milk advocates , including higher nutritive value , reduced incidence of tooth decay , enhanced resistance to disease , and enhanced fertility .
Citing 65 references , however , Potter et al. conclude that no significant nutritional difference has been found between raw and pasteurized milk in numerous studies in both animals and humans .
The report explains that pasteurization affects six milk constituents with known nutritional benefits
.
Three vitamins for which milk is a minor source ( thiamine , B12 , and C ) are reduced about 10 % .
About 6 % of the calcium in milk is rendered insoluble , about 1 % of milk protein is coagulated , and some fat globules are dispersed ; but these changes have no effect on the bioavailability of these three nutrients .
On the public health issues , the CDC group states that , “ Abundant evidence has shown that raw milk serves as the source of bacteria that cause outbreaks of disease in humans : in recent years , most frequently salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis .
In the investigations of such outbreaks , the epidemiologic evidence , combined with knowledge about the occurrence of specific pathogens in cattle and the isolation of some of these pathogens from raw milk , leaves no doubt that raw milk is a vehicle for disease in humans . ”
The main symptoms of these infections are cramps , diarrhea and fever , but Salmonella dublin presents a special problem .
This relatively rare organism is known to be host - adapted to cattle and is more likely to be identified as being derived from raw milk than are the more commonly isolated types of Salmonellae .
The authors note that , “ Numerous studies in multiple locations have confirmed the role of raw milk in the transmission of S. dublin to humans … S. Dublin infections are of particular concern because the associated illness tends to be severe ” — and is not limited to the digestive tract .
At the FDA hearing , Dr. Potter added that , “ From 1980 to 1983 , 53 % of the foodborne outbreaks of Campylobacter reported to CDC were associated with drinking unpasteurized milk .
The reported rate of isolates identified is 20 times greater in states that permit the sale of unpasteurized milk . ”
According to CDC , outbreaks of campylobacteriosis associated with raw milk consumption have been reported recently in Arizona , California , Colorado , Georgia , Kansas , Maine , Oregon and Pennsylvania .
Michael Osterholm , M.D. , Minnesota Department of Health epidemiologist , described the investigation of a current mysterious disease outbreak in that state .
After months of investigation , in which 94 families have been contacted , the investigators know only this :
The causative agent has not been identified , but the method of transmission is undisputed .
Unpasteurized milk produced by one dairy had been drunk by all 122 victims during the three weeks before onset .
Some have been sick for months .
For those under age 18 , the median is 76 days ’ duration .
Children have recovered more quickly than adults , but only 11 ( 9 % ) have fully recovered .
The producing dairy has voluntarily stopped selling raw milk products .
“ All cases of which we are aware are associated with raw milk consumption , and there have been no new cases since the implicated milk product was withdrawn , ” said Dr. Osterholm .
“ This is no S. campylobacter .
It is not a virus or a fungus .
It stumps the best experts . ”
Raw milk ’s growing popularity as a “ supposed health food ” is of concern to the American Academy of Pediatrics , said another witness , John Bolton , M.D. , a San Francisco pediatrician .
The Academy “ has reviewed both the nutritional properties and the safety records of raw milk and has found that the risks outweigh the benefits , ” he declared .
“ There are no benefits of raw milk that would outweigh the extreme risk of infection that sometimes follows feeding raw milk products to infants , children with malignancies , and children with problems involving the immune system . ”
He said that , since 1977 , 192 isolates of Salmonella have been made in certified raw milk in California .
This milk is also transported across state lines by distributors .
According to Dr. Bolton , “ The most recent finding on September 28 , 1984 , involved 4,000 gallons of certified raw milk distributed to consumers and retail outlets . ”
Press reports prior to the hearing indicate that California health officials had recalled Alta - Dena ’s raw milk products 17 times since 1977 because state tests found S. dublin in samples .
The incident referred to by Dr. Bolton occurred just hours before Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed a controversial bill that would have freed the dairy from control by state regulatory agencies .
The bill would have allowed the sale of CRM shown by state labs to harbor salmonellae .
Another recall involving Alta - Dena and two other California dairies has occurred since the FDA hearing .
Dr. Bolton exhibited a chart which analyzed the 123 cases of S. dublin reported in California in 1983 .
It showed 51 patients who used raw milk , including 44 who used it from Alta - Dena .
Only 10 of the 51 had been exposed to such other possible sources of S. dublin infection as raw eggs or raw or rare meat .
The list of pre-existing diseases in these patients “ reads like the index to a pathology textbook : cancer , leukemia , lymphoma , cirrhosis , lupus , AIDS , etc. , ” he said .
“ This points out one of the most tragic aspects of this problem .
Seriously ill patients purchase a so - called ‘ health food ’ only to be exposed to S. dublin .
Raw milk is even advertised as a basic food for invalids . ”
In response to certified raw milk producers ’ claim that the product is made safe by the practice of spraying the udders of the cattle with an antiseptic solution and then using two clean towels to wipe off , Dr. Bolton stated categorically that , “ Potentially harmful bacteria still reside on the udders and inside some of the cattle as well . ”
Advocates of raw milk consumption point to other foods such as poultry which are frequently contaminated with Salmonellae .
“ What they fail to point out , ” said Dr. Bolton , “ is that these foods are intended to be cooked before consumption .
Heat destroys Salmonellae .
Pasteurization , heat treatment of milk , is the only way to assure safe milk supplies . ”
Referring to the statistical analysis of Salmonella illnesses cited by Congressman Dannemeyer , Dr. Bolton called it “ creative . ”
Literature distributed by Alta - Dena shows that the figure of “ 3.6 million cases between 1971 and 1982 ” was derived by multiplying the number of all types of Salmonella infections reported annually ( 3,000 ) by 12 years and again by 100 , “ since some say that only 1 out of 100 Salmonella cases are ever detected / reported . ”
However , the number of S. dublin cases connected with raw milk consumption was given as the actual number reported ( 103 ) , not the 10,300 which would result from multiplying this figure by 100 .
According to state health officials , the fact that the number of S. dublin cases in California is not larger “ relates to the fact that the population that drinks CRM is very small and that contamination of CRM appears to be intermittent . ”
In its March 30 , 1984 morbidity report , the Infectious Disease Section of the California Department of Health Services estimates that S. dublin infections are 158 times more likely in CRM users than in non-CRM users .
Others testifying in favor of a federal rule regarding raw milk included representatives of the Association of Food and Drug Officials ; International Association of Milk , Food , and Environmental Sanitarians ; National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments ; and National Milk Producers Federation .
The FDA hearing was but a skirmish in what The Los Angeles Times [ Aug. 31 ] called “ a holy war over milk ” in California .
“ Each time the state laboratories have found salmonella in Alta - Dena ’s milk , ” the writer noted , “ another recall notice has been issued , warnings have appeared in newspaper articles and the raw milk has been pulled off supermarket shelves .
In this war of attrition , the state seems to be slowly winning . ”
Although Alta - Dena ’s total sales have increased steadily in recent years , raw milk sales have declined from almost 20,000 gallons a day in 1977 to about half of that amount today .
Yet , the article points out , “ after all the recalls and all the press releases , an estimated 200,000 people a day still drink raw milk in California . ”

Apparently , cooking vegetables may have been the impetus for human civilization .
Robin Nixon at Live Science reports :
For a long time , we were pretty dumb .
Humans did little but make “ the same very boring stone tools for almost 2 million years , ” he said .
Then , only about 150,000 years ago , a different type of spurt happened — our big brains suddenly got smart .
We started innovating .
We tried different materials , such as bone , and invented many new tools , including needles for beadwork .
Responding to , presumably , our first abstract thoughts , we started creating art and maybe even religion .
To understand what caused the cognitive spurt , [ Researcher Philipp Khaitovich of the Partner Institute for Computational Biology ] and colleagues examined chemical brain processes known to have changed in the past 200,000 years .
Comparing apes and humans , they found the most robust differences were for processes involved in energy metabolism . …
In most animals , the gut needs a lot of energy to grind out nourishment from food sources .
But cooking , by breaking down fibers and making nutrients more readily available , is a way of processing food outside the body .
Eating ( mostly ) cooked meals would have lessened the energy needs of our digestion systems , Khaitovich explained , thereby freeing up calories for our brains .
But what about meat ?
Perhaps it was roast beef , not lentil soup , that led to higher powers of cognition ?
Possibly , but less likely , in my opinon .
Animal cells have membranes , which are easy for the body to break down .
Plants have walls , made of cellulose which are much more difficult : cooking greatly facilitates their digestion .
Cooking meat can very slightly increases the caloric density , but only by driving water off , making it denser .
However , the total calories from available from the meat decreases during cooking : fat is driven off and proteins are broken down .
Cooking plants boils the water inside the cells , rupturing the cellulose cell wall .
This makes the calories and other nutrients vastly more bioavailable .
It also lets you eat a more diverse variety of plants ; many wild plants are toxic in their uncooked form , and heat denatures the toxins .
In many more , heat wo n’t denature the toxins , but repeated boils in changes of water can get rid of them , like the tannins in tea .
And , apart from a few hunter gatherer societies that living in incredibly barren environments , such as the Innuit , most hunter - gatherer groups get about 80 % of their calories from plants .

Fossils of three new species of dinosaurs have been discovered in Australia
Fossils of three new species of dinosaurs have been discovered in Australia , including a meat - eater larger than Velociraptor from the Jurassic Park movies , suggesting Australia may have a more complex prehistoric past .
The two plant - eating and one carnivore dinosaurs , the first large dinosaurs unearthed since 1981 , were found in Queensland and date back 98 million years to the mid-Cretaceous period .
“ It not only presents us with two new amazing long - necked giants of the ancient Australian continent , but also announces our first really big predator , ” paleontologist John Long , head of sciences at Museum Victoria said on Friday .
Workers excavate at the site where three new species of dinosaurs were found
Paleontologist Ben Kear at La Trobe University in Melbourne said the discovery will pave the way for new studies on Australian dinosaurs and their environments .
“ Australia is one of the great untapped resources in our current understanding of life from the Age of Dinosaurs , ” Kear said .
“ The discoveries … will definitely reinvigorate interest in the hitherto tantalizingly incomplete , but globally significant record from this continent … ”
Australia ’s dinosaur fossil record has been extremely poor compared with North America , South America and Africa .
The new dinosaurs were unearthed during joint Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum and Queensland Museum digs at Winton in outback Queensland .
Palaeontologist Scott Hocknull
SLASHING CLAWS
The meat - eating theropod dinosaur has been called Australovenator ( nicknamed Banjo after Australian bush poet Banjo Patterson ) and the two plant - eating sauropod dinosaurs are Wintonotitan and Diamantinasaurus
“ The cheetah of his time , Banjo was light and agile .
He could run down most prey with ease over open ground , ” said Scott Hocknull , lead author of the dinosaur discovery , published on Friday on PLos One ( www.plosone.org/home.action).
“ His most distinguishing feature was three large slashing claws on each hand .
Unlike some theropods that have small arms ( like T Rex ) , Banjo was different .
His arms were a primary weapon .
He ’s Australia ’s answer to Velociraptor , but many times bigger and more terrifying , ” said Hocknull .
“ Banjo ” sheds light on the ancestry of the largest - ever meat - eating dinosaurs , the carcharodontosaurs , a group of dinosaurs that became gigantic , like Giganotosaurus , he said .
The two herbivore dinosaurs were different kinds of titanosaur , the largest type of dinosaur ever to have lived .
Fossil illustrations of three new species of dinosaurs found near Winton , Western Queensland
Wintonotitan was a tall animal which may have fitted into a giraffe - like niche , while the stocky Diamantinasaurus was more hippo- like , said Hocknull .
Two of the dinosaurs were found buried together in a 98 - million - year - old “ billabong ” or waterhole .
“ Billabongs are a built - in part of the Australian mind because we associate them with mystery , ghosts and monsters , ” said Hocknull , referring to Patterson ’s poem Waltzing Matilda , which tells of a “ swagman ” or bushman who jumps into a billabong and drowns after police try and catch him with a stolen sheep .
Hocknull said hundreds more fossils from the dig were still to be prepared and there was more material to be excavated .

So what ’s new ?
Quite a bit !
The next few sections explain what I changed and why I changed it .
The basics
I started by removing elements that have been deprecated from the HTML 5 specification , like < acronym > , < center > and < big > .
( We ’ll cover deprecated elements in more detail in another post ) .
I also added new HTML 5 elements , like and , in order to remove any default padding , margin , and borders .
I ’ve also added an explicit display : block property for elements that are required to render as blocks .
I also removed the explicit unstyling of the : focus pseudo - class .
There are two reasons for this .
First , by declaring outline : 0 , you remove the focus identifier for keyboard users .
Second , Eric released his stylesheet in good faith that people would explicitly style : focus , but they generally do n’t , so it ’s safer to leave the default : focus styles in place .
( I also set defaults for < ins > , since I do n’t think that got updated very often either . )
I ’ve left the default list styles in place simply as a personal preference .
I tend to add the list style back when using Eric ’s reset anyway .
I have , however , included nav ul {list - style : none ;} to remove those pesky bullets from your navigation .
Using attribute selectors
You ’ll notice that I ’ve included attribute selectors for < abbr > and < dfn > .
This way , the style will only appear if there is a title attribute on the element .
This is primarily for accessibility .
For example , we use < abbr > regularly on this site but do n’t always include a title attribute .
We think it ’s safe to assume all of our readers ( no matter what device they ’re using ) know what HTML stands for .
We do still use the < abbr > element to make sure screen readers read the text as H - T - M - L rather than struggling to pronounce “ HTML ” .
What ’s that bit about mark ?
< mark > is a new element introduced in HTML 5 used to ( you guessed it ) mark text in a document .
According to the spec :
“ The mark element represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes , due to its relevance in another context . ” .
I anticipate it will be used for highlighting phrases in search results and other similar purposes .
We ’ll post more on < mark > soon .
Where are all those application elements ?
Application elements is a term I ’ve loosely used to describe elements like menu , etc .
These elements are more likely found in web apps than web sites .
I left these out since , at the time of writing , browsers implement barely any of what was “ Web Applications 1.0 ” .
Also , this stylesheet is intended primarily for authors serving their pages as text / html , not XML .

[ It 's time for another Monthly Musing -- the monthly community blog theme that provides readers with a chance to get their articles and discussions printed on the frontpage .
-- CTZ ]
While trying to come up with a good topic , I started in on making a bunch of different blogs .
I started one about a Chrono Trigger sequel in my mind that never was and another about the Blues Brothers IP and car chases .
I even thought about rehashing a blog article I wrote last year about a Star Trek idea .
None of it really took form as a complete thought , and I 've yet to throw my hat into the ring for this month 's Musing .
However , I think I 've been getting at one main idea with all these half starts .
In all cases , each IP could benefit from a heaping serving of good old fashioned situational simulation and straight up , by the book , number crunching .
While the payout is n't immediate to any investor , putting time into building a great simulation system could revolutionize our play experiences .
Take .
What turned me on aboutwas n't just the character design or fun combat system .
It was the idea that my action had consequence in consideration of time .
If you plant a seed , it becomes a tree in a different time .
Though limited by narrative situation and scope of project , real results come from meddling on the temporal grid .
What if there was more time to design around that mechanic ?
What if the death of a character in Pre-Historia was able to change the entire make up of the civilization thousands of years in the future , opening and closing gameplay situations as characters cease to exist or come into being ?
What if whistling a tune across the world and 30 years prior would inspire a nation 's
Anthem that could be heard in the present at a colonial outpost ?
Nuance and minutia , perhaps .
But come on .
Aside from any narrative , playing with that system would be a true blast .
Certainly , it would be difficult .
The game would have to be built around this idea , and then , everything would have to work within the rules of whatever system is established .
Situations would have to be considered and calculated , and results , inevitably , would have to be parsed out and normalized to ensure a fun experience .
Its just a dream though .
I mean , you 'd have to create some way to manage all these objects .
You 'd have to write a whole system to define how objects and people interact with each other .
You 'd need to figure out numbers and traits for things , and define types of things and general AI .
Worst of all , you 'd probably have to take maybe 5 to 10 people to just find and define a huge number of objects to exist in this world .
Why , that 's insanity .
Its just unreal .
This could never actually happen in the industry .
Not this industry .
Oh right .is actually happening .
This September .
On the Nintendo DS .
The core gaming world is losing their collective gourd over , and with good reason .
After years of the guided narrative and the cinematic presentation , feeding on gritty action gaming and accepting the slowing arc toward sport simulation perfection , here comes a database .
A nerdgasmic database of 10,000 nouns that all have a meaning and purpose and an incomprehensible combination of computational results .
We are shocked , awed and intrigued , but what are we looking at ?
What we 're looking at is a good idea magnified , smartly , to the nth degree .
Not to trivialize the hard work the must have gone into the creation of this evocative wonder - software , but its just the escalation of game system creation .
This is not a graphical leap necessitating cell - processors or fan - cooled horsepower .
Its numbers on an array of arrays , played out in paperform gameplay .
We could have been playing with Scribbles and Time Lines generations ago .
The untapped potential is simply clever systems , my friends .
I think we had that in simulations likeorat least 10 years ago !
Imagine moving ever forward to the smarter simulation with more ways to process numbers and situational data .
What if we had gone to macro with this system design structure ?
What if , instead of graphics and networking , the medium delved farther into bolstering simulations and gameplay - relevant calculation years ago ?
We 'll never know .
But we 're bound to draw a new conclusion in the coming months .
Once people get turned on to whatdoes , and how it does it , we 're likely to see a whole new way of thinking when it comes to game design and execution .
Lets just hope that at least one inspired individual will look to create a consequential time traveling world .
The possibilities ( and paradoxes ) are endless .
Do n't look now , but you 're being watched .
And now that I 've signed up for Spokeo.com , I could be the one watching you .
Spokeo is a search engine that uses email addresses to find people across the social Web .
Give the site your log - on info for Gmail , Hotmail , Yahoo Mail , or AOL -- or just upload your personal address book ; Spokeo will scour 41 social networks and collect all information associated with each email address .
Blog entries , Linked
In profiles , Flickr photostreams , Twitter tweets , Digg comments , Amazon wish lists -- and a whole lot more -- all on one tidy little Web page .
And every time they add new content , Spokeo lets you know .
In other words , for just $ 3 to $ 5 a month Spokeo gives you the ability to stalk near - total strangers in new and fascinating ways .
I do n't know about you , but my email address book is filled with people I could n't pick out of a police lineup .
I 've probably met fewer than 2 percent of these people ; I 've spoken on the phone to maybe 1 out of 20 .
But suddenly I have this window into their lives that 's , well , just a little bit creepy .
For instance :
There 's a senior PR rep for Yahoo whom I met once five years ago .
Now I know what she looks like nine months pregnant and what color she 's painted her child 's nursery ( thank you , Flickr ) .
There 's the former director of communications for a huge Web company who also apparently frequents discussion forums for the Paranormal Research Society .
( Remember :
The truth is out there . )
Then there 's this person named Indigo -- I have n't the foggiest idea who she is or how she got into my address book -- but I know she 's a freak for The Beatles and the soundtrack from Juno .
Suddenly I have insights into the musical , literary , and political tastes of a whole swath of people I would n't know what to say to in an elevator ( though I guess we could start with their musical , literary , and political tastes ) .
On the other hand , Spokeo helped me find two old friends on Facebook and MySpace whom I 'd been unable to locate using Google .
So it 's not all bad .
The odd thing is that Spokeo is n't breaking any privacy rules .
If you made your profiles private and I 'm not on your guest list , it wo n't sneak me past the bouncers at the door .
But if like most people you 've posted stuff online without thinking twice about who can see it , Spokeo will find it -- and by extension so will I , if our electronic paths have crossed even briefly .
Despite having been out in the wild for more than year , the service is still a little bumpy .
Like every other people search engine I 've ever used , it occasionally lumps two entirely different people under the same identity .
Some import functions simply do n't work or quit midway through with no error message .
It has trouble parsing certain passwords .
And despite the fact it's a paid service , Spokeo does n't seem to offer any kind of customer support .
I sent a half - dozen questions last week via its blog contact page ; I 'm still waiting for the first response .
( Though given that the Spokeo site has been up and down all weekend , they may be busy putting out bigger fires . )
If you 're going to take people 's money , though , you ought to answer their questions .
The emergence of tools like Spokeo ( and other , less - nimble people search engines like Spock , ZabaSearch , Pipl , and Wink ) means we 've hit a tipping point in the grand social media experiment .
I 'm calling it the Fishbowl Moment ( tm ) .
For me , this oddly discomfiting mix of public and private , professional and personal , started with Facebook .
Now it 's spreading across the Net.
Judging by recent activity on my Twitter and Facebook accounts , " normal " people -- i.e. , those who barely know how to use a computer -- are now flocking to social media sites .
And though in most cases you can exercise control over the information you share and whom you share it with , most folks wo n't bother because it 's too much hassle .
In the age of massive data aggregation , everyone is ripe for the plucking .
Once , a long time ago , I entered a small bathroom at my place of employment -- and came upon the Big Boss with his BVDs around his knees .
" Do n't get up , " I quipped .
Actually , that 's not quite true .
I quickly closed the door and we both pretended it never happened .
But it 's an image I 'll take with me to the grave .
That 's how I feel now about Spokeo and other social media aggregators .
I get that squishy uncomfortable feeling I 'm seeing stuff I really should not be seeing -- but I 'm unable to stop looking .
Welcome to the Internet 2009 :
An enormous fishbowl , where anyone who wants to can see everything you do .
Hope you enjoy your swim .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Postal Service , the nation ’s second - largest employer , offered buyouts on Tuesday to quickly slash up to 30,000 jobs as it grapples with declining mail volume and embraces more automation .
People wait in line on tax deadline day at the main Post Office in New York April 15 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Chip East
The incentive for voluntary resignations and early retirements among a pool of veteran workers by the end of September is part of a drive to cut costs by $ 6 billion this fiscal year , the Postal Service said .
“ This decision reflects our desire to provide a fair and equitable opportunity for some of our longest - serving employees , ” said Anthony Vegliante , chief human resources officer and executive vice president .
“ It is important to the Postal Service that we take appropriate measures to address our current financial situation . ”
The majority of those offered $ 15,000 to leave as part of an agreement with unions -- up to 30,000 people -- work in mail processing facilities , officials said .
The Postal Service hopes to save up to $ 500 million from the move .
The job cut target is similar in scope to employment reductions by U.S. automakers and certain banks , and comes amid signs that the recession may have bottomed out .
The Postal Service , a quasi - government agency that relies on postage sales and revenue from other products and services to fund operations , reported a $ 2.4 billion loss in the quarter ended June 30 .
Traditional mail volume has been fallen sharply as email has proliferated along with online services such as electronic bill payment , officials have said .
The Postal Service has 656,000 career employees , second behind Wal - Mart Stores Inc which has more than 1.4 million workers in the United States .
Other cost cuts this year have included decisions to close facilities , pare construction , a nationwide hiring freeze , and selling underutilized and unused facilities .
The Postal Service also competes with U.S. package delivery giants UPS Inc and FedEx Corp for some services as well as other companies .
I 'm only a knot newbie , but my dad recently handed me down some shoes because I needed some proper shoes for athletics .
As a deeply frugal person , I thought it was best to help make them fit for my slightly smaller feet instead of shopping for new shoes .
Learning better lacing , including the knot itself ( which is what your site focuses on ) , has basically eliminated heel slippage and a litany of other potential health hazards .
I Just wanted to drop you a note to say thank you for your site .
I discovered it a few years ago now and it's opened my eyes to what 's possible with shoe lacing in an extremely practical and attractive way .
I 've had shoes that did n't fit quite right become comfortable multiple times .
I 've been able to choose lacing schemes that fit the look of my shoes or how I want them to feel when I wear them .
It 's been a wonderful little enrichment to my life .
Thank you .

High interest loans and foreclosed homes could be signs of a modern slave - plantation system taking hold in Metro Detroit , according to Southfield lawyer and former gubernatorial candidate Geoffrey Fieger .
In a recent post on his blog , the always outspoken Fieger questions how long before civil unrest manifests itself , as citizens grow frustrated with their tax dollars being used to underwrite " the same multibillion dollar banking and investment firms who have ripped us all off . "
Fieger is n't one to mince words .
During his 1998 run for Governor , he regularly lambasted John Engler .
Some classics courtesy of the October 1998 Michigan Review :
Fieger was acquitted of federal campaign finance violations last year .
Following the acquittal , Fieger ran a series of ads in which he said , " I 'll always stick up for you .
That 's what lawyers do . "
It seems that , at least in words , Fieger is trying to make good on that promise .
From back in the day when Superman used his moral force to say we should do this because it ’s the right thing to do for our neighbors , never mind if it cost us some tax dollars .
Of course , today he’d be attacked for his position because , after all , he ’s an illegal immigrant .
And like so many other illegals , we just want him to clean up our messes and do the jobs we ca n’t do for ourselves for non-existent pay , but that does n’t mean we have to acknowledge when he might have a point .
But I could be mistaken .
Is there someone out there who can explain why Superman is wrong ?

LGBT and HIV / AIDS activist Rodger McFarlane took his own life last Friday at the age of 54 .
In a note he left behind McFarlane indicated he “ was unwilling to allow compounding heart and back problems to become even worse and result in total debilitation . ”
In a statement released by McFarlane ’s friends and family :
The power of Rodger ’s many personal and professional accomplishments cannot be denied .
He was on the forefront of responding to the AIDS epidemic that ravaged our country – and specifically the gay community – in the 1980’s .
Before HIV even had a name , in 1981 , Rodger set up the very first hotline anywhere ; he just set it up on his own phone .
That was the Rodger we knew .
A born strategist and leader , Rodger took three organizations in their infancy and grew each into a powerhouse in its own way , empowered to tackle this national tragedy .
McFarlane appeared recently in the documentary Outrage which exposes closeted politician and their hypocrisy .
McFarlane ’s brand of “ in - your - face ” activism and his searing wit will sorely be missed .

I ’m a member of a photography group which was recently invited to attend a presentation from photography legend Art Wolfe .
I have been admiring
Art ’s work for the past two decades while I have been exploring photography and hoped to get a chance to meet him .
Living under the principle , “ If you do n’t ask , the answer is always no ” I presented the idea to Seattle Photography Associates Executive Director When Paddison .
When has been a great resource for this community group and did n’t let me down .
She was able to procure me a 15 minute interview with Art before a presentation of his work at the Kirkland Performance Center in Kirkland , Washington .
Before I get to the interview , let me say that Art is not only a fabulous photographer , he ’s also down to earth and a pleasure to talk with .
He ’s engaging , has an easy , yet excited manner and makes those he contacts feel at ease .
After our interview and before the presentation he walked through the Performance Center audience and spent time sitting and chatting with those who had come to experience his presentation .
He ’s a real class act and I am very glad I got the chance to sit with him and pick his brain .
Note : part 2 of this interview with Art Wolfe will be published here at DPS tomorrow .
Stay tuned via one of our subscription methods to get that update .
And now , Part 1 of the transcript from the interview with Art Wolfe
PETER : Your schooling was in art , specifically painting , at the University of Washington yet you are most widely known for your photography .
What about photography changed your focus ?
ART WOLFE :
It was at a time in the late 70s when photography and 35 mms were becoming more and more and more handy .
I got a camera when I was in a climbing class outside of college and I started taking pictures just to document the climbs and I just took to it like a duck in water .
The speed with which I could take compositions and make multiple compositions was much more suited to my temperament .
Having said that , I ’ve just recently got back into painting after 30 years .
And now it ’s been great because I ’m taking it a step further and melding my paintings and my photography together .
So it ’s kinda like a full circle .
PETER : When I was asking on Twitter for questions readers would like to ask you , @wrighttony told me to ask to see some of your paintings .
ART WOLFE :
It ’s amazing , I knew because over the years I ’ve had interviews and people would invariably ask me if I ever would get back to painting ; I said , ” Someday ” .
I never threw away the paints or brushes .
And suddenly I think one of the interviews spurred me to see if I still have any kind of eye - hand coordination .
And you never lose that .
In many ways the paintings I ’m painting now are way more abstract are more sophisticated because the intellect has evolved over 30 years .
So , it ’s been fun .
PETER : What elements are you most interested in while choosing a travel destination ?
ART WOLFE :
The elements are the same ones that would make me want to go to that place .
In other words , a sense of have I seen this scene over and over and over again in peoples pictures or on TV shows .
Or is there a sense of wonderment and adventure to go and see something not quite seen before .
And if it ’s been seen before , can we more importantly put a different slant on it .
So those are some of the motivations .
But I pick the greatest places around the world ( smiles ) .
The most remote cultures the biggest mountains .
The most austere , remote deserts .
And that ’s a great starting point .
If the show continues for 5 years I ’m sure we ’ll get down to exploring the Kent wetlands , but right now we still have a lot of places to get to .
PETER : You ’ve been a professional photographer for over 30 years and you ’ve seen some great photographers come and go .
Who out there inspires you today ?
ART WOLFE : Wow .
It ’s a lot of my non-nature colleagues .
I love the work of Greg Groman and his nudes and celebrity photos .
You know it ’s …. what ’s his name ….. you know I ’m at the age quite honestly where I have to relax the brain to access the short term memory .
Let ’s come back to that one because there are some but you know it ’s like , pulling names out of the hat is really difficult for me .
PETER : Ok , no problem .
How important is it to you to have professional equipment ?
ART WOLFE : Absolutely , I ’m not at all a techy , nor am I someone who polishes the latest camera and plays with the latest gadgets .
I ’m pretty uninterested in technology and that ’s the bottom line .
Having said that , I ’d be idiotic if I ’m going to take anything less than the best equipment into the field .
Because I ’m spending as much energy as you can imagine getting into the middle of the Sahara and to have something to capture the culture and atmospheric conditions that is less than what I could have brought would be ridiculous .
So , I bring really high end cameras along and I ’m working on a project right now that involves human nudes , abstracts and I ’m using Phase 45 equipment so it ’s a huge file .
Because I ’m really rapidly heading towards fine art prints and collectors prints and I want the best equipment to capture that .
PETER : Digital Photography School has a fair amount of beginning photographers who are regular subscribers .
For someone just finding they have a passion for photography , what would you say is the best thing for them to focus on from the very beginning ?
ART WOLFE :
To pursue their passion and to not worry about money .
In other words , I think so many photographers really want to figure out where ’s the economy and whether they can justify their interest in photography by the amount of money they can make from it .
I think that ’s wrong headed .
I think ; do n’t think about money , follow your passion , make whatever you can work in continuing your adventure with photography and someday if that ’s part of what you want , money will come .
But I think people feel that if they ’re not selling their work or making money from it , their work is some how inferior and I do n’t think it ’s ever been a measure of whether your work is of value or not .
A few of us neurotic folks make our living from the work but it is by no means a very easy occupation and I do n’t think it ’s either a measure of whether your work is good or not .
So , I think people should follow their passion , whether they make money or not .
In Part 2 of the interview , Art Wolfe speaks to his use of design in taking and teaching photography as well as his transformation to only shooting digital while on a trip to Antarctica .
Mass marketer General Mills Inc. is carving out a niche in gluten - free food after realizing it could reach eager customers without costly ad campaigns .
The company 's Betty Crocker brand is rolling out gluten - free mixes for cookies , brownies and cakes .
The mixes are the first gluten - free offering from a major , mainstream brand in the cake - mix aisle .
Gluten is a key protein in wheat , but many people react badly to it .

Considering that Newt Gingrich has already written a book called “ Rediscovering God in America ” and been featured in a movie of the same name , it only makes sense that he would also appear in person at a similarly named right - wing conference last week along with the likes of Mike Huckabee , David Barton , Oliver North , and Mat Staver .
The event was hosted by Lou Engle of The Call and Bruce Wilson has a good post and video explaining Engle ’s prophetic and apocalyptic activism and how this recent conference “ showcased the rapid reconfiguration of the Christian right around the rising , highly militant but poorly understood charismatic wing of the new Christian right . ”
We ’ve put together our own video of Engle ’s introduction in which he heaped praise upon Gingrich , followed by key excerpts of the former Speaker ’s remarks in which he called the ACLU a “ hateful , anti-religious system designed to drive God out of America , ” proclaimed that we are “ surrounded by paganism , ” and repeatedly stated that the most important job of every American is to turn those who are not yet saved toward Jesus Christ , followed finally by an Engle - led prayer for Gingrich in which he beseeched God to extend his “ influence for righteousness in this nation , lay your supernatural hand of God upon him and deliver him from the evil schemes of the enemy ” :
Greenpoint resident Chrissie Brodigan says she was riding on the L train between Bedford and First Avenue when her pug , who has health problems , overheated and began vomiting in the tote bag she was carrying him in .
As she was leaving the subway station with the dog in her arms , she says a police officer 's attempt to issue her a ticket turned ugly , and when she became upset the cop began saying , " If you 're going to act like a woman I 'm going to treat you like a woman . "
[ We 've updated with photos of Brodigan 's arrest .
July 1 update : A new post with details about another witness 's account is here . ]
According to Brodigan , the arresting officer 's name is Witriol ( badge number 942838 ) .
After seeing a photo , she identified him to us as Joel Witriol , who in 2006 became New York 's first Hasidic cop .
Brodigan , 32 , says Witriol would not accept her explanation that she was carrying the pug because it was sick , and she believes that the disturbed crowd that gathered to witness the arrest only made him angrier .
She tells us , " He punched me in the back ( there are bruises ) , he handcuffed me , and in the scuffle grabbed my breasts and pinched them . "
Melissa Randazzo , a speech language pathologist who lives in Williamsburg , witnessed the arrest and tells us , " something about it seemed very wrong .
The cop 's tone seemed really inappropriate and he kept saying things like , ' Are you going to act like a woman ? '
She tried to walk away , and then he grabbed her and pushed her against the wall outside the turnstile . "
Randazzo ran up to the street level to call 911 to , as she says , " call the cops " on Witriol , and soon some 20 officers had descended into the Bedford station .
They then ordered the witnesses to disperse .
Brodigan describes what happened after she was arrested :
They took my pug and he told me he was taking him to the pound where he would be " put down . "
I was taken to the J stop headquarters .
I was n't allowed to call a lawyer and I was put in a cell with handcuffs on with two other women who spit on me and hit me in the head , because they were n't in handcuffs and I was crying so much it bothered them .
I was given 3 tickets : failure to produce ID , disorderly conduct , and failure to have dog in a container .
I have a court date in August .
I asked for a pen to write the badge numbers down before I left and they refused to give me a pen and covered up their badges .
My pug was returned .
They had him behind their desks and were playing with him . "
The NYPD press office declined to verify any information about the arrest ; the spokesman told us that because these are misdemeanor charges , they " usually do n't hear anything about that . "
Brodigan adds that , " So many people saw what happened that I just would really like for everyone to submit complaints , because this man should n't be able to do this to women — to anyone . "
Let 's consider some of the data Jackson offers us .
Most bottled water is simply packaged municiple water .
The Environmental Policy Institute estimated 2 years ago that each gallon of bottled water costs $ 10 / gallon from grounwater to your lips .
Purchasing bottled water is a double hit to the environment
( 1 ) plastic bottles
( 2 ) fuel to transport
at a cost four times that of regular gasoline
According to the GAO , energy costs of delivery bottled water in Los Angeles is over 1,000 times that of tap water .
Some will say bottled water is safer than tap water , right ?
Except if it is simply tap water , how is that possible ?
And as our annual per person consumption has gone from 13.4 gallons in 1997 to 29.3 gallons ten years later , we do not even have good access to health information - the GAO found almost no information on labels about health or water quality , and often incomplete information if one went online to try to obtain it .
Meanwhile our landfills continue to feel the impact , as 3 / 4 of the water bottles do not get recycled , but accumulate with the rest of our garbage .
Jackson wonders if people 's behavior might change if they understood the costs .
I have to wonder .
Try this some time - when you see someone with a plastic bottle of water , ask if they might prefer drinking gasoline .
Of course they will think you strange .
Point out to them that the purchase cost per unit of bottled water is several times that of gasoline , ad they will be surprised , yet usually immediately start offering justifications about health and safety .
Point out that usually despite the fancy name they are drinking water taken from municipal sources , and they shrug their shoulders and end the conversation .
As egregious as the profits are for health insurance companies , they pale to the ratio of price to cost of bottled water .
Consider Jackson 's penultimate paragraph :
In one of the more outrageous examples of bottled - water scamming , the Merced ( Calif . )
Sun-Star reported in June how the Safeway supermarket chain turns Merced city water into an enormous profit .
" In Safeway ’s case , ’’ the newspaper reported , " they pay more than $ 1,000 a month for more than a million gallons of water .
The retail cost for that much - purified bottled water at Safeway is just under $ 3 million .
Safeway would not say how much it costs them to produce their water . ’’
Yet Safeway spokeswoman Teena Massingill told the Sun -Star , " We are providing a product that did not exist previously . ’’
Prior to 1945 , we did not have nuclear bombs - mere newness is not always a sufficient justification .
And I chose that comparison deliberately , because currently we may be doing far more damage to environment with our consumption of bottled water than we are in the production of nuclear bombs , or even in the accumulated waste from generating electricity from nuclear power .
We are wasting fuel to transport , which adds to the CO2 in the atmosphere .
We are adding to trash from the plastic bottles .
And of course we add to C O2 in the energy wasted - yes wasted - in the production of the containers .
Safeway 's spokesman did not have the final word in the column .
Nor shall she here .
As I ask you to consider avoiding wherever possible bottled water in plastic bottles , and if you must occasionally , save the bottles and refill them from your own water , as your part to cutting down on the environmental impact , let me offer Jackson 's final words :
Last I heard , water existed before bottles , and before Safeway .
Thankfully , consumers are beginning to remember that , too .
How about you ?
Peace .
Eat fat , forget about cholesterol
The lipid hypothesis states there is a direct link between the amount of saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet and the incidence of heart disease .
This could n’t be further from the truth .
Before the mid 1920 ’s cardiovascular disease was literally unheard of and eggs , butter and lard were consumed in abundance .
In 1900 when heart attacks were nonexistent , egg consumption was three times what it was in the mid 1950 ’s when cardiovascular disease was already the nations # 1 killer .
Scientific data just does n’t support the supposed benefits of reducing saturated fat and cholesterol .
20 studies have shown that people who have had heart attacks have n’t eaten any more saturated fat than other people , and the degree of atherosclerosis at autopsy is unrelated to diet .
On the contrary , saturated fats have been nourishing societies for milenia .
Below is a list of guidelines we can and should follow to be healthier and reduce our risk of the nations number one killer :
La préfecture de police de Paris a démenti , mercredi 6 mai , les allégations du Canard enchaîné du 6 mai , selon lesquelles des policiers en civil ont volontairement provoqué les gendarmes mobiles chargés de disperser la fin du cortège du 1er Mai à Paris , place de la Bastille .
" Des allégations mensongères " , a réagi Marie Lajus , conseillère technique du préfet de police , à la suite de la publications de l'article du Canard .
Mme Lajus reconnaît que des groupes de " policiers en civil sont présents dans les fins de manifestations pour interpeller les casseurs " , une pratique qui s'est d'ailleurs développée depuis 2005 .
Selon l'article du Canard enchaîné , une demi-douzaine de policiers en civil " encapuchonnés , baskets aux pieds , crânes rasés et bardés d'autocollants ' Casse - toi pauv' con ' ou ' Rêve générale ' " , ont semé le trouble sur les marches de l'Opéra - Bastille .
Au final , des interpellations ont eu lieu , sauf concernant " la demi- douzaine de provocateurs qui réussissent à s'évaporer .
Et pour cause " , conclut Le Canard .
" COMPAGNIE DE SÉCURISATION "
La préfecture de Paris dément également que les policiers en civil aient porté des cagoules , ou même des écharpes pendant la manifestation du 1er Mai .
Une pratique qui , si elle est avérée , serait embarrassante pour le gouvernement , qui prépare un décret interdisant le port de cagoule lors d'une manifestation sous peine d'une amende de 1 500 euros .
La préfecture met au défi l'hebdomadaire de publier des preuves montrant que les policiers " pratiquent eux - mêmes des provocations pour susciter des infractions " ou portent des cagoules , se disant " certaine " qu'elles n'existent pas .
L'hebdomadaire satirique déclare disposer de photographies de ces " chauffeurs " , sortant peu auparavant " deux par deux , de fourgons de police stationnés boulevard Richard - Lenoir " .
Les policiers en civil qui écument les manifestations font partie d'une " compagnie de sécurisation " , créée officiellement en 2005 par Nicolas Sarkozy , alors ministre de l'intérieur , afin de " protéger les manifestants " .
Depuis , cette compagnie a participé à d'autres manifestations parisiennes , selon la préfecture , qui précise que d'autres agents " spécialisés dans la lutte contre la délinquance sur la voie publique " participent également à ce genre de manifestations .
Selon Le Canard enchaîné , " il est question de créer d'autres compagnies de sécurisation ailleurs en France " .

LANGFORD , British Columbia , July 19 ( UPI ) -- A British Columbia woman says Wal - Mart apologized to her after telling her she could n't breastfeed in public at one of the chain 's stores , she said .
Tanya Constable was at the Wal - Mart in Langford , near Victoria , July 16 , when her 11 - month - old daughter , Myra , started to cry .
Constable told the Vancouver Sun when she started to breastfeed Myra a store employee told her she could n't nurse in the children 's department and said she had to go to a washroom .

The 27 - year - old mother went to a manager and was told if someone complains the store policy is to ask the mother to move .
Constable said there were no other customers in the baby section .
She left the store when she was asked to move .
Kevin Groh , director of corporate affairs for Wal - Mart Canada , said the employee was wrong to suggest Constable should move .
Groh apologized to her on behalf of the store .
A NEWLY ELECTED Fine Gael councillor has been bound to the peace for 12 months for calling a fellow party member “ a f****** scab ” .
Thomas Bambrick , who was elected to Bagenalstown Town Council in Co Carlow in May , appeared at a recent sitting of the District Court charged with an offence under the Public Order Act .
Bambrick admitted to publicly insulting Larry Byrne , also a local Fine Gael activist , on the street .
On various occasions , the court heard , Bambrick , a retired postman , had insulted Mr Byrne by calling him “ a f****** scab ” , “ a scabby bastard ” , “ a traitor ” and “ a Judas ” .
Bambrick admitted the allegation and told Judge William Harnett : ‘ Oh God in Hell , I do n’t deny that .
I called him a f****** scab three times . ”
Judge Harnett was told that the two men , both in their 60s , had frequently clashed in public .
Bambrick ’s solicitor John Foley agreed that there had been a history of “ political jousting ” .
Mr Byrne admitted that one time , he could n’t quite understand the insults because Bambrick had “ a pipe in his mouth ” .
In his evidence , Bambrick claimed that he , in turn , had also been the victim of unpleasant jibes made by Mr Byrne .
The court heard that Mr Byrne had once ordered his dog not to approach Bambrick when the two men had crossed paths .
According to Bambrick , Mr Byrne had instructed his dog to “ come away from that or you ’ll be contaminated ” .
In his defence , Mr Byrne claimed that , far from insulting Bambrick , he was warning his dog to stay away from “ poo in the grass ” .
Judge Harnett appeared to set a legal precedent when he ruled that a person cannot insult another person by communicating via an animal .
He said Mr Byrne ’s comment could not be construed as an insult because he was talking to his dog .
The judge observed that he was sure it was “ a Fine Gael dog ” and Garda Supt Pat Kavanagh agreed that it would not be necessary to call the hound as a witness .
Bambrick was bound to the peace for one year on his own bond of €300 .
Self - Enforcing Protocols
There are several ways two people can divide a piece of cake in half .
One way is to find someone impartial to do it for them .
This works , but it requires another person .
Another way is for one person to divide the piece , and the other person to complain ( to the police , a judge , or his parents ) if he does n’t think it ’s fair .
This also works , but still requires another person — at least to resolve disputes .
A third way is for one person to do the dividing , and for the other person to choose the half he wants .
That third way , known by kids , pot smokers , and everyone else who needs to divide something up quickly and fairly , is called cut - and - choose .
People use it because it ’s a self - enforcing protocol : a protocol designed so that neither party can cheat .
Self - enforcing protocols are useful because they do n’t require trusted third parties .
Modern systems for transferring money — checks , credit cards , PayPal — require trusted intermediaries like banks and credit card companies to facilitate the transfer .
Even cash transfers require a trusted government to issue currency , and they take a cut in the form of seigniorage .
Modern contract protocols require a legal system to resolve disputes .
Modern commerce was n’t possible until those systems were in place and generally trusted , and complex business contracts still are n’t possible in areas where there is no fair judicial system .
Barter is a self - enforcing protocol : nobody needs to facilitate the transaction or resolve disputes .
It just works .
Self - enforcing protocols are safer than other types because participants do n’t gain an advantage from cheating .
Modern voting systems are rife with the potential for cheating , but an open show of hands in a room — one that everyone in the room can count for himself — is self - enforcing .
On the other hand , there ’s no secret ballot , late voters are potentially subjected to coercion , and it does n’t scale well to large elections .
But there are mathematical election protocols that have self - enforcing properties , and some cryptographers have suggested their use in elections .
Here ’s a self - enforcing protocol for determining property tax : the homeowner decides the value of the property and calculates the resultant tax , and the government can either accept the tax or buy the home for that price .
Sounds unrealistic , but the Greek government implemented exactly that system for the taxation of antiquities .
It was the easiest way to motivate people to accurately report the value of antiquities .
A VAT , or value - added tax , is a self - enforcing alternative to sales tax .
Sales tax is collected on the entire value of the thing at the point of retail sale ; both the customer and the storeowner want to cheat the government .
But VAT is collected at every step between raw materials and that final customer ; it ’s the difference between the price of the materials sold and the materials bought .
Buyers wants official receipts with as high a purchase price as possible , so each buyer along the chain keeps each seller honest .
Yes , there ’s still an incentive to cheat on the final sale to the customer , but the amount of tax collected at that point is much lower .
Of course , self - enforcing protocols are n’t perfect .
For example , someone in a cut - and - choose can punch the other guy and run away with the entire piece of cake .
But perfection is n’t the goal here ; the goal is to reduce cheating by taking away potential avenues of cheating .
Self - enforcing protocols improve security not by implementing countermeasures that prevent cheating , but by leveraging economic incentives so that the parties do n’t want to cheat .
One more self - enforcing protocol .
Imagine a pirate ship that encounters a storm .
The pirates are all worried about their gold , so they put their personal bags of gold in the safe .
During the storm , the safe cracks open , and all the gold mixes up and spills out on the floor .
How do the pirates determine who owns what ?
They each announce to the group how much gold they had .
If the total of all the announcements matches what ’s in the pile , it ’s divided as people announced .
If it ’s different , then the captain keeps it all .
I can think of all kinds of ways this can go wrong — the captain and one pirate can collude to throw off the total , for example — but it is self - enforcing against individual misreporting .

Although an away - game and rain resulted in a low turnout for Randy Johnson 's 300th win yesterday , the small crowd could n't diminish the joy and relief the SF Giants pitcher felt after winning his 300th game .
This makes Johnson the 24th pitcher ( and the sixth left - hander ) to achieve the 300 mark with a 5 - 1 win against the easy - to - clobber Nationals in D.C. last night .
Here 's a photo tribute to the five - time Cy Young Award winner 's big night .
Congratulations , Randy !
The latest creation in the Ass - Covering Studio Excuses R&D Dept. is the " Twitter Effect . "
Movies are n't making money , you see , because too many people are learning , 140 characters at a time , how bad they are .
Every new messaging has brought studio complaints about how they 're being killed with " word of mouth . "
Before Twitter , it was text messaging , Facebook , MySpace , " the web , " email and , for all we know , AOL , television , FM radio , the telegraph and the passenger pigeon , which prevented hucksters from getting people to hand over money for what they think will be a good show , but really is n't .
So , here 's the latest incarnation : Did you tweet about your disappointment in a movie , like Bruno ?
Did all your friends tweet back in agreement ?
According to social media specialists , Universal is mad at you for driving away 73 % percent of Bruno 's ticket sales !
When movie - goers take to their micro-blogging sites and hurl instant critiques at helpless studios , all their marketing machinery is rendered impotent .
Some of this summer 's alleged victims have included Bruno , Land of the Lost , and Year One .
After mega advertising campaigns , months of free publicity from hungry media outlets ( and web sites looking for cheap content ! ) , specialists hired to create Facebook fan pages and Twitter feeds , people insist on slagging summer movies on Twitter .
Like , all Sascha and Universal wanted to do was expose the ugliness that lives in your heart through various stunts involving dildos and terrorists .
Then you had to go off and mean about it .
What 's a matter with you ?!
So how have the studios tried to harness the awe - striking a wrathful power of Twitter ?
Here 's an example :
With Year One , Sony at first tried to get in on the action and created a promotional Year One twitter account that would cull all the posts tagged with " #yearone .
Sad for Sony , though , most of those tags were attached to disparaging statements .
So they tried to pivot and create their own Year One twitter meme !
But no amount of tweet co-opting could save the floundering flick ( full disclosure , I have a soft spot for Biblical comedies that have fantastic Oliver Platt cameos , so I dug it — you 're welcome , Sony ! )
But let 's be honest here , Studios .
Just between you and me , nobody else is listening right now : you really did n't expect that many people to go continue to see a shitty movie after it opened , right ?
You must have known that eventually people would talk .
They 'd tell other people how little they liked Will Ferrell screaming at the sky .
Again .
And though the time between seeing said shitty movie and then telling your buddies about how shitty the movie maybe has shortened thanks to twitter , you must have known from the beginning that you were pushing a shitty product .
So really there 's only one way to combat the Twitter effect : Stop making shitty movies .
P.S. I really laughed during Land of the Lost !
Sorry no one else did , Universal !

The BBC claimed today that Iran had widened electronic jamming of its services , as the country 's Revolutionary Guard ordered domestic websites and blogs to remove any material that might " create tension " amid post-election unrest .
Both the BBC's World News and Persian TV channels are now being jammed by " ground - based interference " in what one senior corporation insider told MediaGuardian .co.uk was akin to " electronic warfare " .
Iranian authorities also blocked access to Yahoo Messenger early today as the country intensified its crackdown on all means of communication following Friday 's controversial presidential poll .
The BBC's Persian website has also been blocked by filters , although the corporation said people were finding a way to unblock them manually and that use of the site had been " massive " .
It was receiving five videos a minute from people within Iran .
Iran 's Revolutionary Guard , an elite body answering to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said through the state news service that Iranian websites and bloggers must remove any materials that " create tension " , or else they would face legal action .
This is the first public statement from what is the country 's most powerful military force since the crisis erupted .
Iranian reformist websites , as well as blogs and Western social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter , have been vital conduits for Iranians to inform the world about protests over the bitterly contested declaration of election victory for the hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
At least 20 websites affiliated to the defeated reformist candidate , Mir Hussein Mousavi , have been blocked , although some users can still update their profiles by using proxy sites .
" Before this we could bypass filtering by using proxy websites , the links for which were distributed daily among friends by email .
But now the Iranian communication ministry has also begun to tackle proxy websites too , " one Iranian student said .
" But there is still a small number of people who update their Facebook and Twitter profiles by using special anti-filtering programmes installed on their PC rather than regular proxy websites .
The problem is that many people do n't know how to use this software . "
Yahoo Messenger had played an important role since Friday , when the Iranian government began to block Iran 's mobile phone network and satellite TV channels .
" Yahoo Messenger was one of the most important means that Iranians could still distribute information after the government filtered Facebook and Twitter , " an Iranian graduate said .
" In the early morning I could n't log into my Yahoo Messenger account .
First I thought that 's because of the government clampdowns on the internet but then I found that I have access to other websites but not my Messenger .
" The internet has a very important social function in Iran in comparison to Europe and other countries .
We are one of the top 10 world 's active blogging communities because of the level of censorship inside the country and now the government is cracking down on the internet as well . "
An Iranian blogger added : " Iran 's blogging community has been very quiet this week – mostly because they are afraid of being arrested .
The government has already filtered thousands of websites and blogs since Friday 's election . "
The Iranian government barred foreign media yesterday from leaving their offices to report on the street protests .
Iran 's opposition announced a third day of street demonstrations today .
The violence has left at least seven people dead , according to Iran 's state media .
In an attempt to placate the opposition , the main electoral authority said yesterday it was prepared to conduct a limited recount of ballots at sites where candidates claim irregularities .
But the announcement did not satisfy Mousavi , who has called the election an " astonishing charade " and demanded it be cancelled and held again .

The mother then asked her daughter : " Have you ever had sex ? "
The 14 - year - old replied : " I ’ve already told you the story about this ... and do n’t look at me and smile because it ’s not funny . "
After a pause she then raised her voice and said : " Oh OK … I got raped when I was 12 years old . "
Sandilands hesitated before asking " Right ... is that the only experience you ’ve had ? "
The girl ’s mother interrupted , saying she found out about the rape only " a couple of months ago " .
Jackie
O then said they would drop the lie detector test as they had been unaware of the rape incident .
An Australian Communications and Media Authority spokesman said it had received " several " phone calls and written letters of complaint about the segment .
However complaints had to be first made directly to 2Day FM , and could be acted on by ACMA if listeners felt the station had not dealt with it properly .
He said there was no regulation that required radio stations to implement a seven second delay on broadcasts .
' Irresponsible '
NSW Community Services minister Linda Burney slammed the segment as ‘‘ in very poor taste and highly irresponsible ’’ .
‘‘ I have listened to the segment and I am appalled at what I ’ve heard , ’’ she said .
‘‘ And it was apparent that the announcers were only interested in shock value and entertainment and were n’t at all concerned about the welfare and wellbeing of a 14 year old . ’’
DoCS had the contact details of both the 14 - year - old and her mother and was trying to contact them to arrange counselling and assistance , she said .
' Appalling '
Karen Willis , manager at the NSW Rape Crisis Centre , said the segment was " appalling on a number of levels " .
" First , an adult person asking a child about their sexual experiences is not on , and to do that in a public arena is quite frankly harassment of a child , " she said .
" Then when [ the girl 's ] answer came , to glibly ask whether she'd had any other experiences , rather than getting her off air as soon as possible … it 's abuse of a child really . "
Ms Willis said it was clear the girl ’s mother did not understand the impact sexual assault had on a child .
" I have serious concerns about [ the ] mum and her behaviour and I ’m hoping there has been some sort of report , " she said .
" It sounds like she ’s tried to tell [ her ] mum and she has n’t taken it seriously .
" [ Rape is ] a serious crime that a little girl should not have to experience and , at 12 , she is a little girl . "
' Did n't know ' 2DayFM general manager Jenny Parkes issued a statement saying : " All due care and consideration was given to the family and clearly we did n’t know anything about the incident .
" The moment we became aware of it was live on air and we shut it down as soon as we possibly could .
" As is only appropriate , we are offering all the assistance we can to the family , including counselling , in what is of course an extraordinarily difficult situation . "

Tipped off by a Mac OS X security expert , Apple is working to repair a serious security flaw in the iPhoneâs operating system â one that could allow an attacker to track the phoneâs location via GPS , eavesdrop on conversations via the microphone , or create a mobile bot net capable of unleashing denial of service attacks .
The attack takes advantage of a vulnerability in the phoneâs short messaging service , or SMS , feature , allowing an outside party into the phoneâs root access without the ownerâs knowledge .
Security researcher Charles Miller , co-author of The Mac Hackerâs Handbook , announced his discovery Thursday at the SyScan Conference in Singapore , according to Computerworld .
Apple plans to have the fix released later this month , before Miller gives his scheduled speech at the Black Hat Technical Security Conference in Los Angeles .
At the July 25 - 30 conference , Miller will be joined by Colin Mulliner for a talk entitled â Fuzzing the Phone in Your Phone , â  which will show attendees how to discover vulnerabilities in a variety of smartphones .
Miller has not specifically detailed how the SMS exploit is done , citing an agreement with Apple .
But he will discuss the attack in length at the Black Hat conference .
The exploit takes advantage of the fact that SMS can send binary code to an iPhone .
That code is automatically processed without user interaction , and can be compiled from multiple messages , allowing larger programs to be sent to a phone .
For a widely - adopted platform , Appleâs iPhone has had remarkably little in the way of discovered vulnerabilities in its short history .
In 2007 , a security firm â including Miller â notified Apple of the phoneâs first security flaw , soon after the hardware had been released .
It was subsequently fixed by Apple .
NEW GERMAN HEAVY ARTILLERY
Indications that the Germans have recently introduced two new specialized heavy artillery weapons are found in photographs and captions appearing in a recent number of the German magazine Signal .
The two accompanying sketches have been prepared from these photographs .
a. Heavy Mortar
The mortar piece labelled " Thor " is stated in the caption to have been used in the Sevastopol siege operations .
Other photographs appearing in the same number of the magazine depict this mortar mounted on a caterpillar tractor , from which it is being fired .
An examination of this photograph by U.S. artillery and ordnance officers resulted in a consensus of opinion that the caliber of this mortar was probably between 500 - mm and 600 - mm .
It will be remembered that at the time of the Sevastopol siege , both the German and neutral European press printed stories that the Germans were employing successfully a mortar of 560 - mm caliber .
The development of a weapon of this type is to be ascribed to the ever - growing difficulties the Germans are encountering in mastering the Russian permanent fortifications .
Forts and pillboxes are becoming stronger and stronger with the passing of each month ; in consequence the attacking force is being required to use ever more powerful weapons of offense .
The mortar pictured has evidently a very short range , certainly not over 5,000 yards and possibly much less .
In consequence , its usefulness is very limited .
Nevertheless , so important a role are modern fortifications playing in the fighting now raging in Russia , notably at Stalingrad , that it would appear probable that , as the war continues to develop , all armies , including our own , will find a need for artillery mortars of this approximate type in order to cope with the problem of destroying permanent land fortifications .
b. Railway Gun
The other type of German weapon portrayed in Signal is a very powerful railway gun .
The caption in Signal suggests that this gun is mounted along the French Channel Coast .
The question of the caliber of this weapon presents some difficulties .
Photographs of the shell appearing elsewhere in Signal indicate , however , that it is at least of 16 - inch caliber , but more probably between 20 and 22 inches .
It is quite possible that this is the same weapon which has been reported on by British sources as follows :
" It has been established that 61.5 - cm howitzers , probably on rail mountings , were used at Sevastopol .
This weapon is reported to have 112 grooves in the rifling , and to fire a base - fuzed ' anticoncrete ' shell ( Betongranate ) which weighs about 4,400 lbs , is 6 ft 9 in long , and has a copper driving band 2.76 in wide . "
The range of this gun is not known , but is doubtless very great .
The German purpose in mounting such a gun in France is not at all clear .
It would seem quite possible that it is primarily intended for the bombardment of London and other inland British cities rather than for fire against channel shipping .

Labour loses out in Staffordshire Red rose county turns
Tory blue Labour has lost control of its four remaining county councils in England after damaging defeats in what were once seen as traditional strongholds .
It lost Staffordshire , Lancashire and Derbyshire to the Conservatives for the time in decades while Nottinghamshire passed to no overall control .
Labour had controlled Derbyshire since 1981 and had been in power in the other three councils since the early 1980s .
Deputy Leader Harriet Harman said the results were " disappointing " .
Labour losses
As the results of elections to 34 English councils are being declared , they indicate that Labour 's vote has been squeezed across the country .
According to the BBC projections , Labour 's share of the national vote has fallen by three points since 2004 to 23 % , behind the Tories on 38 % and the Liberal Democrats on 28 % .
Derbyshire 's loss means it passes out of Labour control for the first time since 1977 as the Conservatives took 19 seats to gain overall control .
The Conservatives also took control of Staffordshire , with Labour winning in only two out of 62 wards called so far .
The BBC's Midlands political editor said this result had been greeted with despair by Labour , with one former councillor describing the result as a " complete wipe - out " .
We have to understand and learn the lessons
Harriet Harman
Conservatives make large gains Tories take Nottinghamshire Tories win county after 28 years The Tories picked up 18 seats in Lancashire , another historic Labour heartland , to gain control of the council for the first time since 1981 .
But the BNP won a seat in Burnley , one of two it has picked up across England so far .
The BBC North East political editor Richard Moss said Labour had suffered some " major reverses " in the region in what had been a " terrible day " for the party .
Ms Harman said the backdrop to the election was very difficult for Labour given voters ' anger over the expenses scandal and the recession .
" I think that we 're all facing disappointment in these results in the Labour Party , " she said .
" We have to listen to what the voters are saying , " she told the BBC .

Welcome to OpenOffice.org , the world - class office suite that ’s also free and open source .
This is your new - user orientation .
You probably already know that OpenOffice.org includes a word processor , spreadsheet , presentation application , drawing program , and database : you stay productive without touching your wallet .
What you may not know are all the resources to help you make the most of your experience .
Read on to discover support , tutorials , community insights , templates , clip art , extensions , and blogs .
OpenOffice.org is organized differently than its main competitor .
Hoping to entice business users to purchase support and services , Sun Microsystems ( recently purchased by Oracle ) gives away not just the OpenOffice.org free of charge , but also its source code ( the blueprints ) and a significant degree of control .
OpenOffice.org is organized as a community under the leadership of Louis Suarez - Potts , the community manager employed by Sun Microsystems .
Sun funds the infrastructure and most of the software engineers .
The community provides additional software engineers , quality assurance experts , marketers , translators , template developers , trainers , help desk staff , and other important roles .
Anyone may participate in the community .
Help
Your first stop for support is the OpenOffice.org Support Index , a long list of resources ranging from free forums to consultants and books .
If you have a generic question ( such as how to get started with Writer , OpenOffice.org ’s word processor ) then it may already be covered in the OpenOffice.org Documentation Wiki .
For a well - organized set of Writer tutorials for beginners to advanced users , visit Tutorials for OpenOffice.org .
For questions with particular circumstances , post your question for others to answer in public message forums OOoForum.org or the OpenOffice.org Community Forum .
If you are a business considering a large deployment of OpenOffice.org , read the recent article OpenOffice.org Opens up for Business .
Paid help is available to ensure a smooth transition .
Template
Honestly OpenOffice.org does n’t come with any templates or clip art worth mentioning , but the community provides free templates that are easy to install .
Since the last time I rounded up OpenOffice.org templates more than a year ago , some things have changed .
What has n’t changed is my favorite presentation templates are still those designed by Chih - Hao Tsai : they are classic , simple , and elegant .
The OpenOffice.org Repositories for Extensions and for Templates are new services organizing many useful templates .
It may not be intuitive to look for templates under the Extensions Repository , but many templates packs are distributed as extensions .
In particular , try the Professional Template Pack I and II .
Once you install the template packs , start OpenOffice.org ( any part ) and click File – New – Templates to browse the templates .
If you are printing address , mailing , shipping , CD and other types of labels , browse WorldLabel.com ’s Label Templates .
Remember OpenOffice.org reads Microsoft
Office document formats , so you can use most templates designed for Microsoft Office .
Clip art
An easy way to grow your clip art is to install OxygenOffice Extra – Gallery and OxygenOffice Extra – Gallery ( free to use ) .
After installation , click Tools – Gallery to browse clip art .
An excellent source of free clip art is the Open Clip Art Library .
While I find the online clip art browser difficult , you can integrate the whole clip art collection into OpenOffice.org in 12 easy steps to put tens of thousand of clip art images at your fingertips .
Extensions
Extensions enhance OpenOffice.org with new functionality , and most are available free through the OpenOffice.org Repository for Extensions .
In particular , I recommend these extensions .
Check grammar
To underline potentially - incorrect grammar with a blue squiggly line , install the popular LanguageTool extension .
It performs well at catching double words , homophones , and other common mistakes .
Reduce the size of presentations
Presentations can easily balloon to sizes larger than necessary .
For example , you may insert a 3 megapixel image from a digital camera , but over two megapixels are wasted as a typical presentation display is only 0.8 megapixels .
The extra size wastes disk space , clogs up email boxes , and takes extra time to download .
Simply install Sun Presentation Minimizer to tame the size of these bloated files .
Import PDFs
Not only does OpenOffice.org out of the box export PDFs with advanced options , OpenOffice.org imports PDFs in an editable format with remarkable results .
PDFs are n’t designed for editing , so do n’t expect too much , but OpenOffice.org will save some people the cost of buying Adobe Acrobat .
Blogs
The best OpenOffice.org blog is Solveig Haugland ’s OpenOffice.org Training , Tips , and Ideas .
She is long - time user , an instructor , author of three books .
She frequently updates the blog with helpful , well - written articles .
My own site OpenOffice.org Ninja chronicles tips , insights , and exclusive previews .

In the time which I 've experimented with Linux and all manner of techie things , I 've noticed a constant , willful violation of Strunk and White 's The Elements of Style growing within the language of English - speaking geeks .
Every day , this phenomenon extends further and further , it seems .
Slowly in quotations , the periods and the commas are switching place with the quotation marks .
What do I mean ?
Well , take a recent node , Troll for the Ages , by TheBooBooKitty .
In it , the wise Kitty postulates that
Notice how the pipes end .
They do not end in the order period - quotation marks or comma-quotation marks , as is standard in the Queen 's English .
Rather the punctuation has been reversed .
I do n't think that this instance was a typo , nor do I think the hundreds of other violations were .
I believe it is an intended departure from normal rules .
In the past , total integrity of the greater ideas within a missive was required , hence , something set off in quotation marks framed the complete thought , including a period or comma .
But as technology advanced , the need of technical speech developed .
Here , total integrity of the letters themselves is required .
A trailing character within a quotation , required by grammatical tradition , could introduce unnecessary error to the data .
Example :
You want to enter at the shell " gcc - cf . "
You want to enter at the shell " gcc - cf " .
Here exists some confusion .
( well , not a lot if you 're really familiar with bash and gcc but bear with me )
Does the trailing dot belong in the shell command ?
Who knows ?
The following is far superior .
So the period began to be pushed to the outside of technical quotations .
And even now as the days go by , it permeates the wider English language more and more .
In fifty years , will the Oxford English Dictionary note and accept this change to the ever - pliable interchange medium which is English ?
pvb pointed out to me that you could put the command on a separate line or rephrase the sentence to avoid having a period nearby the command .
Good point .
HongPong wonders what the sed command to transpose ASCII 34 and ASCII 46 is .
Women prefer to work for male bosses ... because they 're ' better managers and less prone to moods '
Most women prefer to work for male bosses because they are less prone to mood swings , research revealed yesterday .
Two thirds of female employees said they like having a man in charge in the office .
Those questioned also said male bosses are more authoritative , straight - talking and better at making decisions than their female counterparts .
Battle of the sexes :
Two thirds of women say they prefer working for a male boss because they are better decision - makers than their female counterparts
But the study did find the fairer sex are better at delegation and more likely to dish out praise .
The statistics come ten days after Harriet Harman declared men in power can't be trusted .
Labour 's deputy leader said : ' I do n't agree with all - male leaderships .
' Men can not be left to run things on their own .
I think it 's a thoroughly bad thing to have a men-only leadership . '
The results of the survey also revealed four out of ten women who have female bosses believe they could do a better job than their superior .
A spokesman for www.OnePoll.com, which conducted the research , said : ' The results make interesting reading as there were pros and cons to both sexes . '
The research found while women are good at dealing with employees ' personal issues within the office environment most felt men were better at ' steering the ship ' .
' Men were also revealed to be better at having an overall vision of the direction the business was going to take over the long - term , ' the spokesman claimed .
' But women were better at dealing with those slightly uncomfortable issues that pop up from time to time because they were felt to be better listeners than men .
' One the other hand many women felt they could do as good or even better than their female boss while only a handful said they could emulate their male manager .
' The results do paint a picture of men being a bit harder and more driven , but that is n't always the kind of approach which is needed . '
The study of 2,000 women in full or part - time employment were asked whether they would prefer to have a man or woman as their immediate line manager .
Sixty three per cent expressed a male preference , while only 37 per cent opted for a woman .
The main reasons cited were mood swings and bringing personal problems to work .
The results also showed one in six females who work under a woman is experiencing ' underlying tension ' with their boss .
He said the expenses revelations had shown the “ clawing greed ” of MPs and revealed how Westminster had been taken over by “ a culture of abuse ” .
His devastating attack came as Parliament ’s former anti-sleaze chief also accused MPs of a failure of “ moral leadership ” .
Lord Carey wrote : “ It is not just the clawing greed of painstaking claims for such minor items as tampons , barbecue sets and bathrobes , but also the egregious way some have transferred allowances from one second property to another – enabling them to refurbish homes at public expense , then sell them for profit .
“ Already our MPs are seeking a scapegoat .
The first reaction was to shoot the messenger , blaming so - called chequebook journalism .
Yet they ’ve only themselves to blame .
The moral authority of Parliament is at its lowest ebb in living memory . ”
Coming at a time of financial crisis and the betrayal of the Gurkhas , anger over politicians ’ allowances “ threatens to be the straw that finally breaks the camel ’s back , ” Lord Carey said .
Another Game Gets Refused Classification in Australia
David over at Kotaku is pointing out that the OFLC has refused classification to the RPG Risen , based on the fact the game contains “ sexual activity and drug use related to incentives or rewards . ”
Personally , sexual activity is an incentive in itself and has its own rewards .
Sure , it may not be appropriate for kids , but that ’s ( again ) why we need an adult - only rating for games .
As for drug use – while I do n’t find it that interesting outside of having a cool beer after a hard day ’s work or a nice glass of wine with a meal , there are plenty of benefits in medicinal drugs in real life , so why not in a game ?
Of course , the game is being developed for both PC and Xbox 360 , so I ’m sure plenty of pirated PC versions will make it into the country anyway .

CHARLESTON , South Carolina ( CNN ) -- Magoline Hazelton is used to people driving by her home just to take a look .
She 's also known as the " house lady " by her fellow residents in North Charleston , South Carolina .
Steel shipping containers , like these at a depot , can be turned into homes .
more photos »
From the outside , Hazelton 's home does n't seem much different from the rest of the neighborhood .
But there 's one big difference .
Her house is made from cargo shipping containers .
Using containers to build homes has increasingly become a trend in the past several years because it can be cheaper and faster than using traditional construction methods .
There are also plenty of containers at most major ports .
About 18 million containers are used worldwide to transport a variety of everyday products , such as cars , toys and food .
Because the United States imports more than it exports , many containers end up stacked at ports .
See one of the homes being built »
SG Blocks , a company whose name stands for safe and green blocks , has made a business from the container overflow .
Co-founder David Cross previously worked as a merchant marine and spent a lot of time at sea , dealing with shipping containers .
" As you 're looking down the deck of the vessel , you see hundreds to thousands of containers perfectly configured , " Cross said .
" They were stacked nine high below deck , five or six high on deck , and I just kept seeing hotel after hotel on the deck of our ship . "
Watch how residents like living in the homes »
Cross also saw value in the strength of the material .
" The containers are designed for hostile dynamic life at sea ... capable of carrying 60,000 pounds .
It just made imminent sense , that with minor modification , it could become a multi- family living system . "
In 2003 , Cross partnered with engineer Steve Armstrong to help bring the idea to fruition .
A year later , Hazelton 's house was built in South Carolina .
According to Cross , modifying containers into homes uses significantly less energy than melting them down .
" These containers weigh about 9,000 pounds , and it takes about 9,000 kilowatt hours of energy to melt down 9,000 pounds of steel , " Cross said .
" We modify that existing piece of steel with approximately 400 kilowatt hours of energy input .
[ That 's a ] 95 percent energy footprint reduction . "
The energy saved by transforming a single container into a home , rather than melting it down , can power a standard 70 - watt lightbulb for up to 15 years .
The time it takes to assemble a container home can vary , according to Cross .
Hazelton 's home took 10 weeks to build .
Generally , SG Blocks has found that recycled homes cut construction time in half .
" Typical homes can take four to eight months [ to build ] , " Cross said .
" For container homes , it 's usually two to four months . "
According to Armstrong , who is president of SG Blocks , the cost of building a single family container home is comparable to a traditional home .
" But you get a steel home instead of a wood home , " he said .
" So , it 's more durable and has a lower carbon footprint .
It 's also water resistant and termite resistant . "
The construction becomes cheaper as you get into multi-family homes .
According to Armstrong , multi-family mid-rise units cost 10 to 15 percent less than typical " stick frame " homes .
" That 's a lot to do with speed and ease of construction , " he said .
Companies around the world are using shipping containers as building materials to create offices , army barracks , dorms and even designer homes .
" [ We ] can make these look like anything you want .
[ We ] can put a pretty dress on any skeleton , " Armstrong said .
" So , if you want it minimalistic , so you can see the container walls , we can do that .
If you want stucco or brick or siding , [ we ] can do that as well . "
While each container has its own roof , when multiple containers are put together side by side , there are gaps between the boxes .
Therefore , a traditional roof is put on top of the entire home , providing additional safety in inclement weather .
" When the boxes are joined together , the gaps are sealed , so even if you lose your roof above , you 'd have some protection , " said Armstrong .
The second roof also provides another benefit .
Hazelton finds she can't even hear the rain hitting her home when it 's pouring outside .
Her house has been almost maintenance free since she moved in .
" The only thing I 've done here is exchanged the hot water heater .
Nothing else I 've had to do in the last five years ... so far , it 's pretty good . "

One of the problems with trying to track the flood of wingnuttery emitted daily by Rush Limbaugh is that there 's so much of it , and it 's so ceaseless , that one becomes overwhelmed trying to keep up with it .
But there 's been a thread in his commentary this past week that 's particularly dangerous , and it needs calling out .
It began on Monday , after the military coup in Honduras .
Limbaugh went on the air and said this :
Limbaugh :
So we 've got hell breaking loose in Honduras .
You know what we learned about Honduras ?
We learned the Obama administration tried to stop the coup .
Now what was -- the coup was what many of you wish would happen here , without the military .
The next day , describing Obama talking to troops about the withdrawal from Iraq , he described the president thus :
" This is a guy who sought their defeat . "
And then yesterday , he expanded on these thoughts even further :
This is Barack Obama , who led from the United States Senate his party into doing everything he could to ensure the defeat of the U.S. military .
...
This party was doing everything it could to impugn and dishonor the military .
This thread of commentary clearly is pushing toward a single thought -- to push people in the armed forces into seeing Obama as a usurper and traitor , just like the Honduran president , and toward the idea that a similar military - based removal of him from office might be justified .
Keep in mind that Limbaugh is only of only four pundits still broadcast daily on Armed Services Radio , so our men and women in uniform are getting fed this garbage on a daily basis .
( And Wes Clark was right :
It is well past time to take him off . )
Limbaugh in fact is picking up on sentiments already circulating on the right .
Larisa Alexandrovna at AtLargely picked up on the chatter going on at various right - wing blogs after Honduras coup , pointing in particular to the Gateway Pundit 's commenters , who posted such items as the following :
We 've seen a steady drumbeat of fearmongering from the right since Obama 's election .
But now we 're treading into truly dangerous , insurrectionary territory .
UPDATE : Today Limbaugh added to the litany in a much more explicit fashion :
Here you can try out some of the more tolerable games I 've crapped out over the years .
All the games featured here are free to play and distribute .
If you 're interested in distributing a game with a magazine or some other publication , just go for it .
But make sure you include all the files as they are offered here .
The games should all run on a Windows - based PC .

Eternal Daughter is an epic platform game that took myself and my friend Jon two years to make and nearly destroyed our immortal souls .
It 's an homage to some of our favorite games from our preteen years , like Super Metroid and Castlevania : SOTN .
Even though the gameplay is familiar , the world , the characters , and the story are all our own .
The game also marks my first teaming up with Swedish music virtuoso , David Saulesco , who produced an original soundtrack for the game .
We 've been happy together ever since .

Hackers and people who write computer viruses are losers .
But we have to say , this is the greatest thing those degenerates have ever hung their hats on .
Thousands of horny morons received lessons in karma after trying to download naked footage of ESPN reporter Erin Andrews only to get a virus instead .
Video of the stunningly beautiful and extremely popular sports reporter nude in her hotel room hit the Internet over this past weekend .
It was taken through the door ’s peephole and shows the 31 - year - old naked , unaware she ’s being filmed .
Taking advantage of sports fans ’ collective fascination with Erin Andrews nude , hackers are posting links that claim to have the tape but really just give you a virus .
Talk about a d!ck move on their part .
Yet you ca n’t help but laugh .
“ Hackers are no slacks when it comes to taking advantage of a hot Internet search trend , ” Graham Cluley of anti-virus company Sophos told USA Today .
Many of the real nude video links were broken after Andrews ’ lawyer and ESPN ’s legal team stepped in , reminding people that Erin Andrews is a victim .
“ While alone in the privacy of her hotel room , Erin Andrews was surreptitiously videotaped without her knowledge or consent , ” her lawyer said .
“ Although the perpetrator or perpetrators of this criminal act have not been identified , when they are identified she intends to bring both civil and criminal charges against them and against anyone who has published the material . ”
Please , do not click on any links in our comments sections claiming to be the Erin Andrews nude video .
We do n’t have , or link to it .
Period .
We will take bogus links down as we come across them , but we do not endorse , nor can we control the miscreant hackers who publish these toxic links .
In the meantime , click to enlarge some beautiful , fully clothed Erin Andrews pictures that will definitely not give you any viruses .

New 30 % tax credit for advanced energy manufacturing industries
[ social_buttons ]
The Department of Energy on Thursday released the details of a new $ 2.3 billion manufacturing tax credit , enacted earlier this year as part of the Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
The tax credit of 30 % is for investment in new renewable energy manufacturing facilities and re-equipped or expanded facilities .
The idea behind the stimulus is to grow the domestic manufacturing industry for clean energy , stimulating economic growth , creating jobs , reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building a long - term strategy for addressing them .
“ These tax credits will help create thousands of high quality manufacturing jobs in some of the highest growth segments of the economy , ” said Energy Secretary Stephen Chu .
“ This is an opportunity to develop our global leadership in clean energy manufacturing and build a secure , sustained base of jobs for America ’s workers , ” added Chu .
Up to $ 2.3 billion in MTCs will be allocated for advanced energy projects , which will support total capital investments of almost $ 7.7 billion in new renewable and advanced energy manufacturing projects using solar , wind , geothermal and other renewable sources .
Other sectors eligible include the manufacturing of energy storage and management technologies , electric vehicles and components , biofuel refineries and carbon capture and sequestration technologies .
New programs expected to create new jobs in clean energy sector
The announcement comes as part of a string of cash infusions from the Obama administration , including the recent announcement of $ 2.4 billion for advanced battery development .
But the monies awarded thus far are still less than a quarter of the $ 40 billion in Recovery Act Funding for clean energy , many of which are weighted to heavily reward job creation in the clean energy sector .
The Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit does not support energy generation projects , but rather the manufacturing facilities that support generation and conservation .
There is a separate program run jointly by the departments of Energy and the Treasury that essentially prepays the tax benefit companies would receive in 2010 for the production tax credit .
Applicants for the MTC will receive tax credits based on the expected commercial viability of their project and the ranking of their project relative to other projects .
Rankings are based on expected job creation , reduction of air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions , technological innovation , and ability to have the project up and running quickly .
“ Once you start seeing more investments made in our economy recovering , as we stabilize and we get people back to work , then I think there ’ll be more interest in expanding , ” Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis recently told The Associated Press .
Industry representatives also welcomed the announcement as a boon for job growth .
“ This program will attract billions of dollars of investment in manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and will create new jobs in states where they are needed most , ” said Rhone Resch , CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association .
“ We expect solar - related provisions in the stimulus bill like this one to create 110,000 jobs in the solar industry in 2009 and 2010 combined . ”
The application period for the MTC opens August 14 , 2009 and closes on September 16 , 2009 .
Further information about the tax credits and how to apply for them can be found at the Department of Energy website .

July 08 CHINA'S President Hu Jintao has abandoned plans to attend a G8 summit in Italy , returning home early to deal with ethnic violence in the north - western region of Xinjiang that has left at least 156 dead in China's .
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on its website that Mr Hu had left for China " due to the situation " in energy - rich Xinjiang , which borders central Asia , where 156 people have been killed , 1080 injured and 1434 arrested in unrest between Han Chinese and Muslim Uighurs since Sunday .
State Councillor Dai Bingguo will attend the G8 summit in Mr Hu's place , the ministry added .
The summit was due to open in the central Italian city of L'Aquila later today and Mr Hu had been scheduled to join the talks tomorrow .
He arrived in Italy on Sunday and has visited Florence .
Urumqi , Xinjiang 's regional capital , woke up today after an overnight curfew that authorities imposed after thousands of Han Chinese stormed through its streets demanding redress and sometimes extracting bloody vengeance for Sunday 's violence .
The city was quiet , except for soldiers shouting in unison as they went about their morning exercises .
Squads of anti-riot police blocked off main streets , while armored personnel carriers cruised back and forth .
Late yesterday , mobs of Han Chinese wielding clubs , metal bars , cleavers and axes had melted away , but many said Sunday 's killings had left a lasting stain of anger .
Li Yufang , a Han who owns a clothes store in Urumqi , said he was still outraged by what had happened over the weekend , and wanted to protest again , although he admitted it was unlikely amid the heavy presence of troops .
" I could n't sleep last night I was so angry , " he said , clutching a club and what appeared to be a carving knife wrapped in a black plastic bag .
" Uighurs are spoiled like pandas .
When they steal , rob , rape or kill , they can get away with it .
If we Han did the same thing , we'd be executed , " Li added , as a friend standing next to him nodded in agreement .
On the other side of Urumqi's now tensely divided neighborhoods , Uighurs protested yesterday , defying rows of anti-riot police and telling reporters that their husbands , brothers and sons had been taken away in indiscriminate arrests .
Xinjiang has long been a tightly controlled hotbed of ethnic tensions , fostered by an economic gap between many Uighurs and Han Chinese , government controls on religion and culture and an influx of Han migrants who now are the majority in most key cities , including Urumqi .
But controlling the torrid anger on both sides of the region 's ethnic divide will now make controlling Xinjiang , with its gas reserves and trade and energy ties to central Asia , all the more testing for the ruling Communist Party .
The government has sought to bridge that divide by blaming the Sunday killings on exiled Uighurs seeking independence for their homeland , especially Rebiya Kadeer , a businesswoman and activist now living in exile in the United States .
Kadeer , writing in the Asian Wall Street Journal yesterday , condemned the violence on both sides , and again denied being the cause of the unrest .
" Years of Chinese repression of Uighurs topped by a confirmation that Chinese officials have no interest in observing the rule of law when Uighurs are concerned is the cause of the current Uighur discontent , " she wrote .
The Communist Party boss of Xinjiang , Wang Lequan , sought to press forward that effort in a speech broadcast on regional TV and handed out as a leaflet to Urumqi residents late yesterday .
" This was a massive conspiracy by hostile forces at home and abroad , and their goal was precisely to sabotage ethnic unity and provoke ethnic antagonism , " said Wang .
" Point the spear toward hostile forces at home and abroad , toward the criminals who took part in attacking , smashing and looting , and by no means point it toward our own ethnic brothers , " he said , referring to Uighurs .

People convicted of video piracy or of selling pornographic videos to children for the last 25 years could challenge their convictions as the 1984 law regulating the video industry was never enacted , it emerged last night .
Police are to be told to stop bringing any prosecutions until the government brings in emergency legislation to re-enact the 1984 Video Recordings Act .
Until they do , people will be able to sell videos – including violent and pornographic ones – to under - 18s without fear of prosecution .
The government admitted yesterday the act was not properly enacted 25 years ago .
Officials in the Home Office had failed to notify the European commission of the existence of the legislation , as they were required to do under an EU directive .
Barbara Follett , minister for culture media and sport , said last night : " Unfortunately , the discovery of this omission means that , a quarter of a century later , the video recordings act is no longer enforceable against individuals in UK courts . "
In a letter to representatives of the video industry , Follett said : " As the then British government did not notify the European commission of the VRA 's classification and labelling requirements , they cannot now be enforced against individuals in UK courts . "
The act was passed when Leon Brittan was Conservative home secretary and then amended under Michael Howard 's period at the Home Office .
Don Foster , the Liberal Democrat culture , media and sport spokesman , said : " The Conservatives ' incompetence when they were in government has made laws designed to prevent video piracy and protect children from harmful DVDs unenforceable and thrown film censorship into chaos .
" This must be a massive embarrassment to the Tories , especially as David Cameron was the special adviser to the home secretary in 1993 when the law was amended . "
A Home Office spokesman said it was likely the error had occurred because the European directive was new at the time the act was passed .
The error went unnoticed when the laws were amended in 1993 and 1994 .
The technicality means the act is unenforceable and urgent action is now under way to notify Europe and re-enact the legislation .
However , the process will take at least three months and is unlikely to be rectified before the New Year .
Meanwhile , no one can be prosecuted under the laws and the Department for Culture , Media and Sport has written to relevant bodies telling them not to pursue prosecutions .
The mistake was discovered only as the culture department was preparing to establish a new video games classification system .
There were 1,659 successful prosecutions under the act between 1995 and 2007 – the only figures available – and lawyers for the department insist those convictions will remain safe .
The department said it had received legal advice that people who had been prosecuted and convicted would be unable to overturn their convictions or seek compensation .
However , it is possible that those who were convicted may mount legal challenges as they were , in effect , prosecuted under an act that should not have been enforced .
Lavinia Carey , director - general of the British Video Association , which represents 90 % of the industry , said : " What a ludicrous situation to find ourselves in after all this time . "
O. C. Marsh was not always an easy man to love .
Yes , he could be quiet , introverted , and thoughtful .
But he could also be sneaky , distrustful , and quarrelsome .
By the 1880s , he would nearly bankrupt himself ( and find himself socially ostracized ) due to his long - running feud with fellow paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope .
But that was later .
The horses came first .
Marsh really had three things going for him .
First , he was bright .
Really , stunningly , bright .
He made intuitive leaps that eluded many of the ' great minds ' of the day .
He had a massive grasp of morphology and a nearly boundless imagination -- and he put them together in a way that few then ( or now ) could match .
Second , he was a workaholic .
Marsh was rarely happy unless he was turning a bone over in his hand or dashing off one of hundreds of articles .
He eventually named 80 species of dinosaurs , knocking off new taxa with the regularity of a scientific machinegun .
Third , he was the nephew of a famously wealthy philanthropist , which is very rarely a bad thing .
At Marsh 's urging , uncle George Peabody founded the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale , ensuring that Yale would be ( and still is ) a center of paleontological research .
Not so coincidentally , Marsh was named to America 's first professorship in paleontology that same year .
In a world full of amateurs , Marsh was a professional .
He had brains , drive , and a steady paycheck .
By 1874 , Marsh had been collecting fossils of horses for several years .
He was far from the first .
A book about American horses had been published in 1848 .
Charles Darwin himself had found the tooth of a fossil horse in Argentina ( not then part of the Appalachian Trail ) back in 1833 while taking part in the famous H.M.S. Beagle expedition .
William Clark ( the Lewis and Clark , Clark ) found fossil horse bones in Kentucky as far back as 1807 and shipped a few to his friend Thomas Jefferson .
What made all these bones so significant at first was the fact that there were no horses in America .
Or at least , there had not been any horses when the Spanish arrived at the end of the 15th century .
Neither Clark ( nor Jefferson ) seemed to notice the import of that fact , but Darwin certainly did .
That there had been horses in the Americas , but those horses had disappeared , was further proof that the collection of animals roaming the continents was not a constant .
This was even more true when it turned out that Darwin 's tooth came not from a modern horse , but from a variety no longer found anywhere in the world .
By Marsh 's time , a number of different types of fossil horses had been collected in the Americas .
What Marsh did next seems simple -- he put them in order .
But while this may sound no more amazing than arranging the ponies on a carousel , one look at the creatures in Marsh 's chart would show that it was n't quite that simple .
At the start of the line was a creature called Hyracotherium ( Marsh knew it as Eohippus ) .
The scientific name alone is enough to suggest how different this critter was from a modern horse .
The name means " hyrax - like beast . "
Like a modern hyrax ( rabbitish beasties found in Africa and the Middle East ) , Hyracotherium was small , about two feet long .
If you were to see one of these animals crossing a field " horse " is not exactly the first idea that would cross your mind .
In addition to the size , one other very distinct difference between this 50 - million - year - old creature and a modern horse was its feet .
Hyracotherium had four toes on each foot .
The large modern horse , Equus , has a single toe ending in a thick hoof .
There are hidden , internal remnants of two other toes still present in a modern horse , but they 've been reduced to tiny spurs of bone located high up on the leg ( I 'm tempted to say " next to the knee , " but I 'm sure one of our more horse - friendly Kossacks can provide the location using the proper fetlock / forelock terminology ) .
Each step in Marsh 's chart of horse ancestors follows the same trend — reduction of toes , increase in size , lengthening of the head , and more complexity of teeth .
First four toes , then tree toes , then a gradual reduction of the other toes as the central toe becomes the hoof we see today .
These feet are mounted on animals the size of dogs , then deer , ponies , and finally the imposing modern horse .
The teeth move from small molars with nearly flat surfaces , to larger , more complex teeth set in long , well , horsey skulls .
All these steps tell the same neat story .
Here are animals making the transition from small forest - dwelling browsers to large wanderers of the open plains that graze on tough grass , animals that depend on speed and strength to deal with predators .
Marsh had produced not a single transitional specimen , but a whole sequence by which species moved through drastic change .
Without all the intermediate stages , even an anatomist as skilled as Marsh might not have recognized the tiny Hyracotherium as even being an related to the modern horse .
But by placing related species on a timeline , Marsh reduced drastic change into a series of easily understood steps .
It was exactly the sort of succession of creatures that you might expect to see resulting from natural selection .
Best of all , it was essentially correct — where it was n't wholly misleading .
The sequence that Marsh produced does reveal major points along the path that horses took in going from tiny forest animal to lord of the plains , but that path was n't taken across a blank sheet of paper .
The species that appear in Marsh 's paper are only a small fraction of the ancient horses that once existed — just a sampling of a variety more vast and wonderful than any A to B to C chart can reveal .
Some ancient horses did n't lose those extra toes .
Instead the toes grew long as the feet adapted to walk over softer ground .
Some developed teeth better suited to nipping leaves off trees than grazing on grass .
During the Miocene period ( from about 23 to about 5 million years ago ) more then a dozen species of horses roamed the Americas .
Rather than a simple line marked by a few species , the horse family was a large , complex " bush " producing diverse creatures , only a few of which looked particularly horsey .

A better look at the evolution of the modern horse would be something like this .
In this chart , those species in Marsh ’s straight - line evolution are shown in bold .
This chart shows some of the diversity that the horse family displayed during the last 50 million years .
It also shows that while all the animals selected by Marsh were indeed relatives of the modern horse , they were not all in the direct path that led from Hyracotherium to Seabiscuit .
What makes it tempting to draw a simple picture of the family tree of horses is the simplicity of the situation we see around us .
Starting around four million years ago , as the world grew cooler and drier , the horse family tree started to … thin out .
Hipparions , very successful and wide - spread grass - eaters similar in size and build to a modern horse , gradually disappeared from Asia , Europe , Africa , and North America .
As ice expanded and contracted around the northern hemisphere , the non-equus horses disappeared and even the members of that surviving genus were greatly reduced .
The last of them held on until around 8,000 years ago .
That ’s when the pony - sized Hippidion ( which recent DNA analysis reveals may actually have been a member of Equus ) vanished from South America .
It ’s also when Equus scotti and all the other North American horses left the stage .
For the next 6,500 years , there would be no horses in America .
The current situation is simple , but it was n't always that way .
Four and a half centuries after the Spanish brought horses back to America , another sort of pony was born in Detroit , Michigan .
In 1964 , Ford Division general manager Lee Iacocca recognized a open space in the automotive ecosystem .
At the time , Ford had successful large sedans , a popular pickup , and a newly introduced compact car , but none of these vehicles was particularly sporty .
The Thunderbird had been released in 1955 , intended as competition for the Chevrolet Corvette .
But despite outselling the Covette by 23 to 1 , Ford executives ( in particular the soon to be Secretary of Defense , Robert McNamara ) worried that the two - seater roadster had a limited market .
By 1964 the Thunderbird had two more seats , a thousand pounds more bulk , and an upscale price tag as a “ personal luxury vehicle . ”
It was a sales success , but it was n’t exactly a sports car .
Ford introduced a new vehicle .
Just as the bones of Equus reveal a relationship to earlier creatures , the Ford Mustang ’s ancestors were not hard to see .
The chassis , suspension , and drivetrain components came from parts used in the Ford Falcon and Fairlane .
It was n’t very fast .
It was n’t very sporty .
It really was n’t much of a radical departure from other Ford ’s already on the market .
However , it was attractive and it was cheap .
Competitors dismissed the little Ford as a “ secretary ’s car , ” but there were a lot of secretaries — and a lot of non-secretaries who liked the idea of a fun , inexpensive auto .
In the world guided by a different form of selection — consumer selection — the Mustang fit a big , empty niche .
Ford ’s marketing department had forcast sales of 100,000 units during the Mustang ’s first year , but the factories were soon working overtime as the Mustang flew off the lots .
A million were sold in the first 18 months .
As with the ancient horses of the Americas , it ’s tempting to group the Mustang into a neat sequence of models .
After the original model came the Mustang II ( which appeared very late in the Preoilcrisian epoch of the Interstatian Age ) , then the “ Fox ” platform of the 80s , The edgier design of the 90s , and the slightly “ retro ” model in showrooms since 2005 .
But just as with the flesh and blood mustangs , the picture is n’t that simple .
Ford ’s Mustang showed an ability to kick off new “ species ” and “ subspecies ” that would be the envy of the natural world .
By 1968 , there were nine different base models of Mustang .
Coupes , convertibles , and fastbacks were manufactured with a bewildering array of engines , transmissions , and extras .
Over a period of just three years , thirteen different engines were available .
And that ’s not even counting the many semi-official models being cranked out by racing houses that modified the Mustang into more powerful machines .
Something else began happening to Ford Mustangs , something that had also happened to those other mustangs — over time they got bigger and heavier .
Each revision of the car from 1965 to 1973 brought on a meatier and more expensive beast .
This kind of growth is a path that ’s common to both animals and to cars .
The Honda Civics of the natural and automotive world move from tiny econoboxes to more substantial forms , leaving room for the next round of little Fits to take their place .
It ’s not a particularly poor strategy — so long as your ecology stays healthy .
As the Mustang was growing larger , it was also growing competitors .
The success of the Mustang brought on a whole generation of “ pony cars . ”
Most of these were larger and more powerful than the original Mustang as the manufacturers fought to win the consumer selection derby through providing more room and power .
By 1973 , there were Camaros , Javelins , Firebirds and Cougars all scrambling for the same “ ecological niche ” as the Mustang — just as many other forms of horse ( and other grazers ) had challenged Equus on the plains .
And just as challenges starting in the Pliocene whittled away at the horse ranks , a disaster was on the way that would soon reshape the pony car competition .
On October 17 , 1973 , the members of Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries announced an embargo against western countries .
The price of oil tripled almost overnight .
Within a few years , it would triple again .
For the pony cars , the years of easy growth had ended .
The verdant fields of buyers dried up .
An automotive ice age had arrived .
Many of these models disappeared .
Some of them were replaced by other vehicles of the same name at a later time .
Others were gone for good .
But Mustangs lived on .
In fact , the Ford Mustang has been in continuous production since 1964 .
What made the Mustang the automotive equivalent of Equus ?
It was a combination of good planning and coincidence .
Oil prices had been rising for several years before the 1973 embargo .
Not sharply , but enough so that Iacocca and other executives at Ford were starting to be concerned about the Mustang ’s growing size , power , and thirst .
In addition , they were being nudged from another direction .
Fans of the original 1965 Mustang wrote to Ford complaining that by the early 70 ’s the car had lost the cheap , fun appeal of the original .
It had become a boy racer ’s car rather than a secretary ’s car , and out there in the ecosystem of auto buyers , boy racers were just not that common .
Ford went to work , trimming down the Mustang and designing a new car based on the Pinto subcompact .
That new car , the Mustang II , premiered just weeks before the oil embargo .
The new car was smaller , it was cheaper , and it was also designed to be far more reliable , as well as offer a fit and finish that was well ahead of most American cars at any price .
It ’s become fashionable these days to dismiss the Mustang II .
In fact , it ’s often treated as a model best forgotten , not a “ real Mustang ” at all .
With a 4 - cylinder engine in the base model , the new Mustang was spurned by the audience that had come to love it ’s larger and more powerful predecessor .
But it got much better mileage than its competitors .
It ’s smaller size and reduced power made it a loser in a straight line duel with anything faster than a economy car .
But its reliability and good value for the money positioned it to compete with the flood of import cars that moved into the market as oil prices rose .
Those who dismiss the car today forget that in 1974 , the Mustang II — the multiple award winning , Car of the Year , Mustang II , the Mustang II that outsold the previous model in the face of an auto market as shaky as any seen until 2009 — was one of Detroit ’s few bright spots .
The Mustang survived .
And by surviving through that tight spot , it went on to spawn new variants and expand into new niches .
It got the secretaries , and the boy racers ( and the girl racers , as my friend Laurell , who recently bought one of the Mustang ’s more potent subspecies , will attest ) .
Both the Ford Mustang and the mustang mustang , are American originals .
They have spread around the world , but they started here .
Both started from simple beginning , spawned dozens of variations , and were pared back by calamities .
Both have proven tough enough to take on a changing world .
Finally both are also examples of one of those great rules of selection — luck counts .
Equus did n’t lift a hoof to the wind , sense the coming ice age , and decide it was time to leave the forest for the plains .
It was already well adapted for the world that was coming .
Ford did n’t launch it ’s drive for a post - cheap oil Mustang in the wake of the crisis .
The new car was already on the market when the gas lines appeared .
Timing may not be everything , but whether it's the importance of a scientific paper or plain old survival , it means a lot .
As we look ahead and see challenges on the horizon -- including the looming threat of climate change -- we have to remember that the survivors are not those species that learn to swim after the flood arrives .
You need to be lucky , or smart , enough to take steps in advance .
Otherwise you 'll be a Hipparion or an AMC Javelin .
Note : this diary is a trimmed down chapter ( yes , I did say trimmed down ) from an unfinished manuscript titled " The Evolution of Everything . "
If you hate it , let me know now so I can save myself another 400 pages of writing -- and save you from reading more such chapters on upcoming Sundays .
This diary is also intended to kick off a series of diaries for DK GreenRoots -- the rest of which are sure to be both more topical and shorter .

M74 : The Herschel telescope is tuned to see the dust in the galaxy
More details
Europe 's Herschel space observatory is set to become one of the most powerful tools ever to study the Universe .
The " first light " data from its three instruments demonstrates a remarkable capability even though their set - up is still not complete .
Galaxy images released on Friday by the European Space Agency show detail previously unseen in the objects .
The pictures - and the thousands that will follow - should give new insights on star formation and galaxy evolution .
" We have some excellent images ; they 're not calibrated , but they look spectacular , " said Dr Göran Pilbratt , Esa 's Herschel project scientist .
" They tell you we are working ; it 's just fantastic , " he told BBC News .
Different view Herschel is sensitive to light at long wavelengths - in the far - infrared and sub-millimetre range ( 55 to 672 microns ) .
Observations at these longer wavelengths do not produce the " pretty pictures " obtained at shorter wavelengths , such as the visible light detected by the famous Hubble telescope .
M66 : SPIRE has not yet been properly calibrated
More details
What they can do , however , is see features in celestial objects that are invisible to Hubble ; and with Herschel 's giant 3.5 m mirror , the detail becomes extremely rich .
Friday 's release includes the first two galaxy observations using the European telescope 's SPIRE ( Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver ) instrument .
SPIRE has pictured M74 ( also known as NGC 628 ) , a face - on spiral galaxy located about 24 million light - years from Earth in the constellation Pisces ; and M66 ( also known as NGC 3627 ) , a barred spiral galaxy located about 36 million light - years away in the constellation Leo .
What Herschel sees in these objects is not their stars but the dusty clouds of gas that give rise to stars .
SPIRE 's view of M74 at progressively shorter wavelengths ( from left to right )
The shortest wavelengths will always produce the sharpest images A range of wavelengths are needed to see all the features of a galaxy
" We 're seeing the hidden life of the galaxy that never shows up in visible light images , " explained Professor Matt Griffin , the principal investigator on the UK - led SPIRE consortium .
" We see the dust which is a tracer for all the gas and dust which are the raw materials from which star formation occurs .
These are fairly normal galaxies where star formation is going on in a continuous cycle ; and the red [ freckles ] you see in the images are very distant galaxies , probably undergoing intense bursts of star formation . "
The design keeps Herschel 's critical detectors in an ultra-cold state
More details
The Cardiff University researcher added : " This really was take off the blindfold , point and shoot , and see what we see .
These were the very first observations ; and there is a long way to go in terms of the way we set up the instrument , do the image processing and the map making .
But it 's incredible . "
Also in the release are new images from Herschel 's Photoconductor Array Camera and Spectrometer ( PACS ) ; and data from its Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared ( HIFI ) .
PACS , which produced the very first Herschel image last month , has been used to look at a well - known planetary nebula - the Cat's Eye Nebula .
The object has nothing to do with planets but is in fact an ageing star surrounded by a shell of ejected material .
The new PACS images illustrate the complex structure of the shell .
HIFI has a fine ability to detect the presence of particular chemical species in gas clouds that are birthing new stars .
In a test observation of a star - forming region known as DR21 in the constellation Cygnus , the instrument could pick out charged carbon , carbon monoxide , and water .
Hubble 's image of the Cat's Eye ( 1 ) at visible wavelengths is a classic But Herschel is now able to see this object in a completely new way The PACS instrument can home in on specific chemical signatures Oxygen ( 2 ) and nitrogen ( 3 ) distribution reveal the nebula 's 3D structure
Why do these chemical species not spread evenly ( 4 ) through the nebula ?
Scientists expect Herschel to be able to address many such questions
Herschel was despatched into space along with Esa 's Planck telescope on 14 May .
Over the course of the past two months , both astronomical satellites have been moving to observation positions some 1.5 million km from Earth , on its " night side " .
The long journey has been used by engineers to switch on and check out all of the telescopes ' systems .
This past week , a major review of the observatories ' status was held in Darmstadt , Germany .
The meeting marked the formal handover of the facilities from the industrial manufacturers - a pan-European industrial consortium led by Thales Alenia Space .
" We 're now going to start to tune the instruments for maximum performance , " explained Dr Pilbratt .
" We 're going to try them out in many different observing situations in order to learn how to get the best out of them . "
This verification period will then be followed by a six - week demonstration phase in which the operations team hope to show the world the full power of a perfectly prepared , fully mature Herschel space observatory .
Routine operations should begin towards the end of the year .
Herschel is expected to continue working through to 2013 , by which time the super - fluid helium that keeps its instruments and detectors in the necessary ultra -cold state to make observations will have boiled off .

( OrganicJar ) A new study suggests that older adults who eat diets rich in citrus fruits , leafy greens and fish oil , but low in glycemic index have a lower risk of age - related macular degeneration , the leading cause of vision loss among older U.S. adults .
AMD , also known as age - related macular degeneration refers to gradual damage to the macula , a structure in the retina that allows for seeing fine detail .
The condition affects more than 1 million Americans , usually after the age of 65 .
A number of studies have suggested that individual nutrients , including the antioxidants lutein , vitamin C and vitamin E , can help protect against AMD .
This latest study , published in the journal Ophthalmology , looked at the overall diet patterns of 4,000 older adults and the links to AMD risk .
Foods To Eat : Researchers found that participants who tended to eat fish like salmon and mackerel that are rich in omega - 3 fatty acids , or foods high in vitamin C , vitamin E , zinc , lutein and zeaxanthin , had a relatively lower risk of AMD .
Lutein and zeaxanthin are plant pigments that act as antioxidants ; the nutrients are found in broccoli , spinach and other leafy green vegetables , as well as egg yolks .

With Oregon passing a hemp bill ( SB 676 ) last Monday permitting production and possession of industrial hemp in their state , farmers and eco-designers alike are probably freaking out from all the possibilities at hand .
The move is part of a rapidly growing nationwide trend to liberalize laws relating to marijuana .
Hemp is a botanical cousin of marijuana .
Bill sponsor , Senator Floyd Prozanski was quoted by Vote Hemp saying “ By passing SB 676 with strong bi-partisan support , the Oregon legislature has taken a proactive position to allow its farmers the right to grow industrial hemp , to provide American manufacturers with domestically - grown hemp , and to profit from the effort . ”
Until now , only five other states – Maine , Hawaii , Kentucky , Maryland , Montana and West Virginia – have legalized hemp production , making it hard for eco -designers to get hemp fibers for clothing at a reasonable price ( not to mention being able to support an American grown textile ) .
Hemp is one of the most useful fibers known to man with over 25,000 uses from creating clothing to car manufacturing .
( It ’s too bad hemp production is banned in most place largely thanks to misunderstanding and outright myth .)
The fibers themselves are stronger , more absorbent and more mildew - resistant than cotton and can block the sun ’s UV rays more effectively than other fabrics .
It can also be made into a variety of fabrics including a linen quality .

Advertisement Pope Benedict XVI has offered his support for the Palestinians ' right to a homeland as he continues his Middle East tour in the West Bank .
Speaking in a Bethlehem refugee camp , he said he understood frustrations that their " legitimate aspirations " for a Palestinian state were unfulfilled .
Standing beside him , Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas called on Israel to embrace peace .
Earlier , the pontiff said he prayed for a lifting of Israel 's embargo on Gaza .
The BBC's Tim Franks said that the Pope used the stark backdrop of a Palestinian refugee camp to deliver one of his strongest expressions of support for the Palestinians .
Standing in the shadow of Israel 's separation wall in the Aida refugee camp , which houses refugees from Israel 's creation in 1948 , the Pope called the barrier a symbol of " stalemate " between Israel and the Palestinians .
David Willey , BBC News , Bethlehem
It 's Christmas all over again in Bethlehem this fine May day .
O Come All Ye Faithful and Gloria In Excelsis rang out over Manger Square as Pope Benedict celebrated mass for an enthusiastic congregation of several thousand Palestinian Christians and Catholic Pilgrims from as far away as Vietnam .
They protected themselves from the fierce sun with yellow and white baseball hats - the colours of the Vatican flag , handed out by attendants - and they waved Palestinian flags .
The atmosphere was festive despite the heavy security and checkpoints set up along all roads leading to the town where Jesus Christ was born .
Business went on as usual in the nearby cafes and souvenir shops while Pope Benedict , clothed in gold vestments , preached about the injustices suffered by the Palestinians in general and Gazans in particular as a result of the continuing conflict with Israel .
His audience applauded wildly as he referred to the tiny knot of Catholic pilgrims from Gaza who had been allowed to travel to Bethlehem .
In pictures : Pope in Bethlehem Christian couple 's divided life Mixed emotions in Bethlehem " In a world where more and more borders are being opened up - to trade , to travel , to movement of peoples , to cultural exchanges - it is tragic to see walls still being erected , " he said .
He told the refugees that his heart went out to families divided by detention and restrictions on freedom of movement , a reference to Israeli military control of the West Bank .
" It is understandable that you often feel frustrated .
Your legitimate aspirations for permanent homes , for an independent Palestinian state , remain unfulfilled . "
He added : " Although walls can be easily built , we all know that they do not last forever .
They can be taken down .
First , though , it is necessary to remove the walls that we build around our hearts . "
Mr Abbas said Israel 's security could only be attained through peace .
" In front of Your Holiness I address a message of peace to our Israeli neighbours , " he said .
" And I call upon them to renounce occupation , settlements , arrests , and humiliations . "
The BBC's David Willey in Bethlehem says that , on his journey from Jerusalem , the Pope saw for himself for the first time the barrier that the Israelis have erected in the West Bank .
Israel says it is to prevent attacks by militants , but Palestinians say it is to seize occupied land .
Speaking at a news conference at Mr Abbas 's residence , the head of the Roman Catholic Church expressed support for a Palestinian state .
" The Holy See supports the right of your people to a sovereign Palestinian homeland in the land of your forefathers , secure and at peace with its neighbours , within internationally recognised borders , " he said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Whether or not one likes him , or the policies he espouses , he is the head of a massive organization that represents some kind of stability .
I hope and pray he can do something positive Chad , Minneapolis , USA The Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has so far refused to endorse the idea of the creation of a Palestinian state .
The Pope said Palestinians should " resist temptations to resort to acts of violence " .
He later held an open - air Mass and a homily in Manger Square in front of the Church of the Nativity .
The Pope said his heart went out to those caught up in the conflict in Gaza , adding that he was praying for an end to the embargo on the territory .
One of the aims of the pontiff 's visit is to preserve a diminishing Christian presence in the Holy Land .

The issues Although the Christian population of Bethlehem has decreased dramatically in recent years through emigration , the Pope was given an enthusiastic welcome , our correspondent says .
A tiny group of Catholics from Gaza was present , after receiving special permits from the Israeli authorities to travel to the West Bank .
Pope Benedict is due to have a further meeting with Mr Abbas before his departure .
On Tuesday , the Pope visited sites in Jerusalem holy to Muslims , Jews and Christians .
He went first to the Dome of the Rock , the first pontiff to do so .
It is located on the Temple Mount - a site sacred to all three monotheistic religions , and met the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , Mohammed Mohammad Hussein .
Then the Pope followed Jewish tradition at the Western Wall , inserting a written prayer in the cracks between the 2,000 - year - old stones .

In other words , this is the first point that the reader notes when the document is adopted .
Students are often required to work on a specific topic .
Thus , the majority may think that the number of problems is smaller than it can be .
However , it may be difficult to create a good thesis , as well as a topic that will belong to you
It is sometimes easier to find some websites that provide a complete list of interesting ideas on the subject than for conjections .
Select an interesting and non-repeatable topic for the investigation .
You can get the top mark for your paper only if the interesting topic you are interested in is interesting to you as a researcher , and now is original .

Welcome to the first installment on the RL blog , of a mini series – “ How do I learn and master Sinatra ? ” – by top Rubyists using Sinatra .
The interview series will provide insight and commentary from these notable Sinatra developers , with the goal of facilitating and providing answers to the questions Ruby beginners face on how to learn and master Sinatra .
Satish >>
Corey Donohoe , could you tell us something about yourself – your background , where you are based ?
Corey Donohoe >>
I ’m Corey Donohoe .
I ’m based out of Boulder , Colorado – USA .
My background is in computer science and system administration though I prefer hacking to either of those labels .
I ’m a pretty normal dude , I enjoy cycling , music , coffee , micro brews , and all the other awesomeness that my home state has to offer .
I ’ve been working for Engine Yard since March of ’07 doing everything from app support to internal development .
I ’m currently 1⁄ 2 of our internal integrations team .
Sinatra ’s greatest strength is its flexibility
Satish >>
Are there any pre-requisites for a person to start learning Sinatra
Corey >>
There are n’t any hardcore prerequisites per se ; Ruby and experience in a Ruby web framework is a plus .
HTTP verbs play a huge role in Sinatra , as well as things like query and post params .
If you get those concepts you can hit the ground running .
Satish >>
How should one start learning Sinatra ?
Corey >> Learn Sinatra incrementally .
If you have new business requirements try to think about things like “ how would i implement this in Sinatra ? ”
Take the time to figure that requirement out in Sinatra then throw the solution out !
When the time comes to use Sinatra for something you ’ll have a much more broad understanding of the framework and you ’ll hit fewer blockers .
Satish >>
Which area of Sinatra should a beginner pay particular attention to ?
Corey >>
Understanding the difference between Sinatra : : Base and Sinatra : : Default is definitely something a Sinatra beginner should focus on early .
Sinatra : : Base is for writing Rack middleware , and Sinatra : : Default is normally for writing Rack applications .
Learning the modular style app development is really useful as well as using the register method to include pieces of functionality .
Getting a handle on those concepts will expose you to the rest of Sinatra , which is relatively intuitive .
Satish >>
Is the official documentation on Sinatra good enough for a beginner ?
Are there areas which need improvement or need to be re-written
Corey >>
The Sinatra documentation is well done and I can generally find answers to my questions just by referencing the docs .
There ’s always #sinatra on freenode or the Sinatra book on github if you need additional help too .
There ’s plenty of pretty well tested examples on github using Sinatra , hancock and integrity come to mind .
Satish >>
Sequel , DataMapper , ActiveRecord – which one would you recommend to use with Sinatra and why ?
Corey >>
I use DataMapper exclusively .
It was a bumpy ride a year ago but these days it ’s acceptable for production use .
We interface with more than just relational databases and the ability to keep a consistent model syntax across various data sources is really attractive to us .
Realistically I feel like I spend less time fighting my framework when I ’m using DataMapper so it ’s the clear choice .
The one place I would n’t use dm in would be a join heavy relational environment ; ActiveRecord is way better at that .
Satish >>
Is an understanding of Rack important while learning Sinatra ?
Why ?
Which area of Rack should one be really comfortable with ?
Corey >>
You do n’t need a solid understanding of Rack to get a Sinatra up and running , but you ’ll be missing out on a lot of the power .
It ’s extremely beneficial to take the time to learn how the Rack : : Builder works as well as the usage of the use / map / run commands in that context .
The modularity of Rack really becomes apparent and you ’ll find yourself using Sinatra more effectively .
Satish >>
How should one hone one ’s skills in Sinatra ?
Corey >>
Read code , write test code , write code .
All of the awesome testing frameworks available for Ruby are available to Sinatra .
If you do n’t write tests it might be a good way to familiarize yourself with testing best practices without the overheard of a larger framework .
Satish >>
What type of projects should a beginner work on to gain more expertise in Sinatra ?
Corey >>
A beginner would benefit from writing something completely API driven as a first project .
So many people couple databases with dynamic web applications but it ’s kind of liberating to just be an intermediary service .
Twitter apps are pretty trivial to implement and can teach you a lot .
They also expose you to a pretty large userbase to solicit feedback .
Satish >>
Could you suggest some web services that a Sinatra beginner could develop himself / herself ?
Corey >>
Web services are great targets for introducing Sinatra into your workplace .
Identify a pain point in your organization and put a small app in front of it .
It does n’t have to replace something overnight but it ’s a great way to sneak functionality in at work .
Once you have a few of these built you start to reap the benefits of microapps and web services .
Satish >>
Anything else you would like to add ?
Corey >>
Learning Sinatra is the best thing you can do while we all wait for Rails 3 to land .
The middleware you write will be able to be dropped right into your Rails 3 applications so it ’s not like you ’re wasting time .
We ’re starting to build really modular systems using Sinatra by building APIs into those systems .
I think a lot of people would benefit from breaking their monolith apps down into microapps and Sinatra is a great way to do it .
People looking for a template might want to investigate the singem gem .
It has basic templates for twitter apps or regular webservices .
All of them are bootstrapped for testing with cucumber +rspec .
Thank you Corey .
In case you have any queries and / or questions , kindly post your questions here ( as comments to this blog post ) and Corey would be glad to answer .

I have been writing about it for years .
But it 's only now , when I 'm caught in the middle of it , that the full force of this injustice hits me .
Like everyone else here I feel powerless , unstrung as I watch disaster unfolding in slow motion .
I live in the last small corner of Gaul still holding out against the Romans .
In other words , a small market town ( Machynlleth , in mid-Wales ) which has yet to be conquered by the superstores .
No one expects us to hold out for much longer .
Last month Tesco submitted an application to subjugate us .
It wants to build a store of 27,000 square feet on the edge of the town centre .
This is twice the size of all our grocery stores put together , and bigger than our tiny settlement – 2,100 souls – can support .
Tesco will prosper here only if other shops close and customers come from miles away .
More than 300 people – roughly one fifth of the adult population – have sent letters of objection .
The case against the store and the strength of local feeling is so strong here that if we can't beat Tesco , no one can .
But , being deficient in magic potion , we have precious little chance of stopping it .
This town 's tragedy has been precisely foretold .
In 1998 , the government commissioned a study of the impact of big stores on market towns .
It found that when a large supermarket is built on the edge of the centre , other food shops lose between 13 % and 50 % of their trade .
The result is " the closure of some town centre food retailers ; increases in vacancy levels ; and a general decline in the quality of the environment of the centre " .
Towns are hit especially hard where supermarkets " are disproportionately large compared with the size of the centre " .
In these cases the superstore becomes the new town centre , leaving the high street to shrivel .
If this monster is built , everything that is special and precious and distinctive about this town – the quirky shops , the UK 's oldest farmers ' market , the busy community – falls under its shadow .
Tesco will suck the marrow out of us .
The prospects for small shops were dim enough during the boom .
As the supermarkets closed in , independent stores in the United Kingdom shut at the rate of 2,000 a year between 1997 and 2004 .
Now they 're in much bigger trouble .
A report by the Local Data Company at the end of July suggested that 12,000 independent shops have already closed in England and Wales this year .
Tesco , by contrast , has been mopping up .
In April , for the first time , its turnover exceeded £ 1bn a week .
But in seeking to oppose its application , we find ourselves fighting bound and gagged .
Tesco launched its campaign with an exhibition and " consultation " which seemed to me to be wildly biased in favour of the development .
I asked its PR man whether the consultation would be independently audited .
The answer was no .
Tesco announced that the great majority of residents were in favour of the store .
A door - to - door survey by local people discovered the opposite , but I think you can guess which study made the headlines .
We waited , but we had no idea when Tesco would submit its application .
Like all developers , it is not obliged to give prior notice .
It submitted its plans to the county council on 24 June .
The council did n't release them until 14 July .
From Tesco's point of view , the timing was perfect .
This was the week in which the county 's schools broke up and many of its opponents were setting off on their summer holidays .
We had until 31 July to register our objections ( we lost four days due to council fumbling ) .
People are now returning from their holidays to discover that it 's too late to object .
To compound the unfairness , there is no legal requirement for the developer to ensure that the claims it makes are accurate .
Tesco 's planning application is riddled with questionable statements .
It maintains that the new store " will provide a minimum of 140 additional full and part - time jobs " .
However , the superstore 's own research shows that every large outlet causes the net loss of 276 jobs .
That 's hardly surprising : independent shops employ five times as many people per unit of turnover ( all sources are on my website ) .
Tesco maintains that it will buy local produce " wherever possible " .
But when its representatives were challenged on this point , they said that local suppliers would have to sell their produce to the company as a whole .
It would be trucked to the nearest distribution centre – now 120 miles away in Avonmouth – and then trucked back across Wales to Machynlleth .
Incredibly , Tesco proposes that its new store will reduce traffic on our congested roads .
It appears to be relying on a radical misinterpretation of the evidence .
But the real issue is this : if the county council turns it down , Tesco can appeal .
The cost to the council would be astronomical .
As John Sweeney , leader of North Norfolk district council observed , Tesco " are too big and powerful for us .
If we try and deny them they will appeal , and we cannot afford to fight a planning appeal and lose .
If they got costs it would bankrupt us . "
Hardly any local authority is prepared to take this risk .
Tesco can keep appealing and resubmitting , using its vast funds until it gets what it wants .
Objectors , by contrast , have no right of appeal .
The inequality of arms means that we scarcely stand a chance .
Once the store is built , we will quickly be deprived of choice .
As the first wave of customers peels off and the income of the independent stores declines , the quality and range of their produce falls , driving more people into Tesco 's arms .
From that point on , the collapse becomes unstoppable .
The question that occurs to me is this : why should people who do n't live here be making this decision ?
Why do the planning laws not permit us to hold a referendum ?
I understand why decisions about essential services should not be made by the community alone .
I know that rich villages try to shut out social housing and that local people campaign against hostels for the homeless and mental health units .
But in this case we are not talking about essential services .
We are talking – or so we are told – about choice .
You can already buy all the food you need in this town , including ( from the market stalls ) produce that is much cheaper than the superstores sell .
By voting against Tesco we would not be depriving anyone of the means of subsistence .
So why should we hand this decision to a remote , frightened county council ?
The choice should be ours and ours alone , and it should be final .
If planning worked like this , I 'm sure that Britain would be a very different country , in which independent shops still thrived and communities still deserved the name .
This might look like a battle over diversity and local character .
Underneath it is a struggle for democracy .
The Anti-Empire Report
What is there about the Iranian election of June 12 that has led to it being one of the leading stories in media around the world every day since ?
Elections whose results are seriously challenged have taken place in most countries at one time or another in recent decades .
Countless Americans believe that the presidential elections of 2000 and 2004 were stolen by the Republicans , and not just inside the voting machines and in the counting process , but prior to the actual voting as well with numerous Republican Party dirty tricks designed to keep poor and black voters off voting lists or away from polling stations .
The fact that large numbers of Americans did not take to the streets day after day in protest , as in Iran , is not something we can be proud of .
Perhaps if the CIA , the Agency for International Development ( AID ) , several US government - run radio stations , and various other organizations supported by the National Endowment for Democracy ( which was created to serve as a front for the CIA , literally ) had been active in the United States , as they have been for years in Iran , major street protests would have taken place in the United States .
The classic “ outside agitators ” can not only foment dissent through propaganda , adding to already existing dissent , but they can serve to mobilize the public to strongly demonstrate against the government .
In 1953 , when the CIA overthrew Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh , they paid people to agitate in front of Mossadegh ’s residence and elsewhere and engage in acts of violence ; some pretended to be supporters of Mossadegh while engaging in anti-religious actions .
And it worked , remarkably well .
Since the end of World War II , the United States has seriously intervened in some 30 elections around the world , adding a new twist this time , twittering .
The State Department asked Twitter to postpone a scheduled maintenance shutdown of its service to keep information flowing from inside Iran , helping to mobilize protesters .
The New York Times reported : “ An article published by the Web site True / Slant highlighted some of the biggest errors on Twitter that were quickly repeated and amplified by bloggers : that three million protested in Tehran last weekend ( more like a few hundred thousand ) ; that the opposition candidate Mir Hussein Mousavi was under house arrest ( he was being watched ) ; that the president of the election monitoring committee declared the election invalid last Saturday ( not so ) . ”
In recent years , the United States has been patrolling the waters surrounding Iran with warships , halting Iranian ships to check for arms shipments to Hamas or for other illegal reasons , financing and “ educating ” Iranian dissidents , using Iranian groups to carry out terrorist attacks inside Iran , kidnaping Iranian diplomats in Iraq , kidnaping Iranian military personnel in Iran and taking them to Iraq , continually spying and recruiting within Iran , manipulating Iran ’s currency and international financial transactions , and imposing various economic and political sanctions against the country .
“ I ’ve made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran , and is not at all interfering in Iran ’s affairs , ” said US President Barack Obama with a straight face on June 23 .
Some in the Iranian government [ have been ] accusing the United States and others outside of Iran of instigating protests over the elections .
These accusations are patently false and absurd .
“ Never believe anything until it ’s officially denied , ” British writer Claud Cockburn famously said .
In his world - prominent speech to the Middle East on June 4 , Obama mentioned that “ In the middle of the Cold War , the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government . ”
So we have the president of the United States admitting to a previous overthrow of the Iranian government while the United States is in the very midst of trying to overthrow the current Iranian government .
This will serve as the best example of hypocrisy that ’s come along in quite a while .
So why the big international fuss over the Iranian election and street protests ?
There ’s only one answer .
The obvious one .
The announced winner , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is a Washington ODE , an Officially Designated Enemy , for not sufficiently respecting the Empire and its Israeli partner - in - crime ; indeed , Ahmadinejad is one of the most outspoken critics of US foreign policy in the world .
So ingrained is this ODE response built into Washington ’s world view that it appears to matter not at all that Mousavi , Ahmadinejad ’s main opponent in the election and very much supported by the protesters , while prime minister 1981 - 89 , bore large responsibility for the attacks on the US embassy and military barracks in Beirut in 1983 , which took the lives of more than 200 Americans , and the 1988 truck bombing of a US Navy installation in Naples , Italy , that killed five persons .
Remarkably , a search of US newspaper and broadcast sources shows no mention of this during the current protests .
However , the Washington Post saw fit to run a story on June 27 that declared : “ the authoritarian governments of China , Cuba and Burma have been selectively censoring the news this month of Iranian crowds braving government militias on the streets of Tehran to demand democratic reforms . ”
Can it be that no one in the Obama administration knows of Mousavi ’s background ?
And do none of them know about the violent government repression on June 5 in Peru of the peaceful protests organized in response to the US - Peru Free Trade Agreement ?
A massacre that took the lives of between 20 and 25 indigenous people in the Amazon and wounded another 100 .
The Obama administration was silent on the Peruvian massacre because the Peruvian president , Alan Garcia , is not an ODE .
And neither is Mousavi , despite his anti-American terrorist deeds , because he ’s opposed to Ahmadinejad , who competes with Hugo Chavez to be Washington ’s Number One ODE .
Time magazine calls Mousavi a “ moderate , ” and goes on to add : “ It has to be assumed that the Iranian presidential election was rigged , ” offering as much evidence as the Iranian protestors , i.e. , none at all .
It cannot of course be proven that the Iranian election was totally honest , but the arguments given to support the charge of fraud are not very impressive , such as the much - repeated fact that the results were announced very soon after the polls closed .
For decades in various countries election results have been condemned for being withheld for many hours or days .
Some kind of dishonesty must be going on behind the scenes during the long delay it was argued .
So now we ’re asked to believe that some kind of dishonesty must be going on because the results were released so quickly .
It should be noted that the ballots listed only one electoral contest , with but four candidates .
Phil Wilayto , American peace activist and author of a book on Iran , has observed :
Ahmadinejad , himself born into rural poverty , clearly has the support of the poorer classes , especially in the countryside , where nearly half the population lives .
Why ?
In part because he pays attention to them , makes sure they receive some benefits from the government and treats them and their religious views and traditions with respect .
Mousavi , on the other hand , the son of an urban merchant , clearly appeals more to the urban middle classes , especially the college - educated youth .
This being so , why would anyone be surprised that Ahmadinejad carried the vote by a clear majority ?
Are there now more yuppies in Iran than poor people ?
All of which is of course not to say that Iran is not a relatively repressive society on social and religious issues , and it ’s this underlying reality which likely feeds much of the protest ; indeed , many of the protesters may not even have strong views about the election per se , particularly since both Ahmadinejad and Mousavi are members of the establishment , neither is any threat to the Islamic theocracy , and the election can be seen as the kind of power struggle you find in virtually every country .
But that is not the issue I ’m concerned with here .
The issue is Washington ’s long - standing goal of regime change .
If the exact same electoral outcome had taken place in a country that is an ally of the United States , how much of all the accusatory news coverage and speeches would have taken place ?
In fact , the exact same thing did happen in a country that is an ally of the United States , three years ago when Felipe Calderon appeared to have stolen the presidential election in Mexico and there were daily large protests for more than two months ; but the American and international condemnation was virtually non-existent compared to what we see today in regard to Iran .
Iranian leaders undertook a recount of a random ten per cent of ballots and recertified Ahmadinejad as the winner .
How honest the recount was I have no idea , but it ’s more than Americans got in 2000 and 2004 .
By what standard shall we judge Barack Obama ?
Many of my readers have been upset with me for my criticisms of President Obama ’s policies .
Following my last two reports , more than a dozen have asked to be removed from my mailing list .
But if you share my view that the numerous atrocities US foreign policy is responsible for constitute the greatest threat to world peace , prosperity and happiness , then I think you have to want leaders who are unambiguously opposed to America ’s military adventures , because those interventions are unambiguously harmful .
There ’s nothing good to be said about dropping powerful bombs on crowds of innocent people , invading their land , overthrowing their government , occupying the country , breaking down the doors of the citizens , killing the father , raping the mother , traumatizing the children , torturing those opposed to all this … Barack Obama has no problem with this , if we judge him by his policies and not his rhetoric .
And neither does Al Franken , who ’s about to become a Democratic Senator from Minnesota .
The former Saturday Night Live comedian would like you to believe that he ’s been against the war in Iraq since it began , but he ’s gone to Iraq four times to entertain the troops .
Does that make sense ?
Why does the military bring entertainers to soldiers ?
To lift the soldiers ’ spirits .
Why does the military want to lift the soldiers ’ spirits ?
A happier soldier does his job better .
And what ’s the soldier ’s job ?
All the charming things listed above .
Does n’t Franken know what these guys do ?
He criticized the Bush administration because they “ failed to send enough troops to do the job right . ”
What “ job ” did the man think the troops were sent to do that had not been performed to his standards because of lack of manpower ?
Did he want them to be more efficient at killing Iraqis who resisted the occupation ?
Franken has been lifting soldiers ’ spirits for a long time .
This past March he was honored by the United Service Organization ( USO ) for his ten years of entertaining troops abroad .
That includes Kosovo in 1999 , as imperialist an occupation as you ’ll want to see .
He called his USO experience “ one of the best things I ’ve ever done . ”
Franken has also spoken at West Point , encouraging the next generation of imperialist warriors .
Is this a man to challenge the militarization of America at home and abroad ?
No more so than Obama .
Tom Hayden wrote this about Franken in 2005 when Franken had a regular program on the Air America radio network :
Is anyone else disappointed with Al Franken ’s daily defense of the continued war in Iraq ?
Not Bush ’s version of the war , because that would undermine Air America ’s laudable purpose of rallying an anti-Bush audience .
But , well , Kerry ’s version of the war , one that can be better managed and won , somehow with better body armor and fewer torture cells .
This morning Franken was endorsing Sen .
Joe Biden ’s proposal to send 5,000 NATO troops to close the Syrian - Iraq border , bring in foreign trainers for the Iraqi officer corps , and put Iraqis to work cleaning up the destruction of our invasion .
…
Now that Bush has manipulated us into the invasion , Franken thinks we have no choice but to … stay until we crush the insurgents .
It ’s a humanitarian excuse for open - ended American occupation .
And it ’s shared widely by the professional political and pundit class who think of themselves as the conscience of the American establishment and the leadership of the Democratic Party .
I know , I know , I ’m taking away all your heroes .
But such people should n’t be your heroes .
You can learn to see through the liberal , Democratic Party apologists for the empire .
Only a week ago , documents released by the Nixon Library in California revealed that five days before US and South Vietnamese troops made their surprise invasion of Cambodia on April 29 , 1970 — which elicited widespread , angry protests in the US , resulting in the fatal shootings by the National Guard of students at Kent State University in Ohio — President Richard Nixon got approval for the invasion from the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee , Sen. John Stennis of Mississippi .
Stennis told the president : “ I will be with you . … I commend you for what you are doing . ”
Long live the Cold War
President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras was overthrown in a military coup June 28 because he was about to conduct a non-binding survey of the population , asking the question : “ Do you agree that , during the general elections of November 2009 there should be a fourth ballot to decide whether to hold a Constituent National Assembly that will approve a new political constitution ? ”
One of the issues that Zelaya hoped a new constitution would deal with is the limiting of the presidency to one four - year term .
He also expressed the need for other constitutional changes to make it possible for him to carry out policies to improve the life of the poor ; in countries like Honduras , the law is not generally crafted for that end .
At this writing it ’s not clear how matters will turn out in Honduras , but the following should be noted :
The United States , by its own admission , was fully aware for weeks of the Honduran military ’s plan to overthrow Zelaya .
Washington says it tried its best to change the mind of the plotters .
It ’s difficult to believe that this proved impossible .
During the Cold War it was said , with much justification , that the United States could discourage a coup in Latin America with “ a frown . ”
The Honduran and American military establishments have long been on very fraternal terms .
And it must be asked :
In what way and to what extent did the United States warn Zelaya of the impending coup ?
And what protection did it offer him ?
The response to the coup from the Obama administration can be described with adjectives such as lukewarm , proper but belated , and mixed .
It is not unthinkable that the United States gave the military plotters the go - ahead , telling them to keep the traditional “ golpe ” bloodiness to a minimum .
Zelaya was elected to office as the candidate of a conservative party ; he then , surprisingly , moved to the left and became a strong critic of a number of Washington policies , and an ally of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia , both of whom the Bush administration tried to overthrow and assassinate .
Following the coup , National Public Radio ( NPR ) showed once again why progressives refer to it as National Pentagon Radio .
The station ’s leading news anchor , Robert Siegel , interviewed Johanna Mendelson Forman , of the conservative think tank , Center for Strategic and International Studies :
Siegel : “ There has n’t been a coup in Latin America for quite a while . ”
Forman : “ I think the last one was in 1983 . ”
Siegel did not correct her .
This is ignorance of considerable degree .
There was a coup in Venezuela in 2002 that briefly overthrew Hugo Chavez , a coup in Haiti in 2004 that permanently overthrew Jean - Bertrand Aristide , and a coup in Panama in 1989 that permanently overthrew Manuel Noriega .
Is it because the US was closely involved in all three coups that they have been thrown down the Orwellian Memory Hole ?
How internet providers manipulate and manage the speed of the internet for different types of data will be examined by Canada 's telecommunications regulator during six days of hearings in Gatineau , Que. , starting Monday .
Canadian law and internet traffic management The Telecommunications
Act makes it illegal for internet service providers to : Engage in " unjust discrimination " against or give " undue or unreasonable preference " to any person when providing or charging for telecommunications services .
Control the content or influence the meaning or purpose of telecommunications carried by it for the public without the CRTC 's approval .
But the CRTC has not yet ruled on whether any internet traffic management practices would violate provisions of the act .
While the Conservative government has not waded into the debate , the federal Liberal party expressed support for net neutrality in June .
Earlier in June , the federal New Democratic Party 's Charlie Angus , critic for digital issues , re-introduced a private member 's bill , C - 552 , designed to enshrine net neutrality in law .
Whether the online traffic management practices used by internet service providers such as Bell and Rogers violate Canada 's Telecommunications
Act is a question that the Canadian Radio - Television and Telecommunications Commission is trying to answer .
The commission hearings scheduled for the first week of July will look at how some internet service providers are dealing with alleged congestion on the internet , and how that affects consumers and businesses that favour " net neutrality . "
Net neutrality is the principle that says ISPs should not interfere with information transmitted over the internet and no users or applications should be treated preferentially over others .
Advocates say the principle is needed to ensure customer choice and foster innovation .
The CRTC has the power to impose conditions on the way wholesale and retail internet is offered in Canada .
Some of the internet traffic control practices being put under the microscope are :
Throttling — that is , purposely slowing down the internet speeds of certain online applications such as peer - to - peer file transfers ( P2P ) relative to others .
Deep packet inspection , a technology used to examine traffic to figure out what type of data it is so it can be monitored and directed .
Imposing download limits and excess bandwidth usage charges on heavy users .
ISPs that engage in traffic management practices say they are necessary to manage network congestion caused by certain bandwidth - hungry applications like P2P transfers of large files such as movies .
As part of the probe , the commission is also looking into :
The level and growth of congestion on networks .
Other potential methods for dealing with it , such as upgrading network capacity .
Throttling ruling in November
The hearings are part of an investigation launched by the CRTC following a complaint from smaller ISPs that their customers were being throttled by Bell — that is , their customers ' internet speeds were being selectively slowed down when they used certain online applications at certain times .
The smaller ISPs buy network access wholesale from Bell , which is required to sell it to them because its networks were built decades ago at taxpayer expense , when phone companies were government - owned monopolies .
In November , the CRTC ruled that Bell 's throttling of its competitors ' customers was not discriminatory as it also throttles its own customers in the same way .
The decision was specific to Bell 's wholesale customers and did not deal with throttling in general , the commission said .
The same day as that decision was announced , the CRTC said it would open a new probe into the larger issue of internet traffic management , which is also done by other large internet service providers such as Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Inc .
The probe was to include an online public consultation and end with the July public hearings .
Meanwhile , a group of smaller ISPs and public advocacy organizations is challenging the November 2008 Bell ruling .
The appeal alleges the ruling could unfairly influence the CRTC 's probe into internet traffic management practices .
Reconfiguring on the fly could be the future for space probes ( Image : NASA / ESA )
THE trouble with space probes is that once they have been launched their mission cannot be changed .
But a test satellite planned for 2012 could change that : its flight computer will contain electronic hardware that can be completely reconfigured in space , allowing it to switch from , say , an atmospheric pollution sensor to a near - Earth asteroid detector .
Dubbed the “ flying laptop ” , the spacecraft is the brainchild of Toshinori Kuwahara of the Institute of Space Systems at the University of Stuttgart , Germany , whose idea will appear …
12 Words You Can Never Say in the Office Want to sound hip at work ?
Then you 'd better not use these tech words .
Aug. 25 , 2009  --
If you 're old enough to understand the reference in this headline — George Carlin , anyone ?— then you 're old enough to need a refresher course when it comes to talking about technology .
We 've put together a list of outdated tech terms , phrases that you should n't be using at work anymore because they will make you seem old .
This is especially true if you 're looking for a new job .
For example , on an interview , you should be talking about " cloud computing , " not " ASPs " even though they are basically the same thing .
This list is useful for 20 - somethings , too .
Now when the geezer in the office uses one of these terms , you 'll know what he 's talking about .
Outdated Tech Terms to Avoid
1. Intranet
Popular in the mid-90s , the term " intranet " referred to a private network running the Internet Protocol and other Internet standards such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) .
It was also used to describe an internal Web site that was hosted behind a firewall and was accessible only to employees .
Today , every private network runs IP .
So you can just use the term virtual private network or VPN to describe a private IP - based network .
2. Extranet
An " extranet " referred to private network connections based on Internet standards such as IP and HTTP that extended outside an organization , such as between business partners .
Extranets often replaced point - to - point electronic data interchange ( EDI ) connections that used standards such as X12 .
Today , companies provide suppliers , resellers and other members of their supply chain with access to their VPNs .
3. Web Surfing
When is the last time you heard someone talk about surfing the Web ?
You know the term is out of date when your kids do n't know what it means .
To teens and tweens , the Internet and the World Wide Web are one and the same thing .
So it 's better to use the term " browsing " the Web if you want to be understood .
Or you can just say " Google " since everyone uses that term as a verb .
4. Push Technology
The debate over the merits of " push " versus " pull " technology came to a head in 1996 with the release of the PointCast Network , a Web service that sent a steady stream of news to subscribers .
However , PointCast and other push technology services required too much network bandwidth .
Eventually , push technology evolved into RSS feeds , which remain the preferred method for publishing information to subscribers of the Internet .
RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication .
5. Application Service Provider ( ASP )
During this decade , the term " Application Service Provider " evolved into " Software - as - a - Service . "
Both terms refer to a vendor hosting a software application and providing access to it over the Web .
Customers buy the software on a subscription basis , rather than having to own and operate it themselves .
ASP was a hot term prior to the dot - com bust .
Then it was replaced by " SaaS . "
Now it 's cool to talk about " cloud computing . "
6. Personal Digital Assistant ( PDA )
Coined by former Apple CEO John Sculley back in 1992 when he unveiled the Apple Newton , the term " personal digital assistant " referred to a handheld computer .
PDA was still in use in 1996 , when the Palm Pilot was the hottest handheld in corporate America .
Today , the preferred generic term for a handheld like a Blackberry or an iPhone is a " smartphone " .
7. Internet Telephony
You need to purge the term " Internet telephony " from your vocabulary and switch to VoIP , for Voice over IP .
Even the term VoIP is getting old - fashioned because pretty soon all telephone calls will be routed over the Internet rather than the Public Switched Telephone Network .
It 's probably time to stop referring to the PSTN , too , because it is headed for the history books as all voice , data and video traffic is carried on the Internet .
8. Weblog
A blog is a shortened version of " Weblog , " a term that emerged in the late 1990s to describe commentary that an individual publishes online .
It spawned many words still in use such as " blogger " and " blogosphere . "
Nowadays , few people have time to blog so they are " microblogging , " which is another word that 's heading out the door as people turn Twitter into a generic term for blasting out 140 - character observations or opinions .
9 . Thin Client
You have to give Larry Ellison credit for seeing many of the flaws in the client / server computing architecture and for popularizing the term " thin client " to refer to Oracle 's alternative terminal - like approach .
In 1993 , Ellison was touting thin clients as a way for large organizations to improve network security and manageability .
Although thin clients never replaced PCs , the concept is similar to " virtual desktops " that are gaining popularity today as a way of supporting mobile workers .
10 . RBOC
In 1984 , the U.S. government forced AT&T to split up into seven Regional Bell Operating Companies ( RBOCs ) also known as Baby Bells .
Customers bought local service from RBOCs and long - distance service from carriers such as AT&T .
Telecom industry mergers over the last 15 years have formed integrated local - and long - distance carriers such as AT&T , Verizon and Qwest .
This makes not only the term RBOC obsolete , but also the terms ILEC for Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier ( i.e. , GTE ) and CLEC for Competitive Local Exchange Carrier ( i.e. , MFS ) .
11 . Long -Distance Call
Thanks to flat - rate calling plans available from carriers for at least five years , nobody needs to distinguish between local and long - distance calls anymore .
Similarly , you do n't need to distinguish between terrestrial and wireless calls because so many people use only wireless services .
Like pay phones , long - distance calls — and their premium prices — are relics of a past without national and unlimited calling plans .
12 . World Wide Web
Nobody talks about the " World Wide Web " anymore , or the " Information Superhighway , " for that matter .
It 's just the Internet .
It 's a distinction that Steve Czaban , the popular Fox Sports Radio talk show host , likes to mock when he refers to the " Worldwide Interweb . "
Nothing dates you more than pulling out one of those old - fashioned ways of referring to the Internet such as " infobahn " or " electronic highway . "
Last week , I opened my freezer to look for a long - lost salmon filet and found myself nose - to - nose with my daughter ’s frozen placenta .
It had been waiting patiently for over a year for someone ( anyone ! ) to do something ( anything ! ) to it .
Instead of trying to forget I ’d seen it , this time I pulled it out and sighed .
It was the day before Mother ’s Day .
It would be a great time to “ deal ” with the placenta .
I groaned and then left it on the counter to thaw .
I had been contemplating the question of what to do with the placenta — later renamed , that god - damned placenta ! — since conception .
I always liked the idea of planting a tree with it .
But where ?
Our family does n’t own any land where Ayla could watch it grow .
Public parks are governed by strict rules for tree cultivation .
In a moment of desperation , I hatched a plan to illegally plant a tree ( and placenta ) in the middle of the night .
I eventually came to my senses and let go of that plan .
Although I am a tree lover , a few years ago I switched from being a “ forest - person ” to an “ ocean- person . ”
I ca n’t pinpoint exactly when or where it happened , but I gradually stopped craving long hikes in the woods and started salivating over the prospect of taking long walks on the beach .
Mother Ocean had cast a spell over me and now I felt the urge to walk along her soft edges and feel her water wash over me .
I finally decided that I would find a way to return the placenta to a body of water .
But since Mother ’s Day was less then 24 hours away and since I live nowhere near an ocean , I settled on Lake Ontario .
Having decided on a final resting place was only half the battle .
I could n’t dig a hole in the lake or just toss it in .
I vaguely remembered a doula telling me that you could dehydrate a placenta in the oven and then grind it up into a fine powder .
But recipes for dehydrating a placenta were hard to come by .
So I impulsively greased a pan and preheated the oven to 450 degrees .
A few minutes after the placenta was placed inside , the entire house smelled of cooked blood .
For a family of vegetarians , it is a strange thing to smell blood — especially your own blood — for hours on end .
During those hours , I was alternately attracted to the oven and repulsed by it .
My placenta was a fighter — it took almost seven hours to cook it to a crispy finish .
I ’d like to spare you the details of the grinding phase except to say that halfway through it I realized that I should have left it in the oven overnight .
Instead of placenta ashes , I ended up with liver - colored soup .
As I poured the mixture into a yogurt container ( my makeshift urn ) , I wondered if I was committing some kind of bio- hazardous crime .
I decided that I should focus on my intention , rather than the outcome of this strange exercise .
Bidding farewell to my placenta was a means to say " Thank You " to the Universe .
To this day , my entire body tingles when I think about the miracle of conception , and childbirth .
And this strange organ I was about to dispose of had made it all possible .
When I finally bid my placenta farewell , it was not the magical moment I hoped it would be .
Instead of sprinkling crimson fairy dust upon Mama Ocean , chunks of placenta stew plopped into Lake Ontario .
The wind nearly blew me over as I recited a prayer .
Even though I tried to find stillness , I was constantly looking over my shoulder for cops or marine biologists .
I finally had to accept that not every ritual or ceremony turns out the way we imagine it .
After packing up the stroller , I scooped Ayla into my arms and held her close .
Together we stared out at the white - capped waves , lost in thought .
As we walked away , Ayla waved furiously towards the lake .
“ Bah - bah , ” she shouted .
I joined in , “ Bye - bye , placenta . ”
Ayla , as always , had the last word .
“ Bah . ”
And so my placenta returned to Mother Earth .

Although demand for the Web editions of American Chemical Society journals is growing , demand for print editions has declined sharply .
This trend is prompting the society to change the format and dissemination of its printed issues .
In July , ACS will begin publishing the print editions of most of its journals in a " rotated and condensed " format that will fit two pages of content on one printed page .
The new format will reduce paper , printing , and distribution costs for ACS , Journals Publishing Group Senior Vice President Susan L. King notes .
It will also have a positive impact on libraries because a single year of the print editions of all ACS journals currently requires 30 linear feet of shelf space .
ACS wo n't increase prices for its print journals next year , but it will stop offering deep discounts on print subscriptions to libraries that have online subscriptions .
Customers will also be offered incentives to switch to electronic - only access .
" The transition from print to Web for ACS journals has now passed a tipping point , " King says .
" In making changes to the production and dissemination of the print , we are acting in concert with members , readers , and librarians to focus on our digital future .
By focusing on the electronic medium in all its manifestations —
Web , desktop , mobile — we will collectively reap the benefits to be realized by truly networked and accessible scientific information . "
What , you thought American builders were the only ones who built shoddy , boomtime housing ?
9 people in China are being held by authorities over the collapse of this Shanghai apartment building , which literally just fell over on its side without breaking .
The collapse was possibly due to weak construction , or maybe an ill - placed parking garage underneath .
Good luck selling the ones nearby !
New program may lighten student loan debt burden ASSETS & VALUES
Program may lighten student loan debt burden
While job hunting in one of the worst economies on record , college graduates can’t afford to be too choosy about the work they will do .
Many used student loans and credit cards to pay tuition and other college expenses and need paychecks to start whittling away at their debt .
Fortunately for them , the federal government put in place some changes last week that make it easier for college students and graduates who finance their educations with federal loans to pay back borrowed money .
On Wednesday , the federal Education Department launched the Income - Based Repayment plan , a program that adjusts the size of federal student loan payments based on a borrower ’s paycheck and family size .
Repayment formula
The repayment formula is based on 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the borrower ’s family size .
Under the program , the borrower pays no more than 15 percent of the difference between that income threshold and his or her gross income .
The new program also sets the payment period to 25 years .
If by that time the debt is not paid off , what ’s still due on the loan , including interest , is forgiven .
Forgiven , in this context , means the remaining debt is canceled .
When I explained that to Ahmad Hygh , a junior at Prairie View A&M University , he cheered .
Hygh already owes $ 24,000 in federal student loans .
His plan is to graduate with an English degree and use it to teach high school students about literature and language , no matter how much he owes .
“ I ’m positive I can be a teacher , and I ’m not going to let my debt load stop me , ” Hygh said .
“ I have so much other stuff to worry about than how much I owe the government . ”
Loans and a home
On a teacher ’s salary , Hygh plans to pay off his student loans and purchase a home in the next five years .
But he has n’t mapped out yet just how to get all of that done .
“ If the loans are n’t paid off by that time , I might have to wait on getting the house , ” he said .
The new income - based repayment plan would make juggling all of his financial goals less costly .
And when he follows through on his plan to be a teacher , he may also qualify for the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that was also started last week .
Graduates who do public service work and make monthly federal loan repayments for 10 years can have the rest of their federal debts erased .
Direct Loan requirement
To participate in the program , however , you have to get your loans through the federal Direct Loan program , or shift your debt to that program — in which money comes straight from the federal government and not through banks , Sallie Mae or other lenders .
By combining the income - based repayment plan with the public service program , Hygh may find it possible to repay a big chunk of his debt and save money for a down payment on a home .
Nothing ’s guaranteed , but at least the federal government has given him a better chance at actually achieving the old American Dream .

The Origins of the Overclass
By Steve Kangas
The wealthy
The origins of this machine , interestingly enough , can be traced back to the CIA .
This is not to say the machine is a formal CIA operation , complete with code name and signed documents .
( Although such evidence may yet surface  and previously unthinkable domestic operations such as MK - ULTRA , CHAOS and MOCKINGBIRD show this to be a distinct possibility . )
But what we do know already indicts the CIA strongly enough .
Its principle creators were Irving Kristol , Paul Weyrich , William Simon , Richard Mellon Scaife , Frank Shakespeare , William F. Buckley , Jr. , the Rockefeller family , and more .
Almost all the machine 's creators had CIA backgrounds .
During the 1970s , these men would take the propaganda and operational techniques they had learned in the Cold War and apply them to the Class War .
Therefore it is no surprise that the American version of the machine bears an uncanny resemblance to the foreign versions designed to fight communism .
The CIA 's expert and comprehensive organization of the business class would succeed beyond their wildest dreams .
In 1975 , the richest 1 percent owned 22 percent of America ’s wealth .
By 1992 , they would nearly double that , to 42 percent  the highest level of inequality in the 20th century .
How did this alliance start ?
The CIA has always recruited the nation ’s elite : millionaire businessmen , Wall Street brokers , members of the national news media , and Ivy League scholars .
During World War II , General " Wild Bill " Donovan became chief of the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , the forerunner of the CIA .
Donovan recruited so exclusively from the nation ’s rich and powerful that members eventually came to joke that " OSS " stood for " Oh , so social ! "
Another early elite was Allen Dulles , who served as Director of the CIA from 1953 to 1961 .
Dulles was a senior partner at the Wall Street firm of Sullivan and Cromwell , which represented the Rockefeller empire and other mammoth trusts , corporations and cartels .
He was also a board member of the J. Henry Schroeder Bank , with offices in Wall Street , London , Zurich and Hamburg .
His financial interests across the world would become a conflict of interest when he became head of the CIA .
Like Donavan , he would recruit exclusively from society ’s elite .
By the 1950s , the CIA had riddled the nation ’s businesses , media and universities with tens of thousands of part - time , on - call operatives .
Their employment with the agency took a variety of forms , which included :
Leaving one 's profession to work for the CIA in a formal , official capacity .
Staying in one 's profession , using the job as cover for CIA activity .
This undercover activity could be full - time , part - time , or on - call .
Staying in one 's profession , occasionally passing along information useful to the CIA .
Passing through the revolving door that has always existed between the agency and the business world .
Historically , the CIA and society ’s elite have been one and the same people .
This means that their interests and goals are one and the same as well .
Perhaps the most frequent description of the intelligence community is the " old boy network , " where members socialize , talk shop , conduct business and tap each other for favors well outside the formal halls of government .
Many common traits made it inevitable that the CIA and Corporate America would become allies .
Both share an intense dislike of democracy , and feel they should be liberated from democratic regulations and oversight .
Both share a culture of secrecy , either hiding their actions from the American public or lying about them to present the best public image .
And both are in a perfect position to help each other .
How ?
International businesses give CIA agents cover , secret funding , top- quality resources and important contacts in foreign lands .
In return , the CIA gives corporations billion - dollar federal contracts ( for spy planes , satellites and other hi-tech spycraft ) .
Businessmen also enjoy the romantic thrill of participating in spy operations .
The CIA also gives businesses a certain amount of protection and privacy from the media and government watchdogs , under the guise of " national security . "
Finally , the CIA helps American corporations remain dominant in foreign markets , by overthrowing governments hostile to unregulated capitalism and installing puppet regimes whose policies favor American corporations at the expense of their people .
The CIA ’s alliance with the elite turned out to be an unholy one .
Each enabled the other to rise above the law .
Indeed , a review of the CIA ’s history is one of such crime and atrocity that no one can reasonably defend it , even in the name of anticommunism .
Before reviewing this alliance in detail , it is useful to know the CIA ’s history of atrocity first .
The Crimes of the CIA
During World War II , the OSS actively engaged in propaganda , sabotage and countless other dirty tricks .
After the war , and even after the CIA was created in 1947 , the American intelligence community reverted to harmless information gathering and analysis , thinking that the danger to national security had passed .
That changed in 1948 with the emergence of the Cold War .
In that year , the CIA recreated its covert action wing , innocuously called the Office of Policy Coordination .
Its first director was Wall Street lawyer Frank Wisner .
According to its secret charter , its responsibilities included
propaganda , economic warfare , preventive direct action , including sabotage , antisabotage , demolition and evacuation procedures ; subversion against hostile states , including assistance to underground resistance groups , and support of indigenous anti-communist elements in threatened countries of the free world .
Stanley Lovell , a CIA recruiter for " Wild Bill " Donovan : " What I have to do is to stimulate the Peck 's Bad Boy beneath the surface of every American scientist and say to him , ' Throw all your normal law - abiding concepts out the window .
Here 's a chance to raise merry hell .
Come help me raise it . ' "
( 1 ) George Hunter
White , writing of his CIA escapades : " I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun , fun , fun ...
Where else could a red - blooded American boy lie , kill , cheat , steal , rape and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the all - highest ? " ( 2 ) A retired CIA agency caseworker with twenty years experience : " I never gave a thought to legality or morality .
Frankly , I did what worked . "
During the 40s and 50s , most of the public was unaware of what the CIA was doing .
Those who knew thought they were fighting the good fight against communism , like James Bond .
However , they could not keep their actions secret forever , and by the 60s and 70s , Americans began learning about the agency ’s crimes and atrocities .
( 3 ) It turns out the CIA has :
Corrupted democratic elections in Greece , Italy and dozens of other nations ;
Been involved to varying degrees in at least 35 assassination plots against foreign heads of state or prominent political leaders .
Successful assassinations include democratically elected leaders like Salvador Allende ( Chile ) and Patrice Lumumba ( Belgian Congo ) ; also CIA - created dictators like Rafael Trujillo ( Dominican Republic ) and Ngo Dinh Diem ( South Vietnam ) ; and popular political leaders like Che Guevara .
Unsuccessful attempts range from Fidel Castro to Charles De Gaulle .
Helped launch military coups that toppled democratic governments , replacing them with brutal dictatorships or juntas .
The list of overthrown democratic leaders includes Mossadegh ( Iran , 1953 ) , Arbenz ( Guatemala , 1954 ) , Velasco and Arosemena ( Ecuador , 1961 , 1963 ) , Bosch ( Dominican Republic , 1963 ) , Goulart ( Brazil , 1964 ) , Sukarno ( Indonesia , 1965 ) , Papandreou ( Greece , 1965 - 67 ) , Allende ( Chile , 1973 ) , and dozens of others .

Undermined the governments of Australia , Guyana , Cambodia , Jamaica and more ;
Supported murderous dictators like General Pinochet ( Chile ) , the Shah of Iran , Ferdinand Marcos ( Phillipines ) , " Papa Doc " and " Baby Doc " Duvalier ( Haiti ) , General Noriega ( Panama ) , Mobutu Sese Seko ( Ziare ) , the " reign of the colonels " ( Greece ) , and more ;
Created , trained and supported death squads and secret police forces that tortured and murdered hundreds of thousands of civilians , leftists and political opponents , in Guatemala , Honduras , El Salvador , Haiti , Bolivia , Cuba , Mexico , Uruguay , Brazil , Chile , Vietnam , Cambodia , Thailand , Iran , Turkey , Angola and others ;
Helped run the " School of the Americas " at Fort Benning , Georgia , which trains Latin American military officers how to overthrow democratic governments .
Subjects include the use of torture , interrogation and murder ;
Used Michigan State " professors " to train Diem ’s secret police in torture ;
Conducted economic sabotage , including ruining crops , disrupting industry , sinking ships and creating food shortages ;
Paved the way for the massacre of 200,000 in East Timor , 500,000 in Indonesia and one to two million in Cambodia ;
Launched secret or illegal military actions or wars in Nicaragua , Angola , Cuba , Laos and Indochina ;
Planted false stories in the local media ;
Framed political opponents for crimes , atrocities , political statements and embarrassments that they did not commit ;
Spied on thousands of American citizens , in defiance of Congressional law ;
Smuggled Nazi war criminals and weapon scientists into the U.S. , unpunished , for their use in the Cold War ;
Created organizations like the World Anti-Communist League , which became filled with ex-Nazis , Nazi sympathizers , Italian terrorists , Japanese fascists , racist Afrikaaners , Latin American death squad leaders , CIA agents and other extreme right - wing militants ;
Conducted Operation MK - ULTRA , a mind - control experiment that gave LSD and other drugs to Americans against their will or without their knowledge , causing some to commit suicide ;
Penetrated and disrupted student antiwar organizations ;
Kept friendly and extensive working relations with the Mafia ;
Actively traded in drugs around the world since the 1950s to fund its operations .
The Contra / crack scandal is only the tip of the iceberg –- other notorious examples include Southeast Asia ’s Golden Triangle and Noreiga ’s Panama .
Had their fingerprints all over the assassinations of John F. Kennedy , Robert F. Kennedy , Martin Luther King , Jr. , and Malcom X . Even if the CIA is not responsible for these killings , the sheer amount of CIA involvement in these cases demands answers ;
And then routinely lied to Congress about all of the above .
We should note that the CIA gets away with this because it is not accountable to democratic government .
Former CIA officer Philip
Agee put it best : " The CIA is the President 's secret army . "
Prior to 1975 , the agency answered only to the President ( creating all the usual problems of authoritarianism ) .
And because the CIA ’s activities were secret , the President rarely had to worry about public criticism and pressure .
After the 1975 Church hearings , Congress tried to create congressional oversight of the CIA , but this has failed miserably .
One reason is that the congressional oversight committee is a sham , filled with Cold Warriors , conservatives , businessmen , and even ex-CIA personnel .
The Business Origins of CIA Crimes
Although many people think that the CIA ’s primary mission during the Cold War was to " deter communism , " Noam Chomksy correctly points out that its real mission was " deterring democracy . "
From corrupting elections to overthrowing democratic governments , from assassinating elected leaders to installing murderous dictators , the CIA has virtually always replaced democracy with dictatorship .
It did n’t help that the CIA was run by businessmen , whose hostility towards democracy is legendary .
The reason they overthrew so many democracies is because the people usually voted for policies that multi-national corporations did n't like : land reform , strong labor unions , nationalization of their industries , and greater regulation protecting workers , consumers and the environment .
So the CIA ’s greatest " successes " were usually more pro-corporate than anti-communist .
Citing a communist threat , the CIA helped overthrow the democratically elected Mohammed Mussadegh government in Iran in 1953 .
But there was no communist threat  the Soviets stood back and watched the coup from afar .
What really happened was that Mussadegh threatened to nationalize British and American oil companies in Iran .
Consequently , the CIA and MI6 toppled Mussadegh and replaced him with a puppet government , headed by the Shah of Iran and his murderous secret police , SAVAK .
The reason why the Ayatollah Khomeini and his revolutionaries took 52 Americans hostage in Tehran in 1979 was because the CIA had helped SAVAK torture and murder their people .
Another " success " was the CIA ’s overthrow of the democratically elected government of Jacabo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954 .
Again , there was no communist threat .
The real threat was to Guatemala ’s United Fruit Company , a Rockefeller - owned firm whose stockholders included CIA Director Allen Dulles .
Arbenz threatened to nationalize the company , albeit with generous compensation .
In response , the CIA initiated a coup that overthrew Arbenz and installed the murderous dictator Castillo Armas .
For four decades , CIA - backed dicatators would torture and murder hundreds of thousands of leftists , union members and others who would fight for a more equitable distribution of the country ’s resources .
Another " success " story was Chile .
In 1973 , the country ’s democratically elected leader , Salvadore Allende , nationalized foreign - owned interests , like Chile ’s lucrative copper mines and telephone system .
International Telephone & Telegraph ( ITT ) offered the CIA $ 1 million to overthrow Allende  which the CIA allegedly refused  but paid $ 350,000 to his political opponents .
The CIA responded with a coup that murdered Allende and replaced him with a brutal tyrant , General Augusto Pinochet .
Pinochet tortured and murdered thousands of leftists , union members and political opponents as economists trained at the University of Chicago under Milton Friedman installed a " free market " economy .
Since then , income inequality has soared higher in Chile than anywhere else in Latin America .
Even when the communist threat was real , the CIA first and foremost took care of the elite .
In testimony before Congress in the early 50s , it artificially inflated Soviet military capabilities .
A notorious example was the " bomber gap " that later turned out to be grossly exaggerated .
Another was " Team B , " a group of hawkish CIA analysts who seriously distorted Soviet military data .
These scare tactics worked .
Congress awarded giant defense contracts to the U.S. military - industrial complex .
And not even the fall of the Soviet Union and the demise of American defense contracts have stopped the CIA from serving the elite .
Journalist Robert Dreyfuss writes :
Since the end of the Cold War , Washington has been abuzz with talk about using the CIA for economic espionage .
Stripped of euphemism , economic espionage simply means that American spies would target foreign companies , such as Toyota , Nissan and Honda , and then covertly pass stolen trade secrets and technology to U.S. corporate executives . ( 5 )
In a 1975 interview , Ex-CIA agent Philip Agee summed up his personal observations of the agency :
To the people who work for it , the CIA is known as The Company .
The Big Business mentality pervades everything .
Agents , for instance , are called assets .
The man in charge of the United Kingdom desk is said to have the " U.K. account " …
American multinational corporations have built up colossal interests all over the world , and you can bet your ass that wherever you find U. S. business interests , you also find the CIA …
The multinational corporations want a peaceful status quo in countries where they have investments , because that gives them undisturbed access to cheap raw materials , cheap labor and stable markets for their finished goods .
The status quo suits bankers , because their money remains secure and multiplies .
And , of course , the status quo suits the small ruling groups the CIA supports abroad , because all they want is to keep themselves on top of the socioeconomic pyramid and the majority of their people on the bottom .
But do you realize what being on the bottom means in most parts of the world ?
Ignorance , poverty , often early death by starvation or disease …
Remember , the CIA is an instrument of the President ; it only carries out policy .
And , like everyone else , the President has to respond to forces in the society he 's trying to lead , right ?
In America , the most powerful force is Big Business , and American Big Business has a vested interest in the Cold War . ( 6 )
The CIA had no trouble recruiting elites who sought a more exciting life .
Between 1948 and 1959 , more than 40,000 American individuals and companies acted as sources for the U.S. intelligence community .
( 7 ) Let ’s look at each area of recruitment , and see how they enabled the CIA to conduct its crimes :
Big Business
The CIA co-opted big business right from the start , beginning with the most famous billionaire of the time : Howard Hughes .
Hughes had inherited his father ’s million - dollar tool and die company at age 19 .
Anxious to expand his fortune , he made a conscientious decision " to go where the money is "  namely , government .
With a few well - placed bribes , Hughes secured defense contracts to build military planes .
The result was the Hughes Aircraft company .
By 1940 , he had also acquired a controlling interest in Trans World Airlines .
His government connections and international airline soon caught the attention of the CIA , and the two began a lifelong relationship .
Hughes , whom the CIA dubbed " The Stockbroker , " became the agency ’s largest contractor .
Not only did he let the CIA use his business firms as fronts , but he also funded countless CIA operations .
Perhaps the most notorious was Operation Jennifer , an allegedly failed attempt to recover nuclear codes from a sunken Soviet submarine .
Hughes ’ right - hand security man , Robert Maheu , was a CIA agent who at one time represented the CIA in negotiations with the Mafia to assassinate Fidel Castro .
The CIA ’s contacts with big business quickly spread .
The agency showed a preference for international companies , public relations firms , media companies , law offices , banks , financiers and stockbrokers .
The CIA did n’t limit its activities to recruiting businessmen ; sometimes the CIA bought or created entire companies outright .
One benefit of co-opting big business was that the CIA was able to create a secret source of funds other than from government .
With stock portfolios multiplying their profits , it ’s impossible now to say how flush the CIA really is .
If Congress ever cut off funds for a mission , the business fraternity could easily replace them , either by donations or even setting up profitable businesses in the target country .
In fact , this is precisely what happened during the Iran / Contra scandal .
By allying itself with the business community , the CIA received the funds and ability it needed to remove itself from democratic control .
The Media
Journalism is a perfect cover for CIA agents .
People talk freely to journalists , and few think suspiciously of a journalist aggressively searching for information .
Journalists also have power , influence and clout .
Not surprisingly , the CIA began a mission in the late 1940s to recruit American journalists on a wide scale , a mission it dubbed Operation MOCKINGBIRD .
The agency wanted these journalists not only to relay any sensitive information they discovered , but also to write anti-communist , pro-capitalist propaganda when needed .
The instigators of MOCKINGBIRD were Frank Wisner , Allan Dulles , Richard Helms and Philip Graham .
Graham was the husband of Katherine Graham , today ’s publisher of the Washington Post .
In fact , it was the Post ’s ties to the CIA that allowed it to grow so quickly after the war , both in readership and influence . ( 8 )
MOCKINGBIRD was extraordinarily successful .
In no time , the agency had recruited at least 25 media organizations to disseminate CIA propaganda .
At least 400 journalists would eventually join the CIA payroll , according to the CIA ’s testimony before a stunned Church Committee in 1975 .
( The committee felt the true number was considerably higher . )
The names of those recruited reads like a Who 's Who of journalism :
Philip and Katharine Graham ( Publishers , Washington Post )
) William Paley ( President , CBS )
Henry Luce ( Publisher , Time and Life magazine )
and magazine ) Arthur Hays Sulzberger ( Publisher , N.Y. Times )
) Jerry O'Leary ( Washington Star )
) Hal Hendrix ( Pulitzer Prize winner , Miami News )
) Barry Bingham Sr. , ( Louisville Courier - Journal )
) James Copley ( Copley News Services )
Joseph Harrison ( Editor , Christian Science Monitor )
) C.D. Jackson ( Fortune )
) Walter Pincus ( Reporter , Washington Post )
) ABC
NBC
Associated Press
United Press International
Reuters
Hearst Newspapers
Scripps - Howard
Newsweek
magazine Mutual Broadcasting System
Miami Herald
Old Saturday Evening Post
New York Herald - Tribune
After Philip ’s suicide in 1963 , Katharine Graham took over the Post .
Seduced by her husband ’s world of government and espionage , she expanded her newspaper ’s relationship with the CIA .
In a 1988 speech before CIA officials at Langley , Virginia , she stated :
We live in a dirty and dangerous world .
There are some things that the general public does not need to know and should n’t .
I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows .
Ben Bradlee was the Post ’s managing editor during most of the Cold War .
He worked in the U.S. Paris embassy from 1951 to 1953 , where he followed orders by the CIA station chief to place propaganda in the European press .
( 9 ) Most Americans incorrectly believe that Bradlee personifies the liberal slant of the Post , given his role in publishing the Pentagon Papers and the Watergate investigations .
But neither of these two incidents are what they seem .
The Post merely published the Pentagon Papers after The New York Times already had , because it wanted to appear competitive .
As for Watergate , we ’ll examine the CIA ’s reasons for wanting to bring down Nixon in a moment .
Someone once asked Bradlee : " Does it irk you when The Washington Post is made out to be a bastion of slanted liberal thinkers instead of champion journalists just because of Watergate ? "
Bradlee responded : " Damn right it does ! " ( 10 )
It would be impossible to elaborate in this short space even the most important examples of the CIA / media alliance .
Sig Mickelson was a CIA asset the entire time he was president of CBS News from 1954 to 1961 .
Later he went on to become president of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty , two major outlets of CIA propaganda .
The CIA also secretly bought or created its own media companies .
It owned 40 percent of the Rome Daily American at a time when communists were threatening to win the Italian elections .
Worse , the CIA has bought many domestic media companies .
A prime example is Capital Cities , created in 1954 by CIA businessman William Casey ( who would later become Reagan ’s CIA director ) .
Another founder was Lowell Thomas , a close friend and business contact with CIA Director Allen Dulles .
Another founder was CIA businessman Thomas Dewey .
By 1985 , Capital Cities had grown so powerful that it was able to buy an entire TV network : ABC .
For those who believe in " separation of press and state , " the very idea that the CIA has secret propaganda outlets throughout the media is appalling .
The reason why America was so oblivious to CIA crimes in the 40s and 50s was because the media willingly complied with the agency .
Even today , when the immorality of the CIA should be an open - and - shut case , " debate " about the issue rages in the media .
Here is but one example :
In 1996 , The San Jose Mercury News published an investigative report suggesting that the CIA had sold crack in Los Angeles to fund the Contra war in Central America .
A month later , three of the CIA ’s most important media allies 
The Washington Post , The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times  immediately leveled their guns at the Mercury report and blasted away in an attempt to discredit it .
Who wrote the Post article ?
Walter Pincus , longtime CIA journalist .
The dangers here are obvious .
Academia
By the early 50s , CIA Director Allen Dulles had staffed the CIA almost exclusively with Ivy League graduates , especially from Yale .
( A disproportionate number of CIA figures , like George Bush , come from Yale ’s " Skull and Crossbones " Society . )
CIA recruiters also approached thousands of other professors to work in place at their universities on a part - time , contract basis .
Not stopping at recruiting scholars , the agency would go on to create several departments at elite universities , including Harvard 's Russian Research Center and the Center for International Studies at MIT .
Although most academics were supportive of the CIA in the 50s , most were unaware of its abuses .
In the 60s , academia would become outraged to learn that anti-communist organizations like the National Student Association were actually creations of the CIA .
The most audacious CIA front was the Congress for Cultural Freedom , an organization that attracted liberal , freethinking artists and intellectuals who nonetheless deplored communism .
By the late 60s and 70s , growing reports of CIA crimes and atrocities had deeply alienated academia .
Scholars were further troubled to learn that the CIA had penetrated and disrupted student antiwar groups .
Unlike business and the media , academia overwhelmingly denounced the CIA after the Vietnam era .
This eventually forced the CIA to turn to new places to find their analysts and scholars .
The most important source was the conservative think - tank movement , which it helped to create .
More on this later .
The Roman Catholic Church
Although the CIA began as a mostly Protestant organization , Roman Catholics quickly came to dominate the new covert-action wing in 1948 .
All were staunchly conservative , fiercely anti-communist and socially elite .
Just a few of the many Catholic operatives included future CIA directors William Colby , William Casey , and John McCone .
Another well - known personality from this period was William F. Buckley , Jr. , editor of the National Review and gadfly host of TV’s Firing Line .
Buckley , it turns out , served as a CIA agent in Mexico City , and his experiences there served as fodder for his Blackford Oakes spy novels .
There were several reasons for this influx of Catholic elites .
First , Wisner ( himself a Wall Street lawyer ) had an extensive and glamorous circle of friends to recruit from .
Second , Italy was in constant crisis in the 1940s , both during World War II and after .
Throughout this troubled period , the American intelligence community ’s greatest ally in Italy was the Roman Catholic Church .
The Roman Catholic Church , of course , is one of the most anti-communist organizations in the world .
The Marxist doctrine of atheism threatens Catholic theology , and its equality threatens the Church ’s strict tradition of hierarchy and authoritarianism .
When Hitler invaded Communist Russia , the Vatican openly approved .
Jesuit Michael Serafian wrote : " It can not be denied that [ Pope ] Pius XII 's closest advisors for some time regarded Hitler 's armoured divisions as the right hand of God . " ( 11 )
But Hitler persecuted Catholics as well , and ultimately drove the Church to the Americans .
In 1943 , the Vatican reached a secret agreement with OSS Chief Donovan  himself a devout Catholic  to let the Holy See become the center of Allied spy operations in Italy .
Donovan considered the Church to be one of his prize intelligence assets , given its global power , membership and contacts .
He cultivated this alliance by sending America ’s most prestigious Catholics to the Vatican to establish rapport and forge an alliance .
After the war , half of Europe lay under Communist control , and the Italian communist party threatened to win the 1948 elections .
The prospect of communism ruling over the heart of Catholicism terrified the Vatican .
Once again , American intelligence gathered their most prestigious Catholics to strengthen ties with the Vatican .
Because this was the first mission of the new covert action division , the American Catholic agents acquired positions of power early on , and would dominate covert operations for the rest of the Cold War .
At a public level , the U.S. government sunk $ 350 million in social and military aid into Italy to sway the vote .
On a secret level , Wisner spent $ 10 million in black budget funds to steal the elections .
This included disseminating propaganda , beating up left - wing politicians , intimidating voters and disrupting leftist parties .
The dirty tricks worked  the Communists lost , and the Catholic Americans ’ success permanently secured their power within the CIA .
The Knights of Malta ( 12 )
The Roman Catholic Church did not forget the American agents who had saved them from both Nazism and Communism .
It rewarded them by making them Knights of Malta , or members of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta ( SMOM ) .
SMOM is one of the oldest and most elite religious orders in the Catholic Church .
Until recently , it limited its membership to Italians and foreign heads of state .
In 1927 , however , an exception was made for the United States , given its emerging status as a world power .
SMOM opened an American branch , awarding knighthood or damehood to several American Catholic business tycoons .
This group was so conservative that one , John Raskob , the Chairman of General Motors , actually became involved in an aborted military plot to remove Franklin Roosevelt from the White House .
SMOM has also been embarrassed by knighting or giving awards to countless people who later turned out to be Nazi war criminals .
This is the sort of culture that thrives within the leadership of SMOM .
Officially , the Knights of Malta are a global charity organization .
But beginning in the 1940s , knighthood was granted to countless CIA agents , and the organization has become a front for intelligence operations .
SMOM is ideal for this kind of activity , because it is recognized as the world ’s only landless sovereignty , and members enjoy diplomatic immunity .
This allows agents and supplies to pass through customs without interference from the host country .
Such privileges enabled the Knights of Malta to become a major supplier of " humanitarian aid " to the Contras during their war in the 1980s .
A partial list of the Knights and Dames of Malta reads like a Who ’s Who of American Catholicism :
William Casey

The CIA has also used other religious and charity organizations as fronts .
For example , John F. Kennedy -- another anticommunist Roman Catholic who greatly expanded covert operations -- created the U.S. Peace Corps to serve as cover for CIA operatives .
The CIA has also made extensive use of missionaries , with the blessings of many right - wing , anticommunist Christian denominations .
But the World Grows Wise …
It was only a matter of time before other nations caught on to these fronts .
They learned that when the CIA comes to their countries to commit their crimes and atrocities , they come disguised as American journalists , businessmen , missionaries and charity volunteers .
Unfortunately , foreigners are now targeting these professions as hostile .
In Lebanon , terrorists held U.S. journalist Terry Anderson hostage for nearly seven years , on the not unreasonable assumption that he was a spy .
Whether or not this was true is beside the point .
The CIA has put all Americans abroad at risk , whether they are CIA agents or not .
In hearings before the Senate in 1996 , many organizations urged Congress to stop using their professions as CIA cover .
Don Argue of the National Association of Evangelicals testified : " Such use of missionary agents for covert activities by the CIA would be unethical and immoral . " ( 13 )
From the Cold War to the Class War
As noted above , academia was the first major institution to denounce the crimes of the CIA .
Why ?
One reason is that scholars conduct their own extensive research into world affairs , so naturally they were the first to learn the truth .
This is the main reason why protest against the Vietnam War and the CIA erupted first among students on the nation ’s campuses .
By the end of the Vietnam War , the CIA had suffered a " brain drain " as its academic allies became its most articulate , passionate and eloquent critics .
The social revolutions of the 60s terrified the CIA .
James Jesus Angleton , chief of counter - intelligence and a truly paranoid man , was convinced the Soviets had masterminded the entire antiwar movement .
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover shared his conviction .
The CIA had always spied on student groups throughout the 60s , but in 1968 President Johnson dramatically stepped up the effort with Operation CHAOS .
This initially called for 50 CIA agents to go undercover as student radicals , penetrate their antiwar organizations and root out the Russian spies who were causing the rebellion .
Tellingly , they never found a single spy .
The agents also began a campaign of wire - tapping , mail - opening , burglary , deception , intimidation and disruption against thousands of protesting American civilians .
By the time Operation CHAOS wound down in 1973 , the CIA had spied on 7,000 Americans , 1,000 organizations and traded information on more than 300,000 persons with various law agencies .
( 14 )
When academia learned of this , its outrage grew .
The loss of academia was only the first blow for the CIA .
Other disasters quickly followed ; in the early 70s , the CIA was trying desperately to stave off a growing number of scandals .
The first was Watergate .
The CIA ’s fingerprints were all over Watergate .
First , we should note the CIA had clear motives for helping oust Nixon .
He was the ultimate " outsider , " a poor California Quaker who grew up feeling bitter resentment towards the elite " Eastern establishment . "
Nixon , for all his arch - conservatism , was surprisingly liberal on economic issues , enfuriating businessmen with statements like " We are all Keynesians now . "
He created a whole host of new agencies to regulate business , like the FDA , EPA and OSHA .
He signed the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts , which forced businesses to clean up their toxic emissions .
He imposed price controls to fight inflation , and took the nation fully off the gold standard .
Nixon also strengthened affirmative action .
Even his staffers were famously anti-elitist , like Kevin Philips , who would eventually write the bible on inequality during the 1980s , The Politics of Rich and Poor .
Add to this Nixon ’s withdrawal from Vietnam and Détente with China and the Soviet Union .
Nixon and his Secretary of State , Henry Kissinger , had not only tried to remove control of foreign policy from the CIA , but had also taken measures to bring the CIA itself under control .
Not surprisingly , Nixon and his CIA Director , Richard Helms , could n’t stand each other .
( Nixon fired him for failing to cover up for Watergate . )
Clearly , Nixon was fighting at cross-purposes with the CIA and the nation ’s elite .
As it turns out , the CIA had inside knowledge of Nixon ’s dirty work .
Nixon had created his own covert action team , " The Committee to Reelect the President , " more amusingly known by its acronym , CREEP .
The team consisted of two CIA agents  E. Howard Hunt and James McCord  as well as former FBI agent G. Gordon Liddy .
They also employed four Cubans with long CIA histories .
In fact , a CIA front called the Mullen Company funded their activities , which ranged from disrupting Democratic campaigns to laundering Nixon ’s illegal campaign contributions .
The CIA not only had intimate knowledge of Nixon ’s crimes , but it also acted as though it wanted the world to know them .
When the FBI began investigating Watergate , Nixon tried using the CIA to cover up for him .
At first the CIA half - heartedly complied , telling the FBI that the investigation would endanger CIA operations in Mexico .
But a few weeks later it gave the FBI a green light again to proceed again with their investigation .
Furthermore , Watergate was exposed by the CIA ’s main newspaper in America , The Washington Post .
One of the two journalists who investigated the scandal , Robert Woodward , had only recently become a journalist .
Previously Woodward had worked as a Naval intelligence liaison to the White House , privy to some of the nation ’s highest secrets .
He would later write a sympathetic portrait of CIA Director Bill Casey in a book entitled Veil : The Secret Wars of the CIA .
It was Woodward who personally knew and interviewed " Deep Throat , " the unnamed source who revealed inside information on Nixon ’s activities .
Many Watergate researchers consider one of Woodward ’s old intelligence contacts to be a prime candidate for Deep Throat . ( 15 )
Despite all the facts of CIA involvement , Woodward and Bernstein made virtually no mention of the CIA in their Watergate reporting .
Even during Senate hearings on Watergate , the CIA somehow managed to stay out of the spotlight .
In 1974 , the House would clear the CIA of any involvement in Watergate .
The CIA was not as lucky in 1974 , when the Senate held hearings on James Jesus Angleton ’s illegal surveillance of American citizens .
These disclosures resulted in his firing .
But that was nothing compared to the 1975 Church Committee .
This Senate investigation looked into virtually every type of CIA crime , from assassination to secret war to manipulating the domestic media .
The " reforms " that resulted from these hearings were mostly cosmetic , but the details that emerged shattered the CIA ’s reputation forever .
Interestingly enough , the two Senators who held these hearings  Frank Church and Otis Pike  were both defeated for reelection , despite a 98 percent reelection rate for incumbents .
The CIA was n’t the only conservative institution that found itself embattled in the early 70s .
This was a bad time for conservatives everywhere .
America had lost the war in Vietnam .
U.S. corporations had to cope with the rise of OPEC .
The anti-poverty programs of Roosevelt ’s New Deal and Johnson ’s Great Society were causing a major redistribution of wealth .
And Nixon was making things worse with his own anti-poverty and regulatory programs .
Between 1960 and 1973 , these efforts cut poverty in half , from 22 to 11 percent .
Meanwhile , between 1965 and 1976 , the richest 1 percent had gone from owning 37 percent of America ’s wealth to only 22 percent . ( 16 )
At a 1973 Conference Board meeting of top American business leaders , executives declared : " We are fighting for our lives , " " We are fighting a delaying action , " and " If we do n’t take action now , we will see our own demise .
We will evolve into another social democracy . " ( 17 )
The CIA to the rescue
In the mid-1970s , at this historic low point in American conservatism , the CIA began a major campaign to turn corporate fortunes around .
They did this in several ways .
First , they helped create numerous foundations to finance their domestic operations .
Even before 1973 , the CIA had co-opted the most famous ones , like the Ford , Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations .
But after 1973 , they created more .
One of their most notorious recruits was billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife .
During World War II , Scaife 's father served in the OSS , the forerunner of the CIA .
By his mid-twenties , both of Scaife 's parents had died , and he inherited a fortune under four foundations : the Carthage Foundation , the Sarah Scaife Foundation , the Scaife Family Foundations and the Allegheny Foundation .
In the early 1970s , Scaife was encouraged by CIA agent Frank Barnett to begin investing his fortune to fight the " Soviet menace . "
( 18 ) From 1973 to 1975 , Scaife ran Forum World Features , a foreign news service used as a front to disseminate CIA propaganda around the world .
Shortly afterwards he began donating millions to fund the New Right .
Scaife 's CIA roots are typical of those who head the new conservative foundations .
By 1994 the most active were :
Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation
Carthage Foundation
Earhart Foundation
Charles G. Koch
David H. Koch
Claude R. Lambe
Philip M. McKenna
J.M. Foundation
John M. Olin Foundation
Henry Salvatori Foundation
Sarah Scaife Foundation
Smith Richardson Foundation
$ 88.9 million for conservative scholarships ;
$ 79.2 million to enhance a national infrastructure of think tanks and advocacy groups ;
$ 16.3 million for alternative media outlets and watchdog groups ;
$ 10.5 million for conservative pro-market law firms ;
$ 9.3 million for regional and state think tanks and advocacy groups ;
$ 5.4 million to " organizations working to transform the nations social views and giving practices of the nation 's religious and philanthropic leaders . " ( 19 )
Besides creating foundations , the CIA helped organize the business community .
There have always been special interest groups representing business , like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers , and the CIA has long been involved with them .
However , after 1973 , a spate of powerful new groups would come into existence , like the Business Roundtable and the Trilateral Commission .
These organizations quickly became powerhouses in promoting the business agenda .
Their efforts clearly succeeded .
With the 1975 SUN - PAC decision , corporations persuaded government to legalize corporate Political Action Committees ( the lobbyist organizations that bribe our government ) .
By 1992 , corporations formed 67 percent of all PACs , and they donated 79 percent of all campaign contributions to political parties .
( 20 ) In two landmark elections  1980 and 1994  corporations gave heavily and one - sidedly to Republicans , turning one or both houses of Congress over to the GOP .
Democratic incumbents were shocked by the threat of being rolled completely out of power , so they quietly shifted to the right on economic issues , even though they continued a public façade of liberalism .
Corporations went ahead and donated to Democratic incumbents in all other elections , but only as long as they abandoned the interests of workers , consumers , minorities and the poor .
As expected , the new pro-corporate Congress passed laws favoring the rich : between 1975 and 1992 , the amount of national household wealth owned by the richest 1 percent soared from 22 to 42 percent . ( 21 )
The CIA also helped create the conservative think tank movement .
Prior to the 70s , think tanks spanned the political spectrum , with moderate think tanks receiving three times as much funding as conservative ones .
At these early think tanks , scholars typically brainstormed for creative solutions to policy problems .
This would all change after the rise of conservative foundations in the early 70s .
The Heritage Foundation opened its doors in 1973 , the recipient of $ 250,000 in seed money from the Coors Foundation .
A flood of conservative think tanks followed shortly thereafter , and by 1980 they overwhelmed the scene .
The new think tanks turned out to be little more than propaganda mills , rigging studies to " prove " that their corporate sponsors needed tax breaks , deregulation and other favors from government .
Of course , think - tank studies are useless without publicity , and here the CIA proved especially valuable .
Using propaganda techniques it had perfected at the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe , the CIA and its allies turned American AM radio into a haven for conservative talk show hosts .
Yes  Rush Limbaugh uses the same propaganda techniques that Muscovites once heard from Voice of America .
The CIA has also developed countless other media outlets , like Capital Cities ( which eventually bought ABC ) , major PR firms like Hill & Knowlton , and of course , all the Agency ’s connections in the national news media . ( 22 )
The following is a typical example of how the " New Media " operates .
As most political observers know , the Republicans suffer from a " gender gap , " in which women prefer Democrats by huge majorities .
This is , in fact , why Clinton has twice won the presidency .
But , curiously enough , as the 90s progressed , conservative female pundits began popping up everywhere in the media .
Hard - right pundits like Ann Coulter , Kellyanne Fitzpatrick , Laura Ingraham , Barbara Olson , Melinda Sidak , Anita Blair and Whitney Adams conditioned us to the idea of the conservative woman .
This phenomenon was no accident .
It turns out that Richard Mellon Scaife donated $ 450,000 over three years to the Independent Women 's Forum , a booking agency that heavily seeds such female conservative pundits into the media . ( 23 )
Conclusion
The most obvious criticism of the New Overclass is that their political machine is undemocratic .
Using subversive techniques once aimed at communists , and with all the money they ever need to succeed , the Overclass undemocratically controls our government , our media , and even a growing part of academia .
These institutions in turn allow the Overclass to control the supposedly " free " market .
It does n't win all the time , of course  witness Bill Clinton 's impeachment trial  but it does score an endless string of other victories elsewhere , all to the detriment of workers , consumers , women , minorities and the poor .
We need to fight it with everything we 've got .

Acer was the first company to release the AspireRevo which was a great success .
This upgraded model has excelled in the specs and style .
It will now come with Intel Atom 330 Processor instead of Atom N230 .
Moreover it has a hard disk of 500GB instead of 250 GB that was in old model .
The previous model was regarded as a complete desktop replacement , so this one will also act like one .
The new Atom 330 is a dual core processor with 1MB cache , 1.6 GHz clock speed and a 533 MHz FSB and will give 40 % increase in performance as compared to Intel Atom N230 .
It will be shipped with Windows Vista Home Premium , which I could n’t understand ; the nettop is perfectly capable of running Windows 7 and should be shipped with it rather the outdated Windows Vista .
See the complete list of Specs ( the upgrades are shown in bold ) :
Intel® Atom™ Processor 330 ( 1M Cache , 1.60 GHz , 533 MHz FSB )
Nvidia 9400M GPU
Up to 500GB of storage
Windows Vista Home Premium SP1
Up to 4GB DDR2 –800 ( dual channel )
6x USB 2.0
WiFi 802.11b/g/n

So how did the FBI uncover this giant circle of New Jersey corruption ?
It had a lot to do with Solomon Dwek , a pious family man who was considered a pillar of the community in Monmouth County , New Jersey …until 2006 , when he was charged with scheming to defraud banks of $ 50 million .
Dwek flipped , becoming a source for investigators .
He then spent the next three years wiretapping his way through what New Jersey acting US attorney Ralph Marra today called an " ethics - free zone . "

BELLEVILLE --
A couple was arrested last night on drug charges after they reported a home invasion to police , police said today .
At 11:30 p.m. , Devin Perdue , 29 , and his girlfriend Quisannah Noel , 27 , reported that their apartment at 98 Magnolia Street was invaded by two men while their 4 - year - old and 4 - month - old children were home , police said .
The couple said that one of the men hit Perdue on the side of the head with a handgun , which triggered the gun and lodged a bullet in a door jamb inside the house , said Capt .
Mark Minichini
.
Police became suspicious of the couple during the questioning , Minichini said , and obtained a search warrant .
Minichini said police found 10 pounds of marijuana , a money - counting machine , a handgun , almost $ 60,000 in cash and other paraphernalia around the house .
The two home invaders fled before the arrival of police , and Perdue 's head injury was minor .
Perdue and Noel were charged with possession of more than 50 grams of marijuana , possession of marijuana with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school and possession of a handgun .
They were being held at the Belleville police department awaiting bail .
The children are staying with Perdue 's mother .
Richard Kirk Architects have designed the Highgate Hill Residence in Brisbane , Australia .
Full description after the photos … .
The Highgate Hill Residence by Richard Kirk Architects :
The Highgate Hill Residence is located on a south facing ravine adjacent to one Brisbane ’s oldest ridgeline roads – Dornoch Terrace .
The steepness of the rectangular site has resulted in a verdant and mature landscape consisting of a mixture of native and exotics , which created the opportunity to place the house within a rich landscape environment .
As a result of the steepness of the site and the desire to connect the house to an outdoor ground plane the house adopts two distinct identities – the north ( landscape ) and east ( street ) is a diminutive floating single level volume hovering over fine steel pins – the south and west ( distant views ) the vertical and monumental character is revealed of the tall three level residence .
To the North and East , the living level embraces the landscape as the upper level hovers over the ground plane as a protective canopy .
In these areas where the building is more intimate , the materials and detailing are deliberately fine and diminutive .
Fine vertical timber members screen the building upper level to the street provide a public façade of a veil of timber screens that works as a series of layers laid over the building volume .
The upper level of the Northern walls have a façade of glazed vertical timber mullions or sticks which open the interior to the landscape and the filtered northern light through the tree canopy ’s .
To integrate the landscape with the living spaces on the middle level , the external openings are of a significant scale so that the internal floor plate opens up completely to the outdoor spaces that consist of a series of floating platforms of constructed ground planes of timber decking or turf .
To celebrate the transition from interior to exterior the east and north facing walls open completely via series of stacking sliding glazed timber panels .
The Southern and Western facades reveal the height of the building and engage with the distant views are more monumental and respond to the distant views .
The rectangular form of the house is organized over three levels with the middle level containing living and dining spaces and also the point of entry from the street .
The upper level contains all the bedrooms and a void that is located over the dining area .
The lower level contains a guest room and a media space .
The void within the house acts not only as a spatial device to orient and extenuate the verticality of the tall trees outside , but also separates bedrooms of the parents and children .
The stair is an important organizational reference between the levels and is treated as a sculptural element that twists slightly within the void to allow its form to visually link all levels .
In response to the dominance of the landscape , the house is entirely clad in timber and uses timber glazed façade systems where each species is selected to age in response to its orientation and weathering .

Many churches of different styles and denominations were built in the world , but the forms of some temples are so unusual that they deserve special attention .
Crystal Cathedral , the United States
The Protestant church in the Californian town Garden - Grove is made almost entirely of glass and its shape resembles a four - point crystal .
In the process of construction about 12 thousand glasses have been used , and inside is the world ’s largest organ , with 16 thousand pipes .
Hallgrímskirkja , Iceland
This unusual church , located in the center of Reykjavík , is the fourth highest building in Iceland , and at the same time the largest .
Its height is 74.5 meters and on the top of the tower there is an observation deck with a panoramic view of city located .
The church got its strange name in memory of the Icelandic clergy and poet Hallagrum Patterson , and its appearance , according to the creators , should resemble geysers , which are so many in Iceland .
The construction of the temple lasted for a long time , from 1945 to 1986 .
Jubilee , Italy
Another church , which does not fit any canon , is in Rome .
Its creator , Richard Meier , did not hesitate to call it “ the pride of Rome ” and the “ project of millennium ” .
The form of the building has religious overtones .
Three parallel arcs symbolize the Holy Trinity , and the smooth mirror surface before the church should remind of water , which is an important part of the ceremony of baptism .
St. Basil ’s Cathedral
The church , which has long been , along with the Kremlin , the symbol of Moscow and Russia , was built in the years 1555 - 1561 by the order of Ivan Grozny in honour of the capture of Kazan and the victory over the Kazan Khanate .
The author of the temple is unknown .
According to one version , it was Yakovlev Postnikov a master from Pskov , according to the others it was a Western - European ( probably , Italian ) , architect .
The legend has it that the Russian tsar ordered to blind the creator of the cathedral so that he would never be able to build anything even more beautiful .
Sagrada Familia , Spain
Antonio Gaudi ’s creation is perhaps one of the most famous unfinished , long - in - construction buildings in the world .
Started in 1882 , the construction is scheduled for completion in 2026 , on the 100th anniversary of the death of the great architect .
However , the dates have changed so many times that no one particularly believes in the newly appointed date .
Gaudi himself in answer to the question why it takes so long to erect the temple ( and he supervised the construction for over forty years ) - said : “ My customer is not in a hurry ” .
The Cathedral , Brazil
The construction of the unusual church in the capital of Brazil , was completed in 1970 .
The author , Oscar Neymer , created a structure consisting of asymmetric hyperbolic columns , each weighing 90 tons .
The form of the church symbolizes hands raised to heaven , to God .
They say that the Liverpool Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral served as a prototype for the temple .
If you are planning to go to Brasília , you can find affordable hotels to visit the unusual church and the other attractions the city has to offer .
Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral , United Kingdom
The cathedral was originally conceived as the second largest in the world , as opposed to the already existing in Liverpool Anglican Cathedral .
However , because of problems with financing the project of the construction changed four times and eventually has almost nothing in common with the original plan .
Duomo , Italy
The Cathedral of Milan is one of the largest in the world and the second in spaciousness after the Cathedral of St. Peter ’s in Rome .
The construction of the temple , which was begun in 1386 , lasted 600 years and was completed only at the beginning of the XIX century , when by the order of Napoleon the design of the façade was eventually finished .
Paraportiani , Greece
Located on the island of Mykonos , the church was built in 1425 , at the site of a lateral exit from the medieval fortress .
The word “ exit ” in Greek sounds like “ paraporti ” , therefore , the church was named Paraportiani .
The temple consists of 4 chapels on the lower level and one upstairs .
A part of the building was erected in 1425 , and the rest was completed in XVI - XVII centuries .
Kostnice , Czech Republic
The decoration of this Czech church , located on the outskirts of the small town of Kutna Gora , is made entirely of bones , and for this reason the church was called “ Church on the bones ” or Kostnice .
The temple was built on the territory of an ancient cemetery , closed in 1870 , and its interior is made from the remains of about 40 thousand people who were once buried here .
The author of the creation , the half - blind monk Frantisek Rint , was appointed with the task to “ sort ” the territory of the cemetery .
For that very end , he sorted the bones by size and shape , washed and whitened them , and then used them in the decoration of the temple .
Wat Pa Maha Chedi Kaew , Thailand
The Buddhist temple in the Thai province of Sisaket is built entirely of glass bottles , mainly after beer , left behind by tourists .
The monks began to collect glass back in the eighties of the last century .
The collected half a million bottles were enough not only for the construction of the temple , but also for the monastic dwellings and even a few houses for tourists .
Tin lids were also put to use – they have served for creating several panels depicting the Buddha .
The treasure - hunting company rejects the Spanish state 's claim to the haul A deep sea treasure - hunting company has been ordered by a US judge to hand over half a million gold and silver coins to the government of Spain .
The company , Odyssey Marine Exploration , raised the haul from a shipwreck in the Atlantic , suspected to be that of a Spanish naval vessel .
The Spanish government argued that the treasure formed part of the country 's national heritage .
But Odyssey intends to appeal , saying it has a claim to the treasure .
This is just the latest round of a long - running and sometimes murky dispute , says the BBC's Steve Kingstone in Madrid .
The haul of coins - thought to be worth some $ 500 m ( £ 308 m ) - came to light in 2007 , when Odyssey announced the recovery of artefacts from a wreck in the Atlantic .
It kept the location of the wreck secret , in what it said was an attempt to deter looters .
The haul was brought ashore in Gibraltar and quickly flown to Miami - enraging the Spanish government , our correspondent says , which says the wreck is that of the Mercedes , a naval frigate destroyed by the British in 1804 .
' Private property '
Just over a year ago , the Spanish government filed a suit with a federal court in Florida - where Odyssey is based - demanding the haul be handed over .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Late on Wednesday , a judge ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case , and that the property should be returned to Spain under a principle known as " sovereign immunity " .
Spain 's Culture Minister Angeles Gonzalez - Sinde expressed joy at the decision .
" It 's a very positive decision for the Spanish government and for all the Spanish citizens because it guarantees that this ship and the remains of this ship will come back to Spain , which was originally the owner of this ship , " he told the BBC .
" I am pretty sure that Spaniards will have the opportunity to travel back in time and to have a chance to see this treasure . "
But in a statement , Odyssey said it would appeal against the ruling .
The Nasdaq - listed company argues that there is no conclusive proof that the wreck is that of the Mercedes and that even if it is , much of the cargo on board the ship belonged to private individuals and not the Spanish state .
" I 'm confident that ultimately the judge or the appellate court will see the legal and evidentiary flaws in Spain 's claim , and we 'll be back to argue the merits of the case , " said the firm 's CEO , Greg Stemm .

Marwa Al - Sherbini : Killed For Wearing A Headscarf But At What Point Do We Say “ Enough ” ?
Let me break down this story to see if I have it right ( if anything , for my own sanity ) .
A 31 - year old , headscarf - wearing Egyptian Muslim woman , Marwa Al - Sherbini , who was about four months pregnant , takes her German neighbor to court for calling her a “ terrorist ” .
Now , in the courtroom , the neighbor , Alex W. , stabs her 18 times right in front of her 3 - year old son .
Her husband , a research fellow , tries to come to her rescue and ends up not only getting stabbed as well by the attacker , but is actually mistaken for the attacker and shot by the security guard .
This case was so mind - baffling when I read it a few days ago and I still have n’t been able to wrap my mind around it .
Many questions and thoughts have been floating around in my head , and I hate to admit it but the most pertinent one that rests right at the foreground of my brain is based on two words : 18 times .
I am not a forensic scientist but I ’ve seen enough Hollywood movies to know that stabbing someone 18 times is n’t a task that you get done in 5 or 10 seconds unless you ’re the cyborg or a robot sent from the future .
18 times .
How long did it take for people in the courtroom to realize this woman was being stabbed and that someone should do something about it ?
18 times .
Seriously , try stabbing the wind 18 times right now as quickly as possible .
Go ahead .
I ’ll wait .
See what I ’m saying ?
Oh , and add to that her husband getting stabbed three times by the same guy before the tragedy came to an end ( with the husband being shot ) .
Now I know this is a question that might seem silly or even absurd in light of this event .
I know a better debate is being framed elsewhere ( thanks to Egyptian bloggers ) .
I know that a great deal of the conversation that centers around this case has been with regards to the lack of western coverage ( what did they expect ? ) and the outrage in Egypt ( what did they expect ? ) and the outrage to come from the perhaps various parts of the Muslim world ( what did they expect ? ) or the rising Islamophobia in the West ( what did they expect ? ) , but while all these conversations are valid and have their own time and context to consider , for some reason , I remain mesmerized by this number : 18 .
18 times .
Strictly on a human level , how long does it take for someone to react .
To move .
To say “ stop ” .
To say “ enough ” .
Strictly on a human level .
No religion .
No gender .
Just a human being watching one human being slaughtered by another .
How long does it take ?
How does that number reach 18 ?
See , this is what ’s been getting to me lately .
In my head , this number , 18 , rings incredibly significant .
I recognize that there ’s evil in this world , and that there always will be .
There are breaking limits in this world and I recognize that too .
There are numbers that weigh heavy on the human soul , and every one has one .
It ’s unmistakable .
It ’s undeniable .
Often times we have absolutely no control over them and we relieve ourselves of any responsibilities .
Like Tolstoy would put it , we pretend to simply be kings who are slaves to the whims of history .
But often times , we do .
Often times , and not all the time , but some of the time , we do .
Often times these things happen right in front of us .
On our watch .
On our watch , these numbers take shape .
For Marwa Al - Sherbini that magical number was eighteen .
But what ’s the body count in Iraq today ?
What about the West Bank or Gaza ?
What about in Darfur ?
What ’s their magic number ?
What ’s their breaking limit ?
At what point do we say “ enough ” ?
More importantly .
At what point will we mean it ?
A robot has taught itself to smile , frown , and make other human facial expressions using machine learning .
To get the incredibly realistic Einstein robot to make facial expressions , researchers used to have to program each of its 31 artificial muscles individually through trial and error .
Now , computer scientists from the Machine Perception Laboratory at the University of California , San Diego have used machine learning to enable the robot to learn expressions on its own .
" The robotic approach is the ultimate in helping us understand learning and development , " said social development expert Daniel Messinger at the University of Miami , who was not involved with the Einstein research but collaborates with the group on another project .
" There ’s so much we can learn by actually trying to make it happen instead of just watching kids try to move their faces — it ’s like having a baby as opposed to just watching a baby . "
According to the researchers , who presented the project last month at the 2009 IEEE 8th International Conference on Development and Learning , this is the first time anyone has used machine learning to teach a robot to make realistic facial expressions .
To begin teaching the robot , the researchers stuck Einstein in front of a mirror and instructed the robot to " body babble " by contorting its face into random positions .
A video camera connected to facial recognition software gave the robot feedback :
When it made a movement that resembled a " real " expression , it received a reward signal .
" It 's an iterative process , " said facial recognition expert Marian Bartlett , a co-author of the study .
" It starts out completely random and then gets feedback .
Next time the robot picks an expression , there ’s a bias towards putting the motors in the right configuration . "
After the robot figured out the relationship between different muscle movements and known facial expressions , it started experimenting with new expressions , such as eyebrow narrowing .
The robot 's expressions are still a bit awkward , but the researchers say they 're working on ways to make them more realistic , as well experimenting with strategies besides " body babbling " that might speed up the learning process .
The group says its studious robot may even improve our understanding of how infants and children learn to make facial expressions .
" The idea is to try to understand some of the computational principles behind learning , " Bartlett said .
" Here the computational principle is reinforcement learning and active exploration , which may also be behind learning motor movements in an infant . "
The next step is to get the Einstein robot to start socializing .
Once the robot can mimic facial expressions in a social context , the researchers plan to use him in an " automatic tutoring " experiment .
" We 're putting facial expressions onto the robot so that he can engage with a pupil in a non-verbal manner and approximate one - on - one human tutoring as much as possible , " Bartlett said .
" Studies have shown that human one - on - one tutoring improves learning by as much as two standard deviations — we want to know how can you try to approximate that with robotic tutoring . "

Davies began with an “ optimistic ” estimate that if life exists on Mars , then it ’s probably in microbe form living at least 200 meters underground .
Since we do n’t have the prospect for drilling that deep into the planet for signs of life anytime soon .
Davies suggested that we should send in a nuclear missile then follow with a Viking - style lander to examine the resulting crater .
You can guess that there were a few objections .
Davies was quick to acknowledge other reasons against the plan ; many think it ’s a terrible suggestion because it involves “ an act of violence against a neighboring planet . ”
( “ What if they nuke us back ? ” asked Tegmark . )
But , added Davies , it was no worse than sending an unsterilizised probe up there , as we have already done .
( Tegmark : “ In other words , we ’ve already sent up bio weapons , so why not send up nukes ? )
Maulikh Parikh worried about the fallout , but Davies replied that the environment is already pretty radioactive .
Peter Byrne quipped that “ it would just mutate the Martians - - and turn them into us ! ”
Davies finished by lamenting that while he advocates the idea , he ’s found it hard to get support from others .
Glenn Starkman joked that a way to get support would be to explode a nuclear bomb on Earth first and just blame the Martians for it …
The idea was put to vote and it came back 50/50 .

By then , Tegmark had thought of an alternative use for any spare nuclear warheads that might be at the disposal of foundational physicists .
He proposed using it in an extension of the “
In the thought experiment ’s conventional form , a physicist hoping to test if parallel universes exist rigs up a “ quantum gun ” such that when the trigger is pulled it either fires or sticks based on the results of the measurement of the spin of a quantum particle .
She then points it at her head and pulls the trigger .
According to the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics , the universe splits in two each time the particle ’s spin is measured , with one universe corresponding to each outcome .
In one universe the physicist lives ; in the other she dies .
This continues each time she tries to kill herself .
So , if the physicist finds herself pulling the trigger again and again , and yet still living , it would serve as evidence for the many worlds interpretation .
( Please do not try this at home ! )
“ The problem with this , ” explained Tegmark , “ is that only the physicist is convinced . ”
To rectify this , Tegmark proposed sharing the joy of discovery by involving a larger number of people in the quantum game , using a quantum nuclear bomb rather than a quantum gun .
Strangely , nobody was keen to volunteer for such an experiment .
Tevian Dray let Tegmark down gently by explaining that “ in the current global financial climate , it may be best to combine both your experiment and Paul Davies ’-- we ’ll send you to Mars with the nuclear bomb and you can perform your quantum suicide experiment there . ”
Other speakers brave enough to talk on the beach were Tanmay Vaschaspati ( video footage to come ... ) and Lisi ( photo courtesy of Hyung Choi ) , who inkeeping with his desire to keep everything " exceotionally simple , " gave a cheap and cheerful 5 - minute derivation of quantum mechanics from information theory .

Yes , you read the title of this post correctly .
Yesterday at the FQXi conference , Paul Davies gave an argument for why we should detonate a nuclear bomb on Mars - - in an effort to _find_ life .
The light - hearted session was already fairly surreal -- taking place on the beach at Ribeira Quente rather than in a conference room , following an expedition to view whales and dolphins .
( The photo , courtesy of Hyung Choi , shows Tanmay Vachaspati and Paul Davies ( both standing on the right ) taking questions . )
Chairman ( deck - chairman ? )
Max Tegmark opened the floor ( sand ? ) for discussion of slightly off - the - wall ideas that could get people arguing and Davies obliged .
Davies began with an “ optimistic ” estimate that if life exists on Mars , then it ’s probably in microbe form living at least 200 meters underground .
Since we do n’t have the prospect for drilling that deep into the planet for signs of life anytime soon .
Davies suggested that we should send in a nuclear missile then follow with a Viking - style lander to examine the resulting crater .
You can guess that there were a few objections .
Garrett Lisi opened with the most obvious first question : “ Wo n’t the probe just show that Mars is a barren nuclear wasteland ? ”
No , says Davies , the missile wo n’t kill life deep underground , just uncover it .
Davies was quick to acknowledge other reasons against the plan ; many think it ’s a terrible suggestion because it involves “ an act of violence against a neighboring planet . ”

In the thought experiment ’s conventional form , a physicist hoping to test if parallel universes exist rigs up a “ quantum gun ” such that when the trigger is pulled it either fires or sticks based on the results of the measurement of the spin of a quantum particle .
She then points it at her head and pulls the trigger .
According to the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics , the universe splits in two each time the particle ’s spin is measured , with one universe corresponding to each outcome .
In one universe the physicist lives ; in the other she dies .
This continues each time she tries to kill herself .
So , if the physicist finds herself pulling the trigger again and again , and yet still living , it would serve as evidence for the many worlds interpretation .
( Please do not try this at home ! )
“ The problem with this , ” explained Tegmark , “ is that only the physicist is convinced . ”
To rectify this , Tegmark proposed sharing the joy of discovery by involving a larger number of people in the quantum game , using a quantum nuclear bomb rather than a quantum gun .
Strangely , nobody was keen to volunteer for such an experiment .
Tevian Dray let Tegmark down gently by explaining that “ in the current global financial climate , it may be best to combine both your experiment and Paul Davies ’-- we ’ll send you to Mars with the nuclear bomb and you can perform your quantum suicide experiment there .
” Other speakers brave enough to talk on the beach were Tanmay Vaschaspati ( video footage to come ... ) and Lisi ( photo courtesy of Hyung Choi ) , who inkeeping with his desire to keep everything " exceotionally simple , " gave a cheap and cheerful 5 - minute derivation of quantum mechanics from information theory .

What if , in some other dimension , nature closes all the contracts and those many worlds collapse back into one ?
Need to think this through , guys .

Last I heard the value of open contracts was over a quadrillion dollars , on a world economy that 's worth a fraction of that ?

The MWI idea of quantum suicide is a bit of a gamble .
Quantum interpretations are IMO meta- physical overlays .
We might indeed have a near infinte number of alternate lives that we enter into and experience all of them .
We are resurrected out of time , so to speak .
However , I would not bet one 's life on this .

Of course detonating nukes on mars violates the 1963 open air test ban treaty .
It really is not a good idea .

Why use a bomb ?
Launching radioactive material into space is dangerous .
It would be better to use an idea that is similar to deep impact .
It would need to be big , heavy and fast but it would create a huge crater without the need for nukes .

Of course this is rampant speculation , but I would imagine quantum suicide means you " start all over again . "
In other words , maybe your life starts again at the elementary quantum event that started your path integral .

Well , there are many interesting viewpoints here and in the thread in which Christi Stoica brought the dilemma of the MWI to the point ( " Ethics in the Many World 's Scenario " ) .
In a strictly deterministic multiverse all mutually exclusive brain - states are realized , even those in which i turn to be a mass murder instead of a brave citizen .
Besides the consequence of having no " free will " in a strictly deterministic multiverse , the MWI is in contrast to " objective " randomness of events because a sample of 10 consequtively surviving quantum suicide Maxes ( or nuclear bombs ) do n't really tell us if we live in a multiverse or not but could also tell us to live in a world that can generate * mysterious exceptions * of our best elaborated physical rules .
If so , one can ask if those rules are themselves only runaways of - not only probability rules - but even events that are not governed at all by statistics and therefore are * true random * in the sense of * no rules * .
Given enough time , all that can happen will happen , even infinitely many times if we ground this line of reasoning on * fairly sampled * probabilities .
If not , nobody can truly explain why something is happening , neither in the MWI scenario nor in the * no rules * scenario , because in the MWI scenario it 's hard to explain the initial conditions and the very existence of a probabilistic structure ( quantum mechanics ) with the help of probabilities ( the latter could also be true in some or all no - MWI - scenarios ) .

No , it would n't .
The fraction of surviving physicists would still be reduced by the same factor , and finding yourself to be one would be just as unlikely in the MWI as in a single - world interpretation .
The moral costs would be the same as well .

While I 'm ok with a multiverse of unique universes , I disagree with the MWI .
Short of ten thousand Jack 's knocking on my door , each with their own , universe leaping equipment , there is no way to definitively prove this .
It also fails the Occam 's Razor test because it 's easier and simpler just to say that an eigenstate is picked at random ; we 're all familiar with random events .
Furthermore , everytime a decision has to be made , another universe has to spring into existence ; this is a ridiculous violation of conservations of energy .
If the MWI interpretation is correct , I could build an Alcubierre hyperdrive with a never ending supply of new universes with which to convert into energy .
I think that those who embrace MWI are unwilling to admit that something cannot be known precisely .
Maybe it's a need for certainty or control .

If you like conservation laws and you want to pick the mathematically simplest interpretation of QM , then the MWI is actually what you want , on both counts .
The MWI is often mis-described in popular accounts , which is why you thought it violates conservation laws and so on .
As explained in my blog post
Ironically , unlike the MWI , random ' collapse ' would violate conservation laws as the wavefunction suddenly changes .
There is also no well - defined conditions under which it would occur .
It also would add a lot of complexity to the wave equation to introduce a collapse mechanic .
It is not at all simple to do so ; people have been trying for years and all approaches have problems .
Besides that , random numbers also have a lot of algorithmic complexity which deterministic systems do n't have , so while they may seem simple at first glance , a deeper look shows they are very much against Occam 's Razor .
Symmetry is simple .
Randomness is sudden violation of symmetry .

As explained in my blog post " Why MWI ? " , the MWI is nothing but the assumption that the wave equation of QM in configuration space is all there is to the dynamics .
" Branching " is just what happens when a lump of wavefunction splits up - like when a wave is partailly reflected - and the resultant lumps go seperate ways in configuration space .

Nice to know you ,
I read your discussions with Jason " the creative " , I try to understand why people focus on this interpretation of our laws where the time in reversible furthermore .
I wan't be pessimist about MWI but we can't mesure our quantum mechanic , where the mathematical and fundamental coherences and invariances are a physical reality .
If we analyze the determinism with this kind of extrapolations , how can we arrive to a good conclusion ?
It 's impossible !
Mr Everett and Mr Wheeler are competents , it 's evident , but is it a reason to accept all their extrapolations of the mind .
Let 's be pragmatic , the uniqueness of our universe is important , essential even .
The observation is the same for all observers if the synchronization is made with relativity of course .
Can we multiplicate like we want our imaginaries , yes but is it fundamental , it 's an other question .
That becomes sciences fiction after .
It 's the same with the superimposing .
I have an other point to say too .
How are going to interpret the people in fact .
The public , the society can interpret that bizarely .
And about the thermodynamics ???
The violation and inequalities are just an extrapolation of the mind in a whole point of vue , in our 3D and this time constant of evolution .
All needs limits foe the referential , the fundamental referential .
Our waves functions must be pragmatics in their superimposings in my opinion .
No No it 's impossible these multiverse or MWI , and if the 4 D strigs and branes completes these infinity of dimensions , oh my God .it lacks only the others imaginaries and it's the best book of sciences fiction never made .
Spielberg will love , it 's sure .

The MWI and the occult are identical in the sense that neither can be proved definitively .
You can't just create a whole other universe every time you decide what you want for breakfast .
I can't give the MWI any more credence than a shadow universe made out of discarded wavefunctions .
Nobody knows what it means to collapse a wave function .
If you insist that the wave function is still there , I have to ask you where it gets its energy from .
If it ca n't get a Big Bang 's worth of energy , then it has to exist as a shadowy universe of wavefunctions .
It 's not my intent to , in any way , belittle either of these points of view .
The occult has a tendency to fall short of measureable results ; yet it has the uncanny ability to leave behind a great many coincidences .
The only way I can reconcile a many worlds interpretation in an energetically reasonable way is to make such a connection .

The only way I can reconcile a many worlds interpretation in an energetically reasonable way is to make such a connection .

Energy is not an issue for the MWI , which is just the standard wave equation .
Anyone who knows physics knows that .
Obviously you do not know physics nor care to learn .

You disagree with the collapse of the wave function , in your own words , " it does n't work because generally speaking , in proposed models that give mathematical details of ' collapse ' , small residues remain in the other parts of the wavefunction .
Small or not , these residues still go through trajectories that should give rise to computations and thus observers - " So you argue that their are small residues of wave functions that still " go through trajectories " .
I think you mean that they still ' exist ' .
Then you said , " Each individual observer only notices a single classical - like world because that is the one associated with the motion of the peak giving rise to the computations of his own brain ; the others do n't have any effect on him . "
That statement alone is suggestive of my point .
Do you agree that the non-local nature of quantum mechanics is truly foundational ?
When we look closely enough into particle physics , we find that the ultimate reality looks like vibrating strings .
These vibrating strings have eigenstates .
In the classical point of view , all we see are the particular selection of eigenstates that were picked at random .
Since " collapse of the wavefunction " is awkward and leaves residue , let 's just say that the wavefunctions continue to evolve through all of the eigenstates .
As for the occult , yes I agree .
Most of them come across as nutty .
There is even the suggestion that logic and psychic phenomena are mutually exclusive .
That has been my experience .
But remember that the human brain constitutes a quantum system of its own .
People who are psychic are not analyzing their thoughts like logical people do .
They are following their instincts .
These instincts represent a set of successful survival skills billions of years in the making .
At the most basic rudimentary level , these instincts tell you who is not .
If evolution can use quantum mechanics to carry information between two people , enough to create a rapport that could lead to sex and children , why wouldm't it ?
I have personally experienced this kind of instinctive connection with someone else , over the phone , hundreds of miles away , in fact .
I could n't obtain detailed numeric information , but I could tell what kind of a person this was .
Physicists will dismiss such things as pure chance .
Then , they will talk about quantum mechanics and eigenstates as dice games .
If there are many worlds in your opinion , then how do the brains of everyone in these many worlds remain isolated from one another ?
How do you maintain isolation between your thoughts , and the thoughts of your other selves in these other universes ?
How do you restrict quantum entanglement between your thoughts , and the thoughts of someone nearby who you have a close affinity with ?
By the way , are all of your other selves in these other universes always in the same identical geographic location as you are ?

In a letter today to membership , embattled FIA chief and reported sex freak Max Mosley has confirmed he will not stand for re-election when his term as president of motorsport 's governing body ends in October .
Full letter below .

The 69 - year - old , who had last month hinted he might go back on an earlier decision to stand down , revealed his decision in a letter to FIA members .
" I have decided to reconfirm my decision - I will not be a candidate in October , " Mosley wrote .
Advertisement
Mosley has endorsed former Ferrari team boss Jean Todt as his successor .
Yes , because luckily Todt 's wo n't , you know , be rooting for any one team , right ?
Oh wait , yeah , he might be .
We 've received a copy of the letter from FIA and have republished images of the scanned PDF file below along with a quick biography on Mosley .
Click next to read through the whole shebang .
Max Rufus Mosley ( born 13 April 1940 ) is president of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile ( FIA ) , a non-profit association that represents the interests of motoring organisations and car users worldwide .
The FIA is also the governing body for Formula One and other international motorsports .

A former barrister and amateur racing driver , Mosley was a founder and co-owner of March Engineering , a successful racing car constructor and Formula One racing team .
He looked after legal and commercial issues for the company between 1969 and 1977 .
In the late 1970s , Mosley became the official legal adviser to the Formula One Constructors Association ( FOCA ) , the body which represents Formula One constructors .
In this role he drew up the first version of the Concorde Agreement , which settled a long - standing dispute between FOCA and the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile ( FISA ) , the then governing body of Formula One .
Mosley was elected president of FISA in 1991 and became president of the FIA , FISA 's parent body , in 1993 .
Mosley has identified his major achievement as FIA President as the promotion of the European New Car Assessment Programme ( Euro NCAP or Encap ) , a European car safety performance assessment programme .
He has also promoted increased safety and the use of green technologies in motor racing .
In 2008 , stories about his sex life appeared in the British press .
Despite the controversy , Mosley retained his position .
Mosley is the son of Oswald Mosley , former leader of the British Union of Fascists ( BUF ) , and Diana Mitford .
He was educated in France , Germany and Britain before going on to attend university at Christ Church , Oxford , where he graduated with a degree in physics .
In his teens and early twenties Mosley was involved with his father 's post - war political party , the Union Movement ( UM ) .
He has said that the association of his surname with fascism stopped him from developing his interest in politics further , although he briefly worked for the Conservative Party in the early 1980s .

I was chatting with a friend over dinner this weekend about the impact of work environment on one 's ability to excel as a software developer .
We 've both worked for companies where we 've had to work far more than 40 hours each week for extended periods of time .
We both agreed that 's a good way to burn out your staff and , more importantly , a bad way to get stuff done faster .
Sure , you can do an intense sprint now and then , but you do n't win a marathon by running full out the whole way .
The comparison I came up with was that writing software is a lot like writing literature .
It takes both discipline and creativity .
Having either of those attributes will only get you so far ( though it will probably put you ahead of most of the pack ) .
To truly excel you must have both .
Discipline is not about putting in long hours ( well sometimes it is , but that 's not what I 'm talking about ) .
Discipline is about consistency .
It 's like playing blackjack and counting cards - your system wo n't pay off on every hand , but over time you will reap the rewards .
Agile development is very much about that kind of discipline .
You write your tests , go red , go green , refactor .
This aspect of software is craftwork .
It 's methodical .
It 's not very exciting , but it gets you from point A to point B , and for the most part it 's predictable .
Putting in 60 + hours a week is not good for your creative output .
Being creative requires a brain that is rested and energized .
It also takes mixing things up , changing perspective frequently .
Burnout is the enemy !
Sometimes when I 'm stuck I 'll get up and walk around the office , have a 5 minute chat with someone about something random .
When I get back to my desk I can deal with the issue much better .
Or if my pair and I get stuck , we 'll put the story on hold for a little bit and tackle something tiny that lets us reset our perspective .
That sort of thing usually helps a lot .
We know enough not to try something really tough late in the day , and sometimes we save doing a fun story as a reward for finishing something that 's no fun at all .
Our brains naturally have attention spans that are too short to keep up with what we ask of them .
Learn how to work with your brain instead of forcing it to do something it 's not suited for .
There is a balance , and a way that discipline and working creatively mesh .
Find a rhythm that works and that you can sustain , then stick with it .
Back when I was trying to write science fiction , I got to talk to Cory Doctorow about his practice of writing .
His advice was to write a page every day , then send it to people to get feedback .
Pretty simple , eh ?
Cory produces a lot of fiction and I find it shocking that he only does a page a day .
But a page a day lets him do a novel and a few short stories in a year , which is a lot more than I ever wrote when I was trying .
I think he can probably keep that pace up forever .
Sustainable pace wins .
One of the things I like best about working at Pivotal is that we consistently work at a sustainable pace .
I can't believe how many startups advertise jobs where they say that they expect you to work " startup hours " .
I wo n't even consider working at a place like that ever again .
It 's not just because I do n't like working that way myself , but because I think companies that expect and require that kind of pace from their developers are just going to screw themselves and burn out their developers .
They 'll either get real about what they can sustain , fail , or figure out how to deal with a high attrition / turnover rate .
Then there are companies that have no discipline and rely only on their " rock star " developers being able to come up with one inspired solution after another .
Now , inspiration is great , but it does n't get you even halfway there .
People do n't pay you for your ideas ; they pay you for how you execute on them .
If all you ever did was sit around and think up great solutions for difficult problems , you would n't ever get anything done .
And if all you ever did was play Rock Band , you might be very inspired but you 'd never finish writing Duke Nukem Forever .
As an ENTP ( the personality type , not the company ) , working in a team is the only way I can consistently get things done over a long period .
I can be super productive working with other people , but working on my own can be very challenging for more than a short time .
It 's much easier to keep up my discipline when I 'm pairing since that helps me stay focused , and I can be very creative too , since I think better out loud .
I know that way does n't work for everyone , but it sure does for me .
I also love tools like Pivotal Tracker that let me easily see what I have to work on next so I do n't have to keep figuring it out every time I finish a task and need something else to do .
On the other hand , I 'm not a Calendar - About - Nothing kind of guy .
That 's enough philosophy for the evening .
But I 'm curious to hear what other people feel about the interaction of discipline and creativity .

Although Harry Truman left office widely disliked and dismissed more than half a century ago , the effort to resurrect his reputation is now a thriving industry , with politicians and pundits of all stripes trying to tie themselves to the tough , blunt old cold warrior .
Contributing to this effort , the husband - and - wife team Allis and Ronald Radosh have written “ A Safe Haven , ” the story of Truman ’s integral role in the birth of Israel .
While some of Truman ’s foreign policy accomplishments — the creation of the Marshall Plan , the United Nations and NATO , and his defiance of the Soviets — have gotten the credit they deserve , the Radoshes say , his involvement in the creation of Israel remains overlooked .
That may not be quite right .
Most modern histories already acknowledge Truman ’s early support of the Jewish state ; it ’s hard to overlook the fact that he recognized newborn Israel just 10 minutes after its delivery .
That said , what these histories do n’t recognize — and here ’s where the Radoshes make their contribution — is just how hard Truman had to work to get there , battling enemies , allies and many in his own administration to make certain that Israel made it to independence with American backing .
It was , as the Radoshes make clear , a long , tough slog .
Truman , who fell into the presidency unprepared after the death of Franklin Roosevelt , inherited a mess in the Middle East .
The suave and urbane Roosevelt ( one of the Radoshes ’ villains ) had pursued a policy of “ obfuscation ” on Palestine , assuring both Jews and Arabs that he was sensitive to their concerns .
This meant that on taking office , Truman had to deal with a tangle of contradictory commitments .
He also had to face down two implacable opponents of Jewish statehood : Great Britain , the colonial power in Palestine , and his own State Department , which bitterly opposed granting the Jews a homeland .
Image Credit ... From “ a Safe Haven ”
Yet Truman — a biblical literalist and a Christian Zionist — had long been a fierce believer in Jewish statehood for reasons both religious and moral .
The Old Testament said that Jews belonged in Israel .
And Truman was appalled by the Holocaust ( which gave him nightmares ) , as well as by the scandalously poor treatment of postwar Jewish refugees in European displaced - persons camps .
And so this “ simple man ” waged a long and often bitter diplomatic campaign to help ensure that the Jews got a country of their own .
Sticklebacks are found in fresh and marine water environments in Europe , Asia , and North America , and feed on shrimps and fish larvae
Sticklebacks could be the " geniuses " of the fish world , after experts found the breed displays a sophisticated learning technique never before seen in animals .
They have found the way fish learn could be much closer to the human way of thinking than previously thought .
The St Andrews University study shows nine - spined sticklebacks can watch others to make better choices .
The ability to pick the best food patch by comparing how successful others are has not been shown before in animals .
They tested the reactions of 270 nine - spined stickleback fish and found many of them could compare the behaviour of other sticklebacks with their own experience and choose which fish to copy in order to find more food .
" It 's remarkable that a form of learning found to be optimal in humans is exactly what these fish do
Professor Kevin Laland
St Andrews University
The study , published in the journal Behavioral Ecology , authors say their findings suggest the fish might have a capability known as , " hill - climbing " strategy which humans have but has not yet been found in other animals .
Co-author Professor Kevin Laland from the school of biology at St Andrews University said : " Nine - spined sticklebacks may be the geniuses of the fish world .
" It 's remarkable that a form of learning found to be optimal in humans is exactly what these fish do . "
Researchers at St Andrews and Durham Universities put the fish in an aquarium and gave them worms from two feeders at either end of the tank .
They initially preferred the feeder that was giving them more worms .
Researchers then fed the fish more worms from the second feeder at the other end of the tank .
The first group of fish were allowed to watch other fish feed before feeding themselves .
About 75 % of fish were ' clever ' enough to know from watching the other fish that the feeder they had previously found to give them fewer worms was now giving out more and went for the second feeder .
Food preferences
However , if the fish observed that the feeders were giving roughly the same amount of food they did not copy the other fish and stuck with their own choice .
The scientists say the findings contribute to the understanding of brain evolution and the types of brain required for certain cognitive functions , both in humans and animals .
Lead author Dr Jeremy Kendal from Durham University 's anthropology department , said : " Lots of animals observe more experienced peers and that way gain foraging skills , develop food preferences , and learn how to evade predators .
" But it is not always a recipe for success to simply copy someone .
" Animals are often better off being selective about when and who they copy .
" These fish are obviously not at all closely related to humans , yet they have this human ability to only copy when the pay off is better than their own .

They make train robberies look so easy in the movies , do n't they ?
You jump on to a train with guns a - blazin ' and a bandana covering your face , rob the safe and jump off , never to be caught .
But in real life , the gangs who robbed trains were almost always caught and brought to justice .
Here are a few of their stories .
Jesse James ' First Train Robbery
On July 21 , 1873 , Jesse James and the James - Younger Gang robbed their first train in Adair , Iowa , of all places .
They managed to derail the Rock Island train , turning the train on its side , killing the engineer and injuring a lot of its passengers .
But that was n't enough terror for the passengers - the James - Younger Gang , clad in Ku Klux Klan garb , went up and down the length of the overturned train confronting them and demanding their watches and valuables ( although some reports say they stole only from the men ) .
They threw it all in bags along with the money from the train 's safe and ended up getting about $ 3,000 .
This was a bit unusual for Jesse James and his crew ; after that they mostly stuck to robbing the express safe in the baggage car and left the passengers alone .
Even though the gang killed the engineer of the train and wounded several passengers , Adair does n't hold it against him - every July , they have " Jesse James Days , " where they reenact the train robbery and celebrate with a parade and other festivities .

The Great Gold Robbery of 1855
One of the biggest train robberies of all time took place not in the American Old West , but in London , England .
On May 15 , 1855 , three boxes of gold were put on a car on a South Eastern Railway train headed from England to Boulogne , France .
The boxes were sealed , shut with iron bars , and locked with locks which had keys held by only a few trusted people .
The problem ?
When the boxes reached their destination , one of them was a lot lighter than it should have been .
Upon closer inspection , it was discovered that somehow , someone had substituted lead shot for gold .
Police had no clue what had happened and a two - month investigation ensued .
Hundreds of people were questioned without any hope of a lead , but by August , suspicion fell on Edward Agar .
Agar was sent to prison for passing a fake check , but wanted to make sure that the mother of his child had money to provide for the young one .
He informed her that she would be receiving £ 7,000 from a colleague of his , and when the money did n't show , he blew the whistle on the whole operation .
He and the colleague , William Pierce , had hatched a complicated plot to steal the gold years earlier .
They involved a clerk in the railway office when they found out that he briefly had possession of the keys that locked the boxes the gold was sealed in ; the clerk was able to get the keys to Agar who made an impression of them in wax and later had the keys replicated .
There was a second key to the safes that was n't quite as easy to get .
Agar ended up sending a £ 200 box of bullion on the same route ( under an assumed name , of course ) , then showed up to collect it and watched the clerk carefully to see where he got the second key to the safe .
Turned out it was n't quite as complicated as they thought - the key was simply stored in a cupboard that was n't very well guarded at all .
When the time came , Agar and Pierce strolled right into the office when it was unoccupied and made a quick wax imprint of the key .
They brought the lead shot onto the train in carpet bags ;
Pierce got into a first class carriage and Agar boarded with the train 's guard , James Burgess , who was in on the whole thing .
Agar took the iron bars off with a mallet and chisel , replaced the gold bars with lead shot , replaced the iron bars and stuck a new wax seal on the box to make it look like it had never been tampered with .
When Agar turned Pierce in , police recovered about £ 2,000 of the £ 12,000 worth of gold stolen .
Michael Crichton later based his novel The Great Train Robbery on the incident , which was turned into a movie starring Sean Connery as William Pierce .

The First Known Train Robbery in the U.S .
On October 6 , 1866 , the Reno brothers jumped onto an Ohio and Mississippi Railway train in Indiana and emptied one of the safes .
They tossed another one out the window so they could take it with them , and then they jumped off of the train , completing the first train robbery in the United States .
It was definitely a catching trend - in the two weeks following the Reno brothers ' first moving holdup , two more trains were robbed .
A passenger testified that he saw the faces of two of the robbers from the first holdup , but after he was shot and killed , other passengers clammed up and none of the burglars were charged .
At least , not at that time .
After their fifth robbery a couple of years later , the Pinkertons finally caught up with the Reno brothers .
Ten agents were waiting on the train to bust the boys , and although most of them escaped , they were arrested the next day .
Some members of the gang were hanged , but a lynch mob got to the others before official justice could be served .
The Great Train Robbery of 1963
The '60s in England - you think of the Beatles and Twiggy , not train robberies , right ?
But one of the biggest train robberies in the history of the U.K. actually took place on August 8 , 1963 .
A gang consisting of 15 guys hijacked the Royal Mail train going from Glasgow to London and stole the contents of the High Value Package - a carriage containing registered mail with cash contents .
The robbers planned this carefully ; normally the HVP carriage only carried about £ 300,000 , but since there had been a bank holiday and this was the first shipment following it , the amount was much more than usual - about £ 2.3 million .
They did so with no weapons other than an iron bar , which was used to hit the driver of the train on the head .
They did n't pull it off , though - the gang left the train rife with fingerprints , and left all kinds of evidence littered about the farmhouse they took refuge in for five days in Buckinghamshire .
Not only were fingerprints found , they were allegedly found on a Monopoly board that the robbers had used to amuse themselves with while they were holed up .
They used real money , of course .
13 of the gang members were eventually caught ( that 's a few of them in the picture ) , although at least one of them did n't stay caught for long .
Ronnie Biggs escaped about 15 months into his prison sentence and moved to Paris , where he had plastic surgery .
Then he moved to Australia and lived under the radar for quite a few years , until his identity was exposed , forcing him to move to Brazil .
He lived there until 2001 , when a series of strokes made him want to return to England to buy a proper pint before he died , although most people suspect he wanted the healthcare .
He was returned to jail to finish out his sentence and is still there - Biggs was just denied parole on July 2 because the Justice Secretary felt that " Mr. Biggs is wholly unrepentant . "

The Train Robbery that Brought Down George Parrot
Big Nose George Parrot sounds like a character on Sesame Street or something , but he was the furthest thing from it .
Big Nose George was a train robber who did n't mind killing to get what he wanted .
He had done just that in 1878 - after a botched train robbery , Parrot and his gang killed two men - a Union Pacific detective and the Wyoming deputy sheriff .
The gang then robbed the corpses of their two victims , including one of their horses , and took off .
Word of the double murders got around fast and a $ 20,000 reward was offered for apprehending the killers .
They were , indeed , apprehended .
Big Nose George Parrot was supposed to be hanged , but after he tried to escape , a lynch mob hunted him down and strung him up themselves .
" It 's a lynch mob , " you might be thinking , " They 're prone to extreme behavior . "
But the doctors were n't any better - Parrot 's skull cap was sawed off and given to the doctor 's 15 - year - old assistant , Lilian Heath .
Throughout her life she used it as a pen holder , a doorstop and an ashtray .
The doctor made a pair of shoes and a medical bag out of Parrot 's skin and he allegedly wore the shoes to his inaugural ball a year later when he was elected the first Democratic Governor of Wyoming .
You can still see the shoes - they 're on display at the Carbon County Museum in Rawlins , Wyoming .

and im not gonna put alaskans through that
i promised efficiency
and effectiveness
thats not how im wired
im not wired to operate
under the same old politics as usual
i promised that four years ago
and i meant it
it thats not what is best for alaska at this time
im determined to take the right path for alaska
even though it is unconventional
and its not so comfortable
with this announcement
that im not seeking reelection
ive determined its best to
transfer the authority of governor
to lieutenant governor parnell
and i am willing to do this
so that this administration
with its positive agenda
and its accomplishments
and its successful road to
an incredible future for alaska
so that it can continue without interruption
and with great administrative and legislative success
my choice is to take a stand and effect change
and not just hit our head against the wall
and watch valuable state time and money
millions of your dollars go down the drain
in this new political environment
rather we know we can effect positive change
outside government at this moment in time
on another scale
and actually make a difference for our priorities
and so we will for alaskans
and for americans
lemme go back quickly to a comfortable analogy for me
and thats sports
basketball
and i use it because you are naive
if you dont see a full court press from the national level
picking away right now
a good point guard heres what she does
she drives through a full court press
protecting the ball
keeping her head
up because she needs to keep her eye on the basket
and she knows exactly when to pass the ball
so that the team can win
and that is what im doing
keeping our eye on the ball
that represents sound priorities
remember they include energy independence and smaller government
and national security and freedom
and i know when its time to pass the ball
for victory
and ive given my reasons now
very candidly
truthfully
and my last day wont be for another few weeks so
the transition will be very smooth
in fact we look forward to swearing in sean parnell
up there in fairbanks at the conclusion
of our governors picnic at the end of the month
and i really dont want to disappoint anyone with this announcement
not with the decision that i have made
all that i can ask is that you trust me with this decision
and know that it is no more politics as usual
and some alaskans it seemed today
maybe they dont mind wasting public dollars and state time
but i do
and i cannot stand here as your governor
and allow the millions of dollars and all that time go to waste
just so i can hold the title of governor
and i dont know if my children are gonna allow it anyway
some are gonna question the timing of this
and let me just say
this decision has been in the works for a while
in fact this decision comes after much consideration
prayer and consideration
and finally i polled the most important people in my life
my kids
where the count was unanimous
well in response to asking hey do you want
make a positive difference and
fight for all our childrens future
from outside the governors office
it was four yesses
and one hell yeah
and the hell yeah sealed it
and some day ill talk about the details of that
i think though much of it for the kids
had to do with
recently seeing
their baby brother trigg
mocked and ridiculed by some pretty mean spirited adults
recently
and by the way i sure wish folks could ever understand
all that we can learn all of us from someone like trigg
i know he needs me
but i know that i need him even more
and what a child can offer to set priorities right
know that time is precious
the world needs more triggs not fewer
my decision was also fortified
during this most recent trip to kosovo and landstuhl
to visit our wounded soldiers overseas
those who truly sacrifice themselves
in war for our freedom and our security
and we can all learn from our selfless selfless troops
theyre bold and they dont give up and they
take a stand and they
know that life is short
so they choose not to waste time
they choose to be productive and serve something greater than self
and to build up their families and their states and our great country
these troops and their important missions now
there is where truly the worthy causes are in this world
and thats where our public resources should be
our public priority
with time and resources spent on that
not on this superficial
wasteful
political bloodsport
so may we all learn from them
really weve just gotta put first things first
and first things first as governor
i love my job
and i love alaska
and it hurts to make this choice
but im doing whats best for alaska
and i have explained why
though i think of the saying on my parents refrigerator
a little magnet that says
dont explain
your friends dont need it
and your enemies wont believe you anyway
but ive given my reasons
its no more politics as usual
and im taking my fight for whats right
for alaska
in a new direction
now despite this i dont want any one
any alaskan
dissuaded from entering politics
after seeing this real climate change
that began in august
no we need hardworking average americans
fighting for whats right
and i will support you
because we need you
and you can effect change
and i can too
on the outside
we need those who will respect our constitution
where government is supposed to serve from the bottom up
and not move toward this top down big government takeover
but rather
will be protectors of individual rights
who also have enough common sense to acknowledge
when conditions have drastically changed
and theyre willing to call an audible
and pass the ball when its time
so the team can win
and thats what im doing
remember alaska
america is now more than ever
looking north to the future
and itll be good
so god bless you
and from me and from my family
to all alaska
you have my heart
and were gonna be in really great hands
the capable hands
of our lieutenant governor sean parnell
and lieutenant general craig campbell
then will assume the role of lieutenant governor
and its my promise to you that
i will always be standing by ready to assist
we have a good positive agenda for alaska
take the words of general macarthur
he said
we are not retreating
we are advancing
in another direction
so with that imonna hand this over
to our good lieutenant governor
and again i say thank you
and god bless you alaska
Here is a very rough rendering of what I am working on .
This is a 2 person self balancing cycle .
I have seen similar examples of this elsewhere , but mine is on a smaller scale .
My goal is to make it very easy to make and cost less than $ 100 .
It self balances because the weight is below the center of the axle .
The pedals will connect to the wheels via chain .
Each person controls one wheel .
Pedal to together and you go straight .
Go opposite and you spin in place , etc .
I will probably make some form of disc brake for each wheel .
Not shown are casters that will contact the ground to prevent rollover on sudden starts or stops .
I am going to start at a scale for kids ( about 5 ' tall max ) .
See the snapshot of the Sketchup drawing of the basic concept .
Here is a link to the Sketchup ( Ver 7 ) file .
Update 5/3/09
Chip are flying .
I cut one side , the seat bottom and the seat back .
The size and fit of the seat was my biggest risk area .
I used the Universe Cycle as a stand in for some pedals .
The size looks good .
It appears wider than I thought it would .
To keep the costs down I am using BC exterior plywood .
3/4 " for the sides and 1/2 " for the seat .
I routed a lot of slots in the parts to give it a lighter look .
It might save a little weight , but I think it will look a lot better .
I designed some gears and a piston thing for the sides .
See the new 3D view .
A lot of the mechanical parts are on order from Surplus Center .
They should be here by Tuesday .
Update 5/5/09
Have the basic chassis cut .
See the picture .
Got the mechanical parts from surplus center .
Added a picture of my shop .

Lesson # 278 - Creationism
Let 's accept the idea , just for the sake of this argument , that God - some god , any god - created man .
Now , regardless of what you actually believe , you have to accept that the overall intricacy of the human body is amazing and practically a work of art by whoever created it .
The way blood is transported throughout the body , the control that the brain employs over the entire body despite its incredible reliance on each fragile lobe , how neurons fire messages across synapses to direct movement and nerves , the multitude of organs and their functions , the body 's capability for self - repair - even for people who hate biology , we have to admit we are completely amazed at the entire scope of the human body .
The fact that there are so many details that sciencestill has n't figured out is truly beyond comprehension .
So now , we 're accepting that the human body is a work of art , and that God created man .
Now , there are just a number of examples of development among other species - indications where we can see how some creatures developed through time to become the animals that live among us today .
Similarities in bone structure between turtles and horses and bats , the natural geographical distribution of related species like the hundred kangaroo species in Australia in the absence of dogs and cats , the fact that a man 's DNA is ninety percent identical to a baboon - just a number of scientific points exist which would certainly suggest evolution is a possibility .
This is the part of the argument where the opposing sides seem to falter over .
While there may be seemingly obvious linkage between the development of different species , creationists can't seem to accept that man may have developed from species that exists before man came into being because God is excluded from the argument .
Meanwhile , in the search of perfect scientific answers , evolutionists immediately have to set aside God from the argument in order to remove a fallback answer when they can't come up with an easy conclusion .
After completely considering both sides of the argument , here 's the point that we come to - if God did go to such work to create the complex system that is man , suggesting that he certainly has some appreciation for science , why would he just jump in and create ?
Would n't that just seem like cheating ?
With the way that the entire world is , it just seems inconceivable to us that God would go to all this effort to create each species individually without linking them together .
In fact , it seems much more likely that God would actually want something like evolution as a greater work of scientific art .
It 's not an easy conclusion to come to - the problem with the argument of creationism is that it 's just an easy fallback position to escape the study of science and the possibility that perfect evolutionary proof might exist .
And when you have to rationalize potentially opposing beliefs , to us , it just seems like God would be working to promote evolution .
Who knows .
We just believe you have to keep an open mind , and that outright open rejection of science is n't the way to go about it .
WASHINGTON 
At one time , airline safety generally meant one thing : avoiding a crash .
But safety regulators are increasingly focusing on surviving one .
Starting this fall , all new airplanes will be required to have seats that will stay in place when subjected to stresses up to 16 times the force of gravity .
The old seats had to meet stresses of only nine times the force of gravity .
And , in a safety measure borrowed from automobiles , some seats will be equipped with air bags .
The combination of sturdy seats and air bags means that if a plane touches down short of the runway or rolls off the end of the runway and hits an obstruction , “ You ’re going to be conscious .
You ’re going to have the opportunity to survive , ” said Bill Hagan , president of AmSafe , which makes the air bags .
In some airline crashes , the strength of the seats is irrelevant because the crash is not what the engineers call “ survivable . ”
In other crashes , still violent but not as much so as exploding in midair or breaking up in flight , the passengers ’ survival depends on suffering little or no injury in the first phase of the accident , as when a plane runs off the runway , and then getting out of the plane quickly to avoid a postcrash fire .
We use billions of plastic bottles every year , at a huge environmental expense .
Sure , you can recycle them and feel a bit better knowing that they ’ll be turned into products like Ecospun felt , but recycling requires energy and raw materials and not all plastics can even be recycled .
Why not divert all that plastic from the waste stream entirely by turning those old bottles into something new ?
Here are ten plastic bottle craft ideas to get you going !
So I ’m pretty confident that you guys have done some plastic bottle crafting of your own .
What sorts of things have you made with your empties ?

Suppose you wanted to do something rash like release a new version of some important piece of infrastructure like Cabal , haddock or indeed ghc itself .
Of course you worry that your sparkling new release might have hidden regressions .
If only you could check that you 're not breaking anyone 's code .
Well , you can !
We can use the cabal command line tool to do regression testing .
Basically we build all of Hackage with the old and new releases and then we compare the build reports to find regressions .
Simple !
Let 's look at the details ...
The consistent subset of Hackage
At first you might think that we can just build all of hackage by making a list and asking cabal to install them all .
It 's not quite that simple .
For one thing , some packages on hackage are simply impossible to install .
Some are just missing dependencies ( there are a small number of packages on Hackage that are best described as completely borked ) .
A bigger problem however is that in general it is not possible to install all the packages together consistently .
Remember that cabal tries really hard to make sure that in each set of packages it installs there is at most one version of each package .
But on Hackage there are some packages that need HaXml - 1.13.x and some need HaXml - 1.19.x .
What are we to do ?
Sadly , we just have to pick one and chuck out the packages that require the version we did n't pick .
But there are over 1,000 packages on Hackage !
How do we find the set that we can install consistently .
Yeah , it 's a bit time consuming .
Sorry .
I 'll show you how to do it though .
I talked recently about how we might be able to automate this .
Might even be doable as part of a GSoC project , who knows .
The algorithm is to start with all packages on Hackage :
cabal update cabal list -- simple - output | \ cut - d ' ' - f1 | uniq > pkgs
Now we ask cabal to try installing all of these :
cabal install $ ( cat pkgs ) -- dry -v
In truth , cabal list also lists packages that you 've got installed but are not on hackage .
So the first thing you 'll have to do is remove any of those .
For example :
There is no package named rts
Well , there is , but it 's not on Hackage , so remove it from the pkgs file and try again .
After that you 'll get the packages that simply cannot be installed because they 're borked .
It 's an iterative process .
You cast out packages that can not be installed .
It soon gets onto the more interesting cases : dependency conflicts .
That 's like the HaXml - 1.13.x vs HaXml - 1.19.x issue I mentioned earlier .
You can add constraints in your package list file for example :
HaXml==1.13 .*
When I did this recently for the Cabal - 1.6.0.2 release it looked to me like more packages would build if we picked the stable 1.13.x release rather than the development 1.19.x release .
Similarly I ended up adding these constraints :
HTTP < 4000 funsat < 0.5.1 parse - dimacs < 1.2 parsec < 3 regex - base < 0.80 regex - compat<0.80 regex- posix <0.80 rss<3000.1 xml-parsec <1.0.3
The list of packages I had to chuck out is rather longer .
When I did this for Cabal - 1.6.0.2 there were 1072 packages in my initial list and in then end I had to whittle it down to 985 before I could get a consistent solution .
If you actually try this then you 'll notice that it soon gets annoying waiting for the cabal dependency resolver .
I 'll let you in on a secret .
If you turn off the assertion checking in the resolver then it's about a bazillion times quicker .
See the - fno - ignore - asserts in the cabal - install.cabal file ?
Leave that out and compile with - O and it 's really much quicker .
But shhh !
Do n't tell everyone !
I sleep much better at night knowing that all the people using cabal - install at the moment are not getting completely bogus results due to some hidden internal error in the resolver ( yeah yeah , they 're getting bogus results for other reasons , but that 's not the point right now ) .
I 've got the list of packages that I used when I tested Cabal - 1.6.0.2 .
I wanted to tell you how I got it first though , because it includes some essentially arbitrary choices on my part and it does not necessarily work with the current Hackage , it was only a snapshot .
So , with all those caveats in mind , here 's my list .
You can diff it with the full list and make any alterations you like .
Isolated builds
We obviously want to be able to build all these packages without messing up your normal set of user packages .
That and we want to build two ways without them getting in each others way .
So what we want to do is have two ( or more ) isolated sets of builds .
That means a separate install prefix but also separate ghc package DBs .
We will also want separate locations for build reports of course .
So , here are the important flags :
-- prefix= -- package - db= --build- summary= --build-log=
The -- prefix and -- package - db are needed to get the isolated builds .
Note that if you do this then it 's quite possible to run two sets of builds in parallel .
They will not trample over each other because they 're installing to different prefixes and registering into different package DBs .
The -- build - summary and - - build - log stuff is quite nice .
The build summary is the machine readable information about the outcome of building a package .
For example :
package : xmonad - 0.8.1 os : linux arch : x86_64 compiler : ghc - 6.10.1 client : cabal- install - 0.6.2 flags : - testing small_base dependencies : X11-1.4.5 base -3.0.3.0 containers -0.2.0.0 directory - 1.0.0.2 mtl-1.1.0.2 process -1.0.1.0 unix-2.3.1.0 install - outcome : InstallOk docs - outcome : NotTried tests - outcome : NotTried
This is what we 'll use at the end to compare and check for regressions .
So we want a single build summary file .
For build logs however it 's much more convenient to have a log file per-package .
That will let us go and look at the details of any regressions that we find .
There are a few template variables that we can use in the log file name , in particular $ pkgid .
So lets put things together .
Lets suppose that you want to test two versions of ghc .
I mentioned that I used this technique for comparing two versions of Cabal .
It should also work for haddock because we can -- enable - documentation and the build reports I think do correctly record if the docs built ok ( whereas tests are currently ignored ) .
So you 'll want two dirs , lets say ~ surveyghc - 6.10.1 and ~ surveyghc - 6.10.2 .
It 's probably wise to use absolute paths .
export PREFIX=$HOME / survey / ghc-6.10.1 echo [ ]
> $ PREFIX/package.conf cabal install --with-compiler=ghc-6.10.1 - v $ ( cat pkgs ) -- prefix=$ PREFIX --package-db=$PREFIX/package.conf --build-log=$PREFIX'/logs/$pkgid.log '
--build-summary=$PREFIX/build.reports
Note that the $ pkgid bit has to be in quotes because the template variable has to be passed to cabal and not expanded by the shell .
Obviously you then do this again with a different $ PREFIX and this time you specify -- with - compiler=ghc - 6.10.2 .
Or if you were testing two versions of haddock you 'd use -- with - haddock .
For different Cabal lib versions use the - - cabal - lib - version flag .
If you 're testing ghc itself then you probably want to build all these packages with - O , but if you 're testing something else like Cabal or haddock then you 'll save loads of time by using - O0 .
Even so , a full build of 900 + packages on hackage will take many hours .
Run it overnight .
Use nohup too .
Some more tricky details ...
I would also recommend backing up and removing your per-user ghc package db .
At the moment I do n't think it 's possible to do these kinds of isolated builds completely ignoring the per-user package db .
It should be possible , and maybe it does work , but I 've not tried it , so be on the safe side .
Note that if you do this then you 'll also want to register packages like Gtk2 Hs into both isolated package DBs .
Gtk2 Hs is n't on Hackage yet so you have to register mtl then build Gtk2 Hs twice .
Sorry about that .
Either that or you have to exclude all the packages on Hackage that use Gtk2Hs .
Analysing the results
The build reports are machine readable however the code to read them is n't part of a nice library yet .
One day I 'll make a hackage - client package but until then we just have to load one of the cabal - install modules in ghci :
cd cabal - install cabal configure ; cabal build ghci - idist / build / autogen \ - package base - 3.0.3.0 Distribution.Client.BuildReports .Anonymous
Now we can load up the two logs and compare them :
> :m + Distribution .
Client .
Utils > :m + Data .
Function > :m + Distribution .
Text > reports1 <- fmap parseList $ readFile " survey /ghc-6.10.1/build.reports " > reports2 <- fmap parseList $ readFile " survey /ghc-6.10.2/build.reports " > let merged = mergeBy ( compare `on` package ) reports1 reports2 > let regressions = [ b | InBoth a b <- merged , installOutcome a == InstallOk , installOutcome b /= InstallOk ] > mapM_ ( putStrLn . display . package ) regressions
Sorry about the mult - line formatting here .
Width restrictions .
So that prints the list of packages that built fine before and now fail for some reason .
You can then go and look in the per- package log files that we made and see what you can see .
The cabal unpack command is really handy for trying to reproduce the problems .
There are obviously more things you can do here .
You 've got the data and you 've got list comprehensions .
There are lots of ad - hoc queries you can easily do .
For example , you can look for the packages that cause the most knock - on failures .
Just look for Dependency Failed and group by the package id of the failing package .
Actually , you might want to look more generally at which packages are causing many knock - on failures , not just regressions .
Often there are C libs that you could install which would make these packages work and then you 're getting better coverage in your regression testing .
You'd be surprised by how many packages are bindings to obscure C libs that you probably do n't have installed .
Note that if you are actually comparing ghc - 6.10.1 vs 6.10.2 then you will also pick up all the regressions due to Cabal - 1.6.0.1 vs 1.6.0.2 .
I described all these in an email to the libraries list .
A lot of the regressions you find will actually be due to C libraries that you do not have installed .
With Cabal - 1.6.0.1 many such packages will build ( if they 're using pure FFI and no hsc2hs ) whereas now Cabal - 1.6.0.2 checks that the C lib actually exists and so you 'll get a Configure Failed outcome .
For this reason , if you 're testing ghc - 6.10.1 vs 6.10.2 you might be tempted to use ghc - 6.10.1 using Cabal - 1.6.0.2 to eliminate that set of issues .
That 's up to you of course .
These instructions are somewhat from memory so feel free to get in touch if you run into problems .
Have fun !

This week , tens of thousands of gay people will converge on New York City for Pride Week , and tens of thousands of residents will come out to play as well .
Some of us will indulge in clubbing and dancing , and some of us will bond over our ineptitude at both .
Some of us will be in drag and some of us will roll our eyes at drag .
We will rehash arguments so old that they ’ve become a Pride Week staple ; for instance , is the parade a joyous expression of liberation , or a counterproductive freak show dominated by needy exhibitionists and gawking news cameras ?
Other debates will be more freshly minted :
Is President Obama ’s procrastinatory approach to gay - rights issues an all - out betrayal , or just pragmatic incrementalism ?
We ’ll have a good , long , energizing intra-family bull session about same - sex marriage and the New York State Senate , Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act , Project Runway and Adam Lambert .
And at some point , a group of gay men in their forties or fifties will find themselves occupying the same bar or park or restaurant or subway car or patch of pavement as a group of gay men in their twenties .
We will look at them .
They will look at us .
We will realize that we have absolutely nothing to say to one another .
And the gay generation gap will widen .
You hear the tone of brusque dismissiveness in private conversations , often fueled by a couple of drinks , and you see the irritation become combustible when it ’s protected by Internet anonymity .
On the well - trafficked chat site DataLounge , a self - described repository of “ gay gossip , news , and pointless bitchery , ” there ’s no topic , from politics to locker - room etiquette to the proper locations for wearing cargo pants and flip - flops , that cannot quickly devolve into “ What are you , 17 ? ” –“ What are you , some Stonewall - era relic ? ” sniping .
And some not entirely dissimilar rhetoric is showing up in loftier media .
In April , a 25 - year - old right - of - center gay journalist argued in a Washington Post op - ed that many gay - rights groups are starting to outlive their purpose , and chided older activists for being stuck in “ a mind - set that sees the plight of gay people as one of perpetual struggle … their life ’s work depends on the notion that we are always and everywhere oppressed . ”
The scathing message - board replies pounded him at least as hard for his age as for his politics .
“ You twentysomething gays seem to think being out equals acceptance … Do n’t be so quick to dissolve the organizations that made it possible for you to be so naïve , ” wrote one reader .
Another , blunter response : “ Forgive me for not falling all over myself to do exactly what an inexperienced 25 - year - old decrees …
Do n’t waltz in and start barking orders , little boy . ”
Public infighting is a big minority - group taboo — it ’s called taking your business out in the street .
And it may seem strange to note this phenomenon at a juncture that , largely because of the fight for gay marriage , has been marked by impressive solidarity .
But let ’s have a look .
Here ’s the awful stuff , the deeply unfair ( but maybe a little true ) things that many middle - aged gay men say about their younger counterparts :
They ’re shallow .
They ’re silly .
They reek of entitlement .
They have n’t had to work for anything and therefore are n’t interested in anything that takes work .
They ’re profoundly ungrateful for the political and social gains we spent our own youth striving to obtain for them .
They ’re so sexually careless that you ’d think a deadly worldwide epidemic was just an abstraction .
They think old - fashioned What do we want !
When do we want it !
activism is icky and noisy .
They toss around terms like “ post - gay ” without caring how hard we fought just to get all the way to “ gay . ”
And here ’s the awful stuff they throw back at us — at 45 , I write the word “ us ” from the graying side of the divide — a completely vicious slander ( except that some of us are a little like this ) :
We ’re terminally depressed .
We ’re horrible scolds .
We gas on about AIDS the way our parents or grandparents could n’t stop talking about World War II .
We act like we invented political action , and think the only way to accomplish something is by expressions of fury .
We say we want change , but really what we want is to get off on our own victimhood .
We ’re made uncomfortable , or even jealous , by their easygoing confidence .
We ’re grim , prim , strident , self - ghettoizing , doctrinaire bores who think that if you ’re not gloomy , you ’re not worth taking seriously .
Also , we ’re probably cruising them .
To some extent , a generation gap in any subgroup with a history of struggle is good news , because it ’s a sign of arrival .
If you have to spend every minute fighting against social opprobrium , religious hatred , and governmental indifference , taking the time to grumble about generational issues would be a ridiculously off - mission luxury ; there are no ageists in foxholes .
But today , with the tide of history and public opinion finally ( albeit fitfully ) moving our way , we can afford to step back and exercise the same disrespect for our elders ( or our juniors ) as heterosexuals do .
That ’s progress , of a kind .

These unnuanced generalizations , as everyone who makes them quickly notes , do a gross injustice to both groups .
The gay community — or more accurately , communities — is hardly monolithic , and its divisions , not just of age but of race , gender , region , and income , are too complex to paint with a broad brush .
And Pride Week — which this year falls on the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall Inn riots — is a reminder that we have always been able to unite when faced with either a common cause or a common enemy .
It ’s when we ’re not on the front lines that tensions flare .
“ On its simplest level , ” says Jon Barrett , 40 , the editor - in - chief of the 42 - year - old gay magazine The Advocate , “ we think they ’re naïve .
And they think we ’re old . ”
Even on those front lines , it ’s a complex moment .
Last November , eight days after the election , I found myself marching with thousands of gay men , lesbians , and friends of the cause from Lincoln Center to Columbus Circle to protest the passage of Proposition 8 in California .
The air was charged ; many of us were eager to call out the enemy — a well - organized , well - financed coalition of conservatives who were using churches as political - action bases designed to roll back civil rights for gay Americans .
And our response was anger .
We held up signs with slogans like TAX THIS CHURCH !
We yelled ourselves hoarse .
But the demeanor of many of the young attendees felt unfamiliar to older protesters .
They were smiling more than seething , and I noticed that many of their picket signs — LET ME GET MARRIED , LOVE ISN ’T PREJUDICED , NYC LOVES GAY MARRIAGE — were more like let - the - sunshine - in expressions than clenched fists .
Shouting did not come as naturally to them .
There ’s nothing duller than a young gay man whose curiosity about the world does n’t appear to extend past his iPod .
Activism is an unlikely realm in which to spot a generation gap ; by definition , a rally attracts people who identify themselves by a shared goal .
But it ’s sometimes an uneasy union ; the march marked an encounter between age groups that , although part of the same community , had previously spent little time together .
And a difference in outlook was unmistakable .
“ After Prop 8 passed , a tremendous number of young people who had never been to a protest before wanted to release that energy , ” says Corey Johnson , the event ’s 27 - year - old organizer .
“ And that night was a great example of the two generations being bridged in a productive way .
But my impression is that there is a difference .
Young people are , I think , upset , but it ’s not with the level of anger that a lot of older folks feel , and perhaps there ’s more hopefulness involved . ”
To many young gay people , the passage of Prop 8 was shocking but not alarming ; it has jolted them into action , but one suspects it ’s out of a Milk - fed belief that identity - politics activism can be ennobling and cool .
What does n’t seem to be driving them is fear ; their cheerful conviction that history is going their way seems unshakable compared to ours .
That can lead to callousness on both sides ; we patronizingly warn them that their optimism is dangerous ; they patronizingly tell us that we ’re too embittered by our own past struggles to see the big picture .
The notion that anger no longer has a primary place in the gay - rights movement can feel awfully uninformed to anyone raised on the protests of the late eighties , when say - it - loud outrage was one of the movement ’s only effective weapons .
To some of those whose identities as both homosexuals and activists were forged in the early years of the AIDS epidemic , this new aura of serenity is way too “ Kumbaya . ”
It ’s hard to overstate the centrality of the AIDS crisis in any gay generation gap ( the divide between those who are currently 45 and their elders once yawned at least as wide ) .
If you want to know where you stand in gay history , ask yourself where you were in 1982 , when the disease took hold in public consciousness .
If you were already sexually active by then and you ’re still here to read this , you are someone who surely knows that fury has its uses .
If you were in your teens , wondering how to take even your first steps into life as a gay man in a world in which a single encounter could become a death sentence , you understand fear , and its warping effects down through the decades .
And if you were a kid , you grew up seeing AIDS as an unhappy fact of life .
But what about the ever - growing cohort of gay men who were n’t even born in 1982 ?
For most of them , AIDS is not their past but the past .
No wonder some of us feel frustrated ; when we complain that young gay men do n’t know their history , what we ’re really saying is that they do n’t know our history — that once again , we feel invisible , this time within our own ranks .
Were we that uninterested when we were that young ?
Actually , no , we were n’t ; we were thirsty to acquire the vast range of knowledge , tastes , and encoded references that seemed to derive from some mysterious User ’s Guide to Homosexuality , because even if we then rejected them , they still constituted a lingua franca ( in an era well before LGBT studies programs or even many books on gay history made that kind of information easily accessible ) .
Now , a familiarity with those movies , those plays , and those books will likely get you branded an “ old queen ” by people for whom “ old ” is by far the worse of those two epithets ( unfortunately , a morbid fear of aging is one of the few ideas we seem to have done a good job instilling in the young ) .
For gay men who came of age 25 years ago in a tougher environment , knowing your ( sub ) cultural iconography was not only a way of connecting to past generations but a means of defiantly reorganizing the world , of asserting your right to literally see , hear , and perceive things differently .
The need to hide yourself was thus transformed into the privilege of joining a private club with a private language .
But to many younger gay men who grew up with gay public figures , fictional characters , and references , it ’s a dead language — a calcified gallery of Judy Garland references and All About Eve bon mots that excludes them as much as it does the straight world .
So they react , as they react to many things , with a pose of bored indifference .
Which is , of course , infuriating :
There ’s nothing duller than a young gay man who ornaments his ignorance with attitude and whose curiosity about the world does n’t appear to extend past his iPod , certain that anything not already within his firsthand experience is by definition antiquated .
But once we start blaming gay twentysomethings for not having gone through what we did , we turn into sour old reactionaries telling ourselves self - flattering lies about how misery builds character .
Worse , we may in fact be doing damage .
According to a 2005 report by the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies , our “ emphasis on suffering reflects not the current reality of many LGBT adolescents so much as recollections of previous generations ’ own ‘ horror ’ … LGBT adults ’ residual fears and pain may be acting to magnify the real difficulties of LGBT teens . ”
Put simply , we talk too much , telling nightmare stories about AIDS and the Reagan administration when we should be listening — and then we get angry that they ’re not listening to us .
“ We ’re just like our parents , ” says a colleague of mine who came out right after college , in the mid-eighties .
“ We fought really hard so that our children would have things easier than we did , and now we resent them for it and sit around complaining that they lack character because they had everything too easy . ”
That parent - child analogy also points to a larger cultural change , one that helped breed the hurt feelings that created the gay generation gap , which is that young gay men are , by and large , not our kids , even symbolically .
The last twenty years — thanks to political progress , activism , education , the dying - off of a lot of homophobes , the Internet , and the mighty guiding arm of popular entertainment — have brought about a remarkable growth in straight America ’s acceptance of homosexuality .
Without forgetting that for too many gay kids , coming out is still hell , we ’re also witnessing the rise of a parallel generation of gay kids with unflinchingly supportive parents , buddies who cheer their comings - out on Facebook , high schools with gay - straight alliances — in other words , kids who have grown up in a world that ’s finally beginning , in a few places , to look like the one we wanted to create for them , or for ourselves .
And it would be dishonest to suggest that those kids — brash , at ease in their own skin , exuberant , happy — are being greeted by older gay men with nothing but uncomplicated joy .
We ca n’t help but wonder how our lives might have been different if things had been easier for us , too .
Some envy , some wistfulness , even some resentment is only human .
And to add one further injury :
Those kids do n’t seem to need us anymore .
For decades , gay men functioned as unofficial surrogate parents to the newly out and / or newly outcast .
They ’d offer reassurance that being gay did n’t mean being lonely .
It was a bond that linked many generations of gay men across the age spectrum and created a real emotional connection , even if what necessitated it was pervasive prejudice .
Today , though , the notion of quasi- parental gay mentorship feels ancient , a trope out of Tales of the City .
Unlike heterosexuals , most gay kids do n’t grow up around adults who are like them , and gay adults in their forties , fifties , and sixties do n’t have many occasions for routine , ordinary contact with a younger group of gay people .
One of the benefits of Pride Week is that , however artificially , it breaks that barrier down and restarts the conversation .
That ’s appropriate for an occasion that ’s meant to be steeped not just in optimism but in an awareness of history — a history that , by the way , includes a generation gap of its own .
As author David Carter reminds us in his excellent 2004 book Stonewall , back in 1969 , gay New York was deeply factionalized .
Gay older men “ passing ” in coat - and - tie jobs on Madison and Park Avenues and then discreetly meeting each other in Turtle Bay bars had contempt for long - haired , sideburned Village hippies , and the reverse was also rudely , robustly the case .
Even though gay Americans seem to have lived a century of tumult and progress since then , it ’s good to know we still have something in common with our ancestral brothers - in - arms .
It is now 40 years since the start of a riot for freedom in a small tavern in New York City – and the riot has never stopped .
It is spreading slowly across the world , to every continent , to Mumbai and Shanghai and Dubai .
Everywhere it goes , it wins , in time .
Yet on 28 June 1969 , it seemed only like another Sixties ruck in the muck against corrupt cops .
The Stonewall Tavern was a Greenwich Village bar where gay people huddled together to find friends and lovers in a hostile country on a hostile planet .
It was a hangout for everyone from macho bikers to drag queens making the pilgrimage from Ohio and Iowa and Kansas .
One of the regulars said that until he discovered the bar " I felt like I was the only one ... I only knew enough to hide " .
The regulars were harming nobody , they were only enjoying themselves , but the local police force was fond of busting the bar and beating and imprisoning the clientele .
They only allowed the bar to stay open at all because they were being bribed by local gay gangsters .
But one day , gay people decided they had had enough of cowering and hiding and being told they were sick .
On the day of Judy Garland 's funeral , the police smashed their way into the Stonewall .
The historian Martin Duberman distills what happened next into a single image : " A leg , poured into nylons and sporting a high heel , shot out of a paddy wagon into the chest of a cop , throwing him backwards . "
The drag queen yelled : " Nobody 's gonna fuck with me no more ! "
And the global riot began .
It was the turning point in the fight for equality for gay people .
Within four decades , goals that would have seemed impossible to those fighters that night were achieved : openly gay prime ministers , gay marriage in Europe and parts of the US , legal bans on discrimination .
The gay rights movement was a cry for the right to love in the darkness .
It is a model of democratic pressure : a minority peacefully appealing to the decency of the majority , and prevailing .
It is the strongest antidote to cynicism that I know .

The conversation about gay people has been so soaked in theology for so long that it is important to state some hard empirical facts .
Homosexuality is a naturally occurring phenomenon that happens in every human society .
Everywhere , about 2 to 5 per cent of human beings prefer to have sex with their own gender .
It occurs at the heart of nature : only last week , Professors Nathan Bailey and Marlene Zuk , of the University of California , concluded in a study : " The variety and ubiquity of same - sex sexual behaviour in animals is impressive – many thousands of instances of same - sex courtship , pair bonding and copulation have been observed in a wide range of species , including mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians , insects , molluscs and nematodes . "
Birds do it , bees do it , even educated fleas do it .
It does n't mean anything .
It is a harmless genetic quirk .
It has always happened and it always will .
The only question is : do you want to be spiteful to gay people , or let them express their most natural urges peacefully ?
In the US and Europe , steadily and remarkably quickly , the civilising voices are winning .
There is still a lot to do .
Gay teenagers are six times more likely to commit suicide than their straight siblings but the trajectory is ever - upwards .
In much of the developing world , gay equality is inching forward too .
After extraordinarily brave men and women fought back , India is poised to decriminalise homosexuality this year and China has just seen its first ever Gay Pride parade .
But there are three great swathes of humanity still untouched by the spirit of Stonewall – and terrified , terrorised gay people there are screaming for help .
In the Caribbean , majority - Muslim countries and most of Africa , being gay is a death sentence , yet many people who should be showing solidarity choose not to see it .
Jamaica is Taliban Afghanistan for gay people .
If caught , gays and lesbians face 10 years of hard labour , but they are more likely to be lynched .
The cases documented by Dr Robert Carr , of the University of the West Indies , fill whole books .
Here are two from a single week : a father found a picture of a naked man in his 16 - year - old son 's rucksack , so he produced it in the playground and called on the boy 's classmates to beat him to death – which they promptly did .
No one was ever charged .
In Montego Bay , a man was caught checking out another man , so the crowd lynched him .
When police arrived , they joined in .
Hospitals routinely refuse to treat the victims of gay - bashings , leaving them to die , yet people who would never have dreamed of holidaying in apartheid - era South Africa still flock to Jamaica 's beaches .
A heroic Jamaican called Brian Williamson set up an organisation called J- FLAG to campaign for the rights of gay Jamaicans .
His body was found stabbed and slashed 70 times .
The police did nothing .
The most popular song in Jamaica in recent years – by Beenie Man – choruses : " I 'm dreaming of a new Jamaica , come to execute all the gays ...
Take dem by surprise /
Get dem in the head . "
Throughout Muslim countries , gay people are routinely jailed , tortured and hanged .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejadh denies there are any gay people in Iran , but is happy to have them executed in public squares .
In post - invasion Iraq , there has been a homo - cidal pogrom of gay people being led by private Islamist " morality squads " .
In the past two months , 25 gay men's corpses have been found mutilated in one Baghdad slum , Sadr City , with notes saying " pervert " pinned to their chests .
Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , the country 's leading religious cleric , says gays should be killed " in the worst way possible " – and they are obeying .
Men are now being killed by having their anuses glued shut .
In Africa , one country has been a beacon for gay rights .
Post - apartheid South Africa even has gay equality written into its constitution .
Yet even it is now headed by a man , Jacob Zuma , who brags about beating up gay men in his youth .
The gay people cowering in these countries are asking for our support – by funding their underground organisations , by putting gay rights on the diplomatic agenda , and by consistently granting asylum to the victims of homophobic persecution .
Today , some gay people seeking safety are given the right to remain , while others are told to go back and hide their sexuality .
But too many people avert their gaze from the murderous , homophobic persecution happening now and , even more shockingly , some condemn the people who are trying to stop it .
Peter Tatchell , one of the great figures of the fight for gay equality , has for years been organising practical support for gay Jamaicans , Muslims and Africans .
They have been incredibly grateful , but he has been pilloried by people who pretend to be left - wingers here as " racist " and " imperialist " .
How is it " racist " to side with black and Muslim people who are being hunted down and murdered by other black and Muslim people ?
How is it " imperialist " to peacefully support their struggle , as they are begging us to ?
Should we say to the successors of Brian Williamson – sorry , but we can't help you today , because the descendants of your torturers and murderers were subject to British imperial rape a century ago ?
That would be real racism : to cheer a Stonewall for white people on the streets of New York City , but to ignore it on the streets of Kingston or Cairo or Kinshasa , just because the homophobic cops there happen to be black or Arab .
Homosexuality happens everywhere , so gay people fight for the freedom to be themselves everywhere .
The Stonewall riot , and its high - heeled kick , is n't over ; in many places , it has only just begun .

Genetic encoding of the Hamiltonian Path Problem
The design of our bacterial computer benefited from a series of abstractions of DNA sequence into the edges and nodes of a Hamiltonian path .
The first abstraction treated DNA segments as edges of a directed graph .
DNA edges flanked by hixC sites can be reshuffled by Hin recombinase , creating random orderings and orientations of edges of the graph .
The second abstraction treated all nodes , except the terminal one , as genes split into two halves ( Figure 2 ) .
The first ( 5 ' ) half of the gene for a given node is found on any DNA edge that terminates at the node , while the second ( 3 ' ) half of the gene is found on any DNA edge that originates at the node .
The final abstraction was an arrangement of DNA edges that represented a HPP solution and exhibited a new phenotype .
To place our proposed improvement of DNA computing in the historical context of the graph in Figure 1 , we designed the constructs shown in Figure 2 .
Each node in the graph is represented by a gene that encodes an observable phenotype , such as antibiotic resistance or fluorescence .
The exception to this is node 5 , which is represented by a transcription terminator to ensure that it will be the last node in the Hamiltonian path .
Each 5 ' half of a gene is denoted by the left half of a circle and each 3 ' half is denoted by the right half of a circle .
Gene halves connected by arrows and flanked by triangular hixC sites are the flippable DNA edges .
The order and orientation of the DNA edges determines the starting configuration , an example of which is illustrated in Figure 2a .
Hin-mediated recombination of the 14 DNA edges could produce 1.42 × 1015 possible configurations .
Of these , a small fraction represent Hamiltonian paths with all of the node genes intact ( see mathematical modeling section below for details ) .
An example of one of these solution configurations is illustrated in Figure 2b .
Bacterial colonies that contain an HPP solution will express a unique combination of phenotypes that can be detected directly or found by selection .

Splitting GFP and RFP genes
Once we were convinced that our proposed in vivo DNA computer could solve a HPP , we chose a simpler three node graph for our first biological implementation of the problem .
To execute our design , we needed to split two marker genes by inserting hixC sites .
For each gene to be split , we had to find a site in the encoded protein where 13 specific amino acids could be inserted without destroying the function of the protein .
We examined the three - dimensional structure of each protein candidate , chose a site for the insertion , built gene halves , and tested the reunited halves with the 13 amino acid insertion for protein function .
We successfully inserted hixC sites into the coding sequences of both GFP and RFP without loss of fluorescence [ 11 ] .
We inserted the hixC site between amino acids 157 and 158 in GFP , and between the structurally equivalent amino acids 154 and 155 in RFP .
Each of the insertions extended a loop outside of the beta barrel structure of the fluorescent proteins .
We also tested two hybrid constructs to ensure that they would not fluoresce .
We assembled the 5 ' half of GFP with the 3 ' half of RFP and the hybrid protein did not fluoresce red or green ( data not shown ) .
Similarly , the 5 ' half of RFP placed upstream of the 3 ' half of GFP did not cause fluorescence ( data not shown ) .
In addition , none of the four half proteins fluoresced by themselves ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrated the suitability of the GFP and RFP gene halves as parts for use in programming a bacterial computer to solve an HPP .
Being able to split two genes enabled us to design a bacterial computer to solve an HPP for a three node directed graph .
Mathematical modeling of bacterial computational capacity
We used mathematical modeling to examine several important questions about the system .
The first question is whether the order and orientation of the DNA edges in a starting construct affect the probability of detecting an HPP solution .
During an HPP experiment , billions of bacteria cells will attempt to find a solution by random flipping of DNA edges catalyzed by Hin recombinase .
We developed a Markov Chain model in MATLAB using the signed permutations of { 1,2 , ...n} as the states of DNA edges in the HPP .
We assumed that each possible reversal of adjacent DNA edges was equally likely .
Using this transition matrix , we computed the probability that any starting configuration would be in any of the solved states after k flips .
We conducted this analysis for a number of different graphs .
Figure 3 shows one example of the results , for a graph with four nodes and three edges .
The graph shows a relatively quick convergence to equilibrium , as was the case for all the graphs we analyzed .
In this example , there are 48 possible configurations of the edges , only one of which is a solution .
After about 20 flips , the probability that the edges are in the solution state ( or any other state ) is 1/48 ( ≈ 0.02 ) .
Consideration of the reaction rate reported for Hin recombinase [ 12 ] led us to conclude that equilibrium could be reached in the 3 - node , 3 - edge experiment that we intended to use as a proof - of - concept .
Assuming that E. coli divides every 20 –30 minutes and that we grow the cells for 16 hours , exceeding 20 flips should occur even if Hin recombinase catalyzes only one reaction per cell cycle .
Figure 3 Markov Chain model of solving a Hamiltonian Path Problem .
Each colored line represents a different starting configuration of a graph with four nodes and three edges .
As the number of flips increases , the probability of finding a Hamiltonian path solution converges to 1/48 , or about 0.02 .
Full size image
We also used mathematical modeling to determine how many bacteria would be needed to have high confidence that , after Hin recombination , at least one cell would contain a plasmid with a true HPP solution .
For the example of the graph in Figure 1 , each HPP solution would have six DNA edges in the proper order and orientation followed by the remaining eight edges in any order and orientation .
Because there are 8 !
ways to order the eight remaining edges , and two ways to orient each one , there are 8!·28 = 10,321,920 different configurations that are solutions , one example of which is shown in Figure 2b .
There is a total of 14 !
·214 = 1.42 × 1015 possible configurations of the edges ( 14 ! ways to order the edges , and two ways to order each one ) , many of which are not even valid connected paths in the graph , much less Hamiltonian paths .
The probability of any one plasmid holding an HPP solution is p = ( 8!·28 ) /( 14!·214 ) .
Assuming that the states of different plasmids are independent and that a sufficient number of flips has occurred to achieve a uniform distribution of the 14 !
·214 possible configurations , the probability that at least one of m plasmids holds an HPP solution is 1 - ( 1 - p ) m .
From this expression , we can solve for m to find the number of plasmids needed to reach the desired probability of finding at least one solution .
For example , if we wanted to be 99.9 % sure of finding an HPP solution , we would need at least one billion independent , identically distributed plasmids .
A billion E. coli can grow overnight in a single culture .
It should be noted , however , that it may take longer than that for Hin recombination to produce a uniform distribution of all possible plasmid configurations .
Since each bacterium would have at least 100 copies of the plasmid , the computational capacity of a billion cells exceeds our needs by two orders of magnitude .
Because the number of processors would be increasing exponentially , the time required for a biological computer to evaluate all 14 !
·214 configurations is a constant multiple of log ( 14!·214 ) , or approximately 14 ·log ( 14 ) , while the time required for a conventional computer to evaluate the same number of paths would be a constant multiple of 14 !
·214 .
A key feature of our experimental design is the simplicity of detecting answers with phenotypes of red and green fluorescence resulting in yellow colonies .
However , when our design is applied to a more complex problem such as the one presented in Figures 1 and 2 , it is possible that a colony with a correct phenotype might have an incorrect genotype , resulting in a false positive .
We considered the question of whether there are too many false positives to detect a true positive .
Using MATLAB , we computed the number of true positives for the 14 - edge graph in Figure 1 to be 10,321,920 and the number of total positives to be 168,006,848 .
The ratio of true positives to total positives is therefore approximately 0.06 .
Since all false positive solutions must have at least one more edge between the starting node and the ending node than in the true solution states , putative solutions could be screened using PCR .
However , since the ratio of true to total positives gets smaller with the size of the problem , this approach becomes increasingly impractical .
An alternative would be to conduct high throughput DNA sequencing of pooled putative solution plasmids .
Our mathematical modeling supported the conclusion that our experimental design could solve Hamiltonian Path Problems .
As a proof - of - concept , we designed a simple directed graph with a unique Hamiltonian path and programmed a bacterial computer to find that path .
Programming a bacterial computer
Figure 4a shows the directed graph with three nodes and three edges that we chose to encode in our bacterial computer .
The graph contains a unique Hamiltonian path starting at the RFP node , traveling via edge A to the GFP node , and using edge B to reach the ending TT node .
Edge C , from RFP to TT , is a detractor .
Figure 4b illustrates the DNA constructs we used to encode a solved HPP as a positive control and two unsolved starting configurations .
Since the solution must originate at the RFP node and terminate at the GFP node , DNA edge A contained the 3 ' half of RFP followed by the 5 ' half of GFP .
DNA edge B originated at GFP and terminated at TT , so its DNA segment has 3 ' GFP followed by the double transcription terminator .
DNA edge C originated with the 3 ' half of RFP and terminated at TT .
Each of the 5 ' gene halves included a ribosome binding site ( RBS ) upstream of its start codon in order to support translation .
Figure 4 DNA constructs that encode a three node Hamiltonian Path Problem .
a .
The three node directed graph contains a Hamiltonian path starting at the RFP node , proceeding to the GFP node , and finishing at the TT node .
b. Construct ABC represents a solution to the three node HPP .
Its three hixC - flanked DNA segments are in the proper order and orientation for the GFP and RFP genes to be intact .
ACB has the RFP gene intact but not the GFP gene , while BAC has neither gene intact .
Full size image
As illustrated in Figure 4b , we designed an expression cassette to contain the three DNA edges .
To ensure the solution begins at the RFP node , the cassette starts with a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter , an RBS , and 5 ' RFP prior to the first hixC site .
Construct ABC represents one of two HPP solutions since it begins with the RFP node , passes through GFP and ends with TT .
Since both the RFP and GFP genes are intact , downstream of the promoter , in the correct orientation , and followed by the transcriptional terminators , ABC colonies should express both red and green fluorescence and appear yellow .
A second solution is ABC ' , in which forward DNA edges A and B are followed by backwards DNA edge C. Bacteria containing this configuration are expected to fluoresce yellow , since RFP and GFP are intact and in forward orientation .
Construct ACB has the RFP gene intact , in the correct orientation , and uninterrupted by transcriptional terminators , but its GFP gene halves are not united .
As a result , this construct is predicted to produce red colonies .
The BAC construct has neither RFP nor GFP intact and should not fluoresce at all .
The three plates on the left side of Figure 5 show that all three constructs produced the predicted phenotypes in the absence of Hin recombinase : ABC colonies fluoresce yellow , ACB colonies fluoresce red , and BAC colonies show no fluorescence .

In a given experiment , bacteria were cotransformed with 1 ) a plasmid conferring ampicillin resistance and containing one of the three starting constructs and 2 ) a plasmid encoding tetracycline resistance with a Hin recombinase expression cassette .
The resulting cotransformed colonies were grown overnight for isolation of plasmids containing the Hin-exposed HPP constructs .
The isolated plasmids were then used in a second round of transformation into bacteria that expressed bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and plated on media containing only ampicillin ( Figure 5 ) .
Ampicillin - resistant colonies were grown overnight to allow the T7 RNA polymerase to transcribe each plasmid in its final flipped state .
Because each colony represented a single transformation event and Hin was no longer present , each colony contained isogenic plasmids and thus only one configuration of the three DNA edges .
This experimental protocol was followed for each of the three starting constructs .
Verifying bacterial computer solutions to a Hamiltonian Path Problem
Once
Hin recombinase reorders the DNA edges of each of the constructs , a distribution of 48 possible configurations is expected .
The positive control ABC construct should convert from its yellow fluorescent starting phenotype to the red and uncolored phenotypes of unsolved arrangements .
The ABC recombination plate pictured in Figure 5 matched our prediction .
We assumed that the double transcriptional terminator would function in reverse orientation , so that green colonies would not be possible in the experiment .
However , green colonies on the ABC recombination plate indicate that TT did not block further transcription .
The ABC recombination plate also shows a number of unusually colored colonies that were not expected , which we discuss later .
The ACB starting construct was expected to undergo Hin-mediated recombination to produce a variety of configurations , including a solution that requires at least two flips .
Yellow fluorescent colonies representing putative HPP solutions are visible on the ACB recombination plate .
The BAC starting configuration was three flips away from the nearest solution .
Several examples of yellow fluorescent colonies on the BAC recombination plate are candidates for solutions to the HPP .
As with the ABC recombination plate , we found unexpected colony colors on both the ACB and BAC recombination plates .
Yellow fluorescent colonies on the ACB and BAC recombination plates provided preliminary evidence that the bacterial computer had solved both versions of the HPP .
We wanted to verify this result by sequencing plasmid DNA to determine the genotypes of three yellow colonies from each of the ABC , ACB , and BAC recombination plates .
All nine colonies had a genotype of ABC or ABC ' , in which the third DNA edge is in reverse orientation ( Figure 6 ) .
Both of these configurations represent a solution to the HPP .
These results verified that our bacterial computer had found true solutions to a three node HPP configured in two different starting orientations .
The $ 100bn ISS has been blighted by toilet trouble
The main toilet has broken down on the International Space Station ( ISS ) , currently home to a record 13 astronauts , Nasa said .
Mission Control told the crew to hang an " out of service " sign until the toilet can be fixed .
The crew of the shuttle Endeavour is confined to using the craft 's loo .
ISS residents are using a back - up toilet in the Russian part of the station .
If repairs fail , Apollo - era urine collection bags are on hand , Nasa said .
" We do n't yet know the extent of the problem , " flight director Brian Smith told reporters , adding that the toilet troubles were " not going to be an issue " for now .
Bad plumbing ?
The main toilet , a multi-million - dollar Russian - built unit , was flown up and installed on the US side of the space station last year .
It had broken down once before , requiring a rush delivery of a replacement pump by the shuttle Discovery in 2008 .
And another toilet - related row broke out earlier this year , when a Russian cosmonaut complained that he was no longer allowed to use the US toilet because of billing and cost issues .
Despite the latest housekeeping setback , astronauts managed to transfer spare parts from the shuttle Endeavour to the ISS on Sunday , the second day of a planned 11 - day mission .
Nasa was also investigating why Endeavour 's tank shed an unusually large amount of insulating foam during its launch .

Wait !
We were pretty much dead on ?
How does that happen with a " Rumored " list ?
Or was it the three Live tracks we did n't list as Live ?
Was that it ?
Maybe you nay sayers should trust in our awesome reporting skills .
Snark aside , I 'm still going to hold to my guns on this being a very odd listing of tracks for the game .
There are a bunch of songs that have already been out , from smaller " unknown " bands , and some that just do n't make sense to have on Guitar Hero .
Stevie Wonder and Elton John ?
Really ?
Those guys do n't really scream Guitar Heroes to me .
But I guess it is good to mix things up sometimes .
To make up for the above rant and rave though , here are few more shots and a video from the game .
All showing off Shirley Manson of Garbage in Guitar Hero 5 .
Check them out and enjoy .
Remember this disgusting specimen ?
It was Pizza Hut Japan 's Double Roll Pizza , and it packed a whopping 646 calories … per slice .
Good lord .
Wait 'til you see the list of toppings .

What contributed to such a high calorie count ?
Try little bacon wrapped sausages that acted as the crust , and mini hamburger patties on top of the mushrooms , soy beans , corn , paprika , garlic chips , green peppers , and pepperoni .
Oh , and cheese ?
Yeah , it has cheese .
Mozzarella , cheddar and parmesan .
Oh , and it comes with ketchup and maple syrup for extra flavor .
I wonder why it 's not around anymore ?

WASHINGTON --
With the budget deficit soaring toward $ 2 trillion , the Department of Justice has figured out how to play its part : double - sided photocopying .
There are other acts of national sacrifice .
The Forest Service will no longer repaint its new , white vehicles green immediately upon purchase .
The Army will start packing more soldiers onto R&R flights .
The Navy will delete unused email accounts .
Three ...
It seemed like a good idea at the time .
When Tasha Bowens , a 26 - year - old political activist from Florida , went to get a tattoo she chose a butterfly , thinking she would never regret such an innocuous design .
But when the tattoo began to fade in the sun , she came to rue her youthful lapse of judgment .
" Since I did n't take care of it , it kind of faded , " she said .
" I was young and stupid , and I was n't protecting it from the sun . "
America is full of men and women who made the fateful decision to adorn their bodies with tattoos .
Some come to accept them as part of their identity , but hundreds of thousands wish they could remove them .
In a move that reflects the growing trend for tattoo removal , a small California company hopes to establish a nationwide network of laser clinics .
Executives with Dr Tattoff , Inc aim to expand across the country from three clinics in southern California , as twentysomethings reared with television images of inked rockers and Hollywood stars realise the barbed wire bands around their wrists and gothic lettering on their necks are not as well suited to the corporate conference room as to the university dorm .
" Tattoos are becoming more common in the workplace and in society , " chief executive John Keefe told the Los Angeles Times .
" My suspicion is that along with that , the tattoo regret factor will only grow as people get older . "
While laser tattoo removal has been around for a decade , Dr Tattoff executives hope the company will be the first to build a franchise and marketing brand around the procedure and plan one day to take the company public .
The market is huge .
Fourteen percent of Americans sport a tattoo , rising to a third among Americans ages 25 to 29 , according to a survey last year by the Harris Poll .
Sixteen percent of those regret them , leaving nearly 7 million potential laser removal customers .
And it 's not just average Joes who wish they had never set foot inside a tattoo parlour .
Rapper Andre Benjamin of OutKast said : " I had six silly tattoos done when I was young and I bitterly regret them .
I 've thought about laser surgery , but that leaves a scar , so I 'm just leaving them . "
Removal costs five to 10 times as much as the tattoo , about $ 750 to $ 1,500 spread across several sessions .
The procedure entails blasting the ink particles with a laser and can cause significant pain ( one Dr Tattoff patient said the procedure was worse than having his " crotch " tattooed ) .
Multicoloured pieces are the hardest to remove , and scarring can remain .
In addition to those seeking a more grown - up appearance , patients show up at Dr Tattoff clinics after breaking up with lovers whose names they short - sightedly inked to their bodies , and others want to clear the canvas for new artwork .
And as with shoes and clothing , tattoo styles go out of fashion .
In the US , celtic arm bands and tattoos on women 's lower backs have come and gone .
Or not gone .
California make - up artist Pixie Acia had Dr Tattoff dermatologist Will Kirby remove a montage of a woman and child from her shoulder to clear the " prime real estate " for another piece with more personal meaning .
About twice a week the clinic treats youngsters hauled in by angry parents .
The company says 85 % of patients are women ages 18 to 44 .
First person : ' I do n't believe in getting tattoos removed .
They are a bit like scars - you 've got to live with them '
I 've a got this horrible lyric tattooed to my left inside ankle from a band I was in when I was 18 .
Every time I look at it I think : " How did you ever make a living from words when you wrote such pompous self - indulgent shit ? "
It 's in my handwriting .
I can't believe how shoddy it was - it looks like an illiterate monkey did it .
I will quite often being lying in the bath reading and then I 'll look down at my ankle and be furious .
I 'll look at my leg and think , " You were such a dreamer when you were 18 " .
I 'm too embarrassed to say what it says .
There 's a little line in it about " believing in angels " .
I 've also got a Doncaster Rovers tattoo and there are times when I 've been so angry with the team that I 've wanted to scrub it off my leg .
I was always thought my Dad 's tattoos looked cool , even though he regrets them because he 's not in the Navy any more .
My Mum and Dad went mental when they noticed I 'd got them .
I got my last one two years ago - it was the logo of the band Black Flag .
I got it on expenses because I wrote about it for the paper .
I do n't believe in getting tattoos removed .
They are a bit like scars - you 've got to live with them .
They are a daily reminder of a point in your life when you were an idiot .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 19/5/2009 ( 4151 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
A former Canadian soldier was in court Tuesday trying to convince a Manitoba judge to authorize criminal charges against 15 Mounties and three RCMP support staff , claiming police zapped him repeatedly with a stun gun .
Matthew Gray , 47 , said police improperly stunned him with a Taser at his home , in a Portage la Prairie hospital and in an ambulance heading to Winnipeg .
The bulky former Canadian Forces Airborne Regiment soldier told court RCMP members came to his Portage la Prairie home on June 15 , 2003 , after he had an anxiety attack .
Gray alleged the officers then arrested him and tortured him as they supervised him in the hours following receiving medical help in Portage and Winnipeg .
Gray told Judge John
Guy he wants the RCMP and support staff to face criminal charges -- including obstruction of justice , conspiracy , aggravated assault , excessive force and negligence .
The former Agassiz Youth Centre guard and Portage la Prairie bar bouncer said the RCMP members have permanently injured his arms and legs by stunning him .
He told court he is the victim of a cover - up by police , suggesting the officers allegedly doctored notes .
" I was a sophisticated artist .
Now , I can barely write , " said Gray , who said he has post - traumatic stress disorder , an anxiety disorder and is bipolar .
Gray has waged an ongoing legal battle against the RCMP since June 2003 .
That includes a $ 20 - million lawsuit he filed in 2005 that named eight active or retired RCMP officers and the Attorney General of Canada .
Gray told court one female Mountie who allegedly grabbed his genital area in an ambulance on the way to Winnipeg 's Health Sciences Centre should face a charge of aggravated sexual assault .
He said he can't comprehend why officers allegedly choked and stunned him in the emergency vehicle since he was strapped into a gurney and handcuffed , he said .
" I was no threat .
I was n't moving , " he said .
The RCMP has said in court documents that officers stunned Gray because he posed a safety threat .
The hearing is called a private prosecution , a rarely used right by citizens to try and convince a provincial court judge to authorize charges in cases where justice officials like police or Crown attorneys have declined to do so .
No charges have been laid against the officers .
In an unusual twist in the proceeding , Gray called a former RCMP officer with the Portage detachment to tell the court about his perceptions of the way Mounties investigated the incident .
Sylvain Villeneuve said before June 2003
Gray was well known to Portage Mounties as a nightclub security worker who was helpful to police , he said .
" I found the RCMP investigation was totally improper , " said Villeneuve , who told court he worked for the RCMP for 13 years before he left for medical reasons .
Villeneuve said he reviewed extensive research and records compiled by Gray to come to his conclusions .
Marty Minuk is the independent prosecutor the Crown appointed to observe the case .
The hearing is scheduled to resume today .

More than 1,300 foreign troops have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001 Four US soldiers have been killed by a bomb in southern Afghanistan , a Nato spokesman has said .
Brig Gen Eric
Tremblay said they were struck " while patrolling in one of the most violent areas of Afghanistan " , but did not give an exact location .
The deaths bring the number of foreign forces killed in Afghanistan in 2009 to 295 , the deadliest year since the US - led invasion to overthrow the Taliban .
The previous deadliest year was 2008 , when 294 military personnel died .
Afghanistan is very vulnerable in terms of [ the ]
Taliban and extremists taking over again , and I do n't think that threat 's going to go away
Admiral Mike Mullen
Chairman , US Joint Chiefs of Staff
US looks for Afghanistan progress Nato 's new approach in Afghanistan
The soldiers whose deaths were announced on Tuesday had been operating under the command of the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) .
" It is with great sorrow that I learned about this terrible attack and I wish to convey my sincere condolences to the families and loved ones of these four determined Isaf comrades , " said Gen Tremblay .
" We shall always be proud of their courage and sacrifice as they fell fighting for the good of Afghans living in the south , " he added .
' Very vulnerable ' US and Nato casualties in Afghanistan are fast mounting .
At least 63 foreign military personnel have been killed this month , including 37 Americans .
A total of 1,340 have died in the country since 2001 .
More than 30,000 extra US troops have been sent to Afghanistan since President Barack Obama ordered reinforcements in May , almost doubling his country 's contingent and increasing the Western total to about 100,000 .
On Sunday , the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , said the security situation in Afghanistan was " serious and deteriorating " and left open the possibility of further reinforcements .
" Afghanistan is very vulnerable in terms of [ the ] Taliban and extremists taking over again , and I do n't think that threat 's going to go away , " he told CNN .
" The Taliban insurgency has gotten better , more sophisticated . "
The latest casualties come five days after Afghanistan held presidential and provincial elections .
Partial preliminary results from the presidential poll are due shortly .
Representatives for the two leading candidates , President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah , have already claimed to be in the lead .

WallBuilders ’ goal is to exert a direct and positive influence in government , education , and the family by ( 1 ) educating the nation concerning the Godly foundation of our country ; ( 2 ) providing information to federal , state , and local officials as they develop public policies which reflect Biblical values ; and ( 3 ) encouraging Christians to be involved in the civic arena .
Educating the Nation
In the first part of this goal , we develop materials to educate the public concerning the periods in our country ’s history when its laws and policies were firmly rooted in Biblical principles .
As George Washington indicated in his famous “ Farewell Address , ” previous generations believed such elements were inseparable from America :
Of all the habits and dispositions which lead to political prosperity , religion and morality are indispensable supports .
For over three centuries , historians presented American history from a broad perspective , but in the 1960s historical writers widely embraced what today is called the “ economic view of American history ” whereby economic causes are the primary and almost singular emphasis of study .
Consequently , students study only “ taxation without representation ” when they examine the Declaration of Independence rather than important civil , governmental , and moral principles addressed in that document .
WallBuilders returns to the historical approach long utilized by the nation ’s pre-eminent historians .
As Charles Coffin ( a best - selling author of school history texts in the nineteenth century ) reminded teachers in his text , The Story of Liberty :
You will notice that while the oppressors have carried out their plans and had things their own way , there were other forces silently at work which in time undermined their plans – as if a Divine hand were directing the counter - plan .
Whoever peruses the story of liberty without recognizing this feature will fail of fully comprehending the meaning of history .
There must be a meaning to history or else existence is an incomprehensible enigma .
This broad and thus much more inclusive approach to American history characterized the work of influential historians and educators from George Bancroft ( “ The Father of American History ” ) to Noah Webster ( “ The Schoolmaster to America ” ) to Emma Willard ( “ The Pioneer of Women ’s Education in America ” ) , John Fiske , and countless others .
In fact , to exclude non-economic events and motivations is to present a biased view of history .
As explained by U. S. Department of Education history researcher Dr. Paul Vitz :
Bias is primarily accomplished by exclusion .
. . .
Such a bias is much harder to observe than a positive vilification or direct criticism , but it is the essence of censorship .
WallBuilders presents an uncensored view of American history , thus not only giving meaning to history but also keeping it from becoming what Charles Coffin termed “ an incomprehensible enigma . ” Providing Information
In the second part of our goal , we believe that as citizens learn the truth about our nation ’s past , they will be better equipped to help frame its future and to help shape the policies under which they will live .
Toward this end , WallBuilders is an educational resource to those working toward improving federal , state and local policies .
This is accomplished in part by providing direct assistance to our elected and appointed officials .
This assistance takes several forms , including consulting with both legislators and judges , at their request , on legal and historical issues , testifying in state and federal hearings , providing research services , identifying and supporting sound legislation , and providing historical perspectives to current problems .
Encouraging Christians
Thirdly , we encourage people of faith to become involved in the civic arena , whether through prayer or direct involvement .
As President and gospel minister James A. Garfield stated , “ Now , more than ever , the people are responsible for the character of their Congress .
If that body be ignorant , reckless and corrupt , it is because the people tolerate ignorance , recklessness , and corruption .
If it be intelligent , brave , and pure , it is because the people demand these high qualities to represent them in the national legislature .
. . . [ I ] f the next centennial does not find us a great nation .
. . . it will be because those who represent the enterprise , the culture , and the morality of the nation do not aid in controlling the political forces . ”
Enlarge AP via cakes.com JodiLee Knops celebrates setting the Guinness record for the world 's largest cupcake at the Minneapolis Mall of America .
MINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) 
A portly cupcake that weighs as much as a person has been certified as the world 's largest .
The super - sized snack was unveiled Saturday at the Minneapolis Mall of America .
It weighed in at nearly 151 pounds , including 15 pounds of fudge filling and 60 pounds of yellow icing .
It was one foot tall and two feet wide .
Guinness World Records adjudicator Danny Girton Jr. was on hand to certify the record , calling the cupcake a " fun and creative achievement . "
The dessert was made by cakes.com , which is run by DecoPac .
The Minneapolis - based company calls itself the world 's largest cake - decoration supplier and marketer .
" This is a thrill and an honor for cakes.com , " company spokeswoman Jamie Miller said .
The company initially planned to cut up the record cupcake and distribute it to mall patrons .
But because only the top layer had frosting , company officials realized most patrons would get only plain cake .
So cakes.com gave away 4,000 free cupcakes for the event , and arranged a more ignominious fate for the record - sized snack .
Miller said it would be sent to a pig farm whose snouty residents specialize in the disposal of edible garbage .
" They 're going to get one heck of a sugar rush , I 'm sure , " Miller said .

Human rights activists today accused Chechnya 's president , Ramzan Kadyrov , of personally threatening Natalia Estemirova , the Russian human rights campaigner who was abducted and shot dead in Chechnya yesterday .
Oleg Orlov , the director of the human rights organisation Memorial , claimed Kadyrov made the threat during a meeting just months before her death .
He said the president 's aides had explicitly warned her to stop her work in Chechnya .
" I know who is guilty of Natalia 's murder .
His name is Ramzan Kadyrov , " Orlov said in a statement posted today on Memorial 's website .
" Ramzan already threatened Natalia , insulted her , considered her a personal enemy .
He has made it impossible for rights activists to work in Chechnya , " he said .
Estemirova was seized by four unknown men yesterday morning as she left for work .
Neighbours at her house in the capital , Grozny , heard her shout : " I 'm being kidnapped . "
This morning Kadyrov promised to investigate Estemirova 's death , which he blamed on forces trying to " discredit " Chechnya and Ingushetia .
He described her murder as a " barbaric crime " and a " carefully planned act " .
Interfax news agency quoted Kadyrov as saying the perpetrators of her " monstrous " murder " deserve no support and must be punished as the cruellest of criminals " .
Estemirova 's body was found near Gazi - Yurt village , in neighbouring Ingushetia .
She had been shot twice in the head and chest , police said , adding that her corpse had been dumped on the main road .
Human rights activists expressed outrage at her murder , reminiscent of the killing of Anna Politkovskaya , the journalist , writer and bitter Kremlin critic shot dead outside her Moscow apartment in 2006 .
Estemirova , 50 , was a close friend of Politkovskaya's .
The two had collaborated on numerous investigations into human rights abuses in Chechnya .
Both were scathing opponents of Kadyrov , Chechnya 's pro-Kremlin president .
" Natasha was at the forefront of some of the most intense human rights investigations in Chechnya , " said Allison Gill , director of Human Rights Watch in Russia .
" She was targeted because of her work .
I have no doubt her killing was to silence her .
One of the most amazing things about Natasha is that she never stopped doing what she was doing .
She never checked herself .
She was highly public in her calls for accountability .
" I think the human rights situation is in crisis in Russia , " she added .
" We have a deathly silence from the authorities whenever activists , lawyers or journalists are murdered .
Not a single person is brought to justice . "
Last night the US and EU condemned her " brutal " death .
" We call for the authorities to try to establish who is responsible , " the Swedish foreign minister , Carl Bildt , whose country holds the EU presidency , said .
Mike Hammer , the US 's national security council spokesman , added : " Such a heinous crime sends a chilling signal to Russia 's civil society and the international community . "
Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , has condemned the murder .
He is likely to face tough questioning over the Kremlin 's abysmal human rights record during a bilateral summit later today in Germany , with the chancellor , Angela Merkel .
Estemirova was the Chechnya - based head of Memorial , Russia 's oldest human rights group .
Operating out of a small office in Grozny , she doggedly pursued stories of human rights abuses in the face of official intimidation and hostility .
She recently collaborated on two damning reports into punitive house burnings and extra-judicial killings in Chechnya , allegedly carried out by Kadyrov 's forces .
The reports documented how on 2 July his troops allegedly shot 20 - year - old Madina Yunusova and her husband near Grozny .
Chechen officials claimed her husband had been involved in a plot to kill Kadyrov .
Yunusova died three days later in hospital under mysterious circumstances .
" Natasha was always involved in the most sensitive cases .
She knew what she was doing .
She knew the risks , " Shamil Tangiyev , a former Memorial colleague , said .
" She was extremely brave .
It was in her nature to be an activist . "
Estemirova made no attempt to hide her work .
Her office near the newly renamed Putin Avenue was well known .
The timing of her murder follows Barack Obama 's first visit to Moscow last week as US president .
Obama met with Russian human rights activists and set out the US 's commitment to " universal values " .
The Kremlin responded with hardline pronouncements and President Medvedev visited the breakaway Georgian republic of South Ossetia on Monday .
The trip appeared to be a direct rebuff to Obama , who had said that both Georgia and Ukraine should be free to choose their own leaders .
Estemirova , who leaves a 15 - year - old daughter , was probably the best - known human rights activist in Russia 's provinces .
Earlier this year she attended the trial in Moscow of four people – two of them Chechens – accused of involvement in Politkovskaya 's murder .
Speaking to the Guardian in February , Estemirova called the Politkovskaya trial a " farce " .
Kadyrov , a close ally of Russia 's prime minister , Vladimir Putin , has denied accusations he was involved in Politkovskaya 's killing , saying : " I do n't kill women . "
The Kremlin has recently given Kadyrov unprecedented powers for counter - terrorist operations in Ingushetia , amid a worsening Islamist insurgency across the entire north Caucasus .
Estemirova was a close colleague of Stanislav Markelov , the human rights lawyer murdered in Moscow in January .
A masked assassin shot Markelov in the back of the head , not far from the Kremlin , along with Anastasia Baburova , a journalist with the Novaya Gazeta newspaper .
Last night rights activists urged the west to place human rights at the centre of any dialogue with Russia .
Gill said : " We can't talk about trade or energy without mentioning the rule of law . "
The Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI ) spends more on informants than almost every other police force in the UK , it was revealed today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
For the first time ever the amount of money that police forces spend on informants has been released with payouts topping £ 6 m across every police force .
The PSNI bill for people with information on criminal activity in the past year was £ 299,000 — more than every other force except the Metropolitan and Greater Manchester .
The figures will reignite the debate over the use of the controversial police tactics as well as accountability .
A spokeswoman for the PSNI today said that the police force “ does not discuss intelligence matters ” .
But Sinn Fein Policing Board member Daithi McKay MLA ( Member of the Legislative Assembly ) said he was concerned about the revelations and added that more accountability is needed from the PSNI on the issue .
“ There is too much focus being placed on gathering intelligence and information in this way .
“ The PSNI want to solve crimes such as drug dealing and anti-social behaviour which is a big concern for communities , particularly in working class areas , however they need to gather the confidence of such communities to get them engaging with police , rather than resorting to tactics , like paying touts , who will often have their own agenda , ” he said .
“ Obviously we all know the stories about informers in the north before and their agendas .
It is not the way we want to go forward in terms of community policing .
“ We do not need policing based on paying people off to inform on communities and gather intelligence on communities .
This is something we have raised at the Policing Board in the past and will continue to do so . ”

Social Democratic and Labour Party ( SDLP ) Policing Board member Dolores Kelly MLA said the wider question is how the informants are being managed .
“ Because of the history of the past in Northern Ireland this is something that the SDLP is very vigilant on .
“ It would be very naive of me to say informants were not used in any democratic society by the police .
It does depend on how then they are managed and that they do not get a carte blanche in terms of their own criminal enterprises . ”
According to the information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act , other forces with large bills for “ covert human intelligence sources ” — as informants are officially termed — include the Metropolitan Police , which spent £ 1.8 m in 2008/09 , Greater Manchester Police , which spent £ 329,497 and West Midlands Police , which spent £ 291,780 .
The Association of Chief Police Officers said the system was “ vital in bringing offenders to justice ” .
Patricia Gallan , Assistant Chief Constable of Merseyside Police and chairman of ACPO 's National Source Working Group , said the use of informants had proved essential in cases ranging from serious organised crime to burglary .
“ Each force is audited on their use of informants and is subject to a robust annual inspection by the Office of Surveillance Commissioners to ensure compliance with the law .
They are a valuable source of intelligence and their use is justifiable and proportionate when set against other police tactics , ” she told BBC 5 Live .
One of the most notorious police touts in Northern Ireland is Mark Haddock , one - time leading member of the Ulster Volunteer Force ( UVF ) .
Haddock worked as an informant for the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) ’s Special Branch during the Troubles .
He was last week charged with the murder of John Harbinson , who was beaten to death in the north of the city in 1997 .

CADR Emulation
updated 11/11/2006
I took the red pill ... two , in fact :-)
You can find the MIT CADR Lisp Machine Source code here .
This a software emulation of MIT CADR lisp machine .
It 's basically a program to run the lisp machine microcode .
The emulator includes support for the keyboard , mouse and disk so that it can boot from an original lisp machine ' load band ' ( a load band is basically a disk image of memory pages ) .
Several load bands and micrcode images are provided as well a program to make complete disk images .
The emulator runs pretty reliably and includes network support for Chaosnet .
A basic chaosnet file server is included .
News
It boots a load band , uses the network & the FILE server !
Mac OS X Version !
Win32 Version !
08/07/06 CADR usim v0.9 - fixed Mac OSX little endian support ; now usim and the chaosd file server work .
Added code to sync the SDL mouse with the microcode .
The mouse now stays with cursor .
Add ability to save the memory state ( - S ) and then do warm start ( - w ) .
Warm start get the machine running instantly instead of the impossibly long delay you get on cold boot .
Includes some simple speed ups .
Included in the disks / subdirectory are also some LMFS FILE partition images with the 78.48 and System 99 sources .
There is a README file which describes how to install the file partitions into a disk image .
In the new / directory are some lisp files which will allow you to resize the screen ( statically ) and fix the date display on the who line .
07/11/06 CADR usim v0.8 + - more bug fixes and speedups .
chaos code now supports ( si:recompile - world ) .
Fixed long standing bug which overflowed cycle counter and crashed emulator .
New improved diskmaker .
chaosd works better .
you can resize the screen now .
12/15/2005
Fixed ALU bug which seems to have been causing crashes in the scheduler .
Now should stay up much longer .
I was able to load an assemble the 841 microcode , for example .
12/13/2005
New chaos fileserver code .
easier to use , better README , bug fixes .
The network daemon now starts the required servers so you can access the linux file system via chaosnet .
Nice for recompiling sources and running demos .
12/12/2005
V0.7 : Finally got OS X ( 10.4 ) version working .
Some speadups .
Improved diskmaker .
Bjorn 's new keyboard mapping code .
Updated README .
10/24/2005
V0.6 : I built a version of the CADR emulator for Win32 .
The zip file contains the binary executable and all the files you need .
Be warned , however , it creates a big window .
The win32 version does not currently support networking .
10/04/2005
New release of CADR emulator ( V0.5 ) with Chaos networking and FILE server
Bjorn Victor has been helping me debug the chaos code and enhance the emulator .
It now will talk to the FILE server and read and write files from a linux host .
It 's still fragile but it works enough to experiment with .
The emulator is more stable now and support C- M key combinations .
You can debug , compile functions and run code .
Start the chaosd and then server .
The server will start the FILE program when the first question comes in .
I use this sequence to set up the file system
( login ' name t ) ( si: set - sys - host " server " ' : unix 0404 " // " )
This command will take a while to complete ( 2 - 3 minutes ) .
Once it 's working you can start emacs ( F2 - e ) and then open a file ( C-x C - f server : / tmp/ filename ) .
Ah - the moment I 've been waiting for .
The original lisp code in zwei , on the screen !
You can also make a local file system in the FILE partition with
( lmfs:fsmaint - fs- initialize )
Obligatory screen shot :
Another showing lisp and more output
10/02/2005
Released the MIT CADR LispM source code .
9/29/2005
I 've been working on an automated conversion of the original CADR schematics to verilog .
After a long delay ( read real work ) it 's starting to run and gets about 1000 instructions into the boot prom .
Also Bjorn Victor has taken a interest and has been extremely helpful finding bugs and giving me patches .
With his help we have the simulator working on the network and I 'm working on a FILE server .
We 've fixed a few bugs and sped things up a little and it 's getting much better .
10/21/2004
I 've been working on a emulator of the MIT CADR .
Basically a program to run its microcode .
It is now running to the point where it runs a load band .
There is basic display , mouse and keyboard support .
There is some code for the chaosnet interface but it's not ( yet ) wired into the real network .
The emulation is still a bit raw .
I fixed a long standing bug in the divide logic which caused the dates to be wrong and floating math to be incorrect ( i.e. 1.1 printed as 0.4 ) .
The microcode ( as you might imagine ) takes advantage of many " features " of the hardware , some of which are subtle .
I hope to do a verilog version of the hardware next and that will no doubt uncover a few of the things I missed .
I wanted a clunky " C " version first , however , to verify the basic notions .
And , I wanted a place to run zetalisp :-)
The source tar file includes a prom binary from a actual CADR .
The disk image file has a label , microcode and load band .
It looks like a Trident T - 300 disk .
There are several utilities for making disks and looking inside load bands .
I 'm written a small questions / errata page on AI Memo 528 , please comment on it if you have used a CADR and / or know the architecture .
Below is also a large .pdf ( 11 mb ) of the AI labs " memo 528 " which describes the CADR .
Some some reason the other on - line versions stop after page 42 and are missing page 18 .
This version is 75 pages .
This version of the emulator is just a quick and dirty hack intended to prove out the concept .
It 's not intended to be pretty or fast - just accurate .
It seems to run at about the same speed or slightly faster than an actual CADR .
And please feel free to email diffs :-)

You gotta love the Japanese .
They start with a little of this :
Add in a little of this :
And end up with this :
Occlusion or Kaatsu training .
What is Occlusion or Kaatsu Training ?
In a nutshell , Occlusion Training involves applying a tourniquet of some sort ( Researchers use a pneumatic tourniquets similar to a blood pressure cuff ) to the proximal portion of one of your limbs to restrict blood flow ( partially or fully ) while you perform low intensity exercise .
And why would you do that ?
According to this recent study :
Low intensity occlusion ( 50 - 100 mm Hg ) training provides a unique beneficial training mode for promoting muscle hypertrophy .
Training at intensities as low as 20 % of 1 rep maximum with moderate vascular occlusion results in muscle hypertrophy in as little as 3 weeks .
A typical exercise prescription calls for 3 to 5 sets to volitional fatigue with short rest periods .
The metabolic buildup causes positive phsiologic reactions , specifically a rise in growth hormone that is higher than levels found with higher intensities .
Occlusion training is applicable for those who are unable to sustain high loads due to joint pain , postoperative patients , cardiac rehabilitation , athletes who are unloading , and astronauts .
In fact , during the study , test subjects saw some pretty startling results :
Lactate increased
Growth Hormone increased
Norepinephrine increased
IGF - 1 increased
Noradrenaline increased
Myostatin decreased
One rep maximum strength increased
Isometric strength & torque increased
Isokinetic strength & torque increased
Muscular endurance increased
Cross-sectional area of the muscle increased
Slow twitch fibers changed into Fast twitch fibers
And all you need to turn yourself into a muscle - building Kaatsu warrior is some bondage gear and the ability to ignore the stares and giggles of your fellow health club members .
So , what do you think of that ?
I may come back and expand this post with more data in the next few days .
I just received a full copy of this latest study and I am poring over the details .
But , I could n’t wait to share this with you .
Looking forward to the comments .

While America ’s wealthy continue to enjoy economic and recreational comforts , many parts of the world are being plunged into economic collapse , depression , and civil unrest .
American elitist politicians enjoy the safety and protection provided by our military and secret service .
Meanwhile , the American citizen ’s freedoms are attacked non-stop by Police State agencies in their homes , schools and neighborhoods .
The writing has been on the wall for some time , nothing has changed , and the plan for the New World Order is full force .
In America , the two party system has failed the people ; the politicians feign fighting in front of cameras , while they sleep together at night .
Bush Sr. , Clinton , Bush Jr. , and now Obama have expressly followed elitist world power orders .
Nothing has changed and the class assault on America ’s values , morals and freedoms continues .
George W. Bush , widely considered one of the worst presidents in US history , initiated legislation that stripped Americans of every right they thought they had .
This includes the Patriot Acts I and II , FISA Amendments Act of 2008 , Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , Amended Presidential Executive Orders , and the revocation of Posse Comitatus Act .
These actions were specifically designed for DOMESTIC control – under the illusion and disguise they “ help ” you .
These are only a few of the many fascist laws the Bush Administration championed .
As a result , they effectively changed the Judicial , Legislative and Executive powers forever .
With financial ruin , a contrived illegal war , amnesty for illegal aliens , and wide - open borders , the 8 year agenda becomes glaringly clear …
American people do not matter .
[ efoods ] Barack Hussein Obama ran on the platform of “ change ” .
Like every politician the two party system and mainstream media offer us , his campaign promises immediately disappeared once elected .
Despite his fictional campaign rhetoric , his immediate actions paint the picture of what to expect .
He strongly condemned lobbyists and claimed his cabinet would NOT allow them .
Today , his cabinet has more “ special interest ” lobbyists than any cabinet in history .
He made assertions of repealing Bush laws that infringed American rights .
He has n’t repealed one .
In fact he is using the same laws to his benefit and further strip firearm and free speech rights .
The Obama Administration bailout dwarfs what Bush initiated .
With the illusion “ it helps you , ” but it is designed specifically for elitist entitlement .
Obama ran on an Anti-war platform , promising to pull troops and get out of Iraq .
He ’s done the opposite , increasing troops and extending war to Afghanistan and perhaps Iran .
Remember Ross Perot ’s famous quote ?
“ You hear that sucking sound ?
That ’s your American jobs going overseas ” due to NAFTA and the government “ sell out ” of American jobs .
Independent Ross Perot was right .
Obama made promises in his campaign mantra that he would change foreign trade agreements .
Today , he shows little interest in NAFTA or foreign trade policy .
In a time of recession / depression with massive debt , Barack Obama spent 3 times more money than any president in US history for his inauguration .
Scholars and Historians liken the Obama youth to Hitler Youth , complete with combat training for “ domestic safety ” .
He made assertions Bush would be held accountable for his actions in Iraq and 9/11 – Today he wo n’t touch it .
They are on the same Globalist team , and he continues where Bush left off with the NAU plan to combine USA , Canada and Mexico thereby eliminating our borders and our sovereignty ; essentially declaring our Declaration of Independence void .
Our ranking two party politicians can no longer be trusted because they are not making decisions in our interest .
World bankers , corporations , and elitists with an agenda have infiltrated our government .
These two party politicians are puppets .
They serve the elite and only have one goal , globalism .
They are not loyal to country or people .
Likewise , our main stream media only serve to reinforce that agenda and manipulate the minds of the people .
Fox News , CNN , ABC , CBS , NBC corporate news appear to take their marching orders from Washington and other elitists .
They are equivalent to NAZI propaganda in the 1930s .
Diversion , deception , misleading , and boycotting REAL news is the name of their game .
It ’s not a coincidence .
These NEWS organizations spend hours diluting you with Hollywood drivel , American Idol , Sports , Dancing with the stars , and everything ridiculous WHILE at the same time major American legislation is passed to destroy your future .
Yet , this legislation goes on and is seldom heard about .
They serve to divert attention away from real issues .
Everything is a “ sellout ” and the American people eat popcorn and watch movies instead of compiling arms , food , and preparing for a revolution .
When the masses finally get clued into reality , it may be entirely too late .
Yes indeed , the two party system has failed the American people .
Politicians are bought and paid for and they disregard your children ’s future with unabashed arrogance .
Everyone from legislators , to judges , to presidents , is manipulated and lopsided in the Democratic and Republican royalty .
The media gives the illusion you have a choice , while simultaneously stifling and ridiculing third party candidates and alternative media .
It is time for independence once again .
We need independent candidates , media , and independence from corporate greed and lobbyists .
Independence from freedom - stripping legislators is the last hope that exists for a country founded on freedom .
The independent thinkers of America have long suffered ridicule and labels such as “ conspiracy theorists ” .
300 million people corralled into two parties is insanity , it is time the American citizen is heard .
It is time for American Independence again .
People , turn off the television , think for yourself , stand up .

All in all an excellent game !
I enjoyed playing as Sly , but there were times I thought I 'd never get this far .
I managed to pull through and get the medals .
Timing is key , but I also took time to make my own Wlliam and the Sly map to collect everything .
It took me great amount of time to figure out where everything was .
Surely you 've read the Twitter works of noted wordsmith Sarah Palin and wondered to yourself , " How does she string together such poetry so effortlessly ? "
Very , very slowly !
Now , we follow Palin 's trainwreck Twitter account , which we sincerely feel is the best thing the internet has ever produced , so we 're well - versed in her unique brand of tweet - buffoonery , but what we had n't noticed previously was the time it takes for her to condense the broad thoughts conjured up by her leviathan intellect down to 140 - character tweets .
The hitch in catching on to this was taking notice of her tweets within the first hour of their publication , when they 're still logged chronologically on Twitter dashboards by the system in minute time frames .
Check out the tweets in the screengrab below caught by Eric Spiegelman earlier tonight .
These five tweets are all conjoined , all part of the same dipshit-y thought , which was another one of her maniacal rants about the endless stream of ethics complaints logged against her .
Starting with the first one at the bottom , take a look at the time lapse in between the posting of each tweet .
In total , it took Palin 27 minutes to spit out this one thought , and it was still expressed almost completely incoherently .
On a related note , a new poll released yesterday had Sarah Palin within six points of Barack Obama in a hypothetical 2012 Presidential Election Death Match .
Finally , in one last bit of Sarah Palin hilarity , Vanity Fair had their literary editor take a red pen to Palin 's rhetorical abortion of a resignation speech from a couple of weeks ago .
We highly recommend checking it out .

June 4 , 2009 — Regular consumption of fish , nuts , olive oil , and other foods containing omega - 3 fatty acids and avoidance of trans fats appear to be associated with a lower risk for the eye disease age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , according to 2 studies reported in the May issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology .
Blue Mountains Eye Study
" The role of dietary fatty acids in AMD was initially examined because of the hypothesis that AMD and cardiovascular disease may share a similar pathogenesis , and fat intake has been associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease , " write Jennifer S.L. Tan , MBBS , BE , from Westmead Millennium Institute , Westmead Hospital in Sydney , Australia , and colleagues from the Blue Mountains Eye Study .
" There is increasing evidence of a benefit from regular dietary fish and omega - 3 ( PUFA ) [ polyunsaturated fatty acid ] intake on the risk of AMD , particularly in people with a lower ratio of omega - 6 to omega - 3 PUFAs .
However , evidence of the association between AMD and total fat or other fat types , such as saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids , is inconsistent . "
The goal of this study was to examine the association between baseline dietary fatty acids and 10 - year incident AMD in an elderly Australian cohort .
AMD was evaluated from retinal photographs in 3654 participants at baseline and in 2454 participants 5 and / or 10 years later .
The participants also completed a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire .
Eating 1 serving of fish per week was associated with lower risk for incident early AMD , after adjustment for age , sex , and smoking ( relative risk [ RR ] , 0.69 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.49 - 0.98 ) .
This association was particularly driven by participants with less than the median consumption of linoleic acid ( RR , 0.57 ; 95 % CI , 0.36 - 0.89 ) .
Results were similar for dietary consumption of long - chain omega - 3 PUFAs .
The risk for incident early AMD was lower in participants who consumed 1 to 2 servings of nuts per week ( RR , 0.65 ; 95 % CI , 0.47 - 0.91 ) .
Protective associations between nut consumption and lower risk for pigmentary abnormalities were evident in nonsmokers , in participants with less than the median ratio of serum total to high - density lipoprotein cholesterol levels , and in those with greater than the median level of beta carotene intake .
" This study provides evidence of protection against early AMD from regularly eating fish , greater consumption of omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids , and low intakes of foods rich in linoleic acid , " the study authors write .
" Regular consumption of nuts may also reduce AMD risk .
Joint effects from multiple factors are suggested . "
Limitations of this study include possible recall or survival bias ; moderate losses to follow - up , introducing possible bias ; and the possibility of chance findings caused by examination of many associations .
" Joint effects on AMD risk are suggested between the consumption of fish , nuts , or long - chain omega - 3 PUFAs and other factors , including smoking , intake of omega -6 PUFAs or beta carotene , and the ratio of serum total cholesterol to HDL - C [ high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ] , " the study authors conclude .
" These findings also suggest that an appropriate balance among various nutrients is essential for maximizing nutritional benefit .
Further studies , particularly clinical trials such as the AREDS [ Age - Related Eye Disease Study ] extension trial , should provide important evidence of whether dietary intervention or supplementation with long - chain omega -3 PUFAs could prevent or delay the development of this significant cause of blindness . "
Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study
The objective of the second study , the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study , by Elaine W. - T. Chong , MD , PhD , MEpi , from the Centre for Eye Research Australia in Melbourne , and colleagues , was to examine the relationship between past dietary fat intake and the prevalence of AMD in a cohort of 6734 Australian participants aged 58 to 69 years in 1990 to 1994 .
The participants completed a food frequency questionnaire at baseline to estimate nutrient intakes , and bilateral digital macula photographs were evaluated for early and late AMD signs at follow - up from 2003 to 2006 .
Odds ratios ( ORs ) were estimated from logistic regression , after adjusting for age , smoking , and other potential confounders .
Higher dietary consumption of trans- unsaturated fats was associated with an increased prevalence of late AMD .
Comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of trans fat intake , the OR for late AMD was 1.76 ( 95 % CI , 0.92 - 3.37 ; P =.02 ) , whereas greater intake of omega - 3 fatty acids was inversely associated with early AMD ( OR for highest quartile vs lowest quartile , 0.85 ; 95 % CI , 0.71 - 1.02 ; P = .03 ) .
The prevalence of late AMD was lower for olive oil intake of 100 mL / week or more vs less than 1 mL / week ( OR , 0.48 ; 95 % CI , 0.22 - 1.04 ; P = .03 ) .
No significant associations with AMD were noted for intakes of fish , total fat , butter , or margarine .
" A diet low in trans - unsaturated fat and rich in omega - 3 fatty acids and olive oil may reduce the risk of AMD , " the study authors write .
Limitations of the study include those inherent in the food frequency questionnaire , failure to differentiate between intake of nonoily and oily fish , use of multiple comparisons , possible residual confounding , and the possibility that olive oil may also be a proxy for certain healthy lifestyles .
" We found that higher TFA [ trans - unsaturated fatty acid ] intake was associated with an increased prevalence of late AMD , while omega - 3 fatty acids and olive oil were associated with a reduced prevalence of early and late AMD , respectively , ” the study authors conclude .
“ Our findings suggest that people who follow a diet low in processed foods high in TFA and rich in omega - 3 fatty acids and olive oil might enjoy some protection from developing AMD . "

One of Hollywood ’s most standard forms of scaring its audience is an oft overused play on humanity ’s basic phobias : acarophobia ( fear of insects that cause itching ) , arachnophobia ( fear of spiders ) , apiphobia ( fear of bees ) , or entomophobia ( fear of insects ) .
People just in general cringe at the sight of either lots and lots of bugs confined to or coming out of nasty spaces , or gigantic insects laying waste to familiar cities and towns .
Back in the golden age of horror movies when every other release was chilling , thrilling , terrifying , or unbelievable , giant bugs and other crawlies were the draw of choice ; audiences swarmed ( get it ? ) to theaters and such films as Them ! , The Beginning of the End , The Deadly Mantis , and The Black Scorpion - just to name a few - became box office gold , often despite their terribly reviewed stories .
And then something new happened .
At some point it became even scarier and more horrific to have humans become the very bugs they sought to destroy .
Men and women slowly transforming into human - sized insect people bent on wreaking havoc on everyone .
Perhaps one of the earliest and best looks into this genre was the original The Fly with Vincent Price .
In it , Andre Delambre has invented a matter disintegrator / integrator in which he and a fly basically switch heads ; man acquires giant fly head , and tiny fly body ends up with the head of the scientist .
Pretty nasty .
Well , movies and plots just got wackier from there .
Here are ten of the coolest human - to - bug movies .
Mansquito ( Mosquitoman ) 2005
A pretty cheesy attempt to cash in on the West Nile Virus scare brought to you by the fine folks at the Sci -Fi Channel .
Dr. Jennifer Allen attempts in earnest to zap a few infected mosquitoes with enough radiation to destroy the deadly virus , but convict - turn - assistant , Ray Erickson becomes one of those wonderful victims of circumstance and gets bombarded by the radiation .
It ’s Mansquito time !
The Mummy Returns 2001
First of all , it does n’t really matter what your movie is about , if you can secure Dwayne ‘ The Rock ’ Johnson to be in it , it ’s certified gold .
In this film , the sequel to The Mummy , The Rock plays Mathayus , the last true Akkadian mercenary with the blood of a scorpion in his 5000 ear - old veins .
When Rick ( Brendan Frasier ) and company try to thwart Imhotep once again , the mummy must face off against the Bracelet of Anubis - risen Scorpion King in full Harryhausen - esque half man -half beast form .
This is the man / bug folks , and it was pretty cool .
Men In Black 1997
Will Smith is Agent J and Tommy Lee Jones is Agent K and you will never know who they are or why they ’ve just investigated an alien presence in your back yard , basically because they ’ve just flashed your brain with a Neuralyzer .
But they can fight , when the situation demands it .
And in the case of Edgar ( the Bug ) played by Vincent D’Onofrio , it was that very time .
Sure , he was an alien , but you ca n’t deny that the ‘ man ’ ( albeit a suit of sorts ) turned into one hell of a bug .
Lost In Space 1998
Okay , okay so the movie ( big budget=big disappointment ) was pretty crappy .
When you take an old TV show that featured such innocent and down - to - earth cast members as Billy Mumy and June Lockhart and revamp the shit out of it using all of the following : William Hurt , Mimi Rogers , Heather Graham , Matt LeBlanc , Gary Oldman , Jack Johnson , and Lacey Chabert , it just does n’t quite feel the same .
At any rate , Gary Oldman ’s Dr. Smith receives a spider bit early on in the film and , eventually , at the end , becomes Spider Smith as it were and there you have this bit ’s ‘ bug guy ’ .
Carry on .
Mimic 1997
Guillermo del
Toro could direct a tampon commercial and it ’d still be cool as hell .
In this addition to his amazing library , we find entomologists Susan ( Mira Sorvino ) and her husband Peter using genetic engineering ( of course ) to create a bug called the Judas Breed that can release an enzyme that will kill off disease carrying cockroaches .
They are predisposed to die off after their work is complete , but a few years later it seems that the Judas Breed is hunting humans by mimicking them .
Pretty wicked .
Slither 2006
Though not bugs in the traditional sense , when Michael Rooker becomes infected by an extraterrestrial being and begins inundating the town with killer slugs , I call it close enough .
He slowly begins to mutate much to his wife ’s ( Elizabeth Banks ) chagrin and he even goes so far as to ‘ impregnate ’ a local girl into a massive egg sack .
It ’s got bugs enough for me and it ’s a really great B - style horror film .
Invasion of the Bee Girls 1973
Mutations are turning sexually active ladies into bee girls .
That ’s really all you need to know about this pretty funny and surprisingly witty ’ 70 ’s ‘ Bee ’ - movie .
Okay , enough puns .
Neil Agar , an agent with the State Department , is on the hunt for whomever is systematically killing men at local clubs .
When Neil discovers another body , he realizes what the women are up to .
Racing to the lab , he interrupts the women as they begin the process of turning another into one of their number .
Of course he blows up the machine responsible and all is well .
Cute film .
Ticks ( Infested ) 1993
Teens camping in a northern California retreat are terrorized by mutant insects created by evil , polluting pot farmers , that will throw them into a terrifying fight for their lives .
And there ’s your plot synopsis folks .
It really is exactly what it ’s about .
However , if you really ca n’t stomach Carlton ( Fresh Prince ’s Alfonso Ribiero ) as much as I can’t , watching him turn into a tick is just something to behold .
Oh , and good old Clint Howard ’s in it , too .
Now you ’re sold .
The Wasp Woman ( The Bee Girl , Insect Woman ) 1959
If it ’s Roger Corman , you know it just has to be good .
And this is all Roger Corman .
Janice gets slightly upset when her cosmetics firm begins losing money .
So , to spark sales , she begins to work with scientist Dr. Zinthrop as a test subject for his radical enzyme extraction from royal Jelly .
Eventually she turns into a giant queen wasp .
Buzz , buzz baby .
The Fly 1986
I have used this classic Cronenberg movie on lists before , and on this one , well , it just had to be number one .
I mentioned the original in the opening because I really wanted to use this far superior remake ( which is an oddity for sure ) and horror classic .
No real need to go into the plot , only to mention that Jeff Goldblum ’s performance as Seth Brundle is just fascinating and something you really need to see for yourself .
It ’s fun to compare the two as there are many similarities , but somehow Cronenberg ’s attempt stands out .
We tend to define perfection as the absence of flaws , which is inherently wrong , since flaws are part of the reality .
Too often , our perception of perfection as a flawless situation or individual proved to be not only difficult to learn , but plain wrong and deceivable .
Striving for perfection causes more harm than good , leading into a land of frustration , weariness and misery .
Defining something by the absence of something else is a mindset of incompletion , a hedonistic and fearful approach .
It ’s hedonistic because we try to isolate only the “ good ” things from the whole , and it ’s fearful because we do that by fear of the other , “ bad ” side .
Choosing only one side of the coin is useless and ineffective .
You ca n’t have a full coin if you chose only one side of it .
On the other hand , being just better assumes you know your flaws and accept them .
You ’re just getting better , not perfect .
You ’re embracing your whole structure .
Not seldom , what you considered to be “ flaws ” are just violent pointers for a path you refuse to see or to take .
What you may call “ flaw ” is in fact just an open window for another reality , usually much better than the current one .
Dry Future versus Rich Present
When you move your focus from your current reality and projecting it into a future , flawless reality in which you are perfect , you are depriving yourself from the only precious tool you have : your present time .
When you step out of the living second and project yourself into a dry future you ’re not actually living to the full .
Whenever you strive for perfection you step out from the current time space continuum and try to insert into another , illusory one .
Whenever you strive for getting better , you ’re in the present moment .
You have to continuously assess your progress , you have to keep your focus on what you ’re doing .
If you had goals , you have to constantly check if you reached them .
And if you did , you have to evaluate your options and set up the next goals .
When you chose to become better , you never get out of your current time space continuum .
Your present is real .
And is rich .
Destination Oriented versus Traveling Oriented
When you strive for perfection you ’re destination oriented : your goal is to attain a certain state , a flawless situation in which you are perfect .
When you strive for being better you ’re traveling oriented : your goal is not so much the destination , which changes continuously , but the travel itself .
I find much more joy by traveling than by arriving to a certain destination .
As long as the current destination is also the departure point for my next trip , I can understand and I enjoy it .
But if my final destination is reached , that means it ’s the end of the travel .
My trip has to stop .
Which I simply do n’t want to happen .
I enjoy the trip much too much .
Focus On Bad vs Focus On Good
Striving for perfection is such a wearing attitude , it really drains you out .
In fact , striving for perfection is quite a negativistic approach , if you look carefully .
Since we define perfection as the absence of flaws , when we strive for perfection we focus on eliminating our flaws .
Hence , we focus on flaws , instead of things we can improve .
Striving to be better is a fulfilling attitude , it fuel your body and mind .
Striving for the better is focusing on the positive side .
By accepting your flaws as part of your inherent nature , focusing on becoming better forces you to focus on your positive qualities and start enhancing what you already have an can grow .
The Dumbo Paradigm
I guess you all know by now the famous Dumbo cartoon .
For those living on planet Mars in the lastÂ 50 years , Dumbo is the touching story of a baby elephant which had a big problem : huge ears .
So huge that it actually had integration problems in his environment , a circus .
His mother had to defend him from picky boys saying bad things about it , the other workers in the circus were also bothered by the little cub which only use seemed to be a very dangerous leap into a bucket filled with water , and nothing more .
That little elephant with those incredibly big ears was no good even in a circus .
Dumbo was tainted by his flaw : those huge and almost obscene ears .
But after the little elephant touches the bottom of his sorrow , with a little help from his friends , stumble upon a great discovery .
His ears are so big that it can actually … fly !
Right , those ears are so big that it can become a flying mammal just by flipping them .
His biggest flaw has become the trampoline for his biggest success .
The cartoon ends with a happy image of Dumbo flying all over the country above its personal tour train .
There is much to be learned from this story , and I do intend to write another blog post about it , but for now I ’ll just say that Dumbo became better not because he tried to eliminate his flaw , but because he accepted it and made the best out of it .
Dumbo focused on becoming better not perfect .
If Dumbo would have been a perfect elephant , I really doubt that Disney would have made a cartoon about it .
Perfection is boring .
Getting better is where all the fun is .
A Bunny's Tale
-- By Clemstra--
Copyright 2003
" Okay kids , what shall we tell you ? "
" We want to know how Bunny came to us , " they chanted .
The man and woman looked down at the children , " Okay , "
said the woman .
" I have to get Bunny ready , but your father
can tell you the tale of how she came to us . "
The men / ogre creatures were still laughing , cackling and Bunny
was getting bored , even sleepy .
Not to mention it was cold
and Bunny 's nipples were freezing .
The Men / Ogre 's had dug her
up from hibernation and so far they had n't wanted either sex
or to eat her .
Perhaps they were not quite aware of what she was ?
She asked , were they aware she was a multi , one of those evolved
towards the light , that is in the intermediate state between
mortal and immortal ?
In her case possessing more then a million
lives / re-embodiments .
They gave her a " Huh . "
Sighing she stated
it in simpler terms they might understand .
" you know , my people have more then one life , we need to get rid
of energy ? " " Huh " they responded .
Bunny further simplified , " We need to get eaten every now and then .
You can eat us more then once , we may even become immortal , maybe ? "
They scratched their heads then smiled , " eat you " they said .
Bunny smiled , they had got it " yes , you can eat me . "
" Bunny girl , " they chimed gleefully .
" Well , my type of multi does have bunny like features prefering
earthen homes , thus my tail and ears like a bunny , but otherwise
I 'm a human woman . "
" Eat you , " they chimed .
Bunny sighed again with a flick of her fluffy bunny tail .
Okay ,
these were pretty simplistic .
She wondered if they even knew
about cooking , but they had clothing so they must know how to
at least dress themselves .
" Yes , eat me , " Bunny said .
" You dug me out of a hibernative
state so at least eat me . "
They were confused again , Bunny tried make it simple for them .
" Eat me , okay just eat me . "
They smiled and finally grabbed her , but instead of eating her , they
started laughing and cackling about how yummy she would be .
Bunny hoped
this was not an indication of all of her new neighbors in this part of
the forest .
She 'd moved here because of the big carnivorous tree .
Come
spring she would let the tree eat her , thus proving friendship and a
mutual alliance .
That done she would build an underground house under
the tree 's deadly reach , which would be a good protection for
her , except in winter .
Like now for instance .
It was winter ,
the tree was asleep and these @# %^ % had woke her out of a sound
hibernation without eating her .
Bunny wondered if they needed encouragement .
Perhaps they needed
to know she was one of the willing prey types .
It was cold , she
was shivering .
She started pointing out her features , guiding
their hands to parts of her body so they could see how yummy she
was .
" See , yummy soft breasts , with a good amount of meat to fat
ratio and plentiful portions .
Soft yummy arms , yummy fingers , "
she waved her fingers in front of them .
" Good ribs , soft stomach
flesh , fine soft tender thighs , excellent rump roast . "
They clapped
at her presentation but did not seem to want to eat her .
" Okay , " said Bunny in a now dangerous sounding voice , her bunny
ears moving down in anger .
The tone of her seemed angry , making
them move back .
" You dug me up out of a sound sleep and will not eat me .
Why ? "
She screamed ?
" Not hungry , " said their apparent leader .
" Not hungry , NOT HUNGRY , " shouted Bunny .
" Why did you dig me
up then ? "
" Wanted to see Bunny girl , pet you , never had a pet before , "
they explained .
" Okay , " she said apparently taking this in .
" that 's IT , Die ,
die teasing scum . "
She yelled jumping at them with clear intent .
The men / ogre creatures started moving back fast , then seemed to
remember that they were in fact bigger then her .
Bigger , but maybe
the Bunny creature was really mean .
They started to run again .
Bunny started to leap at the leader with what looked like a really
deadly foot maneuver .
No one had told him Bunny people could be
mean .
He thought they were cute , cuddly , fun , sexy and most of
all yummy .
Now the Bunny girl was going berserk on them .
Suddenly something wrapped itself around Bunny just as her foot
was about to make a nasty indentation on the leader of the
men / ogre 's face .
Bunny found herself twirled around to face a
man on horseback with a whip .
" What 's going on here , " said the well dressed , clean and
finely manicured man with handsome features .
" Bunny woman try to hurt us , " said the men / ogre creatures .
The man looked at her , his light brown eyes questioning her .
" They dug me out of hibernation , teased me , and would not
eat me , " said Bunny .
" Okay , I can see the problem here , " he said .
" Guys , " he
addressed the men / ogre creatures , " I 'll handle this , but you
had best leave for the moment . "
" Want to pet Bunny , " they said with pathetic need .
" Do n't think that would be wise right now , Bunny is obviously very
pissed . "
The men / ogre creatures sadly turned and trudged into the forest .
" Sorry about that , " he said unwrapping his whip from Bunny 's body .
" They really do n't mean any harm , their just so child like sometimes . "
Bunny shivered in the cold , " I 'm sorry too , it 's just I 'm " and
Bunny sniffled a bit .
" Oh , I 'm sorry , your cold and in need , " he said .
" Tell you what ,
why do n't I take you to my house , my wife and I can fix you up
proper , pop you in a big oven then eat you ? "
" Your not teasing me are you , " a now almost sobbing Bunny asked ?
" No , no , really you look simply delicious .
We would even like
to play with you . "
" Well , " said Bunny , " I 've never really had sex with another
woman before , just men . "
" Well , maybe you can decide when you meet my wife , you know
nothing 's carved in stone , " he replied .
" Let 's get you home
first though " and he wrapped a nice silk cloak around the
shivering Bunny .
He brought her home , his wife was delighted .
" Bunny honey , " she
said .
" I understand those meanies were teasing poor soft , yummy
so fun looking Bunny . "
She stroked Bunny 's ears , Bunny 's soft
blonde hair and body .
Bunny felt herself stir sexually and
decided to give this thing a chance .
So the nice young man and his wife started playing with Bunny .
They stroked her body to a fine high pitch , then the man had
sex with Bunny from behind while his wife played with Bunny's
nice breast roasts .
They showed Bunny the nice kitchen .
They prepared Bunny with great style , something Bunny greatly
enjoyed .
Then Bunny , all nicely seasoned , with potatoes and
carrots surrounding her , an apple in her mouth , went into
the nice warm oven to bake .
While Bunny baked , the man and
wife then made love on the kitchen table .
They ate Bunny for
dinner that night , she was the yummiest thing they had ever
eaten .
They told Bunny this while they ate her .
They told
Bunny this once she got her new body and stood before them .
They then invited Bunny to come to bed with them , for they had
a very big soft bed that would easily fit three .
Bunny was a
nice , soft addition to their bedroom .
In the morning they
convinced Bunny to stay with them .
For it was still winter ,
cold ... brrrrr , and was n't this so much better then hibernating .
Bunny stayed the winter .
In the spring they pointed out to Bunny that she could just
as easily study plants and bugs , ( entomology ) from their house
in the forest as she could from the big , bunny people eating tree .
Would not Bunny 's people be just as impressed by her scholarly
pursuits from their house as from one Bunny might make underground ?
Bunny stayed with them .
Then the man 's wife had babies , and Bunny
helped them raise the babies , falling in love with them herself .
" And that children , " said the man , " is how Bunny came to live with
us and is still with us today . "
The children clapped their hands as their mother came in .
" Bunny
in the oven , " they chimed .
" Yes dear 's , Bunny 's in the oven baking .
It is after all Spring ,
Easter to be precise .
What would Easter be without an Easter
Bunny in the oven . "
They all agreed , as they gleefully went Easter
egg hunting .

Driver 's License Suspension in Atlanta
Protecting Your Driving Privileges After a DUI
No matter what vehicle you drive , a DUI arrest in Georgia can result in the suspension of your driver 's license .
While your license is suspended , you may have a restricted ability to drive , or none at all .

How can my license be suspended ?
You may face license suspension more than once in a DUI case .
You may face automatic license suspension during a DUI arrest if you refuse to submit to a chemical blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) test .
Your license may also be suspended as a penalty of DUI conviction .
In either case , the suspension of your driver 's license can have serious consequences on your life , and it is crucial that you take prompt legal action with an Atlanta DUI lawyer at your side .
Refusing a Chemical BAC Test
The Georgia law of implied consent ( O.C.G.A § 55 - 5 - 67.1 ) dictates that individuals driving in the state automatically give consent to submit to a chemical blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) test .
If you refuse to submit to a chemical test such as the breath test after being arrested for DUI , the officer may revoke your driver 's license and issue you a temporary driving permit .
Individuals have 10 days after the arrest to schedule a hearing with the Georgia DDS .
If you fail to schedule an ALS hearing , you could lose your driving privileges for up to 18 months !
Convicted of Driving Under the Influence
Individuals who are convicted of DUI may face license suspension as one of the penalties , alongside the penalties of heavy monetary fines , jail time , and probation .
Because the ALS hearing with the Georgia DDS is separate from the DUI criminal trial , it is possible to face license suspension more than once over the duration of a DUI case .
A skilled legal professional may help you protect your driving privileges throughout a DUI case — from the aftermath of an arrest and during the trial .

Midwifery professor Denis Walsh argues that labor pain is good for women :
In an article for Evidence Based Midwifery , published by the Royal College of Midwives , Dr Walsh said the NHS was too quick to give in to requests for pain - killing injections .
He said : ‘ A large number of women want to avoid pain , but more should be prepared to withstand it .
Pain in labour is a purposeful , useful thing which has a number of benefits , such as preparing a mother for the responsibility of nurturing a newborn baby . ’ [...]
He said labour pain was a timeless component of motherhood , but warned : ‘ There has been a loss of rites - of - passage meaning to childbirth , so pain and stress are viewed negatively . ’
[ Daily Mail - - where else ? ) ]
The guilt trip is part of Prof .
Walsh 's larger crusade against epidural anesthesia for laboring women in the National Health Service .
It 's one thing to argue that the risks of a particular pain - relief strategy outweigh the benefits , or to point out that some technique is often used on people who do n't need it .
Those are empirical questions .
It 's another thing entirely to assert that women ought to endure pain for their own good .
That 's a dubious value judgement based on an unsupported claim about the benefits of pain .
Does Walsh have studies supporting a link between labor pain and maternal responsibility ?
Or is that just his pet theory that he feels entitled to dispense as if it were a medical fact ?
If pain builds character , does he advocate torturing new dads to harden them up ?
Even if it 's true that labor pain confers some marginal psychological benefit , a responsible clinician would lay out the potential costs and benefits and let the patient decide .
Of course , the principle applies for pain relief options .
Every option from drug - free birth to general anesthesia has its own costs and benefits .
It 's pretty rare that any one strategy is medically necessary , so the decision should be left to the woman .
Dr. Amy Tuteur , The Skeptical OB , has a great post about the sexist roots of the anti-anesthesia evangelism .
She argues that Walsh is carrying on a long and ignoble tradition of romanticizing labor pain and dismissing women 's suffering .
Paloma lives in the basement of a tall , regal - looking building on a smart street in west London .
Hers is a spacious studio flat with a neat patio area , just big enough for a potted herb garden and wrought - iron table with matching chairs .
Inside , the living quarters feature buffed wooden floorboards and neutral walls ; there are rows of reference books , Penguin Classics , National Geographic and Vogue .
Below these , taking centre stage on the mantelpiece , is a framed graduation photograph .
It 's nothing extraordinary , just a typical post - ceremony portrait of a slightly startled looking twentysomething with a fixed grin , clutching a rolled certificate .
But in its present context , the image of Paloma with chestnut ringlets spilling erratically from under a mortarboard is somewhat incongruous .
For today – some five years later – almost directly below where the photo stands , the former Economic History student is squatting in the middle of her living room carpet , rummaging through a suitcase stuffed with lace garters , feathered face masks and beaded nipple tassels .
Paloma pulls out a silver sequin suspender belt which she hoiks over faded denim jeans : " What do you think ? " she teases , giving a flamboyant twirl .
Her friend Camilla , a long , sinewy creature who is curled up on the sofa , looks up briefly : " I think you 'll be the belle of the ball , babe , " she purrs , before returning her attention to painting her fingernails .

Moments later , the doorbell rings .
" That 'll be the girls ! " shouts Paloma , as she skips off down the hallway before returning with Claire , a smartly dressed brunette , and Bianca , an elfin figure with long auburn hair .
" Sorry we 're late ! " they coo , offloading a bottle of rosé and a bag of deli snacks in the kitchen .
" There was an absolute disaster in the office last night ! "
Claire announces : " So I did n't get home until the early hours and had absolutely no time to think about what to wear ! " Bianca smiles .
" I would n't worry about that babe , " she replies with a wink .
" You 're new to this , but I can tell you that if past experience is anything to go by , it wo n't be long until it all comes off again ! "
The women break into giggles and Claire gives a conciliatory shrug : " Better have a glass of wine in that case , " she grins , and heads off in search of a corkscrew .
Tonight , it transpires , is something of an initiation for Claire , who , at 32 , is the oldest of the four .
For the first time , she will join the rest of her friends at what has become one of the most important nights in their social diary : a Killing Kittens party , an unusual private - members ' event where , in the words of its organisers , " the sole aim is the pursuit of female sexual pleasure " .
According to Paloma , who is something of an old - timer ( this will be her fifth party ) , if the event is a success , after an hour or two of cocktails and outrageous flirting , the gathering will turn into an orgy .
It wo n't take long to find out .
But before we do , there is some serious preening , plucking and wine - drinking to be done , and while the girls prepare excitedly for the night ahead , they are eager to explain why attractive young career women such as themselves choose to spend their Saturday nights seeking out no -holds - barred group sex .
" I know that for some people the idea is hard to grasp , " Paloma begins .
" But for me it makes perfect sense . "
At 28 , Paloma has a successful career in the City , which often keeps her at her desk from 7 am until 11 pm ; the toll on her social life can be heavy and means she has limited time to dedicate to forging a meaningful relationship .
But not having a boyfriend , she insists , should n't mean having to forfeit her sex life : " I 've always had a strong libido , " she says , " and with a high - powered job to contend with , I find sex is an amazing way to unwind . "
Not that she is n't interested in finding a partner in the long term .
On the contrary .
Getting married and having children is a priority .
Paloma 's own parents have been married for 29 years , and the secret of their relationship , she says , is that they both waited until they found the right person .
" Many women get involved in unsatisfactory relationships just because they believe that any companionship is better than none .
But that is not what I want for myself .
I want to wait until I meet the right man , and when I do , I 'll concentrate my efforts on making our relationship last . "
Until then , she says , she will continue to ensure that she still gets her thrills , whenever and however she wants .
And it seems she 's not alone .
Judging by the booming numbers attending parties such as tonight 's – Killing Kittens alone boasts 6,500 members , 70 per cent of whom are women – we are witnessing something of a sexual revolution , or at the very least , a new age of female sexual assertiveness .
According to the Adult Industry Trade Association , a record number of sex toys were sold in the UK last year – the majority to young women .
Of the £ 100 m - worth of toys bought , the biggest grossers – by a long stretch – at outlets such as Ann Summers , Love Honey , Myla and sextoys .
co.uk , were hand - held vibrators , designed for women to use on their own , or with their partner .
Whereas a few years ago , the mere mention of a Rampant Rabbit would elicit uncomfortable squeals , today high - end vibrators – some made of gold and costing hundreds of pounds – are treated as ornamental treasures to be displayed and celebrated , not hidden away in a drawer .
One wonders what the physician who invented the " manipulator " in 1870 – a steam - powered dildo used by doctors to relieve symptoms of " hysteria " in women – would make of this trend .
" I 'd love to see his face , " says Paloma .
" If only he 'd known what he was starting ! "
On a more serious note , Paloma says that the widespread availability and popularity of vibrators has helped to normalise discussions about the female libido .
This , she believes , is very empowering .
" Like when Kate Moss was spotted buying a vibrator in New York .
It 's only a small thing really , but it helps show men and women that it 's OK to take charge of your sex life , and that helps other women realise they are normal for having a healthy sex drive . "
Two bottles and much preening later , the now somewhat inebriated gaggle arrives at the allotted venue for tonight 's party , a discreet private mansion in central London .
It is 10 pm and outside there is little sign of life , but behind an imposing front door , some 200 revellers are getting into the spirit of the occasion .
Once inside , it becomes clear why the girls feel so at home here .
Like them , 70 per cent of the clientele are female , well - educated and conventionally good looking .
The few men in attendance shuffle about , forming feeble packs – safety in numbers , one imagines , for this is a place where they constitute the submissive gender , and they know it .
Men can't even attend these events without a female chaperone , and once there , they are forbidden from making any kind of advance .
So until they get an invite to " come and play " from a " kitten " , they have to stand on the sidelines and watch the action unfolding .
We arrive to a surprisingly tame scene .
Downstairs , the champagne flows freely while revellers exchange polite , even wary , niceties .
Some of the groups , quite clearly new to this , seem unwilling to commit to a conversation with their new acquaintances in case they are , according to some private code , verbally contracting themselves to the other group .
But it appears they need n't have worried – for when the party gets going , it becomes a free - for - all .
It takes a while to find this out , however .
For the first hour or two , you might even forget the reason why you 're here .
Apart from a couple of topless young women , who could be escapees from a frisky college party , the vibe is low - key – a bit of dancing , a little flirtatious banter , but not much more .
And then , like something from a vampire movie , at 1 am almost to the second , this subdued affair transforms surprisingly quickly into a full - blown orgy .
By the time I return to the main upstairs salon – in which a huge pile of adjoining mattresses , overlooked by a floor - to - ceiling mirror , is placed tellingly in the middle of the room – the walls are lined with couples and huddles of women , all looking on eagerly as some 20 bodies ( male and female ) get to it .
There are threesomes , foursomes and indecipherable groupings in the throes of various intimate acts , some having full - blown sex , either oblivious to or spurred on by their audience .
Sometimes it's hard to tell where one group stops and the next begins .
More and more of those on the sidelines begin to slide into the pile , without any obvious invitation , and no one seems willing to turn down anyone who wants to get involved .
( It 's hard to tell how widely condoms are being used , but I did notice a basket of them by the front door . )
As I make my escape , I catch a conversation by the ground - floor stairway : a naked woman , recently returned from the bedroom , addresses an apprehensive - looking friend : " Why do n't you just come upstairs ? " she asks her reassuringly .
" If you feel like getting involved , that 's great , but if you do n't , that 's cool too . "
The pair join hands and move towards the stairs .
I later tell Paloma that the whole affair has left me feeling a little unsettled .
But it should n't , she insists : " Whether or not you personally agree with what happened is sort of by - the -by .
The point is that we acknowledge that a lot of women have the same desires as men and should have the chance to explore them . "
It is the acceptance that women have needs and desires that lies at the heart of what Paloma insists is a new sexual outlook .
If we continue to be shocked by women going to sex parties , or using vibrators , then we are doing the female population a disservice .
" This is supposed to be a progressive , liberated society , " she argues .
" And yet some people still insist on making women feel like social pariahs if they admit to enjoying an orgasm .
I think it 's about time we faced up to the fact that some women just enjoy sex .
Is that really so hard to believe ? "

" Not only do these images reveal the great accomplishments of Apollo , they also show us that lunar exploration continues , " said LRO project scientist Richard Vondrak of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " They demonstrate how LRO will be used to identify the best destinations for the next journeys to the moon . "
Forty years later , you can still see the lunar modules , and even footprints , left on the moon by the Apollo missions .
NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , or LRO took new pictures between July 11th and 15th .
NASA officials say the next round of photographs , to be taken during the final mapping orbit , will have even greater resolution .

A new order is emerging on Wall Street after the worst crisis since the Great Depression  one in which just a couple of victors are starting to tower over the handful of financial titans that used to dominate the industry .
On Thursday , JPMorgan
Chase became the latest big bank to announce stellar second - quarter earnings .
Its $ 2.7 billion profit , after record gains for Goldman Sachs , underscores how the government ’s effort to halt a collapse has also set the stage for a narrowing concentration of financial power .
“ One theme here is that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan really have emerged as the winners , as the last of the survivors , ” said Robert Reich , a professor at the University of California , Berkeley , who was secretary of labor in the Clinton administration .
Both banks now stand astride post - bailout Wall Street , having benefited from billions of dollars in taxpayer support and cheap government financing to climb over banks that continue to struggle .
They are capitalizing on the turmoil in financial markets and their rivals ’ weakness to pull in billions in trading profits .
Government “ safety net ” programs like Social Security and food stamps have pulled growing numbers of Americans out of poverty since the mid-1990s .
But even before the current recession , these programs were providing less help to the most desperately poor , mainly nonworking families with children , according to a new study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a private group in Washington .
The recession is expected to raise poverty rates , economists agree , although the impact is being softened by the federal stimulus package adopted this year , which temporarily expanded measures like food stamps , child tax credits , unemployment benefits and housing and tuition aid .
In view of the gloomy employment report last week , economists are debating whether to increase stimulus funds over all .
But in a side argument , poverty experts are also asking whether elements of the package aimed at the most vulnerable Americans should be extended beyond their scheduled expiration in two years or even made permanent .
The new safety - net study found that federal aid programs had helped tens of millions of Americans stay afloat in recent years , especially those with low - end jobs who benefited from rising tax credits .
I started writing a post about implementing actors in D when I realized that there was something wrong with the way thread spawning interacts with data sharing .
Currently D’s Thread class closely mimics its Java counterpart , so I started wondering if this may be a more general problem–a problem with mixing object - oriented paradigm with multithreading .
In functional languages like Erlang or Concurrent ML , you start a thread by calling a function– spawn or create , respectively .
The argument to this function is another function –the one to be executed in a new thread .
If you think of a new thread as a semi- separate application , the thread function is its “ main ” .
You may also pass arguments to it –the equivalent of argc , argv , only more general .
Those arguments are , of course , passed by value ( we ’re talking functional programming after all ) .
In non-functional languages it ’s possible and often desirable to share data between threads .
It ’s very important to know which variables are shared and which are n’t , because shared variables require special handling –they need synchronization .
You may share global variables with a thread , or you may pass shared variables to it during thread creation .
You may also provide access to more shared variables during the thread ’s lifetime by attaching and detaching them from the original shared variables –that ’s how message queues may be described in this language .
In the object - oriented world everything is an object so , predictably , a ( capital letter ) Thread is an object too .
An object combines data with code .
There is a piece of data associated with every thread –the thread ID or a handle–and there are things you can do to a thread , like pause it , wait for its termination , etc .
But there ’s more : A Thread in Java has a thread function .
It ’s a method called run .
The user defines his or her own thread by inheriting from Thread and overriding run .
Since run takes no arguments , data has to be passed to the new thread by making it part of the derived thread object .
In general a thread object contains two types of data : shared and non-shared .
The non-shared data are the value arguments passed by the creator to the thread function , possibly some return values , plus state used internally by the thread function .
Thread data may form some logical abstraction or , as it often happens , have the structure of a kitchen sink after a dinner party .
Because of the presence of shared state , a Thread object must be considered shared , thus requiring synchronization .
As I described in my previous posts , public methods of a shared object must either be synchronized or lock free .
But what about the run method ?
It can not be synchronized because that would make the whole thread object inaccessible to other threads , including its creator ( which may be okay for a daemon thread , but wold be a fatal flaw in general ) .
It makes perfect sense for run to be private , since nobody should call it from the outside ( or , for that matter , from the inside ) .
But the reason for private methods not requiring synchronization is that they are only called from public methods , which must be synchronized .
This is not true for run — run is not called from under any lock !
So essentially run has unfettered access to all ( potentially shared ) data stored in this .
Unless the programmer is very disciplined , the potential for data races is high .
And that ’s where Java stands right now ( the Runnable interface has the same problems ) .
If you ’ve been following my blog , you know that I ’m working on a type system that eliminates races .
If I can convince Walter and Andrei , this system might be implemented in the D programming language .
As I mentioned , D ’s treatment of threads comes directly from Java and therefore is inherently unsafe .
Like in Java , D’s Thread object has a run method .
So how could D , with the race - free type system , improve on Java ?
One possibility is to make the run method lockfree .
A lockfree method ( public or private ) is not synchronized but its access to this is severely restricted .
It can only operate on lockfree data members ( if any ) , unless it takes the object ’s lock or calls a synchronized method ( all public methods of a shared object are , by default , synchronized ) .
Let me give you a small example :
class Counter : Thread { public : // public methods are implicitly synchronized void inc ( ) { ++_cnt ; } void dec ( ) { -- _cnt ; } private : override void run ( ) lockfree { inc ( ) ; // ok : calling a synchronized method wait ( 10000 ) ; synchronized ( this ) { // ok : explicit synchronization on this _cnt = _cnt * _cnt ; } // _cnt /= 2 ; // error : not synchronized !
} int _cnt ; } // usage : auto cnt = new shared Counter ; cnt.start ; cnt.inc ; cnt.join ;
This approach would work and guarantee freedom from races , but I do n’t think it fits D. Unlike Java , which is so OO that even main is a method of an object , D is a multi- paradigm language .
It does n’t have to force threads into an OO paradigm .
And the thread function , being a thread equivalent of main does n’t have to be a method of any object .
In my opinion , the functional approach to thread creation would serve D much better .
Here ’s how I see it :
class Counter { public : void inc ( ) { ++_cnt ; } void dec ( ) { -- _cnt ; } int get ( ) const { return _cnt ; } void set ( int cnt ) { _cnt = cnt ; } private : int _cnt ; } void counter Fun( shared Counter cnt ) { cnt.inc ; Thread.sleep( 10000 ) ; synchronized ( cnt ) { int c = cnt.get ; cnt.set ( c * c ) ; } } // usage : auto cnt = new shared Counter ; Thread thr = Thread.spawn( &counterFun , cnt ) ; thr.start ; cnt.inc ; thr.join ;
I find it more logical to have start and join operate on a different object , thr , rather than on the counter , cnt .
The static template method spawn accepts a function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments that are either values or shared or unique objects .
In particular , you could pass to it your ( shared ) communication channels or message queues to implement the message - passing paradigm .
Such spawn primitive could be used to build more complex classes –including the equivalents of a Java ’s Thread or a Scala ’s Actor .
The argument between deflation and inflation is still raging like a wildfire .
From reading many articles and following many experts on the topic , it would seem that there is still no clear consensus as to what is going to happen long term .
Just think of how many experts actually saw the housing bubble forming .
Not since the Great Depression have we seen consumer prices contract so severely .
Much of the argument for inflation comes from the actions taken by the U.S Treasury and Federal Reserve .
Without a doubt , we have never witnessed such massive injections of liquidity and bailouts happening all at once .
The argument goes that with so much money pumped into the system we must see prices rising at a certain point .
Maybe but that will be for another day .
Yet the current facts point to a disturbing menace that is deflation :
The most widely followed measure of inflation in the U.S. is the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) .
As the chart above indicates , we have seen our first year over year decline in the CPI since the 1950s .
Now keep in mind , last year we had the massive oil bubble which means we will probably have year over year declines for a few more months simply because oil nearly touched $ 150 per barrel last year .
For our purposes we are going to look at consumer prices as our measure of inflation and deflation since this impacts most people in a more understandable way .
Now before going forward , it is important to look at what areas are contracting during this recession :
Now this is important to highlight .
The 12 month adjusted data tells us the following :
Categories with decreases :
Transportation
Energy
Categories with increases :
Medical care
Education
Food
Categories neutral or slightly up :
Housing
Apparel
Recreation
Now keep in mind this is over 12 months .
Yet if we look at the latest data , we start seeing that food and housing are now starting to decline .
A large part of this is because of the excess housing on the market and the BLS measures owners ’ equivalent of rent ( OER ) which has been coming down .
After all , with 26 million unemployed or underemployed Americans hiking the rent may not get you new tenants in many markets .
Yet you will notice that in the last 3 months , every category aside from medical care and education has come down steadily .
The evidence so far is we have been experiencing deflation .
Now we are going to examine five major sectors of the economy and look deeper into the deflation and inflation debate .
Sector # 1 – Housing Prices
( Deflation or Inflation ) = Deflation
I ’m not sure how anyone can argue that housing prices have seen any sign of inflation during the current recession .
The largest line item for Americans is housing and it has been contracting at a furious pace .
The reason the BLS over the past 12 months has seen a slight up tick is because of the OER measure .
Initially when the bubble burst , people shifted to renting which either neutralized prices or even slightly increased rental demand .
However , now that unemployment is raging and people are losing their jobs , the rental market is now being hammered which is now showing up in the CPI data .
Housing bottoms normally take two forms .
First , you will see a bottom in housing starts :
This is for 1 - unit private housing starts .
As you can tell , the market has completely collapsed .
Yet if you squint , you can see a tiny yellow weed sprouting up .
Of course , this is the non-sense of green shoots , as if superman will suddenly emerge with a construction hat and save the day by building homes again .
In the case of housing starts , we may have hit a bottom but just put that into context in the chart above .
We still have the Alt - A and pay Option ARM disaster waiting for us and this will assure us more cheap inventory for years to come .
So in this sense , we may have already reached a bottom with housing starts but the thing many forget is we will never see peak bubble action like we did earlier in the decade .
Demographics and the flood of inventory via foreclosures assure us ample supply .
The second bottom takes the shape of lower prices and we are still falling in every sense of the word :
Prices are still going down .
The Case - Shiller Index is the best measure since it looks at same home repeat sales .
You have a few people like Jim Cramer talking about housing bottoms but they are looking at the median price .
The problem with looking at the median price is that it is artificially high in the mania phase and low when a flood of distress homes hit the market .
A perfect example is California where over 50 percent of homes sold are foreclosure resales .
Ironically , now that you are seeing more price cuts in mid to higher priced areas you will see the median price go up or neutralize .
Yet overall , prices are still heading lower .
This is something that I have examined in detail when I discuss the 10 Reasons why California will not see a housing price bottom until 2011 .
I am looking more at the Case - Shiller data instead of the median price which can fluctuate wildly .
It is rather clear to any observer that we are seeing deflation in the housing market .
There is little debate here .
It is hard to envision any price pressure to the upside with such a horrible job market .
In normal times , people pay for their mortgages with jobs and not high flying banana republic mortgages like pay Option ARMs and Alt - A products .
Sector # 2 – Auto Sale Prices and Sales
( Deflation or Inflation ) = Deflation
There is little doubt that we are seeing deflation in the automotive sector .
With General Motors and Chrysler hitting rock bottom with bankruptcy , there is little pricing power here .
Certainly auto workers , a large employment sector are n’t seeing wage increases .
First , in 2008 the auto companies ’ weak foundation was exposed with the oil bubble .
After all , who wants to drive around an urban tank with a V - 10 engine on the 405 freeway ?
It is n’t like you are driving in the Serengeti running away from rabid hyenas in treacherous terrain .
I would see one person in these behemoths stuck on the freeway idling in their tank as the $ 4.50 gallon of oil just evaporated into the atmosphere .
Some people feel bad about what occurred but keep in mind these companies prided themselves on cheap oil fueling their tanks forever and the high profit margins on these vehicles .
Even after the oil bubble imploded , the damage had already been done .
There was no coming back .
Now you can find many of these urban safari all - terrain vehicles on eBay and Craigslist selling for 50 , 60 , or 70 percent off their once MSRP .
Looking for a Cadillac Escalade ?
You can get a 2002 with all the trimmings for a little under $ 17,000 :
The fascinating thing that occurred during this bubble is the notion that everyone was rich and therefore should have the artifacts of the wealthy .
The poor had access to middle class credit .
The middle class had access to upper class wealth .
The upper class spent like a new Gilded Age was here .
The Escalade is a perfect example .
I would drive around areas in Los Angeles County were people were living in run down apartments but out in front you would see an Escalade .
Once again you can thank easy financing here .
You would have people living in giant McMansions with a $ 700,000 mortgage when they were only pulling in $ 100,000 .
Early last year on the blog , I talked about people going broke on a $ 100,000 salary .
At the time , people had a hard time believing this .
Now , this is virtually a daily thing and many of these people are the folks living it up with the ticking Alt - A and Option ARM time bomb .
The fact of the matter is , auto sales have fallen off a cliff :
With all the attention being given to the housing bubble , we sometimes forget to mention that we also had an automotive bubble .
What allowed the automotive bubble to explode ?
Easy and dubious financing once again .
Since the early 1990s auto sales never went below the 14 and 15 million annual sale mark .
This lasted well into May of 2008 .
Think about that .
The stock market was already crashing and housing imploding yet we were still over 14 million auto sales per year !
Nuts .
The chart above is rather clear .
Annual sales have been cut virtually in half in one year .
So the dynamics in the auto industry reflect housing prices to some extent .
Lower prices .
What people also fail to examine is cars last much longer than they did in the past .
There is no reason to replace a car every three years with a new model .
A good car with proper maintenance can last you a decade .
Suddenly many people have no choice but to fix and hold onto their current car .
The Federal Highway Administration lists 247,264,605 motor vehicles in the United States .
From this number 134,000,000 are automobiles and 110,000,000 are trucks .
As of 2000 there were 105,000,000 households .
So basically we have two cars per household here and this does not include buses and public transportation .
So it is n’t like many people need new cars .
People are holding on to their cars more tightly and as you can see from the sales chart above , people are voting with their wallets .
Easy financing built up the housing and auto industries for the past decade .
Sector # 3 – Cost of Education – Higher for Public but non-Elite Private will Implode
( Deflation or Inflation ) = Deflation for non-Elite private and inflation for Public
As we highlighted early in the article , only two areas are now seeing inflation .
Those are medical care and education .
Education I hate to say is also experiencing a bubble with easy financing .
How many people do you know who went or sent their kids to a private non-elite college paying $ 40,000 a year in tuition to pursue a career that would n’t pay more than $ 30,000 a year ?
Clearly , many of these people would have never been able to afford the tuition cost if it was n’t for easy access to student loans .
That of course is now changing .
The Chronicle of Higher Education had a fascinating article examining this trend :
“ Is it possible that higher education might be the next bubble to burst ?
Some early warnings suggest that it could be .
With tuitions , fees , and room and board at dozens of colleges now reaching $ 50,000 a year , the ability to sustain private higher education for all but the very well - heeled is questionable .
According to the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education , over the past 25 years , average college tuition and fees have risen by 440 percent – more than four times the rate of inflation and almost twice the rate of medical care .
Patrick M. Callan , the center ’s president , has warned that low - income students will find college unaffordable .
Meanwhile , the middle class , which has paid for higher education in the past mainly by taking out loans , may now be precluded from doing so as the private student - loan market has all but dried up .
In addition , endowment cushions that allowed colleges to engage in steep tuition discounting are gone .
Declines in housing valuations are making it difficult for families to rely on home - equity loans for college financing .
Even when the equity is there , parents are reluctant to further leverage themselves into a future where job security is uncertain . ”
I am not surprised at all by this .
It was stunning to see many people go to private schools to study a career that was fading and dishing out $ 50,000 a year to pursue their “ dream ” field .
Again , this notion of having access to everything right now is the fuel that made people feel that they needed the “ dream house ” and the “ dream car ” and the “ dream vacation ” only to wake up in a debt induced nightmare .
Few of the fields like engineering , education , or medicine appeal to Americans because why go into these fields where you have to learn “ math ” when you can go into selling real estate for six - figures a year with only a GED .
Of course that game is now over and probably many of these private institution catering to these dream degrees will fade as well .
What we will now see is value added for certain educational fields .
No longer will a B.A. in Basket Weaving land you a promising job into the middle class .
I do want to make a distinction here .
Private elite colleges will still have some pricing strength because of their names .
And many public schools will have fierce demand because they are lower priced and offer a lucrative option to many .
Take for example the University of California and California State University systems here in California .
Both institutions are hiking tuition by 10 percent ( again ) and they are actually taking less students :
“ ( Daily Sundial )
An even larger proposed budget cut is anticipated for the entire CSU system .
The original planned budget reductions , which would have fallen just below the $ 100 million mark , could now reach as high as $ 400 to $ 700 million .
For CSUN , this large discrepancy would mean cuts of up to $ 49 million , far from the first figures of just under $ 7 million .
“ California is dealing with a budget shortage of more than $ 24 billion .
A financial meltdown , ” said Erik Fallis , the media relations specialist at the CSU chancellor ’s office .
“ As a consequence , the CSU is facing an unprecedented cut in state support . ”
Unprecedented is the key word in these latest figures .
When Gov. Schwarzenegger announced the first proposals in 2008 , CSUN had already pooled money in reserves in preparation for this type of situation , said Harry Hellenbrand , CSUN ’s provost and vice president for academic affairs .
According to CSUN ’s budget update web site , if the CSU budget for the upcoming year is cut by approximately $ 600 million , all campuses will have to reduce their incoming students by 40,000 instead of the projected 10,000 .
While tuition increases and class reductions are obvious , other solutions to curtail the budget are n’t definitive . ”
There you have it .
We are assured that the UC and CSU will be hiking fees for the next few years because of California ’s horrific budget planning and $ 24 billion budget deficit .
And with California ’s 11.5 percent unemployment rate ( the highest in record keeping history ) you can rest assured that many will go back to school to pursue a degree ( or another one if they have fallen into a career with little viability .
So in education you will see a split in the market .
Public universities will accelerate tuition hikes , curtail enrollment , and become more like private elite institutions .
Non-elite private colleges will have the hardest time adjusting since people will begin questioning the value of degrees and also , lack of loans will slow enrollments down .
Sector # 4 – Employment – Wage Cuts – Hours , Furloughs , and Layoffs
( Deflation or Inflation ) = Deflation
There are few things more deflationary than unemployment .
Would you work one month for free if your employer asked you to ?
Well if you work for British Airways , they have already asked this question :
“ ( Yahoo ! )
British Airways is asking thousands of its staff to work for free for up to four weeks , spokeswoman Kirsten Millard said Tuesday .
In an e-mail to all its staff , the airline offered workers between one and four weeks of unpaid leave — but with the option to work during this period .
British Airways employs just more than 40,000 people in the United Kingdom .
Last month , the company posted a record annual loss of £ 400 million ( $ 656 million ) . ”
Now think about that .
This only adds more pressure to prices on the downside .
When you yank the pay of an employee either through cutting hours or asking them to work for free , they have less money to spend .
This is also happening in the U.S. where companies are furloughing people or cutting back on overtime .
In our country where nearly 70 percent of GDP is consumption based , what do you think this will do for spending ?
Of course people point to the trillions in bailouts but I have n’t seen any of that money rolling my way .
Have you ?
Unless you are part of the crony banking syndicate you are basically bailing out those who created and financed this mess in the first place .
With 26,000,000 unemployed and underemployed Americans , there will be more pricing pressure on the downside .
This chart below shows how weak the market is in terms of pricing power :
Some people point to the 1970s of a time where inflation raged and we had price jumping up in the face of recession .
This was the so - called stagflation .
Yet much of this was again based on energy but also , the nature of globalization was n’t as big as it is now .
We still had some control .
Now , we have essentially out sourced our entire manufacturing base and became a service driven economy .
Nothing was more prominent than when GM filed for bankruptcy , Wal - Mart announced it would be hiring 22,000 more people .
Trading $ 20 an hour jobs for $ 10 an hour jobs .
That is deflation in wages .
But if you notice the above chart , both aggregate hours worked and inflation are both plunging .
What does this tell us ?
That deflation for the moment it taking hold of consumer prices and wages .
Aggregate hours is a more sensitive indicator than overall employment since it looks at aggregate weekly hours worked .
In fact , this may be a good indicator of when things may start turning up since companies may not be hiring people early in the recovery when it comes but instead , using the British Airways example will start paying those employees who took the month off for the month .
Even major strongholds like state governments will be cutting wages and not hiring as much :
“ LOS ANGELES , June 21 ( Xinhua ) —
In response to California ’s budget crisis , more than half of the state senators have agreed to reduce their 116,208 - dollar salary this year , most taking a five - percent cut starting July 1 , it was reported on Sunday .
During budget negotiations last week , Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg took the lead by offering to have his salary reduced by five percent , according to the Los Angeles Tims . ”
Now of course this is a joke especially here in California where we have one of the most dysfunctional politicians up in Sacramento .
But tens of thousands of state workers have already been furloughed in effect taking a 10 percent pay cut .
Does that sound like inflation to you ?
And the power of the unions which once had a say in pricing power has little clout in a global marketplace .
How are you going to compete with China and India and their wages ?
You can ’t .
Plus , Americans like cheap goods .
Unless we do boneheaded moves like the Smooth - Hawley Tariff
Act we can expect more pricing pressure to the downside .
Sector # 5 – Stock Market Losses
( Deflation or Inflation ) = Deflation
The stock markets are off by 40 percent from their 2007 peak which shows the depth of the collapse since we have had a virtually non -stop rally since the March 2009 lows .
I ’ve been re-reading Charles Kindleberger ’s The World in Depression 1929 – 1939 which is a fantastic read about the global collapse during the 1930s .
It is a dense read but worth it if you really want to understand the multiple factors that led to the Great Depression .
Some are arguing that the current pains we are feeling are because of the stock market crash .
I tend to believe the crash of the stock market is a symptom of the global debt bubble we went through .
This is what Professor Kindleberger had to say about the stock market crash during 1929 :
“ In the light of the sudden collapse of business , commodity prices , and imports at the end of 1929 , it is difficult to maintain that the stock market was a superficial phenomenon , a signal , or a triggering , rather than part of the deflationary mechanism .
One should not be dogmatic about it , but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is something to the conventional wisdom that characterized the crash as the start of a process .
The crash led to a scramble for liquidity on the part of both lenders to the call market and owners of stocks .
In the process , orders were canceled and loans called .
The action of the Federal Reserve in buying securities in the open market and lowering the rediscount rate in New York brought credit markets quickly into good order .
By this time , however the deflation had been communicated to fragile commodity markets and durable goods industries .
The stock market crash is less interesting for the irony it permits the historian , bemused by the foibles of greedy men , than for starting a process that took on a dynamic of its own . ”
In our current case , the stock market crash was merely reflecting the collapse in the credit markets and the housing bubble bursting .
The stock market did not create this recession but is merely reflecting the reality on the street .
When we hit the peak in 2007 , it reflected the peak of euphoria .
When it busted , it reflected the panic .
The current jump is optimistically betting on a second half recovery which fails to adequately analyze the commercial real estate bubble bust which is going to hit us and the immense amount of toxic assets still in our system .
Even if we dump all these toxic assets onto the taxpayer , they will fail and guess who will end up paying for it ?
In the end , prices will still need to find a bottom .
Let us take a look at the Dow World Index :
Now if we look at the Dow World Index , we see that prices nearly fell by 60 percent to the March bottom .
And since that bottom , it has rallied by 47 percent but is still off by 40 percent .
The bottom line is that the world is in recession .
This is not isolated .
Looking at these five major sectors you realize that deflation seems to be the major issue at our door .
And what people fail to realize is that American households have lost a stunning $ 13.87 trillion in wealth from stocks and real estate .
So even though the Fed and U.S. Treasury are saving their crony banking buddies , the bottom line is the average American is still suffering .
The Atlantic has a great break down why most Americans feel like they are getting shafted in the current scheme of things :
So while American households just lost $ 13.8 trillion only $ 700 billion or so will be felt by the average American .
The rest of the trillions will go to bailout and patch up the Swiss cheese balance sheets of the Wall Street cronies .
By this time during the Great Depression we were already marching people down to the Pecora Investigations bringing justice to those who brought the economy to a halt .
Today , we are still giving more and more power to those who are largely at the helm of this mess .
So for the time being , demand destruction is leading to price deflation .

Lonesome George , the world 's most inveterate bachelor , may finally be about to settle down .
The 90 - year - old Pinta island tortoise is the last of his kind , and scientists have been coaxing the giant tortoise to mate with a similar species for 15 years – but , despite being in his sexual prime , George has shown little interest .
Last year , one of the many female giant tortoises to have tried their luck finally succeeded in seducing him .
It was the first time George had succumbed in 36 years – but the resulting eggs turned out to be infertile .

Undeterred , his Galapagos Island handlers tried again this year .
And on Monday , they found five eggs in his compound at the Charles Darwin research station on the island of Santa Cruz .
Now conservationists must wait out the 120 - day incubation period to see if any of this year 's batch contains a tiny tortoise sprog .
If so , it may be time to give George a new nickname .

A human rights tribunal verdict of racial profiling against a Toronto constable sets " an impossibly high standard " that will be challenged in court , Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair said yesterday .
" We 're not denying the existence of bias or the possibility of racial profiling , " Blair said in an interview with the Star .
He said the tribunal 's decision last month that Ron Phipps , who is black , was a victim of racial profiling by Const .
Michael Shaw , who is white , means " you can have the best of intentions and be totally without bias but none of that matters if someone wants to believe you are biased . "
The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario ruled that by stopping Phipps while he was delivering mail on a Bridle Path street in 2005 , checking with a homeowner he spoke to , trailing him and verifying his identity with a white letter carrier , Shaw was guilty of racial profiling .
There was no overt racism , the tribunal said , but Shaw 's actions showed he acted " whether consciously or unconsciously " because Phipps was a black man in an affluent neighbourhood .
That decision , said Blair , " sets a standard that 's new , that can't be met " by any reasonable , fair - minded officer .
Police lawyers are preparing a challenge to the Divisional Court of the Superior Court of Ontario , he said .
" They were n't suggesting for a moment that he was doing anything wrong , " said Blair .
" Frankly , verifying the information does n't strike me as unreasonable .
Their finding demonstrates a seriously flawed misunderstanding of the duties of a police officer . "
" The tribunal decision speaks for itself , " Margaret Layton , counsel to the chair of the human rights tribunal , said yesterday .
The chief is sending a message via police intranet this morning to the entire force " that they still have to do their job and it must be done courteously and free of bias .
But they should know that when they conduct themselves that way they have the support of the service to do their jobs .
I do n't want them to feel diminished . "
Blair said he discussed the decision yesterday with Barbara Hall , chair of the Ontario Human Rights Commission , which last year turned over all complaint hearings to the independent tribunal .
For the past two and a half years , the police have made " very significant progress " working with the Toronto Police Services Board and the Ontario Human Rights Commission to make sure officers are hired , trained and working as best they can to deal with a very diverse city , Blair said .
Hall agreed , saying , " They 're making a lot of progress . "
The Bridle Path encounter is " an occurrence from 2005 , " she said , but called the decision " confirmation that systemic discrimination is often something of which people are unaware and it requires hard work to get rid of . "
Phipps 's claim against Blair himself and the Toronto police as a whole , which was separated from the original complaint involving Shaw , is to be heard Sept. 14 , although the police force is disputing where it should be heard .

Blair pointed out the tribunal found no evidence that Shaw tried to intimidate Phipps .
And he was gratified , he said , that Shaw politely asked Phipps for identification .
Blair asked for an interview with the Star because of his concern that " this public airing will have a really negative effect , reaffirming with some parts of the population their belief that this is what police are doing .
Russian energy giant Gazprom has inadvertently walked into an online racism debate with the announcement of its new joint venture in Nigeria - Nigaz .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and his Nigerian counterpart last week agreed the $ US2.5 billion venture to build refineries , pipelines and gas power stations in Africa 's most populous nation .
The name is meant to be an amalgamation of Nigeria and Gazprom , pronounced " nye - gaz " , but can be read phonetically as an offensive term for people of black African origin .
" How more derogatory can it be ... let 's join forces in making our government rename this JV , " said the creator of Nigerians No Nigaz , a group set up on social networking website Facebook .
Other bloggers took a more mocking approach .
One African - American blogger recommended a playlist of songs from US hip - hop artists including 50 Cent and Tupac Shakur for the Nigaz launch party .
But many comments about the branding blunder on the Twitter and other social networking sites were from white bloggers .
" White people are making too much of this .
As long as the Russians pay us , they can call it what they like , " said one Nigerian in the commercial hub , Lagos , asking not to be named .

I 've installed 7.04 into an old pc I built .
It unfortunately set the screen resolution to 1280x1024 instead of 1680x1050 .
It has a a radeon rv100 qy 7000 / ve video card and I tried to get it to work .
I went to ' Debugging Xautoconfiguration ' page and came across a bit of a brick wall .
It said " sudo mv /etc/xorg.conf /etc/xorg. conf.orig "
But what is that ?
I managed to figure out I needed to open a terminal after hours of research and type it in .
Then it returned an error of file not found .
A few hours later I managed to figure out it actually meant /etc/ X11 / xorg.conf ! !!
Then the instructions said " restart X " ( Huh ??? what is that ?
Who writes this crap ?
After a few more hours I discovered I need to simply press Ctrl - Alt - backspace .
Gosh WHY could n't it just say that !!!
I did that and now my LCD screen states it can't display the screen mode and I should change it .
So I 'm stuck .
I can't change what I can't see .
I 'm typing this in a Internet cafe .
What can I do now to recover my PC ?
I thought Ubuntu was suppose to be easy !
I guess I fell for the line ' It just works ' .... :-((
I 've tried and tried to progress with this OS .
But its been brick wall after brick wall with the official documentation .
Can you Ubuntu guys spend some time on it ?
I 'm really down atm .... so excuse me ...

Microwave weapons will get an upgrade ( Image : Air Force Photo )
THE Pentagon ’s enthusiasm for non-lethal crowd - control weapons appears to have stepped up a gear with its decision to develop a microwave pain - infliction system that can be fired from an aircraft .
The device is an extension of its controversial Active Denial System , which uses microwaves to heat the surface of the skin , creating a painful sensation without burning that strongly motivates the target to flee .
The ADS was unveiled in 2001 , but it has not been deployed owing to legal issues and safety fears .
Nevertheless , …
It has now been put on the market for £ 350,000 .

For the guy who never leaves his desk !
Heinz has worked up a mini microwave that is USB powered .
I ca n’t believe my eyes a mini microwave so I can cook things right at my desk no way .
I am not sure where the USB device craze started but it sure is fun to see what they come up with .
I mean could n’t you just plug a microwave into the wall or the power strip your computer is plugged into ?
I mean it ’s not like your putting this thing in your laptop bag and taking it to Starbucks with you to heat up your coffee cake .
Not on the market yet sorry your just going to have to use a regular size microwave in the mean time .

Bowing to international pressure and unprecedented protests by hundreds of women on the streets of Kabul , the Afghan government promised in April to review a new law imposing severe restrictions on women in Shiite Muslim families .
Last week , though , Human Rights Watch discovered that a revised version of the Shiite Personal Status Law had been quietly put into effect at the end of July — meaning that Shiite men in Afghanistan now have the legal right to starve their wives if their sexual demands are not met and that Shiite women must obtain permission from their husbands to even leave their houses , “ except in extreme circumstances . ”
Ahmad Masood / Reuters
The new law was signed by President Hamid Karzai , who is depending on support from Sheik Muhammad Asif Mohseni , the country ’s most powerful Shiite cleric , in this week ’s presidential election .
Shiites , who were oppressed by the Sunni-led Taliban government , are believed to make up between 10 and 20 percent of Afghanistan ’s population .
Sheik Mohseni and scholars close to him were allowed to write the first draft of the new law , and he was reportedly unhappy that Parliament had introduced a provision that banned men from marrying girls under the age of 16 .
When the law was first approved , President Barack Obama called it “ abhorrent , ” but has not yet responded to reports that it has now been revised and put into effect , perhaps because Afghanistan ’s election is just days away .
In April , Al Jazeera visited Kabul ’s main Shiite mosque to record Sheik Mohseni expressing his displeasure at the controversy over the law , and reporters from the news station spoke with some Shiite women who endorsed it :
Days later , my colleague Abdul Waheed Wafa shot this video of women gathered outside the mosque and a madrasa run by Sheik Asif Mohseni to protest the law in the face of the taunts of a larger group of men who supported it :
Although the law applies only to Shiites , Soraya Sobhrang , commissioner for women ’s rights at the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission , said in April that it could influence a proposed family law for the Sunni majority and a draft law on violence against women .
She told The Times in April , “ This opens the way for more discrimination . ”
According to Human Rights
Watch , the new law also “ grants guardianship of children exclusively to their fathers and grandfathers ” and “ effectively allows a rapist to avoid prosecution by paying ‘ blood money ’ to a girl who was injured when he raped her . ”
Brad Adams , the Asia director for the human rights group , said that President Karzai “ has made an unthinkable deal to sell Afghan women out in return for the support of fundamentalists in the August 20 election . ”
On Saturday , the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission in Kabul took a less dim view , calling the fact that the law was amended at all , “ a step forward . ”
Jerome Starkey explained on Saturday in The Independent why support from Shiite leaders was so important to Mr. Karzai :
Update : Twitter says that the account suspensions were due to human error .
We 've included Twitter 's entire statement at the end of this article .
—-
There seems to be a wave of suspensions going around Twitter today , and it 's turning quickly into an echo chamber of confusion and frustration .
We 've received several tips ( the first one being from Mashable guest writer Matt Singley ) that a range of users are being taken down , including some with large followings such as @marismith and the LA Times Top of the Ticket account .
A quick look at Twitter chatter is another indication that something 's amiss .
What if you 've been suspended ?
The best thing to do is to inform Twitter through either their Twitter Spam account or by sending a request through their Customer support system .
We 've sent a note to members of the Twitter team for clarification on this situation .
We think it 's safe to say that if there is an issue with Twitter suspensions and their algorithm , that Twitter will act upon it quickly .
We will update this post when we learn more about the the suspensions .
In the meantime , if you have been suspended or know someone who has been suspended in error , please let us know in the comments .
Update 1 : Twitter has responded to our inquiry .
They 're aware of the situation and will be making an announcement shortly .
Update 2 : The following is an update from Twitter 's status tumblelog :
Two tax provisions in the health - care bill voted on by the House Ways and Means Committee earlier this summer have gained significant attention .
One would impose a surtax on high - income earners .
The other would force individuals ( or their employers ) who do not have approved health - insurance plans to pay a tax penalty .
But there are other " revenue provisions " in the bill that also deserve a close look .
One would change the law to mandate that the Internal Revenue Service slap penalties on honest but errant taxpayers .
Under current law , taxpayers who lose an argument with the IRS can generally avoid penalties by showing they tried in good faith to comply with the tax law .
In a broad range of circumstances , the health - care bill would change the law to impose strict liability penalties for income - tax underpayments , meaning that taxpayers will no longer have the luxury of making an honest mistake .
The ability of even the IRS to waive penalties in sympathetic cases would be sharply curtailed .
Recent experience shows that Congress needs to be careful about imposing no - fault penalties .
In 2004 , Congress adopted very large automatic penalties for failures of taxpayers to attach a tax - shelter reporting form to their tax returns .
While penalties make sense where a taxpayer deliberately fails to file a return , the approach here was too unforgiving .

Is Global Warming Real or Not ?
( OrganicJar )
As the years pass and data accumulate , it is becoming evident that global warming may be a fraud .
Climate change is natural and ongoing , but the Earth has not warmed significantly over the last thirty years .
Nor has there been a single negative effect of any type that can be unambiguously attributed to global warming .
As I write , satellite data show that the mean global temperature is the same that it was in 1979 .
The extent of global sea ice is also unchanged from 1979 .
Since the end of the last Ice Age , sea level has risen more than a hundred meters .
But for the last three years , there has been no rise in sea level .
If the polar ice sheets are melting , why is n't sea level rising ?
Global warming is supposed to increase the severity and frequency of tropical storms .
But hurricane and typhoon activity is at a record low , though the media would have you think otherwise .
Every year in the US , more than forty thousand people are killed in traffic accidents .
But not one single person has ever been killed by global warming .
The number of species that have gone extinct from global warming is exactly zero .
Both the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets are stable .
The polar bear population is increasing .
There has been no increase in infectious disease that can be attributed to climate change .
We are not currently experiencing more floods , droughts , or forest fires .
If you can find scientific prove that I ’m wrong let me know .
Why do people think the planet is warming ?
One reason is that the temperature data from weather stations appear to be hopelessly contaminated by urban heat effects .
A survey of the 1221 temperature stations in the US by meteorologist Anthony Watts and his colleagues is now more than 80 percent complete .
The magnitude of putative global warming over the last 150 years is about 0.7 °C .
But only 9 percent of meteorological stations in the US are likely to have temperature errors lower than 1 °C .
More than two - thirds of temperature sensors used to estimate global warming are located near artificial heating sources such as air conditioning vents , asphalt paving , or buildings .
These sources are likely to introduce artifacts greater than 2 °C into the temperature record .
Another cause of global warming hysteria is the infiltration of science by ideological zealots who place politics above truth .
Earlier this month , the Obama administration issued a report that concluded global warming would have a number of deleterious effects on the US .
In 1995 , one of the lead authors of this report told me that we had to alter the historical temperature record by " getting rid " of the Medieval Warm Period .
The Obama report refers to - six times - the work of a climate scientist named Stephen H. Schneider .
In 1989 , Schneider told Discover magazine that " we have to offer up scary scenarios , make simplified , dramatic statements , and make little mention of any doubts we might have . "
Schneider concluded " each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest . "
Schneider 's position is not unusual .
In 2007 , Mike Hulme , the founding director of the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research in Britain , told the Guardian newspaper that " scientists and politicians must trade truth for influence . "
While releasing a politicized report ( PDF link ) that prostitutes science to politics , the Obama administration simultaneously suppressed an internal EPA report that concluded there were " glaring inconsistencies " between the scientific data and the hypothesis that carbon dioxide emissions were changing the climate .
If we had an appreciation for history , we would not be fooled so easily .
It has all happened before , albeit on a smaller scale in an age where people had more common sense .
On May 19 , 1912 , the Washington Post posed these questions : " Is the climate of the world changing ?
Is it becoming warmer in the polar regions ? "
On November 2 , 1922 , the Associated Press reported that " the Arctic Ocean is warming up , icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the waters too hot . "
On February 25 , 1923 , the New York Times concluded that " the Arctic appears to be warming up . "
On December 21 , 1930 , the Times noted that " Alpine glaciers are in full retreat . "
A few months later the New York Times concluded that there was " a radical change in climatic conditions and hitherto unheard of warmth " in Greenland .
About the only thing that has changed at the Times since 1930 is that no one working there today is literate enough to use the word " hitherto . "
After the warm weather of the 1930s gave way to a cooling trend beginning in 1940 , the media began speculating on the imminent arrival of a new Ice Age .
We have now come full circle , mired in a hopeless cycle of reincarnated ignorance .
H. L. Mencken understood this process when he explained " the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed by an endless series of hobgoblins , most of them imaginary . "

We just got a brief glimpse at the new PlayStation Eye - based augmented reality EyePet game from Sony , which is on track for a holiday release on the PS3 .
It 's no Project Natal , but what the game lacks in gesture - based interaction ( though we were able to pet and play with the little guy pretty intuitively ) it makes up for in extensive adorability .
You can naturally play , feed , groom and customize your pet -- even teach the thing to draw shapes and bring them to life in a sense -- but it 's surprisingly fun to just watch the little dude scamper around in seemingly real space .
The title will be available both as a standalone game and as a bundle with the PlayStation Eye .
Check out a video of the game in an early beta state after the break , and you can find Joystiq 's E3 impressions of the game here
In the U.S. , about 70 % of public water supplies are fluoridated .
This equates to approximately 185 million people , which is over half the number of people drinking artificially fluoridated water worldwide .
Some countries have areas with high natural fluoride levels in the water .
These include India , China and parts of Africa .
In these countries measures are being taken to remove the fluoride because of the health problems that fluoride can cause .
In Europe , only Ireland ( 73 % ) , Poland ( 1 % ) , Serbia ( 3 % ) , Spain ( 11 % ) , and the U.K. ( 11 % ) fluoridate any of their water .
Most developed countries , including Japan and 97 % of the western European population , do not consume fluoridated water .
1 ) Fluoride is the only chemical added to water for the purpose of medical treatment .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) classifies fluoride as a drug when used to prevent or mitigate disease ( FDA 2000 ) .
As a matter of basic logic , adding fluoride to water for the sole purpose of preventing tooth decay ( a non-water borne disease ) is a form of medical treatment .
All other water treatment chemicals are added to improve the water ’s quality or safety , which fluoride does not do .
2 ) Fluoridation is unethical .
Informed consent is standard practice for all medication , and one of the key reasons why most of Western Europe has ruled against fluoridation .
With water fluoridation we are allowing governments to do to whole communities ( forcing people to take a medicine irrespective of their consent ) what individual doctors cannot do to individual patients .
Put another way :
Does a voter have the right to require that their neighbor ingest a certain medication ( even if it is against that neighbor ’s will ) ?
3 ) The dose can not be controlled .
Once fluoride is put in the water it is impossible to control the dose each individual receives because people drink different amounts of water .
Being able to control the dose a patient receives is critical .
Some people ( e.g. , manual laborers , athletes , diabetics , and people with kidney disease ) drink substantially more water than others .
4 ) The fluoride goes to everyone regardless of age , health or vulnerability .
According to Dr. Arvid Carlsson , the 2000 Nobel Laureate in Medicine and Physiology and one of the scientists who helped keep fluoridation out of Sweden :
“ Water fluoridation goes against leading principles of pharmacotherapy , which is progressing from a stereotyped medication — of the type 1 tablet 3 times a day — to a much more individualized therapy as regards both dosage and selection of drugs .
The addition of drugs to the drinking water means exactly the opposite of an individualized therapy ” ( Carlsson 1978 ) .
5 ) People now receive fluoride from many other sources besides water .
Fluoridated water is not the only way people are exposed to fluoride .
Other sources of fluoride include food and beverages processed with fluoridated water ( Kiritsy 1996 ; Heilman 1999 ) , fluoridated dental products ( Bentley 1999 ; Levy 1999 ) , mechanically deboned meat ( Fein 2001 ) , tea ( Levy 1999 ) , and pesticide residues ( e.g. , from cryolite ) on food ( Stannard 1991 ; Burgstahler 1997 ) .
It is now widely acknowledged that exposure to non-water sources of fluoride has significantly increased since the water fluoridation program first began ( NRC 2006 ) .
6 ) Fluoride is not an essential nutrient .
No disease , not even tooth decay , is caused by a “ fluoride deficiency . ” ( NRC 1993 ; Institute of Medicine 1997 , NRC 2006 ) .
Not a single biological process has been shown to require fluoride .
On the contrary there is extensive evidence that fluoride can interfere with many important biological processes .
Fluoride interferes with numerous enzymes ( Waldbott 1978 ) .
In combination with aluminum , fluoride interferes with G- proteins ( Bigay 1985 , 1987 ) .
Such interactions give aluminum - fluoride complexes the potential to interfere with signals from growth factors , hormones and neurotransmitters ( Strunecka & Patocka 1999 ; Li 2003 ) .
More and more studies indicate that fluoride can interfere with biochemistry in fundamental ways ( Barbier 2010 ) .
7 ) The level in mothers ’ milk is very low .
Considering reason # 6 it is perhaps not surprising that the level of fluoride in mother ’s milk is remarkably low ( 0.004 ppm , NRC , 2006 ) .
This means that a bottle - fed baby consuming fluoridated water ( 0.6 – 1.2 ppm ) can get up to 300 times more fluoride than a breast - fed baby .
There are no benefits ( see reasons # 11 - 19 ) , only risks ( see reasons # 21 - 36 ) , for infants ingesting this heightened level of fluoride at such an early age ( an age where susceptibility to environmental toxins is particularly high ) .
8 ) Fluoride accumulates in the body .
Healthy adult kidneys excrete 50 to 60 % of the fluoride ingested each day ( Marier & Rose 1971 ) .
The remainder accumulates in the body , largely in calcifying tissues such as the bones and pineal gland ( Luke 1997 , 2001 ) .
Infants and children excrete less fluoride from their kidneys and take up to 80 % of ingested fluoride into their bones ( Ekstrand 1994 ) .
The fluoride concentration in bone steadily increases over a lifetime ( NRC 2006 ) .
9 ) No health agency in fluoridated countries is monitoring fluoride exposure or side effects .
No regular measurements are being made of the levels of fluoride in urine , blood , bones , hair , or nails of either the general population or sensitive subparts of the population ( e.g. , individuals with kidney disease ) .
10 ) There has never been a single randomized controlled trial to demonstrate fluoridation ’s effectiveness or safety .
Despite the fact that fluoride has been added to community water supplies for over 60 years , “ there have been no randomized trials of water fluoridation ” ( Cheng 2007 ) .
Randomized trials are the standard method for determining the safety and effectiveness of any purportedly beneficial medical treatment .
In 2000 , the British Government ’s “ York Review ” could not give a single fluoridation trial a Grade A classification – despite 50 years of research ( McDonagh 2000 ) .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) continues to classify fluoride as an “ unapproved new drug . ”
Swallowing fluoride provides no ( or very little ) benefit
11 ) Benefit is topical not systemic .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC , 1999 , 2001 ) has now acknowledged that the mechanism of fluoride ’s benefits are mainly topical , not systemic .
There is no need whatsoever , therefore , to swallow fluoride to protect teeth .
Since the purported benefit of fluoride is topical , and the risks are systemic , it makes more sense to deliver the fluoride directly to the tooth in the form of toothpaste .
Since swallowing fluoride is unnecessary , and potentially dangerous , there is no justification for forcing people ( against their will ) to ingest fluoride through their water supply .
12 ) Fluoridation is not necessary .
Most western , industrialized countries have rejected water fluoridation , but have nevertheless experienced the same decline in childhood dental decay as fluoridated countries .
( See data from World Health Organization presented graphically in Figure ) .
13 ) Fluoridation ’s role in the decline of tooth decay is in serious doubt .
The largest survey ever conducted in the US ( over 39,000 children from 84 communities ) by the National Institute of Dental Research showed little difference in tooth decay among children in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities ( Hileman 1989 ) .
According to NIDR researchers , the study found an average difference of only 0.6 DMFS ( Decayed , Missing , and Filled Surfaces ) in the permanent teeth of children aged 5 - 17 residing their entire lives in either fluoridated or unfluoridated areas ( Brunelle & Carlos , 1990 ) .
This difference is less than one tooth surface , and less than 1 % of the 100 + tooth surfaces available in a child ’s mouth .
Large surveys from three Australian states have found even less of a benefit , with decay reductions ranging from 0 to 0.3 of one permanent tooth surface ( Spencer 1996 ; Armfield & Spencer 2004 ) .
None of these studies have allowed for the possible delayed eruption of the teeth that may be caused by exposure to fluoride , for which there is some evidence ( Komarek 2005 ) .
A one - year delay in eruption of the permanent teeth would eliminate the very small benefit recorded in these modern studies .
14 ) NIH - funded study on individual fluoride ingestion and tooth decay found no significant correlation .
A multi-million dollar , U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) - funded study found no significant relationship between tooth decay and fluoride intake among children .
( Warren 2009 ) This is the first time tooth decay has been investigated as a function of individual exposure ( as opposed to mere residence in a fluoridated community ) .
15 ) Tooth decay is high in low - income communities that have been fluoridated for years .
Despite some claims to the contrary , water fluoridation cannot prevent the oral health crises that result from rampant poverty , inadequate nutrition , and lack of access to dental care .
There have been numerous reports of severe dental crises in low - income neighborhoods of US cities that have been fluoridated for over 20 years ( e.g. , Boston , Cincinnati , New York City , and Pittsburgh ) .
In addition , research has repeatedly found fluoridation to be ineffective at preventing the most serious oral health problem facing poor children , namely “ baby bottle tooth decay , ” otherwise known as early childhood caries ( Barnes 1992 ; Shiboski 2003 ) .
16 ) Tooth decay does not go up when fluoridation is stopped .
Where fluoridation has been discontinued in communities from Canada , the former East Germany , Cuba and Finland , dental decay has not increased but has generally continued to decrease ( Maupomé 2001 ; Kunzel & Fischer , 1997 , 2000 ; Kunzel 2000 ; Seppa 2000 ) .
17 ) Tooth decay was coming down before fluoridation started .
Modern research shows that decay rates were coming down before fluoridation was introduced in Australia and New Zealand and have continued to decline even after its benefits would have been maximized .
( Colquhoun 1997 ; Diesendorf 1986 ) .
As the following figure indicates , many other factors are responsible for the decline of tooth decay that has been universally reported throughout the western world .
18 ) The studies that launched fluoridation were methodologically flawed .
The early trials conducted between 1945 and 1955 in North America that helped to launch fluoridation , have been heavily criticized for their poor methodology and poor choice of control communities ( De Stefano 1954 ; Sutton 1959 , 1960 , 1996 ; Ziegelbecker 1970 ) .
According to Dr. Hubert Arnold , a statistician from the University of California at Davis , the early fluoridation trials “ are especially rich in fallacies , improper design , invalid use of statistical methods , omissions of contrary data , and just plain muddleheadedness and hebetude . ”
Serious questions have also been raised about Trendley Dean ’s ( the father of fluoridation ) famous 21 - city study from 1942 ( Ziegelbecker 1981 ) .
Children are being over - exposed to fluoride
19 ) Children are being over - exposed to fluoride .
The fluoridation program has massively failed to achieve one of its key objectives , i.e. , to lower dental decay rates while limiting the occurrence of dental fluorosis ( a discoloring of tooth enamel caused by too much fluoride .
The goal of the early promoters of fluoridation was to limit dental fluorosis ( in its very mild form ) to10 % of children ( NRC 1993 , pp. 6 - 7 ) .
In 2010 , however , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reported that 41 % of American adolescents had dental fluorosis , with 8.6 % having mild fluorosis and 3.6 % having either moderate or severe dental fluorosis ( Beltran - Aguilar 2010 ) .
As the 41 % prevalence figure is a national average and includes children living in fluoridated and unfluoridated areas , the fluorosis rate in fluoridated communities will obviously be higher .
The British Government ’s York Review estimated that up to 48 % of children in fluoridated areas worldwide have dental fluorosis in all forms , with 12.5 % having fluorosis of aesthetic concern ( McDonagh , 2000 ) .
20 ) The highest doses of fluoride are going to bottle - fed babies .
Because of their sole reliance on liquids for their food intake , infants consuming formula made with fluoridated water have the highest exposure to fluoride , by bodyweight , in the population .
Because infant exposure to fluoridated water has been repeatedly found to be a major risk factor for developing dental fluorosis later in life ( Marshall 2004 ; Hong 2006 ; Levy 2010 ) , a number of dental researchers have recommended that parents of newborns not use fluoridated water when reconstituting formula ( Ekstrand 1996 ; Pendrys 1998 ; Fomon 2000 ; Brothwell 2003 ; Marshall 2004 ) .
Even the American Dental Association ( ADA ) , the most ardent institutional proponent of fluoridation , distributed a November 6 , 2006 email alert to its members recommending that parents be advised that formula should be made with “ low or no -fluoride water . ”
Unfortunately , the ADA has done little to get this information into the hands of parents .
As a result , many parents remain unaware of the fluorosis risk from infant exposure to fluoridated water .
Evidence of harm to other tissues
21 ) Dental fluorosis may be an indicator of wider systemic damage .
There have been many suggestions as to the possible biochemical mechanisms underlying the development of dental fluorosis ( Matsuo 1998 ; Den Besten 1999 ; Sharma 2008 ; Duan 2011 ; Tye 2011 ) and they are complicated for a lay reader .
While promoters of fluoridation are content to dismiss dental fluorosis ( in its milder forms ) as merely a cosmetic effect , it is rash to assume that fluoride is not impacting other developing tissues when it is visibly damaging the teeth by some biochemical mechanism ( Groth 1973 ; Colquhoun 1997 ) .
Moreover , ingested fluoride can only cause dental fluorosis during the period before the permanent teeth have erupted ( 6 - 8 years ) , other tissues are potentially susceptible to damage throughout life .
For example , in areas of naturally high levels of fluoride the first indicator of harm is dental fluorosis in children .
In the same communities many older people develop skeletal fluorosis .
22 ) Fluoride may damage the brain .
According to the National Research Council ( 2006 ) , “ it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain . ”
In a review of the literature commissioned by the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , fluoride has been listed among about 100 chemicals for which there is “ substantial evidence of developmental neurotoxicity . ”
Animal experiments show that fluoride accumulates in the brain and alters mental behavior in a manner consistent with a neurotoxic agent ( Mullenix 1995 ) .
In total , there have now been over 100 animal experiments showing that fluoride can damage the brain and impact learning and behavior .
According to fluoridation proponents , these animal studies can be ignored because high doses were used .
However , it is important to note that rats generally require five times more fluoride to reach the same plasma levels in humans ( Sawan 2010 ) .
Further , one animal experiment found effects at remarkably low doses ( Varner 1998 ) .
In this study , rats fed for one year with 1 ppm fluoride in their water ( the same level used in fluoridation programs ) , using either sodium fluoride or aluminum fluoride , had morphological changes to their kidneys and brains , an increased uptake of aluminum in the brain , and the formation of beta - amyloid deposits which are associated with Alzheimer ’s disease .
Other animal studies have found effects on the brain at water fluoride levels as low as 5 ppm ( Liu 2010 ) .
23 ) Fluoride may lower IQ .
There have now been 33 studies from China , Iran , India and Mexico that have reported an association between fluoride exposure and reduced IQ .
One of these studies ( Lin 1991 ) indicates that even just moderate levels of fluoride exposure ( e.g. , 0.9 ppm in the water ) can exacerbate the neurological defects of iodine deficiency .
Other studies have found IQ reductions at 1.9 ppm ( Xiang 2003a , b ) ; 0.3- 3.0 ppm ( Ding 2011 ) ; 1.8-3.9 ppm ( Xu 1994 ) ; 2.0 ppm ( Yao 1996 , 1997 ) ; 2.1-3.2 ppm ( An 1992 ) ; 2.38 ppm ( Poureslami 2011 ) ; 2.45 ppm ( Eswar 2011 ) ; 2.5 ppm ( Seraj 2006 ) ; 2.85 ppm ( Hong 2001 ) ; 2.97 ppm ( Wang 2001 , Yang 1994 ) ; 3.15 ppm ( Lu 2000 ) ; 4.12 ppm ( Zhao 1996 ) .
In the Ding study , each 1 ppm increase of fluoride in urine was associated with a loss of 0.59 IQ points .
None of these studies indicate an adequate margin of safety to protect all children drinking artificially fluoridated water from this affect .
According to the National Research Council ( 2006 ) , “ the consistency of the results [ in fluoride / IQ studies ] appears significant enough to warrant additional research on the effects of fluoride on intelligence . ”
The NRC ’s conclusion has recently been amplified by a team of Harvard scientists whose fluoride / IQ meta - review concludes that fluoride ’s impact on the developing brain should be a “ high research priority . ” ( Choi et al. , 2012 ) .
Except for one small IQ study from New Zealand ( Spittle 1998 ) no fluoridating country has yet investigated the matter .
24 ) Fluoride may cause non-IQ neurotoxic effects .
Reduced IQ is not the only neurotoxic effect that may result from fluoride exposure .
At least three human studies have reported an association between fluoride exposure and impaired visual - spatial organization ( Calderon 2000 ; Li 2004 ; Rocha - Amador 2009 ) ; while four other studies have found an association between prenatal fluoride exposure and fetal brain damage ( Han 1989 ; Du 1992 ; Dong 1993 ; Yu 1996 ) .
25 ) Fluoride affects the pineal gland .
Studies by Jennifer Luke ( 2001 ) show that fluoride accumulates in the human pineal gland to very high levels .
In her Ph.D. thesis , Luke has also shown in animal studies that fluoride reduces melatonin production and leads to an earlier onset of puberty ( Luke 1997 ) .
Consistent with Luke ’s findings , one of the earliest fluoridation trials in the U.S. ( Schlesinger 1956 ) reported that on average young girls in the fluoridated community reached menstruation 5 months earlier than girls in the non-fluoridated community .
Inexplicably , no fluoridating country has attempted to reproduce either Luke ’s or Schlesinger ’s findings or examine the issue any further .
26 ) Fluoride affects thyroid function .
According to the U.S. National Research Council ( 2006 ) , “ several lines of information indicate an effect of fluoride exposure on thyroid function . ”
In the Ukraine , Bachinskii ( 1985 ) found a lowering of thyroid function , among otherwise healthy people , at 2.3 ppm fluoride in water .
In the middle of the 20th century , fluoride was prescribed by a number of European doctors to reduce the activity of the thyroid gland for those suffering from hyperthyroidism ( overactive thyroid ) ( Stecher 1960 ; Waldbott 1978 ) .
According to a clinical study by Galletti and Joyet ( 1958 ) , the thyroid function of hyperthyroid patients was effectively reduced at just 2.3 to 4.5 mg / day of fluoride ion .
To put this finding in perspective , the Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS , 1991 ) has estimated that total fluoride exposure in fluoridated communities ranges from 1.6 to 6.6 mg / day .
This is a remarkable fact , particularly considering the rampant and increasing problem of hypothyroidism ( underactive thyroid ) in the United States and other fluoridated countries .
Symptoms of hypothyroidism include depression , fatigue , weight gain , muscle and joint pains , increased cholesterol levels , and heart disease .
In 2010 , the second most prescribed drug of the year was Synthroid ( sodium levothyroxine ) which is a hormone replacement drug used to treat an underactive thyroid .
27 ) Fluoride causes arthritic symptoms .
Some of the early symptoms of skeletal fluorosis ( a fluoride - induced bone and joint disease that impacts millions of people in India , China , and Africa ) , mimic the symptoms of arthritis ( Singh 1963 ; Franke 1975 ; Teotia 1976 ; Carnow 1981 ; Czerwinski 1988 ; DHHS 1991 ) .
According to a review on fluoridation published in Chemical & Engineering News , “ Because some of the clinical symptoms mimic arthritis , the first two clinical phases of skeletal fluorosis could be easily misdiagnosed ” ( Hileman 1988 ) .
Few , if any , studies have been done to determine the extent of this misdiagnosis , and whether the high prevalence of arthritis in America ( 1 in 3 Americans have some form of arthritis – CDC , 2002 ) and other fluoridated countries is related to growing fluoride exposure , which is highly plausible .
Even when individuals in the U.S. suffer advanced forms of skeletal fluorosis ( from drinking large amounts of tea ) , it has taken years of misdiagnoses before doctors finally correctly diagnosed the condition as fluorosis .
28 ) Fluoride damages bone .
An early fluoridation trial ( Newburgh - Kingston 1945 - 55 ) found a significant two - fold increase in cortical bone defects among children in the fluoridated community ( Schlesinger 1956 ) .
The cortical bone is the outside layer of the bone and is important to protect against fracture .
While this result was not considered important at the time with respect to bone fractures , it did prompt questions about a possible link to osteosarcoma ( Caffey , 1955 ; NAS , 1977 ) .
In 2001 , Alarcon - Herrera and co-workers reported a linear correlation between the severity of dental fluorosis and the frequency of bone fractures in both children and adults in a high fluoride area in Mexico .
29 ) Fluoride may increase hip fractures in the elderly .
When high doses of fluoride ( average 26 mg per day ) were used in trials to treat patients with osteoporosis in an effort to harden their bones and reduce fracture rates , it actually led to a higher number of fractures , particularly hip fractures ( Inkovaara 1975 ; Gerster 1983 ; Dambacher 1986 ; O’Duffy 1986 ; Hedlund 1989 ; Bayley 1990 ; Gutteridge 1990 .
2002 ; Orcel 1990 ; Riggs 1990 and Schnitzler 1990 ) .
Hip fracture is a very serious issue for the elderly , often leading to a loss of independence or a shortened life .
There have been over a dozen studies published since 1990 that have investigated a possible relationship between hip fractures and long term consumption of artificially fluoridated water or water with high natural levels .
The results have been mixed – some have found an association and others have not .
Some have even claimed a protective effect .
One very important study in China , which examined hip fractures in six Chinese villages , found what appears to be a dose - related increase in hip fracture as the concentration of fluoride rose from 1 ppm to 8 ppm ( Li 2001 ) offering little comfort to those who drink a lot of fluoridated water .
Moreover , in the only human epidemiological study to assess bone strength as a function of bone fluoride concentration , researchers from the University of Toronto found that ( as with animal studies ) the strength of bone declined with increasing fluoride content ( Chachra 2010 ) .
Finally , a recent study from Iowa ( Levy 2009 ) , published data suggesting that low - level fluoride exposure may have a detrimental effect on cortical bone density in girls ( an effect that has been repeatedly documented in clinical trials and which has been posited as an important mechanism by which fluoride may increase bone fracture rates ) .
30 ) People with impaired kidney function are particularly vulnerable to bone damage .
Because of their inability to effectively excrete fluoride , people with kidney disease are prone to accumulating high levels of fluoride in their bone and blood .
As a result of this high fluoride body burden , kidney patients have an elevated risk for developing skeletal fluorosis .
In one of the few U.S. studies investigating the matter , crippling skeletal fluorosis was documented among patients with severe kidney disease drinking water with just 1.7 ppm fluoride ( Johnson 1979 ) .
Since severe skeletal fluorosis in kidney patients has been detected in small case studies , it is likely that larger , systematic studies would detect skeletal fluorosis at even lower fluoride levels .
31 ) Fluoride may cause bone cancer ( osteosarcoma ) .
A U.S. government - funded animal study found a dose - dependent increase in bone cancer ( osteosarcoma ) in fluoride - treated , male rats ( NTP 1990 ) .
Following the results of this study , the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) reviewed national cancer data in the U.S. and found a significantly higher rate of osteosarcoma ( a bone cancer ) in young men in fluoridated versus unfluoridated areas ( Hoover et al 1991a ) .
While the NCI concluded ( based on an analysis lacking statistical power ) that fluoridation was not the cause ( Hoover et al 1991 b ) , no explanation was provided to explain the higher rates in the fluoridated areas .
A smaller study from New Jersey ( Cohn 1992 ) found osteosarcoma rates to be up to 6 times higher in young men living in fluoridated versus unfluoridated areas .
Other epidemiological studies of varying size and quality have failed to find this relationship ( a summary of these can be found in Bassin , 2001 and Connett & Neurath , 2005 ) .
There are three reasons why a fluoride - osteosarcoma connection is plausible :
First , fluoride accumulates to a high level in bone .
Second , fluoride stimulates bone growth .
And , third , fluoride can interfere with the genetic apparatus of bone cells in several ways ; it has been shown to be mutagenic , cause chromosome damage , and interfere with the enzymes involved with DNA repair in both cell and tissue studies ( Tsutsui 1984 ; Caspary 1987 ; Kishi 1993 ; Mihashi 1996 ; Zhang 2009 ) .
In addition to cell and tissue studies , a correlation between fluoride exposure and chromosome damage in humans has also been reported ( Sheth 1994 ; Wu 1995 ; Meng 1997 ; Joseph 2000 ) .
32 ) Proponents have failed to refute the Bassin - Osteosarcoma study .
In 2001 , Elise Bassin , a dentist , successfully defended her doctoral thesis at Harvard in which she found that young boys had a five - to - seven fold increased risk of getting osteosarcoma by the age of 20 if they drank fluoridated water during their mid-childhood growth spurt ( age 6 to 8 ) .
The study was published in 2006 ( Bassin 2006 ) but has been largely discounted by fluoridating countries because her thesis adviser Professor Chester Douglass ( a promoter of fluoridation and a consultant for Colgate ) promised a larger study that he claimed would discount her thesis ( Douglass and Joshipura , 2006 ) .
Now , after 5 years of waiting the Douglass study has finally been published ( Kim 2011 ) but in no way does this study discount Bassin ’s findings .
The study , which used far fewer controls than Bassin ’s analysis , did not even attempt to assess the age - specific window of risk that Bassin identified .
Indeed , by the authors ’ own admission , the study had no capacity to assess the risk of osteosarcoma among children and adolescents ( the precise population of concern ) .
For a critique of the Douglass study , click here .
33 ) Fluoride may cause reproductive problems .
Fluoride administered to animals at high doses wreaks havoc on the male reproductive system – it damages sperm and increases the rate of infertility in a number of different species ( Kour 1980 ; Chinoy 1989 ; Chinoy 1991 ; Susheela 1991 ; Chinoy 1994 ; Kumar 1994 ; Narayana 1994a , b ; Zhao 1995 ; Elbetieha 2000 ; Ghosh 2002 ; Zakrzewska 2002 ) .
In addition , an epidemiological study from the US found increased rates of infertility among couples living in areas with 3 ppm or more fluoride in the water ( Freni 1994 ) , two studies have found increased fertility among men living in high - fluoride areas of China and India ( Liu 1988 ; Neelam 1987 ) ; four studies have found reduced level of circulating testosterone in males living in high fluoride areas ( Hao 2010 ; Chen P 1997 ; Susheela 1996 ; Barot 1998 ) , and a study of fluoride - exposed workers reported a “ subclinical reproductive effect ” ( Ortiz - Perez 2003 ) .
While animal studies by FDA researchers have failed to find evidence of reproductive toxicity in fluoride - exposed rats ( Sprando 1996 , 1997 , 1998 ) , the National Research Council ( 2006 ) has recommended that , “ the relationship between fluoride and fertility requires additional study . ”
34 ) Some individuals are highly sensitive to low levels of fluoride as shown by case studies and double blind studies .
In one study , which lasted 13 years , Feltman and Kosel ( 1961 ) showed that about 1 % of patients given 1 mg of fluoride each day developed negative reactions .
Many individuals have reported suffering from symptoms such as fatigue , headaches , rashes and stomach and gastro intestinal tract problems , which disappear when they avoid fluoride in their water and diet .
( Shea 1967 ; Waldbott 1978 ; Moolenburgh 1987 ) Frequently the symptoms reappear when they are unwittingly exposed to fluoride again ( Spittle , 2008 ) .
No fluoridating government has conducted scientific studies to take this issue beyond these anecdotal reports .
Without the willingness of governments to investigate these reports scientifically , should we as a society be forcing these people to ingest fluoride ?
35 ) Other subsets of population are more vulnerable to fluoride ’s toxicity .
In addition to people suffering from impaired kidney function discussed in reason # 30 other subsets of the population are more vulnerable to fluoride ’s toxic effects .
According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ( ATSDR 1993 ) these include : infants , the elderly , and those with diabetes mellitus .
Also vulnerable are those who suffer from malnutrition ( e.g. , calcium , magnesium , vitamin C , vitamin D and iodine deficiencies and protein - poor diets ) and those who have diabetes insipidus .
See : Greenberg 1974 ; Klein 1975 ; Massler & Schour 1952 ; Marier & Rose 1977 ; Lin 1991 ; Chen 1997 ; Seow 1994 ; Teotia 1998 .
No Margin of Safety
36 ) There is no margin of safety for several health effects .
No one can deny that high natural levels of fluoride damage health .
Millions of people in India and China have had their health compromised by fluoride .
The real question is whether there is an adequate margin of safety between the doses shown to cause harm in published studies and the total dose people receive consuming uncontrolled amounts of fluoridated water and non-water sources of fluoride .
This margin of safety has to take into account the wide range of individual sensitivity expected in a large population ( a safety factor of 10 is usually applied to the lowest level causing harm ) .
Another safety factor is also needed to take into account the wide range of doses to which people are exposed .
There is clearly no margin of safety for dental fluorosis ( CDC , 2010 ) and based on the following studies nowhere near an adequate margin of safety for lowered IQ ( Xiang 2003a , b ; Ding 2011 ; Choi 2012 ) ; lowered thyroid function ( Galletti & Joyet 1958 ; Bachinskii 1985 ; Lin 1991 ) ; bone fractures in children ( Alarcon - Herrera 2001 ) or hip fractures in the elderly ( Kurttio 1999 ; Li 2001 ) .
All of these harmful effects are discussed in the NRC ( 2006 ) review .
Environmental Justice
37 ) Low - income families penalized by fluoridation .
Those most likely to suffer from poor nutrition , and thus more likely to be more vulnerable to fluoride ’s toxic effects , are the poor , who unfortunately , are the very people being targeted by new fluoridation programs .
While at heightened risk , poor families are least able to afford avoiding fluoride once it is added to the water supply .
No financial support is being offered to these families to help them get alternative water supplies or to help pay the costs of treating unsightly cases of dental fluorosis .
38 ) Black and Hispanic children are more vulnerable to fluoride ’s toxicity .
According to the CDC ’s national survey of dental fluorosis , black and Mexican - American children have significantly higher rates of dental fluorosis than white children ( Beltran - Aguilar 2005 , Table 23 ) .
The recognition that minority children appear to be more vulnerable to toxic effects of fluoride , combined with the fact that low - income families are less able to avoid drinking fluoridated water , has prompted prominent leaders in the environmental - justice movement to oppose mandatory fluoridation in Georgia .
In a statement issued in May 2011 , Andrew Young , a colleague of Martin Luther King , Jr. , and former Mayor of Atlanta and former US Ambassador to the United Nations , stated :
“ I am most deeply concerned for poor families who have babies : if they cannot afford unfluoridated water for their babies ’ milk formula , do their babies not count ?
Of course they do .
This is an issue of fairness , civil rights , and compassion .
We must find better ways to prevent cavities , such as helping those most at risk for cavities obtain access to the services of a dentist …
My father was a dentist .
I formerly was a strong believer in the benefits of water fluoridation for preventing cavities .
But many things that we began to do 50 or more years ago we now no longer do , because we have learned further information that changes our practices and policies .
So it is with fluoridation . ”
39 ) Minorities are not being warned about their vulnerabilities to fluoride .
The CDC is not warning black and Mexican - American children that they have higher rates of dental fluorosis than Caucasian children ( see # 38 ) .
This extra vulnerability may extend to other toxic effects of fluoride .
Black Americans have higher rates of lactose intolerance , kidney problems and diabetes , all of which may exacerbate fluoride ’s toxicity .
40 ) Tooth decay reflects low - income not low - fluoride intake .
Since dental decay is most concentrated in poor communities , we should be spending our efforts trying to increase the access to dental care for low - income families .
The highest rates of tooth decay today can be found in low - income areas that have been fluoridated for many years .
The real “ Oral Health Crisis ” that exists today in the United States , is not a lack of fluoride but poverty and lack of dental insurance .
The Surgeon General has estimated that 80 % of dentists in the US do not treat children on Medicaid .
The largely untested chemicals used in fluoridation programs
41 ) The chemicals used to fluoridate water are not pharmaceutical grade .
Instead , they largely come from the wet scrubbing systems of the phosphate fertilizer industry .
These chemicals ( 90 % of which are sodium fluorosilicate and fluorosilicic acid ) , are classified hazardous wastes contaminated with various impurities .
Recent testing by the National Sanitation Foundation suggest that the levels of arsenic in these silicon fluorides are relatively high ( up to 1.6 ppb after dilution into public water ) and of potential concern ( NSF 2000 and Wang 2000 ) .
Arsenic is a known human carcinogen for which there is no safe level .
This one contaminant alone could be increasing cancer rates – and unnecessarily so .
42 ) The silicon fluorides have not been tested comprehensively .
The chemical usually tested in animal studies is pharmaceutical grade sodium fluoride , not industrial grade fluorosilicic acid .
Proponents claim that once the silicon fluorides have been diluted at the public water works they are completely dissociated to free fluoride ions and hydrated silica and thus there is no need to examine the toxicology of these compounds .
However , while a study from the University of Michigan ( Finney et al. , 2006 ) showed complete dissociation at neutral pH , in acidic conditions ( pH 3 ) there was a stable complex containing five fluoride ions .
Thus the possibility arises that such a complex may be regenerated in the stomach where the pH lies between 1 and 2 .
43 ) The silicon fluorides may increase lead uptake into children ’s blood .
Studies by Masters and Coplan ( 1999 , 2000 , 2007 ) , and to a lesser extent Macek ( 2006 ) , show an association between the use of fluorosilicic acid ( and its sodium salt ) to fluoridate water and an increased uptake of lead into children ’s blood .
Because of lead ’s acknowledged ability to damage the developing brain , this is a very serious finding .
Nevertheless , it is being largely ignored by fluoridating countries .
This association received some strong biochemical support from an animal study by Sawan et al. ( 2010 ) who found that exposure of rats to a combination of fluorosilicic acid and lead in their drinking water increased the uptake of lead into blood some threefold over exposure to lead alone .
44 ) Fluoride may leach lead from pipes , brass fittings and soldered joints .
In tightly controlled laboratory experiments , Maas et al ( 2007 ) have shown that fluoridating agents in combination with chlorinating agents such as chloroamine increase the leaching of lead from brass fittings used in plumbing .
While proponents may argue about the neurotoxic effects of low levels of fluoride there is no argument that lead at very low levels lowers IQ in children .
Continued promotion of fluoridation is unscientific
45 ) Key health studies have not been done .
In the January 2008 issue of Scientific American , Professor John Doull , the chairman of the important 2006 National Research Council review , Fluoride in Drinking Water : A Review of EPA ’s Standards , is quoted as saying :
What the committee found is that we ’ve gone with the status quo regarding fluoride for many years — for too long really — and now we need to take a fresh look . . .
In the scientific community people tend to think this is settled .
I mean , when the U.S. surgeon general comes out and says this is one of the top 10 greatest achievements of the 20th century , that ’s a hard hurdle to get over .
But when we looked at the studies that have been done , we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should , considering how long this [ fluoridation ] has been going on .
The absence of studies is being used by promoters as meaning the absence of harm .
This is an irresponsible position .
46 ) Endorsements do not represent scientific evidence .
Many of those promoting fluoridation rely heavily on a list of endorsements .
However , the U.S. PHS first endorsed fluoridation in 1950 , before one single trial had been completed and before any significant health studies had been published ( see chapters 9 and 10 in The Case Against Fluoride for the significance of this PHS endorsement for the future promotion of fluoridation ) .
Many other endorsements swiftly followed with little evidence of any scientific rational for doing so .
The continued use of these endorsements has more to do with political science than medical science .
47 ) Review panels hand - picked to deliver a pro-fluoridation result .
Every so often , particularly when their fluoridation program is under threat , governments of fluoridating countries hand - pick panels to deliver reports that provide the necessary re-endorsement of the practice .
In their recent book Fluoride Wars ( 2009 ) , which is otherwise slanted toward fluoridation , Alan Freeze and Jay Lehr concede this point when they write :
There is one anti-fluoridationist charge that does have some truth to it .
Anti-fluoride forces have always claimed that the many government - sponsored review panels set up over the years to assess the costs and benefits of fluoridation were stacked in favor of fluoridation .
A review of the membership of the various panels confirms this charge .
The expert committees that put together reports by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1941 , 1944 and 1954 ; the National Academy of Sciences in 1951 , 1971 , 1977 and 1993 ; the World Health Organization in 1958 and 1970 ; and the U.S. Public Health Service in 1991 are rife with the names of well - known medical and dental researchers who actively campaigned on behalf of fluoridation or whose research was held in high regard in the pro-fluoridation movement .
Membership was interlocking and incestuous .
The most recent examples of these self - fulfilling prophecies have come from the Irish Fluoridation Forum ( 2002 ) ; the National Health and Medical Research Council ( NHMRC , 2007 ) and Health Canada ( 2008 , 2010 ) .
The latter used a panel of six experts to review the health literature .
Four of the six were pro-fluoridation dentists and the other two had no demonstrated expertise on fluoride .
A notable exception to this trend was the appointment by the U.S. National Research Council of the first balanced panel of experts ever selected to look at fluoride ’s toxicity in the U.S.
This panel of twelve reviewed the US EPA ’s safe drinking water standards for fluoride .
After three and half years the panel concluded in a 507 - page report that the safe drinking water standard was not protective of health and a new maximum contaminant level goal ( MCLG ) should be determined ( NRC , 2006 ) .
If normal toxicological procedures and appropriate margins of safety were applied to their findings this report should spell an end to water fluoridation .
Unfortunately in January of 2011 the US EPA Office of Water made it clear that they would not determine a value for the MCLG that would jeopardize the water fluoridation program ( EPA press release , Jan 7 , 2011 .
Once again politics was allowed to trump science .
More and more independent scientists oppose fluoridation
48 ) Many scientists oppose fluoridation .
Proponents of fluoridation have maintained for many years — despite the fact that the earliest opponents of fluoridation were biochemists — that the only people opposed to fluoridation are not bona fide scientists .
Today , as more and more scientists , doctors , dentists and other professionals , read the primary literature for themselves , rather than relying on self - serving statements from the ADA and the CDC , they are realizing that they and the general public have not been diligently informed by their professional bodies on this subject .
As of January 2012 , over 4,000 professionals have signed a statement calling for an end to water fluoridation worldwide .
This statement and a list of signatories can be found on the website of the Fluoride Action Network .
A glimpse of the caliber of those opposing fluoridation can be gleaned by watching the 28 - minute video “ Professional Perspectives on Water fluoridation ” which can be viewed online at the same FAN site .
Proponents ’ dubious tactics
49 ) Proponents usually refuse to defend fluoridation in open debate .
While pro-fluoridation officials continue to promote fluoridation with undiminished fervor , they usually refuse to defend the practice in open public debate – even when challenged to do so by organizations such as the Association for Science in the Public Interest , the American College of Toxicology , or the U.S. EPA ( Bryson 2004 ) .
According to Dr. Michael Easley , a prominent lobbyist for fluoridation in the US , “ Debates give the illusion that a scientific controversy exists when no credible people support the fluorophobics ’ view ” ( Easley , 1999 ) .
In light of proponents ’ refusal to debate this issue , Dr. Edward Groth , a Senior Scientist at Consumers Union , observed that , “ the political profluoridation stance has evolved into a dogmatic , authoritarian , essentially antiscientific posture , one that discourages open debate of scientific issues ” ( Martin 1991 ) .
50 ) Proponents use very dubious tactics to promote fluoridation .
Many scientists , doctors and dentists who have spoken out publicly on this issue have been subjected to censorship and intimidation ( Martin 1991 ) .
Dr. Phyllis Mullenix was fired from her position as Chair of Toxicology at Forsythe Dental Center for publishing her findings on fluoride and the brain ( Mullenix 1995 ) ; and Dr. William Marcus was fired from the EPA for questioning the government ’s handling of the NTP ’s fluoride - cancer study ( Bryson 2004 ) .
Many dentists and even doctors tell opponents in private that they are opposed to this practice but dare not speak out in public because of peer pressure and the fear of recriminations .
Tactics like this would not be necessary if those promoting fluoridation were on secure scientific and ethical grounds .
Conclusion
When it comes to controversies surrounding toxic chemicals , vested interests traditionally do their very best to discount animal studies and quibble with epidemiological findings .
In the past , political pressures have led government agencies to drag their feet on regulating asbestos , benzene , DDT , PCBs , tetraethyl lead , tobacco and dioxins .
With fluoridation we have had a sixty - year delay .
Unfortunately , because government officials and dental leaders have put so much of their credibility on the line defending fluoridation , and because of the huge liabilities waiting in the wings if they admit that fluoridation has caused an increase in hip fracture , arthritis , bone cancer , brain disorders or thyroid problems , it will be very difficult for them to speak honestly and openly about the issue .
But they must , not only to protect millions of people from unnecessary harm , but to protect the notion that , at its core , public health policy must be based on sound science , not political expediency .
They have a tool with which to do this : it ’s called the Precautionary Principle .
Simply put , this says : if in doubt leave it out .
This is what most European countries have done and their children ’s teeth have not suffered , while their public ’s trust has been strengthened .
Just how much doubt is needed on just one of the health concerns identified above , to override a benefit , which when quantified in the largest survey ever conducted in the US , amounts to less than one tooth surface ( out of 128 ) in a child ’s mouth ?
While fluoridation may not be the greatest environmental health threat , it is one of the easiest to end .
It is as easy as turning off a spigot in the public water works .
But to turn off that spigot takes political will and to get that we need masses more people informed and organized .
Please get these 50 reasons to all your friends and encourage them to get fluoride out of their community and to help ban this practice worldwide .

Publication history of the 50 Reasons
The 50 Reasons were first compiled by Paul Connett and presented in person to the Irish Fluoridation Forum in October 2000 .
The document was refined in 2004 and published in Medical Veritas .
In the introduction to the 2004 version it was explained that after over four years the Irish authorities had not been able to muster a response to the 50 Reasons , despite agreeing to do so in 2000 .
Eventually , an anonymous , incomplete and superficial response was posted on the Irish Department of Health and Children ’s website ( see this response and addendum at : http://www.dohc.ie/other_health_issues/dental_research/.
Paul Connett ’s comprehensive response to this response can be accessed at http://www.fluoridealert.org/50reasons.ireland.pdf.
We learned on August 7 , 2011 that this governmental response was prepared by an external contractor at a cost to the Irish taxpayers ’ of over 30,000 Euros .
Since 2004 , there have been many major scientific developments including the publication of the U.S. National Research Council report ( NRC , 2006 ) ; the publication of Bassin ’s study on Osteosarcoma ( Bassin 2006 ) , and many more studies of fluoride ’s interaction with the brain , that necessitated a major update of the 50 Reasons in August 2011 .
This update was made with the generous assistance of James Beck , MD , PhD , Michael Connett , JD , Hardy Limeback , DDS , PhD , David McRae and Spedding Micklem , D. Phil .
Additional developments in 2012 , including FAN ’s translation of over 20 Chinese studies on fluoride toxicity and publication of the Harvard team ’s meta - review of fluoride and IQ ( Choi 2012 ) , warranted a further update in August 2012 , with the extremely helpful assistance of my son , Michael Connett .

Thanks , son , now go to your room .
Mommy and daddy are going to wrestle .
Something I read in another blog sent me digging into the statistics on homicide between husbands and wives or other “ intimates . ”
I remembered from my days in the crim biz that the US was unique in that wives here killed their husbands almost as frequently as husbands killed wives .
This statistic , the “ spousal rate of killing ” ( SROK ) , was introduced in a now - classic 1992 article by Margo Wilson and Martin Daly .
In most countries , that rate is 25 - 30 % .
In the US , Wilson and Daly pointed out , it was about 75 % .
But something has happened , over the last thirty years or so ( data here ) .
And as far as I can tell from a quick search on the Internet , nobody seems to have noticed .
( Click on the graph for a larger view . )
Between 1976 and 2005 , the number of women killed by their male partners decreased by about 25 % , less than the decrease in all homicides nationwide .
But the number of men killed by women dropped dramatically , from 1300 to 330 , a 75 % decrease ( since the population increased in those three decades , the change in rates is probably even greater .
The SROK fell from 82 % to 28 % .
My Internet search for explanations was cursory at best , but it turned up nothing .
I have only two ideas :
1. Men Behaving Better .
Men have stopped doing those things that made women want to kill them .
I offered this explanation to two women in the Justice Studies department here .
They rejected it out of hand and without comment .
( Maybe they did n’t like the blaming - the - victim assumption : if women kill men , it ’s because of what men do .
Or maybe they were using a convenience sample of anecdotal data on men ’s behavior . ) .
One of these women , Lisa Anne Zilney , offered a counter - explanation . . .
2. Women Having Options .
Women ’s shelters and other facilities have given women an alternative .
Without these , the only way to escape an intolerable situation at home was to get rid of the cause .
Providing abused and desperate women a safe place to go saves lives – and apparently not just the lives of women .
I ’m not wild about either of these explanations for the steep decline in the SROK ( and as I recall , Wilson and Daly were n’t wild about any of their explanations of why it was so high ) .
Any ideas ?

The long - standing Middle East correspondent for The Independent , Robert Fisk , is defying the government crackdown on foreign media reporting in Iran .
As he explains , he has been travelling around the streets of Tehran all day and most of the night and things are far from quiet :
I 've just been witnessing a confrontation , in dusk and into the night , between about 15,000 supporters of Ahmadinejad - supposedly the president of Iran - who are desperate to down the supporters of Mr Mousavi , who thinks he should be the president of Iran .
There were about 10,000 Mousavi men and women on the streets , with approximately 500 Iranian special forces , trying to keep them apart .
It was interesting that the special forces - who normally take the side of Ahmadinejad 's Basij militia - were there with clubs and sticks in their camouflage trousers and their purity white shirts and on this occasion the Iranian military kept them away from Mousavi 's men and women .
In fact at one point , Mousavi 's supporters were shouting ' thank you , thank you ' to the soldiers .
One woman went up to the special forces men , who normally are very brutal with Mr Mousavi 's supporters , and said ' can you protect us from the Basij ? '
He said ' with God 's help ' .
It was quite extraordinary because it looked as if the military authorities in Tehran have either taken a decision not to go on supporting the very brutal militia - which is always associated with the presidency here - or individual soldiers have made up their own mind that they 're tired of being associated with the kind of brutality that left seven dead yesterday - buried , by the way secretly by the police - and indeed the seven or eight students who were killed on the university campus 24 hours earlier .
Quite a lot of policeman are beginning to smile towards the demonstrators of Mr Mousavi , who are insisting there must be a new election because Mr Ahmadinejad was n't really elected .
Quite an extraordinary scene .
There were a lot of stones thrown and quite a lot of bitter fighting , hand - to - hand but at the end of the day the special forces did keep them apart .
I have n't ever seen the Iranian security authorities behaving fairly before and it's quite impressive .
Protests
Certainly the authorities were very struck by the enormous number of people who turned out for Sunday 's march ... from the Square of Revolution to the Square of Freedom .
I walked alongside that march the whole way and was stunned to find one million people at the end , it must have been one million at least .
There were seven killed after that instant alone so we 're having a lot of deaths , much more than we realise , in fact some people say there are more deaths than have been recorded .
There was 100 metres of no man 's land between these thousands of people and I actually walked up and listened to a Basij guy urging his people on to attack the forces of the opposition , saying 'we fought and defended our country in the Iran - Iraq war and now we have to defend it again and we have to move forward ' .
You could actually just walk a few metres and talk to Mousavi 's people .
Some of them came down and tried to embrace the Basij and indeed the leaders who support the man who indeed thinks he is the president .
One man , in the Muslim tradition , tried to kiss him on both cheeks and the Basij man moved back irritably and angry , he did n't want to be touched by this man .
There was a great deal of anger on the part of Ahmadinejad 's supporters .
Safe to report
No - one 's told me not to drive around so I go and see wounded people and go and watch these confrontations and no - one seems to bother me .
I rather think an awful lot of journalists take it too seriously .
If you get in a car and go out and see things , no - one 's going to stop you , frankly .
I went to the earlier demonstration in the centre of the city , which was solely by Ahmadinejad 's people , immensely boring , although I did notice one or two points where they were shouting ' death to the traitor ' .
They meant Mousavi .
You 've got to realise that what 's happening at the moment is that the actual authorities are losing control of what 's happening on the streets and that 's very dangerous and damaging to them .
It 's interesting that the actual government newspapers reported at one point that Sunday 's march was not provocative by the marchers .
They carried a very powerful statement by the Chancellor of the Tehran University , condemning the police and Basij , who broke into university dormitories on Sunday night and killed seven students .
They 've even carried reports of the seven dead after the march on Sunday ... almost as if , not to compromise but they 're trying to get a little bit closer to the other side .
Election result
My suspicion is that [ Ahmadinejad ] might have actually won the election but more like 52 or 53 per cent .
It 's possible that Mousavi got closer to 38 per cent .
But I think the Islamic republic 's regime here wanted to humiliate the opponent and so fiddle the figures , even if Ahmadinejad had won .
The problem with that is they 're now going to claim they 're going to need a recount .
If the recount is to actually give Mousavi the presidency , someone is going to have to pay the price for such an extraordinary fraud of claiming Ahmadinejad won 30 , 40 , 50 per cent more than he should have done .
You 've got to remember as well , on the election night , if the count was correct it meant that they would have had to have counted five million votes in two hours .
Next few days
Someone , presumably the supreme leader , who is constitutionally the leader of all Iran and the clerical leader , Ayatollah Khamanei , he 's going to have to work out a way of stopping these constant street confrontations .
We 've got another great demonstration by the opposition tomorrow evening in the centre of the city .
I suspect what they 're going to have to do is think whether they can have a system where they reintroduce a prime ministership , so the president has someone underneath him .
Maybe we'd have President Ahmadinejad and a Prime Minister Mousavi or maybe a joint presidency .
All this is what people talk about but it means changing the constitution , it means having a referendum .
They did n't believe that the opposition could be so strong and would keep on going .
[ The protest ] is absolutely not against the Islamic republic or the Islamic revolution .
It 's clearly an Islamic protest against specifically the personality , the manner , the language of Ahmadinejad .
They absolutely despise him but they do not hate or dislike the Islamic republic that they live in .
Based on an interview with Radio National 's Fran Kelly
A Greenpoint woman 's altercation with a police officer over carrying her sick dog through the subway has put her out of a job .
To recap : Chrissie Brodigan , a VP for Online Media at Plum TV , says that after she argued with Officer Joel Witriol while trying to carry her pug out of the subway , he arrested her , grabbed her breasts , and punched her in the back while saying , " If you 're going to act like a woman I 'm going to treat you like a woman . "
Other witnesses corroborated Brodigan 's account , but one witness and an unidentified source told the Post that Brodigan yelled at Witriol , the city 's first Hasidic officer , " You f---ing Jew , you 're not even human .
Jewish people think they own everything . "
Brodigan initially said that although she yelled at Witriol , she " did not recall " saying anything anti-Semitic .
( The following day she e-mailed us to firmly deny saying anything anti-Semitic or about Witriol 's Jewish identity .
Other witnesses backed her up . )
But it seems that her initial Reaganesque denial is what cost her her job ; she tells us today :
I was terminated for " equivocating " in the press .
My boss [ Chris Glowacki ] is threatening to not offer an agreeable severance package , including health insurance , which is crucial because i have cystic fibrosis and he is aware .
He 's angry that this is out in the press .
I think he made a judgment based on perceived bigotry .
UPDATE : A publicist for Plum TV writes : " Chrissie Brodigan is no longer employed by Plum .
Her employment was terminated for valid reasons , unrelated to the determination of whether or not she made the objectionable statements as alleged in the press .
We will have no further comment . "
Post reporter Reuven Blau has not responded to our inquires about the article ; according to his Post colleague Reuven Fenton , Blau is the one who " found " the mysterious witness Viane Delgado in the narrow window of time between when we broke the full story and when the Post print edition went to bed .
No other media outlet has quoted Viane Delgado , and we 're still trying to obtain a copy of the police report to see if Delgado was quoted there .
( Though an NYPD spokesman 's comment that the anti-Semitic charge " sounds like something you 're reading in other papers " leads us to suspect there is nothing about that in the police report . )
Of course , Blau is under no obligation to elaborate on his witness or " source " or even return our phone calls , but a source tells us the Post is full of shit .
( Our source also tells us that dogs bite men . )
Below , Chrissie 's long open letter to the media about her termination .
An Open Letter : How I Got Slandered By the New York Post & NYPD
" On Monday , June 30 , I was wrongfully arrested and physically abused by the NYPD .
The arresting officer who manhandled happens to have been the first Hasidic cop on a force of more than 30,000 .
In the days that followed the incident , which became well - publicized , because bystanders photographed the arrest and called the " police " on account of the improper behavior of the arresting officer , and because I had the courage to defend my rights and resisted abuse with the support of these witnesses , the situation has become an unimaginable nightmare for me .
I have been falsely accused of being a bigot by the New York Post in an act of the most irresponsible journalism I have ever experienced , and now I have been fired from a job I loved and was great at on account of these vicious accusations and my alleged failure to respond " vigorously enough " to them .
Here is what happened :
Two days after my arrest the New York Post came out with a vicious article in which anti-Semitic remarks were attributed to me by an alleged witness .
Either the Post fabricated the existence of this witness , who despite an exerted effort by both journalists at Gothamist and myself has never been located , or they fabricated her remarks .
There were witnesses at the scene and these witnesses did not hear me make any anti-Semitic remarks and specifically did not recall the existence of the Post 's alleged witness .
I do not believe that this witness was at the scene nor did any witness hear me make antisemitic remarks .
The truth is that smearing the victim is a classic police technique to cover up abuse and protect the arresting officer .
I am not a bigot , and accusations of bigotry are so absurd that I did not think it even necessary to respond to them .
My " suspension " and now my firing requires that I make things clear to the public .
During the course of my arrest , I did not :
Utter the words " Jewish " or " Jew . "
I did not say , " You Jews think you own the world . "
I did not use the phrase " You fucking Jews . . . "
I did not say anything that any person , reasonable or not , could have interpreted to mean any reference whatsoever to the obvious religion of the cop who was manhandling me .
These anti-Semitic comments printed by the New York Post never crossed my lips on the day I was wrongfully arrested and physically abused .
And , to be even more succinct , those words and statements have NEVER crossed my lips on any other day in my life .
EVER .
I believe that ultimately the evidence will come out that the police were involved in the Post 's smear job of me , which was an effort to cover up police misconduct .
Under these circumstances it is important that you know who I am :
My academic background at George Mason University involved an undergraduate degree in English with a minor in African American studies that culminated in an honors thesis about the civil rights movement .
My graduate studies and masters degrees , I focused my coursework on the history of immigrants , gay , lesbian , black , hispanic , disabled and other oppressed people .
My masters thesis and subsequent doctoral dissertation focused on gender discrimination and women 's rights in the workplace .
Indeed , I note that my principal doctoral advisors were all Jewish .
I have devoted my adult life to studying and supporting the civil rights of minorities .
To smear me as an anti-Semite is both cowardly and a disgrace and victimizes me once again .
I expected more from a community to whom I have devoted my best efforts . "
A common complaint about GNOME is that it has a certain fetish for icons .
Menu entries , buttons – everything has an icon attached to it which often wastes space needlessly by making buttons larger than they need to be , as well as menus wider than they need to be .
The good news ( for me , at least ) is that the next GNOME release will have all these icons removed .
The way Gtk+ and GNOME put icons everywhere has always bothered me .
In menus , such tiny icons are only clutter , and do n’t appear to giveany useful information .
When it comes to buttons , they have the nasty tendency to completely mess up things like button size , button text alignment , and they make buttons “ unstable ” ; icons carry more visual weight than the text , mentally toppling buttons over .
The new GNOME release will do away with icons on menu items and on dialog buttons .
The exceptions are menu items which represent a dynamic object such as applications , files or bookmarks , and devices .
This obviously means that the GNOME panel , as well as the panel menus , will still show icons for their items .
The end result ?
These few shots clearly show the benefits :
What is as of yet unknown , however , is whether or not this will get a GUI checkbox so you can switch back to the old behaviour .
Since there are talks of removing the “ Interface ” tab from the Appearance tab altogether , it ’s unclear where such an option would go even if they wanted it in .
Else , it will be a trip to gconf - editor .
I personally welcome this move , but I ’m sure many of you will disagree .
What do you think ?
Is it a good idea to remove these icons ?
Should there be a GUI option ?
A lot of discussion can be found in the related entries in the bugzilla .
Linux Common Lisp Quickstart HOWTO
Due to some questions on #lisp , I decided to throw together a quick , step - by - step solution to setting up a basic , but working , Common Lisp installation on Linux .
The implementation used will be SBCL
This HOWTO assumes basic linux knowledge as well as knowledge of your distro ’s package management system .
Install SBCL from your distro ’s repo or download binary build from SBCL website Install Emacs – I recommend Emacs - 22 or 23 .
Again , for fast install , I recommend going with your distro packages – if you need / want specially patched version , you probably do n’t need my hand - holding Install clbuild run cd clbuild ; ./ clbuild check and install any remaining dependencies .
Depending on your distro SBCL packages , install local build of SBCL through ./ clbuild compile - implementation sbcl .
It will be used by clbuild after that and saved in ./clbuild / target Install SLIME : ./ clbuild install slime
and configure it by adding result of ./ clbuild slime - configuration to your emacs config .
I recommend switching slime - autodoc to t Test it by running emacs and invoking M-x slime Now go over to Cliki and maybe entertain yourself to Practical Common Lisp
Update : 2010 - 04 - 10 : Fixed links broken by lack of wildcard entry on sbcl.org
The European Commission wants the US to dissolve all government links with the body that ' governs ' the internet , replacing it with an international forum for discussing internet governance and online security .
The rules and decisions on key internet governance issues , such as the creation of top level domains ( such as .com and .eu ) and managing the internet address system that ensures computers can connect to each other , are currently made by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) , a private , not - for profit corporation based in California which operates under an agreement with the US Department of Commerce .
The decisions made by ICANN affect the way the internet works all around the world .
EU information society commissioner Viviane Reding on Monday ( 4 May ) suggested a new model for overseeing the internet from October this year , when the Commerce Department agreement runs out .
She called on US President Barack Obama to fully privatise ICANN and set up an independent judicial body , described as a " G12 for internet governance , " which she described as a " multilateral forum for governments to discuss general internet governance policy and security issues . "
" I trust that President Obama will have the courage , the wisdom and the respect for the global nature of the internet to pave the way in September for a new , more accountable , more transparent , more democratic and more multilateral form of Internet Governance , " she said via a video message posted on her commission website .
The expiry of the agreement between ICANN and the US government " opens the door for the full privatisation of ICANN , and it also raises the question of to whom ICANN should be accountable , " she said .
" In the long run , it is not defendable that the government department of only one country has oversight of an internet function which is used by hundreds of millions of people in countries all over the world . "
Instead , Brussels would prefer that an international government forum that to meet twice a year makes recommendations by majority vote to the newly privatised ICANN .
The forum would be restricted to representatives from 12 countries , with a regional balance taken into consideration .
Her " Internet G12 " would include two representatives each from North America , South America , Europe and Africa , three representatives from Asia and Australia , as well as the Chairman of ICANN as a non-voting member .
International organisations with competences in this field meanwhile could be given observer status .
The new US administration 's position on global internet governance is not yet clear .
However , during the Bush administration , Washington was steadfastly opposed to handing ICANN over to the United Nations .
The commission will hold a conference on Wednesday ( 6 May ) in Brussels to discuss the issue with Europe 's internet community .
As if we ’re not being squeezed enough , Florida Power and Light wants to increase its base power rate by $ 1 billion next year and an additional billion dollars the following year .
And they want to do so without having to reveal how much money its top executives are raking in .
And this is a violation of state law , according to Nancy Argenziano , who sits on the Public Service Commission , the regulatory agency that needs to approve the rate hike .
But she is the lone voice of reason on the commission .
" The statute says compensation shall not be exempt from public record , " she told the South Florida Sun Sentinel .
" To me , it 's cut and dry .
I know how to read statutes ; I used to write them ... This is something that should take 10 minutes to figure out . "
The statute allows FPL to keep certain information private but not salaries , Argenziano said .
First Amendment Foundation President Barbara Petersen also has written a letter to the commission asking them to abide by state law .
Argenziano wants to disclose the salaries of any executive who makes more than $ 165,000 a year .
Some FPL salaries have been publicly disclosed through the Securities and Exchange Commission , including the $ 11.5 million FPL Group Chairman Lew Hay makes and the $ 3.6 million FPL President Armando Olivera makes in a year .
Last month , FPL reported that its net profit shot up 77 percent in the second quarter to $ 370 million from $ 209 million the year before .
But it insists that it still needs to increase rates by 30 percent to every household in order to make a “ fair profit . ”
FPL refuses to reveal the salaries because it believes that would drive up compensation costs and , in turn , drive up consumer rates .
But that is exactly why we want them to release these figures .
Writes Jonah Goldberg :
[ L ]et us consider how President Obama ’s health - care bill would work .
An official body — staffed with government doctors , actuaries , economists and other experts — will determine which treatments , procedures and remedies are cost - effective and which are not .
Then it will decide which ones will get paid for , and which wo n’t .
Democrats call this “ cost- controls . ”
But for the patient and the doctor , it ’s plain old rationing .
Now , imagine if the government had a body of experts charged with figuring out what your free - speech rights are , or right to assemble , or worship .
Mr. Jones , you can say X and Y but not Z. Ms. Smith , you can freely assemble with Aleutians , Freemasons and carpenters , but you may not meet in public with anyone from Cleveland or of Albanian descent .
Mrs. Wilson , you may pray to Vishnu and Crom , but never to Allah or Buddha , and when you do pray , you cannot do so for longer than 20 minutes , unless it is one of several designated holidays .
See Extended Prayer Form 10 - 22B .
Of course , all of this would be ludicrous .
Which is the whole point .
Health care cannot be a right , because rights cannot come from government .
Indeed , this is true .
Rights do not come from the government .
People do not have a natural right to have the government do anything on their behalf , even protect their rights , for that too would involve rationing .
This entire line of reasoning can and should be applied to the whole state apparatus , and certainly to the welfare state .
People can have a right to free speech , because in theory , they can say whatever they want so long as they do n’t trespass against the property rights of others .
This is true in any time and place .
The notion of health care being a right is incoherent .
For if you have a right to a check up , does that mean a doctor somewhere has the enforceable duty to perform it ?
Does a right to surgery imply a right to force surgeons to work ?
As Herbert Spencer said , all socialism involves slavery .
Indeed , taken to its logical conclusion , a positive right to health care is not just a right to compel others to finance it , but to compel others to provide it .
Under natural law , true rights , natural rights , do not conflict with one another .
But positive rights must be rationed .
I wrote about this back in 2006 , in a piece reprinted below .
Earlier today , Canonical has announced the availability of a major security update for the following Ubuntu distributions : 6.06 LTS , 8.04 LTS , 8.10 and 9.04 ( also applies to Kubuntu , Edubuntu and Xubuntu ) .
The update patches no more than 15 security issues ( see below for details ) discovered in the Linux kernel packages by various hackers .
Therefore , it is strongly recommended to update your system as soon as possible !
The following Linux kernel vulnerabilities were discovered :
1 . When root_squash was active , NFS clients could create device nodes .
This could lead to loss of privacy .
The issue was discovered by Igor Zhbanov , and affects only Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 users .
2. SELinux failed to handle various network checks if compat_net=1 was enabled .
Because of this , network checks could be bypassed by a local attacker .
The issue was discovered by Dan Carpenter , and affects only Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 users .
3 . Memory was incorrectly initialized in AGP subsystem , which could lead to loss of privacy .
The issue was discovered by Shaohua Li .
4 . The VMX implementation of KVM failed to handle various registers .
This could lead to a DoS attack and crash the affected system .
The issue was discovered by Benjamin Gilbert , and affects only Ubuntu 8.04 LTS , 8.10 and 9.04 users ( 32 - bit versions ) .
5 . The Amateur Radio X.25 Packet Layer Protocol failed to validate various fields , which could lead to loss of privacy .
The issue was discovered by Thomas Pollet .
6. NFS failed to handle long filenames .
This could lead to a DoS attack and crash the affected system .
The issue was discovered by Trond Myklebust , and affects only Ubuntu 6.06 LTS users .
7 . The Linux kernel failed to handle CAP_KILL and it could lead to a DoS attack .
The issue was discovered by Oleg Nesterov .
8. Signal handling was incorrectly limited to process namespaces , which could lead to a DoS attack .
The issue was discovered by Daniel Hokka Zakrisson , and affects only Ubuntu 8.04 LTS users .
9 . Support for network namespace in IP v6 was incorrectly handled .
This could lead to a DoS attack and crash the affected system .
The issue was discovered by Pavel Emelyanov , and affects only Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 users .
10 .
The e1000 network driver failed to validate various fields .
This could lead to a DoS attack and crash the affected system .
The issue was discovered by Neil Horman .
11 . CIFS failed to check the lengths when various mount requests were handled .
Because of this , restricted applications could be executed .
This could lead to a DoS attack and crash the affected system .
The issue was discovered by Pavan Naregundi .
12 . NFSv4 failed to handle execute permissions .
The issue was discovered by Simon Vallet and Frank Filz .
13 . Buffer overflows were discovered in the code of the CIFS client .
This could lead to a system crash .
The issue was discovered by Jeff Layton and Suresh Jayaraman .
14 . On Sparc architecture , the / proc / iomem was incorrectly initialized .
This could lead to a DoS attack and crash the affected system .
The issue was discovered by Mikulas Patocka , and affects only Ubuntu 8.04 LTS , 8.10 and 9.04 users .
15 . OCFS2 failed to handle various splice operations .
This could lead to a DoS attack and hang the affected system .
The issue was discovered by Miklos Szeredi , and affects only Ubuntu 8.04 LTS , 8.10 and 9.04 users .
The above Linux kernel vulnerabilities can be fixed if you update your system today to the following specific packages :
• For Ubuntu 6.06 LTS , users should update their kernel packages to linux - image - 2.6.15-54.77
• For Ubuntu 8.04 LTS , users should update their kernel packages to linux - image - 2.6.24-24.55
• For Ubuntu 8.10 , users should update their kernel packages to linux - image - 2.6.27-14.35
• For Ubuntu 9.04 , users should update their kernel packages to linux - image - 2.6.28-13.45
Do n't forget to reboot your computer after this update !
You can verify the kernel version by typing the sudo dpkg -l linux - image - 2.6.28 -13 - generic command in a terminal ( the example is for Ubuntu 9.04 users ONLY ) .
ATTENTION : Due to an unavoidable ABI change , the kernel packages have a new version number , which will force you to reinstall or recompile all third - party kernel modules you might have installed .
For example , after the upgrade to the above version of your kernel package , a piece of software such as VirtualBox will NOT work anymore , therefore you must recompile its kernel module by issuing a specific command in the terminal .
Moreover , if you use the linux - restricted - modules package , you have to update it as well to get modules that work with the new Linux kernel version .
Get the latest version of Ubuntu right now from Softpedia .
Do n't forget to share it with your friends and family !
Reconoce que no son los campesinos quienes reciben la ayuda de programas
[ email protected ]
El presidente Felipe Calderón aseguró que en México algunos políticos se han enriquecido a costa de la pobreza de todos y han acumulado “ verdaderas fortunas ” .
Advirtió que por ese motivo es el momento de que se depuren los programas públicos y el país le diga un “ ya basta ” a la corrupción y a la opacidad que prevalece en las finanzas públicas .
Durante la ceremonia de premiación del concurso de dibujo “ Adiós a las trampas ” , Calderón señaló que la depuración de la policía se realiza debido a que lo que más ofende a los mexicanos es que “ la transa venga del mismo gobernante , que la transa venga del mismo policía ” .
“ ¿ Quién podrá defendernos ? ” Y , sin mencionarlo , el Presidente recordó la frase del personaje de la televisión el Chapulín Colorado : “ Si la policía está corrupta , si la policía hace transa , ahora sí que , ¿ quién podrá defendernos ? ” .
Enumeró cuatro acciones de su gobierno que se han establecido para enfrentar la corrupción de grupos delictivos que “ extorsionan , roban y cobran derecho de piso ” a la población en México .
De igual manera , indicó , se realiza una depuración de los cuerpos policiacos y se han establecido acciones de gobierno para transparentar el uso de los recursos públicos y los programas de gobierno en el campo , y de atención a la pobreza , para identificar aquellos que reciben presupuestos importantes y que no sirven .
Calderón explicó a más de 50 niños de primaria y secundaria , así como a directivos de la educación pública , que México libra una lucha para evitar el mal .
“ Ahora que uno se asoma a ver quién se queda con el dinero de ese programa , no es ningún campesino , ni pobre , ni descalzo , ni mucho menos , sino es alguien que tiene un rancho muy , muy grande , de cientos de hectáreas , y compra camioneta nueva cada año y todavía pide más dinero ” , reconoció el Presidente .
“ La transa nos hunde en el fango ” Indicó que la prevalencia de la corrupción y la transa en nuestro país “ empobrecen la calidad educativa ” , que desalienta la inversión para la generación de empleos , pero también que no se vea nada “ dentro de las cajas públicas ” de muchos lugares de los gobiernos estatales o municipales en donde , acusó el mandatario , “ hay una gran opacidad ” .
Eximió de esas acusaciones de corrupción al gobierno federal , en el que , aseguró el titular del Ejecutivo , existen mecanismos de transparencia para saber en qué se gasta cada peso que se recibe , además de que desde el año pasado se realiza una evaluación para saber qué programas sirven y cuáles no .
“ La transa , la corrupción , nos jalan a lo más oscuro , acaban hundiendo a las personas y a las sociedades en el fango , ya no digamos el mar , el lodo de la corrupción ” , expuso el jefe del Ejecutivo .
Previo al inicio de que iniciara una gira por Colombia y a que se realizara el partido de futbol entre las selecciones de México y Estados Unidos — vaticinó el triunfo del equipo mexicano — , el primer mandatario aseguró que la tarea para acabar con la corrupción en el país es de todos , al denunciar y alzar la voz en contra de las prácticas deshonestas .
Last month , the swindling of more than 200 billion ISK resulted in an actual run on a virtual bank in EVE Online .
The best part ?
The loot was sold IRL - just $ 5,000 .

No , griefers from Something Awful are not claiming responsibility .
Not that any of them would have the patience to play nice long enough to become a controller for EBank .
User Ricdic was , and then he took the dough and sold it off , he says in order to place a down payment on a house and pay medical bills .
The heist dwarfs the earlier 100 billion ISK embezzled by an in - game investments manager .
But 250 billion ISK was just 8 percent of the bank 's 2.8 trillion held in deposits .
Still a tidy sum , but hardly the whole kitty .
That did n't stop EVE Ebankers from rushing the teller windows once word passed of Ricdic 's dirty deeds .

He has since been kicked out of EVE , as selling in - game currency for real - world value is a no - no according to the TOS .
Had he kept the ISK in - game , he would not have been sanctioned - by CCP anyway .
In - game depositors may have had something to say and / or do about it .

A bit special : A lone adult male
Fleeting sightings of the world 's rarest antelope , the hirola , in a new safe haven are cases of mistaken identity , a survey has found .
That has dashed hopes that some of the last hirola have managed to colonise a new territory where they would be less vulnerable to flooding and hunting .
Fewer than 600 wild hirola remain , confined to a small area in Kenya .
It is sometimes called a ' living fossil ' , being the sole survivor of a once diverse group of antelope species .
Prior to 1970 , an estimated 14,000 hirola existed in the wild .
But the antelope soon came under a host of pressures which led to a dramatic decline in its population over the next 30 years .
Hunting and predation killed many , while the animals ' range became restricted by habitat loss and an increase in human settlements and farms rearing livestock .
That left few animals surviving in a small area along the border between the River Tana in Kenya and the River Juba in Somalia .
The Somalia population is already thought to be extinct , while in Kenya the antelope survives in pockets within the Ijara , Garissa , Tana River and Lamu districts , while two small groups of animals translocated to the Tsavo East National park and are struggling to establish there .
Under pressure However , in the 1990s two new threats emerged .
The collapse of the Republic of Somalia in 1991 precipitated a massive influx of refugees into Kenya .
" The majority of the Somali refugees were resettled in Garissa district which is part of the hirola 's natural range , " says Yakub Dahiye of the National Museums of Kenya in Nairobi .
" The presence of large numbers of refugees increased poaching activities and general insecurity of the area . "
In 1997 significant flooding caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon covered the region .
In response to both , many large mammals including the hirola migrated either to higher or quieter areas .
An emancipated group of hirola in the Ijara district of Kenya
Then conservationists started receiving exciting reports of hirola in northern Garissa , an area outside of the antelope 's known historical range , suggesting that the antelope was migrating to safer territory .
Previously , the antelope was confined to the southern part of the district .
So to check the authenticity of the reports , Dahiye performed an extensive survey of the region .
For six days , he travelled more than 1100 km criss - crossing the northern Garissa , observing and recording from the top of a moving vehicle the identity and locations of wildlife in the area .
He also showed pictures of hirola to local people , asking if any had seen the elusive antelope in recent years .
None had , and despite spotting giraffe , Grant 's gazelles , gerenuk , lesser kudu and oryx , Dahiye did not see a single hirola , he reports in the African Journal of Ecology .
" That confirms that the species is endemic to a small area between the lower River Tana in Kenya and the lower River Juba in Somalia , " he says .
" If this small natural habitat is destroyed , then we will not have an in situ hirola population . "
Effective management plans for the species are still lacking , says Dahiye .
Back in 1974 , the Arawale National Reserve was set up mainly to conserve the hirola , but the reserve was later abandoned .
Local communities in Ijara district have now responded by establishing a Community Conservation Area to help protect those animals living there , but wider , strategic plans have yet to be put in place to conserve the species , Dahiye says .
Evolutionarily unique
The hirola is special because of both its rarity and evolutionary uniqueness .
Scientifically named ( Beatragus hunteri ) , the hirola belongs to the family Bovidae , the group that includes all antelopes , cattle , bison , buffalo , goats and sheep .
Within that group , it belong to the subfamily Alcelaphinae , meaning it is most closely related to topi , wildebeests and hartbeest antelopes .
But what makes the hirola stand out is that it is the last living representative of the genus Beatragus .
A female hirola killed by a leopard The International Union for the Conservation of Nature considers it to be the most at risk antelope species , listing it as Critically Endangered , while the Zoological Society of London includes the hirola within its EDGE programme , which seeks to conserve the most evolutionary distinct and globally endangered of all animals .
Dahiye thinks that the unconfirmed sightings of the hirola in northern Garrisa , which sparked much excitement among conservationists , were cases of mistaken identity .
Local people call both hirola and impala antelopes by the same name in Somali , while the two species also look similar , he says .

Absolute Zero is Cool T - Shirt - just $ 9.95 over at Neatorama 's Online Store
There 's not many absolutes in science , so absolute zero - the coldest temperature theoretically possible where entropy is reduced to zero - truly stands out .
Indeed , things get really , really weird quantum mechanically as we approach absolute zero .
Let 's take a look at what fun we can have going down the thermometer all the way to 0 Kelvin .
Antarctica
Let 's begin with the coldest place on Earth , Antarctica .
The temperatures there reach a minimum of about - 80 °C ( - 112 °F ) in the winter , with the coldest ever recorded temperature of - 89.2 °C ( - 128.6 °F ) .
[ YouTube Clip ]
In 2006 , Anthony and Christine Powell of Frostbytes blog ( fantastic photos there , by the way ) recorded this video clip of what people in Antarctica consider a terrible weather ( euphemistically called " Condition 1 " ) at the McMurdo Station .
So , next time you 're having some terrible winter weather where ever you are , just remember this video clip .
Liquid Oxygen
Purdue 's Senior System Engineer George Goble hated waiting for his BBQ to light .
So , in 1995 , he decided to find the fastest way to achieve barbecue ignition .
He tried propane , acetylene torches , and even oxygen - fuel gas or racing fuel ( the last one took 30 seconds ) .
But that was n't fast enough - he wanted to set the world record of fastest ignition .
( Source )
[ You Tube clip ]
So Goble decided to get serious and reached for liquid oxygen ( LOX , boiling point : 90.2 K or - 183 °C ) .
He doused 3 gallons of liquid oxygen ( LOX ) onto 60 pounds of charcoal and a smoldering cigarette* .
Within 3 seconds about 40 pounds of the charcoal burned and the grill was vaporized .
For his creativity , George won the 1996 Ig Nobel Prize in Chemistry .
He also attracted the attention of the West Lafayette , Indiana fire department who warned him never to repeat the stunt ever again .
* Actually it 's good that he had a lit cigarette in the pile .
Pouring LOX onto unlit charcoal will cause it to explode at about the force of one stick of dynamite per charcoal .
If you spill LOX on asphalt , it can detonate .
Oh , did we mention that LOX is a rocket fuel ?
( The orange external tank of the Space Shuttle is filled with it . )
Needless to say , do n't try this at home .
Liquid Nitrogen
Nitrogen becomes liquid at 77 K ( - 196 °C ) , which is pretty darn cold .
Liquid Nitrogen or LN 2 is actually a very useful substance : it 's used in the laboratory to freeze things , in hospitals as a medical treatment to freeze and remove warts and skin lesions , and even in restaurants to make alcoholic ice cream .
Wait - make alcoholic ice cream ?
Yes , it turns out though you can't freeze alcohol in the freezer ( not cold enough ) , you can do so with liquid nitrogen .
Here 's Ferran Adria , Head Chef of elBulli Restaurant using liquid nitrogen to make alcohol sorbets and frozen pistachio puree truffles .
Yum !
[ YouTube Clip ]
Liquid Hydrogen
Going down the temperature scale , we have liquid hydrogen at 20.28 K ( - 252.87 °C ) .
Liquid Hydrogen is good for one thing : fuel .
It is a component of rocket fuel , and a perennial contender of zero-emission fuel ( I 'm looking at you , BMW H2R ! )
Liquid hydrogen is used in one of the coolest ( literally ! ) rocket engines ever created by NASA .
Here 's the Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine ( " CECE " for short ) , which generates a scalding 5,000 degree steam and a whopping 13,000 lb of thrust yet form icicles at the rim of its nozzle at the same time .
It 's quite the fire and ice engine :
CECE is fueled by a mixture of - 297 F liquid oxygen and - 423 F liquid hydrogen .
The engine components are super - cooled to similar low temperatures -- and that 's where the icicles come from .
As CECE burns its frigid fuels , hot steam and other gases are propelled out the nozzle .
The steam is cooled by the cold nozzle , condensing and eventually freezing to form icicles around the rim .

Things get really , really strange with liquid helium .
First of all , it 's the only element that remains liquid down to absolute zero ( though you can solidify it with great pressure ) .
It has two form of liquid phases - at 4.2K ( - 268.95 °C ) , helium - 4 ( an isotope of helium ) becomes liquid .
At 2.17 K , it turns into a superfluid .

And the fun begins : superfluid is weird - it has zero viscosity ( a measure of friction for fluids ) , zero entropy , and infinite thermal conductivity .
If a superfluid is placed in an open container , it will creep up the sides and flow over the top .
If you rotate the container from stationary , the superfluid inside will never move .
And weirder still : if you place a capillary tube in a pool of superfluid , then shine light on it , you 'll get a frictionless fountain that will flow forever ( no friction * , remember ? )
* Actually , in bulk fluid , superfluid does have some viscosity whereas in capillary it has no viscosity .
Scientists think the explanation of this paradox is that superfluid is composed of two components - the normal component , and the superfluid component .
I told you it 's strange .
The Coldest Objects in Space
Quick : what 's the coldest object in space ?
A frozen comet or a chilly gas cloud ?
Nope , the coldest object in space is actually a manmade object - the Planck Telescope - launched by the European Space Agency .
As part of experiments to measure the cosmic microwave background ( the afterglow of the Big Bang to you and me ) , the Planck Telescope is cooling its instruments to - 273.05 °C or 0.1 °C above absolute zero .
But what about the coldest natural object in space ?
That title belongs to the Boomerang Nebula ( aka the Bow Tie Nebula ) .
The protoplanetary nebula located 5,000 light - years away from Earth has been spewing ultracold gas for 1,500 years .
This cooled down the nebula to a mere 1 K above absolute zero ( Source ) .

The Coldest Substance on Earth
In 2003 , Nobel Laureate Wolfang Ketterle and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created the coolest man-made substance on Earth : they cooled a Bose - Einstein condensate of sodium atoms down to 450 picoKelvin ( 0.00000000045 K ) .
In 2009 , Tauno Knuuttila and colleagues at the Helsinki University of Technology 's Low Temperature Lab used magnetic refrigeration ( yes , using magnets to cool things down - ain't physics interesting ? ) to cool rhodium to 100 pK ( technically , it 's the temperature for nuclear spin , not its overall thermal energy ) .
Now that 's cold !

The legendary computer game Sim City has been used as the basis for a new programme which is being used to project what the world 's cities will look like in the future .
Gaming technology is being used by urban planners globally
MetroQuest , a piece of software put together by Canadian developers Envision , allows the users to input the decisions that are being made by city planners and see how these areas will change over the next 40 years .
They can also manipulate various factors and explore " what if " future scenarios for their community .
Envision 's co-founder Dave Biggs told BBC News that Sim City was very much the inspiration for the software , which has been in development for 15 years - virtually since the release of the original game .
" We thought if we can just get a fraction of the excitement that people have playing Sim City - but use real information , with real data , from real cities - then we could actually mobilise a huge amount of people , " he said .
" We used the idea of Sim City to develop a process where the community can play games with their own future and see the consequences . "
Manchester 's ' doughnut '
The software works by allowing the user to alter certain aspects of their city , such as poplulation location , urban density , and transport - much as the original game did .
Users can then see the effect of their decisions 40 years down the line , both on a satellite - view map and in a graphical display .
One of the places to put it to practical use has been Manchester , in the north of England .
USERS CAN ALTER : Population location Job location Housing density Roads v transit Transport policy Energy and air quality Water conservation Reduce and recycle Population and economy
Metro Quest worked in partnership with Manchester University 's Urban Planning Department to study the whole of the north - west , looking at alternative scenarios for the region .
Mr Biggs said a conversation had been developed with people in the area about the evolution of the region , after the software showed the " doughnut - like " effect of cities emptying out as more people move to surburbs .
" They 're now looking for ways to re-invigorate the downtown areas to try to curb some of this sprawl that 's happening , " he added .
The software has also been used with planners in Bali , Indonesia - where it showed the island was heading for serious trouble .
The island 's tourism - based economy is so linked to its environment " that they 're inseperable " - but the environment was under serious strain , the programme showed .
" When we went there , we discovered that they were reaching their carrying capacity on so many sustainability issues - overcrowded streets , congested arteries , brownouts for electricity on a regular basis , and at their capacity for water supply , " Mr Biggs said .
" Their plans were as simplistic as trying to increase the economic growth by expanding the airport .
" So by running some scenarios with them , they really woke up to the fact that their entire economy was being compromised , because tourists were having an unpleasant experience because of the rapid growth . "
Unlimited cash
Similarly , the Canadian ski resort of Whistler switched its tourism strategy after using the tool .
Planners had been looking at further enhancing winter tourism , until the model showed the potentially devastating effects of " continuing to build up the hillside " .
Now the resort is focusing instead on attracting more visitors during the quieter summer months .
" Their plans changed right where we got involved , " Mr Biggs added .
However , a demonstration of the tool at the World Urban Forum showed one of the limitations of the tool , which is that , unlike in the real world - and , indeed , unlike in Sim City - money is unlimited .
Given the options , the sustainability experts using MetroQuest invariably selected to go for the expensive " best practices " - which made the city much more sound , but are options perhaps beyond the budget of the average city mayor .
However , Mr Biggs explained that when the tool is used by people other than the gathered for the demonstraton , people are much more cautious .
" Sustainable development cannot be defined academically - it is defined by the people living in the community , " he said .
The other drawback of MetroQuest , of course , is that when you get bored of it , there is no option of unleashing a giant green monster across your city .
