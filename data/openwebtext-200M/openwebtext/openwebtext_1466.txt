NEW YORK , March 25 ( Reuters ) -
The office of Representative Anthony Weiner on Thursday received a threatening letter containing an unidentified white powder , his office said .
“ Earlier today an envelope containing white powder and a threatening letter was delivered to my community office in Kew Gardens , ” the Democratic congressman said in a statement issued by his office .
“ My first priority is the safety of my staff and neighbors , and the authorities are currently taking steps to investigate and resolve the situation , ” he said .
Weiner ’s office in Kew Gardens , part of the New York City borough of Queens , was closed for investigation .
Authorities were responding to the site , and no other details were immediately available , said FBI spokesman Richard Kolko .
The FBI and police are investigating attacks and threats against Democratic members of Congress who voted for healthcare reform , and a senior House of Representatives Democrat said on Wednesday his colleagues are at risk .
Weiner voted in favor of the legislation .

Bricks were tossed through the windows of one member ’s office , another lawmaker was spat at by a protester on Capitol Hill and another was the target of a racial slur .
The House gave the healthcare measure -- President Barack Obama ’s top domestic priority -- final congressional approval on Sunday .
Obama signed it into law on Tuesday .
Emotions ran high among opponents and supporters during the yearlong debate over the legislation .

Martin Stadelmaier , Chef der Staatskanzlei Rheinland - Pfalz , hat den Entwurf für einen neuen Jugendmedienschutz - Staatsvertrag ( JMStV ) gegen anhaltende Kritik in Schutz genommen .
" Es geht nicht darum , dass für Erwachsene Inhalte nicht zugänglich sind " , betonte der SPD - Politiker am heutigen Samstag auf dem PolitCamp 2010 in Berlin .
Kernidee der Novellierung sei es vielmehr , dass Kinder und Jugendliche ein für ihr Alter angemessenes Internetangebot bekämen .
Dafür sollten Eltern die Möglichkeit erhalten , über Jugendschutzprogramme für gewisse Altersgruppen und damit für ihre Schützlinge nicht geeignete Online - Inhalte zu blockieren .
Zur technischen Realisierung der Filtersysteme wird laut dem Staatssekretär ein " einfaches Identifikationsverfahren " in Zusammenarbeit mit Einrichtungen wie der Freiwilligen Selbstkontrolle Multimedia - Diensteanbieter ( FSM ) geschaffen , " wo sich jeder selbst einschätzen kann " .
Im Gegenzug werde der entsprechende Inhalte - Lieferant " von der Haftung freigestellt " , solange er nicht klar gegen Jugendschutzauflagen verstoße .
Stadelmaier unterstrich , dass auch Blog - Betreiber Verantwortung für ihre Inhalte hätten und an dem Ratingverfahren teilnehmen sollten .
Wer dies nicht tue , müsse in Kauf nehmen , dass Eltern ihre Webseiten ausblenden würden , wenn sie sich für den Einsatz eines entsprechenden Jugendschutzprogramms einsetzten .
Der Ländervertreter räumte ein , dass gerade Produzenten aus der Rundfunkwelt alternativ auch weiterhin " Sendezeitbegrenzungen " im Internet vornehmen könnten .
Zudem bestehe nach wie vor die Möglichkeit , als " Ultima Ratio " die Sperre von Webseiten anzuordnen .
Dies geschehe aber " in deutlich anderer Form " als beim teils auf Eis gelegten Zugangserschwerungsgesetz .
So müssten konkrete Inhalte auf Basis eines Verwaltungsaktes blockiert werden , der beklagbar sei .
Es gebe keine allgemeine Schwarze Liste .
Das Verfahren sei als letztes Mittel nötig , " wenn einer unbelehrbar ist " .
" Bestimmte Sachen " wie Kinderpornographie , nationalsozialistische Symbole oder Rassenhass dürfen im Netz eben nicht verbreitet werden .
Generell habe der JMStV in Europa bereits in seiner jetzigen Form eine Vorbildfunktion eingenommen , führte Stadelmaier weiter aus .
Der Kritik am wenig durchsichtigen Verfahren der Verabschiedung von Staatsverträgen hielt er entgegen , dass die Landesparlamente " natürlich beteiligt " würden .
Der jüngste Entwurf von Mitte März sei zudem gerade ins Internet gestellt worden und werde nun den Ministerpräsidenten zur Entscheidung vorgelegt .
Danach gehe das Vorhaben in die Parlamente .
Dass man nicht vorab stärker selbst in die Öffentlichkeit gegangen sei , habe daran gelegen , dass die Initiative " ewig lang außer einer speziellen Community keinen interessiert hat " .
Thomas Jarzombek , ehemaliger Landespolitiker in Nordrhein - Westfalen und inzwischen CDU - Bundestagsabgeordneter , bezeichnete die skizzierte demokratische Beteiligung als Farce .
Er sprach von einem " Sieg der Bürokratie über die Parlamente " .
So werde das Konstrukt mehr oder weniger hinter verschlossenen Türen von den Rundfunkreferenten ausgehandelt .
Dann heiße es : " Friss oder stirb . "
Änderungen durch die Volksvertreter seien nicht vorgesehen .
Der gewählte Ansatz mit Selbstbewertung von Seiten und darauf basierenden Filtern funktioniere zudem vielleicht bei 7 - , aber nicht mehr bei 14 - Jährigen .
Ergebnis sei , dass die Schutzprogramme rasch wieder ausgeschaltet würden .
Das ganze Rating wäre damit vergebens .
Im Namen des Chaos Computer Clubs ( CCC ) vermisste Constanze Kurz " ein Stück weit die Sensibilität " der Länder nach der " ganzen Debatte " um Websperren durch das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz .
Die Umsetzung der angegebenen Ziele sei einfach " verbesserungswürdig " , da müssten die Länder noch einmal " ein Stück zurückgehen " .
Die Netz - Community habe die Sache mit den Sendezeiten zudem prinzipiell abgeschreckt .
Zudem gebe es nach wie vor keine klare Definition des Begriffs des " Anbieters " von Inhalten .
Letztlich klinge die ganze Initiative " schwer nach 60er - und 70er - Jahre - Rundfunk " .
Stephan Dreyer vom Hamburger Hans - Bredow - Institut für Medienforschung lobte prinzipiell den Weg hin zu Jugendschutzprogrammen .
Dieses Konzept sei zwar schon lange im JMStV vorgesehen , aber auch sieben Jahre nach Inkrafttreten des Normenwerk sei noch keine einzige entsprechende Software von den Jugendschützern akzeptiert worden .
Der Gedanke , die Eltern selbst zum Steuern in die Lage zu versetzen , sei begrüßenswert .
Allerdings dürfe es keine praktische staatliche Verpflichtung zur Selbstkennzeichnung geben .
Nicht bewertete Seiten seien insofern nicht automatisch als " ab 18 " einzustufen .
Zudem müssten die Programme so leicht verständlich sein , dass sie normale Anwender nutzen könnten . ( ea )
InformaticaEasy .net ha preso parte all ' incontro con Nokia , presso i suoi uffici , in occasione del quale il famoso produttore di smartphone ha reso ufficialmente nota la sua ultima " trovata " : rendere completamente gratuita la navigazione pedonale e veicolare sui propri smartphone .
Ho ricevuto solo pochi giorni fa una comunicazione con cui Nokia mi invitava calorosamente a prendere parte ad un meeting , fissato per gioved ì
21 Gennaio , direttamente presso i suoi uffici di via Lancetti 43 a Milano .
" Abbiamo delle grandi novità da condividere con te , gioved ì prossimo 21 gennaio .
Non possiamo aggiungere altro in questo momento , ma questo annuncio farà la vera differenza nel modo in cui le persone utilizzeranno i propri telefoni cellulari .
Ti invitiamo quindi a raggiungerci per la presentazione presso gli uffici Nokia [... ] "
C'era qualcosa sotto , indubbiamente .
Una mail che lasciava molto spazio alla fantasia e alla curiosità .
Entrambe mi hanno spinto a recarmi a Milano .
Nonostante una scarpinata dalla fermata della metro , giungo con lieve ritardo in via Lancetti , dove un imponente palazzo di vetro ospita , al quinto piano , gli uffici Nokia .
La presentazione si svolge però in una sala convegni al piano terra .
Saletta piuttosto raccolta , decisamente troppe persone .
10 minuti di ritardo hanno significato seguire la presentazione in piedi tra una calca pazzesca , un esubero notevole rispetto alla normale capienza della sala ed al numero di posti disponibili ...
Un incontro , dunque , decisamente meno formale e meno " diretto " , più che altro una sorta di monologo " unidirezionale " , al termine interrotto solamente da poche domande di carattere alquanto generico ( e spesso ripetute da persone diverse a causa della scarsa sonorità dell ' ambiente ... ) .
Devo ammetterlo : negli incontri con Kingston e Sony Ericsson si respirava un'aria decisamente diversa , forse più informale in quanto concepiti nell ' ottica di porre gli invitati maggiormente a contatto diretto con le personalità dell ' Azienda che gestivano l'evento stesso .
Indubbia la mia curiosità relativa al tema centrale dell 'evento .
Non dimentichiamo che Android e gli smartphone basati sul nuovo OS di Google stanno suscitando molto interesse , così come i nuovi telefoni cellulari con Windows Mobile .
La presentazione , dunque , avrebbe riguardato nuovi telefoni cellulari Nokia ?
Nuovi sistemi operativi scelti in questa nuova ottica concorrenziale ?
Prova sul campo di nuove soluzioni hardware / software ?
Nulla di tutto questo .
La fantasia cede immediatamente il passo alla realtà , ovvero ad un incontro che verteva unicamente sulla presentazione ... del nuovo servizio di Ovi Maps .
Annuncio certamente rivoluzionario per Nokia , ma francamente leggermente distante dalle aspettative che l'invito pervenutomi per posta elettronica voleva lasciar intendere .
In circa un 'ora di presentazione ( l'incontro non è proseguito oltre un rapido buffet finale ) , i manager italiani dell ' Azienda hanno infatti ufficialmente annunciato una nuova versione del software di navigazione Ovi Maps che , grazie all 'implementazione di nuovi ed esclusivi servizi nonchè all 'acquisizione della Navteq , ha davvero molto da offrire agli utenti Nokia .
L'aspetto più interessante riguarda forse la possibilità di scaricare ed utilizzare mappe ed informazioni aggiuntive ( attinte sia online che offline da appositi database ) in maniera del tutto gratuita .
Il sito Ovi Maps è stato già aggiornato con tutti i dettagli del caso ( che riporto di seguito ) .
Ecco uno screenshot di tale pagina web :
La nuova versione di Ovi Maps include , senza costi aggiuntivi , sofisticate funzionalità per la navigazione veicolare e pedonale , come le indicazioni vocali turn - by - turn per 74 paesi in 46 lingue , informazioni sul traffico per più di 10 paesi e mappe dettagliate per oltre 180 paesi .
 Perché avere più dispositivi che funzionano solo in un paese o in una regione ?
Unite tutto , rendete lofferta gratuita e globale , e potenzialmente quasi raddoppierete le dimensioni del mercato della navigazione mobile , ha spiegato Anssi Vanjoki , Executive Vice President di Nokia .
 Nokia è l'unica azienda che offre un servizio di navigazione mobile veicolare e pedonale che funziona in tutto il mondo .
A differenza dei produttori di navigatori stand alone , la casa finlandesa ha infatti deciso di offrire gratuitamente sia il servizio di navigazione che le mappe , con tutte le funzionalità e caratteristiche sofisticate che gli utenti ora si aspettano da un navigatore satellitare di fascia alta .
Per Nokia eliminare i costi legati alla navigazione veicolare e pedonale significa poter attivare rapidamente una base utenti massiccia a cui offrire nuove funzionalità , contenuti e servizi di localizzazione .
Tale operazione rientra nell ' ambito della strategia di Nokia volta a raggiungere la leadership del mercato delle mappe , della navigazione mobile e dei servizi di localizzazione , coerentemente con la visione dell ' azienda che identifica come la prossima ondata di crescita si concentrerà sulla contestualizzazione locale e il social internet : il  " dove " le persone faranno qualcosa diverrà importante quanto il " cosa " faranno .
Grazie all  ' acquisizione di NAVTEQ e ad una ampliata offerta di servizi contestualizzati , Nokia ora può mettere in mano ai propri clienti un sistema di navigazione completo , in qualunque luogo ci si trovi , in qualunque momento sia necessario , gratuitamente .
Nokia ritiene che questa operazione consentirà agli operatori di offrire ai propri clienti un pacchetto completo di navigazione veicolare e personale incoraggiando l'adozione di piani tariffari dati .
Un ulteriore vantaggio per gli operatori consiste nel fatto che Ovi Maps utilizza una tecnologia di grafica ibrida unica nel suo genere , ottimizzata per l'uso su una rete mobile .
Mediante grafiche vettoriali avanzate e un'intelligente combinazione di mappe precaricate e on - line , la nuova versione di Ovi Maps utilizza solo una frazione di banda a differenza delle più ingombranti tecnologie utilizzate dai principali fornitori di mappe mobile .
Con la crescita della base clienti che richiedono applicazioni location - based aggiuntive , inoltre , rendere l'utilizzo della navigazione sul telefono cellulare tanto semplice quanto inviare un sms o scattare una fotografia rappresenta un'enorme opportunità .
Nokia , attraverso il programma Ovi for Developers Beta , ha già rilasciato a una rosa selezionata di sviluppatori ed editori unanteprima di Ovi APIs e SDK  Bet ( kit per lo sviluppo software ) necessari per iniziare a creare le applicazioni , che verranno poi rese disponibili attraverso l Ovi Store di Nokia .
Ovi Maps è immediatamente disponibile per il download per 10 dispositivi Nokia , tra cui il popolare Nokia N97 mini , Nokia 5800 XpressMusic e Nokia E72 , altri smartphone Nokia saranno aggiunti nelle prossime settimane .
Nel frattempo , gli attuali utenti di smartphone Nokia compatibili con il nuovo Ovi Maps possono scaricarlo gratuitamente da www.nokia.it/maps.
Da marzo 2010 i nuovi smartphone Nokia con GPS includeranno la nuova versione di Ovi Maps precaricata con informazioni cartografiche locali , navigazione pedonale e veicolare e laccesso gratuito alle guide Lonely Planet e Michelin .
Ovi Maps copre oltre 180 paesi , con la navigazione pedonale e veicolare in 74 paesi in 46 lingue e 6.000 punti di riferimento tridimensionali per 200 città in tutto il mondo .
Le guide Lonely Planet e Michelin contengono informazioni relative a oltre 1.000 destinazioni in tutto il mondo .
La lista completa dei dispositivi Nokia attualmente compatibili : Nokia N97 mini , Nokia 5800 XpressMusic , Nokia 5800 Navigation Edition , Nokia E52 , Nokia E55 , Nokia E72 , Nokia 5230 , Nokia 6710 Navigator , Nokia 6730 classic e Nokia X6 .

I had an interesting experience phonebanking for OFA in Ann Arbor this week .
One of the names that popped up on my list of calls was Weston Vivian , male , age 85 .
It was probably the most inspirational call I made all week .
Weston Vivian was a U.S. Congressman from Michigan ’s 2nd District from 1965 - 1967 .
As he told me during our phone call , he had the distinct pleasure of voting FOR the Social Security Act of 1965 that created both Medicare and Medicaid .
While we talked , Mr. Vivian told me he is in full support of the current legislation and that it is just as important that it pass today as the bill he voted on in 1965 was back then .
He then agreed to call Bart Stupak to ask him to vote for the bill .
“ Yes , young man , ” he told me .
“ I support the legislation and I ’ll call my member of Congress .
Thank you for what you ’re doing . ”
Mr. Weston was a single - term Congressman .
He was part of what came to be known as “ Michigan Five Fluke Freshmen ” , a group of one - term Democrats who were promptly tossed out of office by Republicans at the next election .
Today we have Republican leadership disingenuously threatening Democrats that they will be defeated in the fall by Republicans if they vote to pass this historic legislation .
They say this as if anyone believes that ( a ) they have the best interests of Democrats in mind and ( b ) they wo n’t use the bill to pummel the Democrats whether it is passed or not .
Maybe Mitch McConnell and John Boehner are right .
Maybe they are wrong .
But after speaking to Weston Vivian , I can tell you this : any Democrat that votes FOR this bill will be able to hold their head up high and have no regrets .
And 45 years later , when some young whippersnapper like me calls them up during a phonebank , they ’ll be able to say , “ Yes , young man , I support the legislation and I ’ll call my member of Congress .
Thank you for what you ’re doing . ”
I ’m just sayin ’ …

Obama reportedly snubbed Israeli PM , walked out on dinner after no deal on settlements
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned home to media derision on Thursday , having failed to resolve a bitter row with Washington over the building of Jewish settlements .
One publication even called it a diplomatic “ hazing ” by President Obama .
During the visit , the Israeli leader suffered perhaps the chilliest reception yet by an American president , as Barack Obama spoke to him only briefly and , learning that Netanyahu was unwilling to compromise on building new settlements in Palestine , abruptly left to dine by himself .
ADVERTISEMENT
Netanyahu did not pose for any photographs and made no statement on arrival in Israel , but government spokesman Nir Hefetz insisted Israel and its closest ally had edged closer to an understanding .
“ There was progress ; there is a narrowing of the gaps between the positions of Israel and the positions of the United States on this issue , ” he told Israel ’s Channel Two TV .
Other Israeli media saw things differently .
“ One Israeli newspaper called the meeting ‘ a hazing in stages ’ , poisoned by such mistrust that the Israeli delegation eventually left rather than risk being eavesdropped on a White House phone line , ” the Times Online reported .
“ Another said that the Prime Minister had received ‘ the treatment reserved for the President of Equatorial Guinea ’ .
“ Left to talk among themselves , Mr Netanyahu and his aides retreated to the Roosevelt Room .
He later spent a further half - hour with Mr Obama and extended his stay for a day of emergency talks aimed at restarting peace negotiations , but left last night with no official statement from either side .
He returns to Israel dangerously isolated after what Israeli media have called a White House ambush for which he is largely to blame . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Israeli media said a briefing Netanyahu had intended to give his inner forum of seven senior ministers had been postponed until Friday .
Netanyahu ’s office would not comment on plans for such a meeting .
The White House sought to give an upbeat tone to Netanyahu ’s trip , although it reported no concrete achievements .
“ We are making progress on important issues , ” spokesman Robert Gibbs said as President Barack Obama flew to Iowa on Air Force One .
ADVERTISEMENT
Gibbs said he had nothing more substantive to report about the meetings , which Washington has declined to describe in detail .
“ Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu will convene his senior ministers on Friday to discuss the demands made by US President Barack Obama and his overall trip to Washington – a trip that , because of negative atmospherics and amid a paucity of hard information , has been widely characterized as among the most difficult in recent memory , ” The Jerusalem Post added .
ADVERTISEMENT
The spat erupted after Netanyahu ’s government announced 1,600 new housing units for annexed , largely Arab , east Jerusalem as US Vice President Joe Biden was in the region earlier this month hoping to promote peace talks .
The Palestinians see east Jerusalem as the capital of their promised state , and refuse to meet Netanyahu face - to - face without a complete freeze of settlement construction in the occupied territories .
An aide to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas quoted a US official as saying Netanyahu ’s US visit did not bridge the divide .
ADVERTISEMENT
Nabil Abu Rudeina told AFP an assistant to US Middle East envoy George Mitchell told Abbas in Jordan on Thursday that Netanyahu ’s session with Obama did not clear the way for indirect Israeli - Palestinian talks that Washington is promoting .
“ He told Abbas that the meeting between Netanyahu and Obama failed to arrive at an agreement to stop settlement in Jerusalem and the West Bank and to begin indirect talks , ” Abu Rudeina said , adding that the official said US efforts would continue .
Israeli President Shimon Peres said Israel “ apparently did not reach an understanding with the United States of America . ”
In Washington , Defence Secretary Robert Gates said Israeli - Palestinian tensions — which the US administration had hoped to ease — are affecting Washington ’s national security interests .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The lack of progress toward Middle East peace is clearly an issue that ’s exploited by our adversaries in the region , ” he said .
Before flying home , Netanyahu cancelled planned interviews with reporters after none of the customary photo opportunities with US officials or any formal statements with them .
Israeli daily Maariv called the visit a “ humiliation ” and said Netanyahu had “ received in the White House the treatment reserved for the president of Equatorial Guinea . ”
Other media reported that Netanyahu ’s carefully coordinated dressing down was accompanied by demands for wide - ranging measures including the extension of a partial settlement halt and the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners .
ADVERTISEMENT
Gibbs described the discussions as “ honest and straightforward , ” a diplomatic euphemism hinting at tensions , after Netanyahu entered the talks having laid down a hard line on settlement construction in east Jerusalem .
Netanyahu on Tuesday said US demands for a settlement freeze could delay the resumption of Middle East peace talks for a year , a day after a fiery speech in which he said : “ Jerusalem is not a settlement . ”
But as he left Washington , he insisted the two sides had “ found a balance between the traditional policy followed by all Israeli governments and our willingness to find ways to revive the the peace process . ”
Obama also discussed the latest Middle East tensions with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the White House said .
The talks by secure video link also focused on another key issue concerning Israel — Iran .
ADVERTISEMENT
Many Israelis fear the growing rift with Washington could hinder progress on containing Iran ’s nuclear program , which Israel views as its greatest strategic threat .
Tehran insists the program is peaceful .
Israel is widely reported to be the sole , if undeclared , nuclear - armed power in the Middle East .
It refuses to confirm or deny having atomic weapons .

From his backyard , Joseph Leggett used to look out over the green , manicured fairways of the Palm Desert Country Club golf course .
Lately , what he saw looked more like weedy vacant lots .
Swaths of the championship course , deemed one of the best designed in the desert , turned brown as its owners searched for hundreds of thousands of dollars to reseed , reopen and rebound from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
“ The course is an eyesore , ” Leggett said recently .
He estimated that his home of 30 years had lost half its value because of the ruined view .
“ My wife is beside herself . ”

The recession has dealt a mean bogey to golf .
Hundreds of courses have closed in the last two years and many formerly exclusive country clubs have slashed fees or opened their greens to the public .
Sales of golf balls , clubs and apparel -- a multibillion - dollar industry -- have dipped 10 % this year as players trim spending , according to golf researcher Pellucid Corp .
But perhaps the most dramatic examples of golf ’s woes can be seen in the string of barren fairways and locked gates .
Through September of this year , at least 114 of the nation ’s 16,000 or so golf courses had closed , according to the National Golf Foundation , a number that was offset only partly by the opening of 44 new courses .
“ People are cutting golf out of their diets because they ’ve got to cut something , ” said Jeff Woolson , a real estate broker with Los Angeles - based CB Richard Ellis who specializes in buying and selling golf courses .
Advertisement
Woolson and other real estate experts say most golf courses have lost 30 % to 50 % of their worth in the last two years .
Several courses have been forced into bankruptcy .
Among them is Chevy Chase Country Club in Glendale , which dates to 1925 and was designed by noted golf architect William P. Bell , who also designed the Bel Air Country Club and the Newport Beach Country Club .
The owners tried to sell it for $ 6.5 million , but could n’t find a buyer before the bankruptcy court decided to turn it over to the lender .
The asking price , which would have included a Spanish - style clubhouse and Olympic - sized pool on 35 acres , might sound like a bargain -- there are homes in the Los Angeles area that sell for more -- but golf courses are businesses , not typical real estate investments , because they must remain golf courses .
And business has been bad lately .
It ’s a big comedown from the glory days .
Golf thrived so in the 1980s that it was widely believed that a new U.S. course could open every day and there still would n’t be enough links to satisfy demand .
In the 1990s came Tiger Woods , who made the world pay attention to golf as he grew to dominate the sport .
The “ Tiger effect , ” many investors assumed , would launch a youth wave of interest in the sport .
Advertisement
It never materialized .
“ The Tiger effect has had a dramatic effect in people watching golf but seems to have no increase in people playing golf , ” said real estate attorney Scott Thompson , who specializes in golf course transactions .
The number of U.S. golfers peaked in 2005 at 30 million , though the number of rounds played was decreasing .
Now with the economy still weak and consumers pinching pennies , many golf course owners face potential financial calamity as loans come due and lenders refuse to let them refinance , Woolson said .
“ Owners have to find new debt , but there is no new debt , ” he said .
Advertisement
Industry insiders say the three major lenders for golf course investments -- GE Capital , Textron Financial Corp. and Capmark Financial Group Inc. -- have nearly stopped making golf - related loans .
Capmark filed for Chapter 11 protection in October .
Most private golf clubs that land in bankruptcy , such as the Chevy Chase in Glendale , are eventually picked up by other investors .
It ’s common for wealthy individuals to join forces and pick up their troubled club .
Last month , a group of businessmen and members of the golf industry bought Bear Creek Golf Club in Murrieta by assuming its debt .
The new owners quickly reduced initiation fees and monthly dues .
Membership at the 27 - year - old club is rising again , they said .
Desert Dunes Golf Course in Desert Hot Springs , which closed in May , is being sold to foreign investors .
The transaction is nearly complete , court - appointed receiver Bellann Raile said , and the course , one of the highest - rated public operations in the country , may reopen soon .

The Coachella Valley has more than 100 courses , and many of them , especially private clubs in new subdivisions , have struggled as the housing crash drove away potential golfers .
Homes near golf courses sell for a premium , so developers often were willing to subsidize a money - losing golf business as long as they were making profits on home sales .
“ A lot of courses were being built to increase lot values for homes , ” said attorney Steven Lurie , a partner of Thompson at the Los Angeles law firm of Greenberg Glusker .
“ No one was paying attention to the economics of golf courses themselves . ”
About 30 % of the courses that opened in the 1990s were connected with residential developments , said Jim Kass , director of research for the Florida - based National Golf Foundation .
This year , 70 % of new golf courses were part of the few projects coming out the end of the development pipeline .
In spite of all the financial setbacks experienced by operators , however , golf courses themselves have a knack for enduring , even if it ’s under new ownership .

The Jack Nicklaus - designed Escena Golf Club in Palm Springs , which opened in 2005 as part of a housing development , closed two years ago when one of the home - builder owners ran into financial problems .
A new owner took over the debt and expects to reopen the course this week as part of a push to sell homes again .
The owners of Palm Desert Country Club in Palm Desert managed to secure an operating loan in the last few weeks that has allowed them to start reseeding and watering , said Larry Kosmont , one of the owners .
He plans to reopen the main course Dec. 4 .
“ It ’s a very tough economy for golf courses , ” Kosmont said , “ but we persevered . ”
To boost business , many private clubs are offering no -interest loans to help the less - well - heeled buy memberships , and public courses are rolling out the equivalent of blue - plate specials , including cheaper rates for off hours and discounts on lessons and merchandise .
Advertisement
Some think heavy discounting is a mistake .
“ The trend of downward rates in the golf industry has been the real cause for many courses failing , ” said Mark Tansey , president of Palm Desert - based Sunrise Golf Inc. , the company that will run Escena for its owners .
“ Too many inexperienced operators are using price as a blunt instrument to generate activity . ”
Not that golfers are protesting .
Dwain Richardson , a hospital food director with an 18 handicap , enjoys the “ twilight ” specials at the Tahquitz Creek Golf Resort in Palm Springs .
By starting midafternoon he can usually play 13 or 14 holes before it gets too dark to see .
He pays only $ 29 and gets the use of a golf cart plus two free drinks at the bar .

Low prices keep golfers like him coming out , he said , which could cement new habits .
“ I would play every other day if I could , ” Richardson said .
“ I can see why people get addicted . ”

SOMERVILLE --
Out of the money that strangers donated for a Manville toddler whose mother and siblings died in a 2007 fire , thousands of it went for expenses that had nothing to do with the boy , like the $ 7,107 his father spent on an escort service , a detective testified today .
Officials say Tubal Eduardo Sr. drained the funds that poured in for his youngest son , Noah , after a blaze killed the rest of their family in the Central Jersey borough .
The Somerset County Prosecutor ’s Office has charged Eduardo , 32 , of Somerville , with third - degree theft by failure to make required disposition of funds .
He is on trial before Superior Court Judge Paul Armstrong in Somerville , and if convicted , Eduardo faces up to five years in state prison .
Testimony started Wednesday and will resume Tuesday with witnesses for the defense .
Assistant Prosecutor Robert Pollock concluded the state ’s case today by calling prosecutor ’s Detective Michael Schutta to the stand to detail how Eduardo allegedly spent the money raised by the Weston School PTA .
Only two purchases seemed to be for Noah .
Eduardo apparently spent $ 58.87 on toys , the detective said .
Public defender Maureen O’Reilly has insisted her client used the money for living expenses , such as the purchase of an eight - year - old car with 112,000 miles .
He had nothing left after the fire killed his longtime girlfriend , Heather Marchie , 28 , and their children , Tubal Jr. , 5 , and Angelina , 4 , on March 12 , 2007 .
The school , where Tubal Jr. attended kindergarten , collected $ 38,351.24 , the state says .
The PTA designated $ 5,000 for Eduardo , and the rest for Noah .
Under a court order , any funds raised for Noah were supposed to go into a joint guardian account naming Eduardo and Noah ’s maternal grandmother , Debra Jean Walters .
The adults had to agree and sign off on anything that was spent .
During today ’s testimony , banking center manager Robert DiSanto said Eduardo opened three accounts in September 2007 at Bank of America ’s Somerville branch .
The father retained sole control over each .
One of them was a money market savings account , with $ 25 , that remained dormant .
Eduardo placed $ 5,000 in a personal checking account and $ 33,351.24 in a custodial savings account naming Noah the beneficiary , DiSanto said .
Eduardo used the custodial account to provide overdraft protection for the checking .
If the latter ran short , money would be transferred to cover pending charges .
On cross-examination , O’Reilly asked why the bank let the custodial account be used for overdrafts .
" That ’s not a normal structure , " DiSanto said .
" That was set up based on customer preference .
" If it does n’t make sense , that ’s not our fault , " he added .
Det. Schutta traced the spending pattern and told jurors that between September and December 2007 , Eduardo made 19 purchases that could not have been for the child .
Some were at liquor stores .
At least $ 7,107 went to First Professional Referral Services .
" I believe it ’s an escort service , " the detective said in court .
There were $ 14,346.75 in cash withdrawals , and $ 2,472.22 for food , gas and lodging .

Here 's a fascinating profile on radical Santa Fe Institute economist Samuel Bowles , an empiricist who says his research does n't support the Chicago School efficient marketplace hypothesis .
Instead , Bowles argues that the wealth inequality created by strict market economics creates inefficiencies because society has to devote so much effort to stopping the poor from expropriating the rich .
He calls this " guard labor " and says that one in four Americans is employed to in the sector — labor that could otherwise be used to increase the nation 's wealth and progress .
The greater the inequalities in a society , the more guard labor it requires , Bowles finds .
This holds true among US states , with relatively unequal states like New Mexico employing a greater share of guard labor than relatively egalitarian states like Wisconsin .
The problem , Bowles argues , is that too much guard labor sustains " illegitimate inequalities , " creating a drag on the economy .
All of the people in guard labor jobs could be doing something more productive with their time–perhaps starting their own businesses or helping to reduce the US trade deficit with China .
Guard labor supports what one might call the beat - down economy .
Community Action 's Porter sees it all the time .
" We have based almost everything we have done on the idea that we always need a part of our workforce that is marginalized –that we can call this group into action at any time , pay them nothing and they will do anything that needs to be done , " she says .
More discouraging , perhaps , is the statistical fact that a person born into this workforce has little chance of rising beyond it .

The study that first suggested a link between vaccines and autism and spurred a long - running , acrimonious debate over the safety of vaccines has been retracted by the British medical journal that published it .
The withdrawal supports the scientific evidence that vaccinations do n't cause autism , but is n't likely to persuade advocacy groups that believe in a link .
The 1998 study of 12 children triggered worry among British parents that the measles - mumps - rubella vaccine caused autism , and many decided not to immunize their children ...

I 've never seen Sen. Claire McCaskill quite so fired up about , well , anything :
A committee investigation of the company revealed that contracting personnel acquired hundreds of weapons , including more than 500 AK - 47s , from a facility in Kabul that stores arms for use by the Afghan police .
The contractors were not authorized to be armed .
Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill says if members of the U.S. military were involved in such actions they would face immediate and serious consequences .
" If one of the Army had gone out there with an AK - 47 they were not supposed to have on top of a moving vehicle and shot a guy in the head and paralyzed him something would have happened in that chain of command , " said Claire McCaskill .
" And if they had kept somebody on the force that had been using cocaine , that had been drunk , that had been charged with larceny that had done all these things these guys had done , they went out and killed Afghan people in the spring of 2009 , something would have happened to them if they were in the military . "
Senator McCaskill says most Afghans do not distinguish between private American contractors and members of the U.S. military .
She says reckless behavior by contractors is jeopardizing the U.S. mission in Afghanistan .
" And what is killing me about this problem with Blackwater is we have two sets of rules and one image , " she said .
" And as long as we have two sets of rules and one image we are in trouble on this mission . "
If you want to know the meaning of life , then my master ’s thesis is relevant .
My master ’s thesis , Two New Kinds of Stoicism , was on ethical theory .
In particular , I developed two new sorts of Stoic ethics without the need for a reference to God ( Universal Reason ) .
Such a theory is meant to tell us what has value , and it is meant to help us identify right and wrong , and make moral decisions .
Although my thesis has not been peer - reviewed by loads of professional philosophers , it was accepted as my master ’s thesis by three philosophy professors at San Jose State University .
( That does n’t mean they agreed with it .
It just means that it was good enough to help me get a degree . )
The thesis can also be downloaded from the San Jose State University website .
It was published in 2008 .
Abstract
This thesis introduces two new kinds of Stoic ethics : Neo-Aristonianism and Common Sense Stoicism .
Although Ancient Stoicism requires us to accept the existence of divine reason ( God ) , the two new kinds of Stoicism were developed to avoid such a requirement .
Ancient Stoic ethics insisted that everything that happens has equal value because everything is part of the divine plan .
This theory of values coupled with a moral psychology that states that desires are caused by value judgments lead Ancient Stoics to reject passions .
Anger , for example , is caused by the belief that someone has done something of negative value .
Neo -Aristonianism and Common Sense Stoicism reject the fact that everything that happens has equal value , and will consequentially find that passions can be appropriate .
Why Stoicism ?
Stoicism offers us an answer to the question , “ How do I know what is right or wrong ? ” as well as help to enable us to actually do what is right .
Stoicism has a great deal of credibility , but it seems to be quickly dismissed by many because of the references to God .
However , Ariston of Chios , an ancient Stoic philosopher , did not find metaphysics ( God ) to be necessary for ethics .
Additionally , Pierre Hadot and Michel Foucault believed that the Stoics to offer us a competitive ethical theory that does not have to refer to God at all .
It was never fully explained how this could be possible , so I decided to give it a try .
I found out that Lawrence Becker also developed a version of Stoic ethics that does n’t require God in his book A New Stoicism .
His version of Stoicism could be considered to be competition to my proposals .
I find his ethical theory to be abstract , he does n’t discuss moral psychology in detail , and I do n’t know if his ethical theory can be applied to everyday decision making .
Why Two Theories ?
People have different levels of skepticism , and Neo-Aristonianism will appeal to those who have higher levels of skepticism than Common Sense Stoicism .
Neo -Aristonianism might be acceptable to an anti-realist , for example .
Some disagreement is expected when we are dealing with uncertainty and I do n’t think everyone should have to agree about something this important unless moral truth becomes certain ( which might never happen ) .
What is Stoicism ?
Stoicism is the philosophical life of a group known as “ the Stoics . ”
They believed themselves to be the “ Socratics ” ( followers of Socrates ) .
They believed that virtue is the greatest priority .
There could be no overriding reason to reject virtue .
( Unlike Aristotle and the Epicureans , we ca n’t reject virtue if we find out that virtue causes suffering . )
The Stoics argued that everything that happens is part of the divine plan , so everything that happens has equal value .
Nothing that happens could be evil .
Additionally , the Stoics agree with Socrates that knowledge is virtue , ignorance is vice , and knowledgeable thought causes virtuous action .
If you think that something is good , then you will want it .
Then your actions are more likely to lead you to try to attain it .
In other words , their moral psychology roughly states the following :
Thinking X is good causes you to desire it .
Desiring X causes you to try to attain it through action .
What About the Meaning of Life ?
I understand the “ meaning of life ” to refer to what “ really matters . ”
If anything really matters , it has what philosophers call “ intrinsic value . ”
For example , I argue that consciousness has intrinsic value , so the meaning of life is ( in part ) to promote consciousness .
We could promote consciousness just by saving lives because each person has consciousness .
No matter what has intrinsic value , virtue will be our greatest priority ( to be willing and able to do good ) .
Becoming virtuous , helping others become virtuous , and saving lives of people ( who have some virtue ) can all be appropriate to promote virtue .
If we for some reason ca n’t know ( or agree upon ) intrinsic values , then our most important priority will still be virtue .
Additionally , we could identify various “ goods ” that are essential for virtue , such as health , knowledge , and consciousness .

Doctors ' fury as NICE bans £ 2 - a - day heart drug that could help 40,000 patients
Dronedarone treats a type of abnormal heartbeat that affects one million people in the UK
An NHS ban on a heart drug costing just £ 2 a day could put thousands of lives at risk , doctors said yesterday .
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has blocked the first new drug in 25 years to treat atrial fibrillation - a type of abnormal heartbeat affecting more than one million in Britain .
Despite the widespread availability of dronedarone in Europe and the United States , the rationing watchdog claims it is not cost effective enough .
Now 176 cardiologists - backed by 25 MPs and peers - have written to NICE insisting the drug could help more than 40,000 sufferers who would otherwise face the risk of heart attacks or strokes .
They argue current atrial fibrillation drugs either do not work or have serious sideeffects .
These include toxic damage to the lungs , kidneys and liver .
Dronedarone costs £ 67 a month , around £ 2 a day , which is more expensive than approved drugs .
But its supporters say the cost is outweighed by the amount which would be saved in treatment costs for sufferers .
Patients whose symptoms are not controlled frequently end up being admitted to hospital for emergency treatment at a cost of thousands of pounds .
NICE published its provisional decision not to approve dronedarone on Christmas Eve .
A final decision is expected in March , but it is unusual for there to be a change of mind .
The cardiologists state in an open letter : ' The draft guidance is a shocking decision , based on cost saving and will be extremely detrimental to many patients with AF , their carers and their medical professionals - all of whom had looked to this innovative treatment as a chance to restore long - term health and improve quality of life for appropriate - patients . '
Dr Derick Todd , consultant cardiologist at the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital , said : ' One in four of us will one day suffer from AF and this new drug is an important advance in its treatment . '
Patients with atrial fibrillation are at risk of a stroke because the rapidly beating heart fails to pump blood away from its chambers properly .
More than 40,000 people could be at needless risk of heart attack and stroke because of the ban , doctors have said ( file picture )
This can cause blood clots which then move on to damage the brain .
It mainly affects the
elderly , although some athletes are also prone to the condition .
Trudie Lobban , chief executive of the Atrial Fibrillation Association , said : ' Paying out around £ 60 a month to keep a patient 's condition controlled is a small price to pay compared to the thousands it costs to treat every stroke suffered by an AF patient .
There is a serious danger that patients whose AF is not controlled will have a stroke .
' Around 16,000 patients a year currently have a stroke .
Around 4,300 will end up in hospital for a long period of time , 3,200 will lose their independence and end up in residential care and 8,500 die . '
Martin Harman , 37 , a company director from York , was diagnosed with the condition four years ago following surgery for a sports injury .
But he came off his medication regime two years ago because of nausea , sleepless nights and fatigue .
He said : ' It was as bad as having the condition and I did n't want to be on drugs long - term with their toxic side effects .
' I would like to be able to go on a drug that works without giving me terrible side effects . '
Last night a spokesman for NICE said : ' In this case , dronedarone costs more and has not been shown to be more effective than other treatments for atrial fibrillation . '
Washington , DC ’s annual Artomatic show is underway .
The free annual showcase of local art is being held on eight floors of an empty office building on Half Street Southeast from now through July 5 .
“ It ’s got everything from soup to nuts , but there ’s a lot more nuts than soup , ” a friend warned me .
Not to be dissauded , I checked it out on Thursday and was pleasantly surprised .
I found one exhibit that I thought was especially brilliant .
The Peeps exhibit consists of a series of art pieces that use small marshmallow candies that are usually consumed during at Easter .
A number of the pieces had space and aviation themes .

Hundreds of thousands of Egyptian football fans took to the streets of Cairo to celebrate their team 's victory in the final of the African Cup of Nations .

Their victory over Ghana makes it an unprecedented three titles in a row .
As soon as referee Koman Coulibaly , from Mali , had blown the final whistle , an all - night street party was under way in the capital .
The night sky filled with the sound of horns and fireworks , and the Egyptian flag was proudly displayed from almost every car that took to the streets .
" I am so proud of my team , " said a delighted Walid Hassan .
" We have won the African Cup three times in a row now and this is a record , something that should make every Egyptian proud , " he said .
Outside the Al - Ahly club , one of the two big Cairo teams , a crowd had gathered to celebrate together .
" Masr ! Masr ! " they screamed : " Egypt , Egypt ! "
" We will party all night and tomorrow night , it 's wonderful .
We played really well throughout the tournament and I 'm so excited , " remarked Loma , leaning from the window of a car , her face painted red , white and black .
" Winning was very important for us , " agreed Ahmad Yousef .
" We have shown the world what a fantastic team we are . "
Palpable relief Thousands of fans watched the match on a big screen in the national stadium .
There was tension throughout .
This win makes it a little bit better , but we had high hopes of competing in this World Cup

Angola 2010 : Tragedy and triumph
The Egyptians - overwhelming favourites against a much younger , inexperienced Ghana - knew it was theirs to lose ; and only minutes before super - sub Gado had scored his sublime winner , the Ghanaians had gone close on a couple of occasions .
The relief in the cafe where we were watching was palpable .
This was a final between two of the most successful nations in the African Cup .
Egypt , who have stretched their record - breaking unbeaten run at the Nations Cup to 19 games since 2004 , have now won seven titles , with Ghana and Cameroon languishing far behind , on four .
And it was Egypt that dominated this year 's tournament .
They beat the fancied teams like Nigeria and Cameroon , they scored 15 goals , conceding only two , and along the way they humiliated Algeria - who only two months ago before had beaten them in an ugly World Cup eliminator .
So satisfying was that 4 - 0 semi-final win over Algeria and the way in which the Algerians had imploded - three Algerians players were sent off - that , to most Egyptians , this had felt like the final after the final ; beating the Algerians was always going to be more important than winning the tournament itself .
" This win makes it a little bit better , but we had high hopes of competing in this World Cup , " said Reem Abu Tabl , who watched the match with her children .
" It 's tough luck and hugely disappointing in my view that the undefeated African champions will not be there , " she added .
" But this proves we are the best in Africa , " said Michelle .
" And it was so important to win well . "
' Best of luck '
There are some , however , who wish the Algerians luck in the World Cup .
Egypt was the favourite to win the match Mohamed Walid said : " We are the African champions , that is fine for us .
But we wish Algeria - the only Arab country competing in South Africa - all the best this summer .
God willing , they will do us proud . "
There was high praise also for the long - time Egyptian coach , Hassan Shehata , who has lifted his team after the disappointment of the past two months , and guided them to victory , even with some of his best players injured .
" We thank Mr Hassan for his professionalism , " said Sherine Talab .
" He took criticism after the Algeria game but he has moulded this team into such a strong side and the country is rightly proud of him and his players . "
There is no doubt that the thousands of Egyptian supporters who will flock to the airport to welcome their victorious team home , would swap all of the euphoria for a place in the World Cup finals later this year .
But perhaps the manner in which they have performed in this tournament will , at least , restore some national pride .

Good news , everyone !
After lengthy discussions , we 've decided to reverse ourselves on the position that we recently established , regarding how hard it 's going to be to get into ScienceHD .
We initially decided to go into lockdown in large part due two reasons : the abuses of many of our users , and security risks .
Our ultimate goal is the sharing of knowledge , though , so this was a very hard choice to make , and we 're very glad to be able to open up again .
We 've been hard at work behind the scenes , implementing new security features and reorganized things , and these new changes have alleviated many of our previous concerns regarding security and bad users , among other things .
Now , ScienceHD wo n't be fully open registration , though .
Here is how things will now stand :
There will be a questionnaire , open to all interested parties , to sign up with .
Unlike our Gravmas event , this invite questionnaire will always be open .
It will be reviewed manually by staff to decide whether an invitation will be extended .
All registration and invite - sending will be subject to the Max User limit , although this will be raised and kept at a generally high level .
No invites or registration will be allowed if the number of enabled users exceeds this value , with the exception that :

This is a snippet from the Gold Forecaster .
The newsletter that covers all pertinent factors affecting the gold price [ with a 95 % accuracy rate ] .-
For many years it was believed that the oil price had a direct impact on the gold price .
Then the �credit crunch � arrived , after the oil price had hit $ 145 + before tumbling to $ 35 a barrel .
Since then the oil price has been treated as irrelevant to the gold price .
We at Gold Forecaster believe it only had an indirect influence on the gold price in the first place .
Its major role was to give us a feel of the state of the global economy .
After all , economies still run on oil .
Nothing on that front has changed , so oil remains a good measure of the state of the world economy .
But since 2007 a great deal has changed in the global economy and the oil market .
These changes are structural and long - term .
But they have to be see in perspective for their impact on the future oil price and indirectly the gold price .
The major structural change has been the expansion of the client base of the oil market and so the potential for huge demand growth .
While oil supply is growing , we do not believe that in a growing world economy there will be enough supply to satisfy demand .
Oil Supplies are growing Khurais is an oilfield that has come on stream now in Saudi Arabia .
It is capable of pumping 1.2 million barrels a day .
This is more than the entire production of Texas .
Saudia Arabia�s output is well over the amount that the world wants at the moment .
After raising its capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day , Saudi Arabia is now pumping about 8.5 million barrels a day , its lowest level since the early 1990s .
The U.S. is no longer Saudi Arabia �s biggest client .
But the recession hit U.S. demand in particular which had to slash oil consumption by 10 % from its 2005 - 7 peaks .
A few months ago , Aramco sold its storage facilities in the Caribbean , a signal that it was abandoning the East Coast market , dropping from the lead oil supplier to the U.S. to letting Canada , Mexico and Venezuela run ahead of them .
Not that they are giving up on the States [ they are expanding refinery capacity in Port Arthur , Texas , alongside Royal Dutch Shell to 600,000 barrels a day to make it the largest U.S. refinery ] , but they are adjusting the shape of their customer preference to make room for Asia .
For instance , they have also ended the � U.S. discount , � where Aramco sold oil to American refiners for about $ 1 a barrel less than to Asia .
Saudi exports to the United States fell to 989,000 barrels a day , the lowest level in 22 years , from 1.5 million barrels a day the previous year .
Oil flows eastward
This has produced a dramatic swing in the global oil flow .
As a result , Saudi Arabia exported more oil to China than to the United States last year .
China is the growth market for petroleum .
Saudi officials have recognized that changes are taking place in the United States turning them from the present top oil buyer to a future when they will be less important .
- Saudi sales to China surged above a million barrels a day last year , nearly doubling from the previous year .
We believe that China �s oil demand is set to grow much more than that each year for at least the next two years .
Saudi Arabia now accounts for a quarter of Chinese oil imports .
Saudi Aramco recently inaugurated a huge refinery in the Fujian province , in the southeast coast of China , which is projected to receive 200,000 barrels a day of Saudi crude , and is looking at a second project in the northeast city of Qingdao .
It is also planning to build two refineries in Saudi Arabia , that are primarily destined to ship products to Asia .
- India is also courting Saudi attention .
After a visit in March to Riyadh by India �s prime minister , Saudi Arabia outlined a goal to double its exports to India from 25 % to 50 % [ Its exports to India grew sevenfold from 2000 to 2008 ] .
Potential Growth of Chinese demand The United States consumed 18.5 million barrels a day in 2009 .
That amounts to 22 barrels of oil a year for each American , compared with 2.4 barrels for each Chinese .
To get some perspective on this growth , look at Chinese growth in oil demand growing roughly in line with their car markets [ much of Chinese industry relies on oil ] .
Their car market grew 46 % in December year - on - year .
Compare populations : 300 million U.S. : 1.4 billion China .
Understandably , the Saudis now see their relationship with China as very long term and a strong foundation for more control over prices and supply in the oil market .
The next oil crisis Chinese oil consumption reached 8.5 million barrels a day last year , compared with 4.8 million in 2000 .
Should Chinese growth persist at the current pace we foresee they will take up at least 2 to 3 million barrels of the 4 million barrels a day , spare capacity of Saudi Arabia .
This brings the next oil crisis into view in around 2013 , provided there is no growth in Europe and the U.S.A. in oil demand .
Most believe there will be growth there , meaning we should hit crisis level in around 2012 or earlier .
U.S. guarantee of security in the Middle East , is it important still ?
We have all taken for granted that Saudi Arabia could not afford to ignore its U.S. guarantee of security [ particularly the house of Saud ] .
This was based on the fear that Russia in particular would fill the void the U.S. would leave .
More realistically , we assumed that they just could not do with the U.S. pressuring them if they turned away from the States .
But is there such a real threat to the stability of Saudi Arabia ?
The Russian danger has diminished considerably [ as has its influence over Iran , its near neighbour ] and in the light of the tight relationship between the Middle Eastern States and the disappearance of any threat from Iraq , just what dangers would Saudi Arabia face if it sent say , more than half its supplies to China ?
The States is headed to a lower level of importance in the eyes of Saudi Arabia , but would remain a critically important supplier to the States .
Saudi Arabia certainly would not abandon its U.S. allies , but would control its oil markets with considerably less influence from the States .
A $ oil price to end ?
So with the issue of Saudi Arabia �s security , less important , so the declining importance of the U.S. to Saudi Arabia brings important ramifications .
We refer in particular to the global oil price continuing to be quoted in the U.S. $ .
It will be but a short while before it will be very much to their benefit to have an oil price in a basket of currencies .
The change in the size of Asian clients should make any such transition far easier than it was two years ago and will make it easier by the day !
So the talk of a Persian Gulf currency based on a basket of currencies may well have substance .
Watch this space !
Now take all these changes and what do we have with reference to the gold market and its price ?
In oil terms the U.S. is in economic decline , a China on the rise , [ with India and the rest of Asia ] following behind .
The East buy gold and will do so believing still that it is the money of last resort .
The Oil price will affect the Gold price
The coming massive oil crisis is just over the horizon .
Markets won�t wait until they arrive they discount the changes well ahead of them .
The picture of a swing in wealth and power to the east , from the west is shown by the changing shape of oil demand and supply .
Add to that the crises that always attend such power swings and oil market changes are pointing to the time when gold will hit peak demand and gold price rise to unseen levels .
Then the oil price will influence the gold price as a joint measure of the state of the global monetary scene .

In a move that would shock even the most cynical government observer , the Illinois legislature is poised to add the “ burning of tires ” to a list of renewable energy programs eligible for clean energy credits .
This special treatment for tire incineration is the result of measures put forth by Rep. David Miller ( D ) , who just happens to represent the district where the state ’s sole tire incinerator is located .
That incinerator , Geneva Energy , is located in Ford Heights , one of the poorest neighborhoods in the United States , where more than 95 percent of the population is black and half live in poverty .
The measure , if passed , will allow Geneva Energy to earn valuable green energy credits in return for their burning of tires , a process which releases deadly pollutants , such as benzene , butadiene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .
Of course , the intent of the original legislation was to reward and encourage the production of renewable energy , such as wind and solar .
In Illinois , energy companies must get at least 10 percent of their electricity from green sources by 2015 and 25 percent by 2025 .
While millions of old tires must be disposed of each year , better alternatives to incineration include shredding them for reuse in asphalt , playground cushioning , and athletic tracks , among other things .
Rep .
Miller , who is currently running for state comptroller , has recently removed his name from the bill after a lobbying effort by the Environmental Law and Policy Center ( ELPC ) focused attention on this legislated loop - hole .
“ This is the sort of cynical legislative maneuvering that makes people question the credibility of our elected officials , ” ELPC head Howard Learner stated .
“ Burning tires is not clean , renewable energy by any credible definition . ”
Digital production house Dr. D. Studios is in the early stages of building a supercomputer grid cluster for the rendering of the animated feature film Happy Feet 2 and visual effects in Fury Road the long - anticipated fourth film in the Mad Max series .
The supercompute grid cluster , based on HP blades servers housed within an APC HACS pod , is already running in excess of 1000 cores and is expected to reach over 6000 cores during peak rendering by mid-2011 .
The technical team at Dr D Studios ( which comprises members from the first Happy Feet production ) spent a 20 - hour shift bringing the APC HACS pod into production and the first 1000 cores online last week .
The cluster for the first production was hosted in one of Sydney 's prominent " traditional " data centres .
This cluster boasted 4096 cores , taking it into the top 100 on the list of Top 500 supercomputers in the world in 2007 ( it now sits at 447 ) .
According to Doctor D infrastructure engineering manager James Bourne , " High density compute clusters provide an interesting engineering exercise for all parties involved .
Over the last few years the drive to virtualise is causing data centres to move down a medium density path . "
The sequel to Happy Feet will require more compute power , but will be housed in a smaller configuration of machines thanks to massive advances in compute density over the past five years .
Each cabinet in the new supercompute build has sufficient power and cooling to hold four double - density blade chassis ( 128 nodes ) .
Whilst , the original Happy Feet supercomputer required approximately 150 chassis , Dr D's new machine will be housed within just 24 .
According to Bourne , the demand for higher density computing has increased .
The commoditisation of cluster compute nodes , the storage access layer and network bandwidth combined with the physical consolidation afforded by blade servers and virtualisation has spawned a new market that begs for higher power density hosting .
" We can fit 1000 cores in a rack now , " Bourne said .
" Back [ in 2005 ] , we were working with single - core [ Intel ] Xeons ; as hyperthreading was of little benefit .
Each blade had two cores then - now they have eight - and 16 per node should hyper - threading be turned on .
Memory density has increased as well now from 1.5 GB per node to 24GB . "
Bourne said that the water cooled pod housing the servers - which offers 30 kW of power per rack - was " absolutely essential to get this level of density .
" Some form of targeted liquid cooling is essential for this level of density .
The APC pod gives that and a lot of flexibility . "
" We will be deploying 6,000 cores in a space of no more than 10 x 5 metres , " he said .
Dr D talked to seven data centre providers before hearing of the new build at E3 in Alexandria .
" None of us were too happy about building another cluster in a traditional data centre given their inherent limitations , " Bourne said .
" We even looked at CDC in Canberra , which does high density ; but the communications costs were too high .
At the eleventh hour we heard about the E3 build . "
The E3 data centre is located within reasonable proximity of Global Switch , Equinix and a Dr D. facility at Carriageworks , Redfern - all of which will be connected under a deal with custom ISP Cinenet .
Will it list ?
Bourne is n't confident the new machine will make the world 's Top 500 supercomputer list , at least in the short term .
Today , just to get on the list requires a machine with 8500 cores so the current configuration of 6,000 will fall short .
However , Dr D still has the option , in terms of the floor space , power and cooling available within its suite at E3 to scale the cluster to 12,000 cores if necessary .
Bourne wo n't rule such an expansion out , as he suspects the visual effects job booked in for the new Mad Max film might require more processing power .
" Generally , visual effects are more challenging than animation , " Bourne said .
" Rendered real human environments can be more complex than animated ones - take Avatar as an example . "
Bourne said that the compute needs for filmmaking are always expanding as the studios try to produce bigger and better effects .
An emerging area is research into the applicability of massively parallel computing in generating usable simulations traditionally MPI clusters and now GPU clusters .
" I expect we will need more than 6,000 cores , but it's hard to know at such an early stage in the production " , he said .
SAN FRANCISCO —
On Friday night , more than two dozen Native Americans embarked from here on a spiritual mission to New Zealand , where they will ask their fish to come home to California .
The unusual journey centers on an apology , to be relayed to the fish on the banks of the Rakaia River through a ceremonial dance that tribal leaders say has not been performed in more than 60 years .
The fish in question is the Chinook salmon , native to the Pacific but lately in short supply in the rivers of Northern California , home to the Winnemem Wintu — a tiny , federally unrecognized and poor tribe supported by some Social Security payments , a couple of retirement plans and the occasional dog sale .
As the Winnemem see it , the tribe ’s troubles began in early 1940s , with the completion of the Shasta Dam , which blocked the Sacramento River and cut off the lower McCloud River , obstructing seasonal salmon runs , and according to the tribe , breaking a covenant with the fish .
Sony appears to be working on a new kind of video game demo .
A patent filed by SCEA details a system that gives users a full or nearly complete game to play with , but slowly removes features until you buy it .
The software has customizable triggers that disable features after a set number of plays or lapsed play time .
Let ’s see some theoretical examples of how this could work .
In one scenario your weapon is weakened or replaced with a less powerful one after so many hours playing the game .
Think of it as a timed level down .
Another idea Sony has is to remove levels , race tracks in this example , after you reach a certain number of plays .
When you finally buy the game ( bottom right ) you can use all of the tracks again .
Removing weapons and playable characters are on the table too .
Sony ’s patent also lists subtle ideas such as softening sound effects , changing color depth , and / or brightness as other ways to encourage players to purchase a full version .
In all cases , you can still play the game , just a limited version of it .
The patent says this system is better than current demos because degradable demos can be distributed on physical media and players can see the whole game for a limited amount of time .
In other words , this system is “ nag screen 2.0 ” that can be distributed on a disc and restored with an unlock key .
The Dutch submission to the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai is an exceptional one .
This time around , it will not be the classic pavilion with long lines of visitors waiting outside and a presentation inside .
The Netherlands is making its appearance at China ’s world exposition along an entire street .
The submission , entitled “ Happy Street ” , is the response by designer John Kormeling to the Chinese Expo theme “ Better City , Better Life ” and the sub - themes :
- Urban cultural diversity - Urban economic growth and prosperity - Innovation in science and technology in urban contexts - Remodelling urban communities - Interaction between urban and rural areas .

Centrist Sen. Blanche Lincoln ( Ark. ) on Wednesday asked arguably the most contentious question during a discussion between Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama , hitting at conservatives and liberals .
Lincoln , who faces a tough reelection fight , asked Obama to push back against " people at the extremes " of both parties , especially against Democrats " who want extremes . "
ADVERTISEMENT
She also took a swipe at Obama 's White House , referencing a constituent who " fears that there 's no one in your administration that understands what it means to go to work on Monday and make a payroll on Friday . "
Lincoln faces a steep reelection bid in 2010 .
She trails the likely Republican nominee , Rep. John Boozman , by 23 points and has only a 27 percent approval rating in a recent poll .
Obama responded by defending steps his administration has taken to right the economy and said " Moving forward , Blanche , what you 're going to hear from some folks ...[ is that ] the only way to provide stability is to go back and do what we did before the crisis . "
The president reiterated that he would not return to past policies .
" If the price of certainty is for us to adopt the exact same proposals that were in place for eight years leading up to the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression ... the result is going to be the same . "
But Obama conceded that " Blanche is right that we sometimes get bogged down in ideology . "

There might be a new favorite hang - out for astronauts aboard the International Space Station later this year .
The Multi Purpose Logistics Module ( MPLM ) known as Leonardo – which will be going to the ISS on the upcoming STS - 131 mission carrying cargo and supplies — will be transformed after the mission into a Permanent Multipurpose Module ( PMM ) , and brought up to stay on the station on STS - 133 as a storeroom for supplies .
But it might also become a haven to get away from it all .
“ The thought is , the PMM might become sort of a ‘ man cave ’ , ” said Mike Kinslow , the Boeing payload manager out at Kennedy Space Center .
“ It wo n’t have all the background noise of fans , computers and other equipment running like in the laboratories , so it will be a quieter atmosphere that might appeal to the astronauts during their off - duty hours . ”
No plans for a big screen TV Kinslow said , but there will be ports for computers , and since internet is now available on the ISS , Leonardo could be the location of choice to compose emails to loved ones back home , or do a little Twittering .
Another interesting piece of hardware scheduled to fly on the PMM is the Robonaut 2 , NASA ’s second generation of dexterous robots with a human - like torso that can work with tools and one day are envisioned to be able to do EVA work outside the ISS .
But for now , R2 will be tested inside the station in zero -g .
“ It will be used on orbit for routine maintenance indoors only . ” said Kinslow , “ This is not an external unit . ”
It has a “ head ” with a vision system , with hands that can do work , controlled by virtual - reality - like operation .
Any chance R2 could be programmed to serve drinks or bring food into the man cave ?
See our article on how General Motors is going to use R2 for manufacturing cars .
Turning Leonardo into a permanent module will take some work , said NASA Payload Manager Joe Delai .
“ Once it returns from this flight we will beef up the external shield and change things internally to become a permanent module .
It will be about a four month process to get it ready . ”
The MPLMs were built in Italy , but are owned by the U.S. and provided in exchange for Italian access to U.S. research time on the Station .
Four modules were built ; three flew to the ISS .
STS - 131 will be Leonardo ’s seventh trip to space .
Kinslow said shields for an MPLM are lighter weight because they are only meant to be on orbit for 2 weeks at a time .
“ Leonardo will be plated with a multilevel Kevlar blanket , the same type of exterior shielding other modules have , which is similar to armor plating , to protect against meteorite or debris impact .
Internally , not a lot of changes will be made , ” he said .
“ It already has a ventilation system like a normal module , but will need a computer system and a few other additions . ”
Leonardo wo n’t be outfitted with a sleep station or crew quarters because it might be in a more vulnerable position for radiation or debris hits .
“ They do n’t really want crew to get in and sleep because of the shielding , ” Kinslow said .
“ It will be a storage module , and we ’re discussing putting exercise equipment in there . ”
The PMM will be berthed on the Node 1 nadir , or Earth - facing port .
Leonardo measures about 6.5 meters ( 21 feet ) long and 4.5 meters ( 15 feet ) in diameter .
STS - 131 is currently scheduled for an April 5 launch , and STS - 133 is shooting for a September 2010 launch .
Just a note on the ISS internet : T.J. Creamer , who is on board the station now told Universe Today that they are n’t able to have streaming video or download large files .
“ In terms of download speeds – you know , back in the old days , it kind of compares to 9.6 and the 14.4 kilobyte modems , so it ’s not really fast enough to do large file exchange or videos , but it certainly lets us to do browsing and the fun reading we want to do , or get caught up on current events on that day .
It ’s a nice outreach for us , and of course you ’ve heard about the Twittering which is a nice feature that we can partake in also . ”
Traffic came to a halt as the youngsters began pelting cars , pedestrians and one another with snowballs , Ondrejka said .
They knocked down numerous bystanders and some members of the mob even turned on each other .
Philadelphia police and several SEPTA cops swarmed the scene and collared 15 participants - 14 boys and one girl - near City Hall , Ondrejka noted .

Got an intriguing email from a knowledgeable source very familiar with search dynamics involving Apple , Microsoft and Yahoo for that matter .
First point :
When Microsoft released its Bing app for iPhone , it became the company 's best mobile search by volume of queries , better than the traffic Verizon Wireless drives to Microsoft , and Bing is already the default the search engine across that network .
Second point :
This source says " Jobs hates Eric . "
Third point :
Every time you do a Google search from Apple 's iPhone Safari and a user clicks an ad , Apple gets a payment .
Microsoft , this source tells me , is willing to throw much more money to Apple to ensure that they displace Google as the default engine .
If that 's the case , it is an absolutely key point to getting a deal done , and if Microsoft is already venturing down that path , then these talks may be much , much further along than my Apple source earlier today suggested .
Fourth point :
Along those lines , this source tells me the discussions between Microsoft and Apple have been ongoing since the October / November time frame .
Lastly , this source tells me that Jobs may not like Microsoft products , but that does n't mean he 's " anti-Microsoft . "
Remember a little history here , that Microsoft helped bail out Apple way back when , still provides Microsoft Office for the Mac platform , and even the original browser for the iMac in Internet Explorer .
" Steve understands that Bing will give him a Search API where he can integrate search results deeper and deeper in the product without having to see the Bing web page and user - interface , " says this source .
Further , this source tells me that Jobs " cannot and will not build a search engine " of his own .
The amount of expertise you need to build relevance is simply not what Apple wants to do , he argues .
Apple , he says , wants to inject its own ads into Maps , Weather , Stocks and Search results , so , getting a Search API from Microsoft is really what Apple wants .
I 'm not sure about that .
I 'm hearing that Apple is in fact working on a search platform of its own so it can control the entire eco-system .
I 'd be surprised if Apple cedes this part of the business -- especially with Google lurking -- to a partnership with Microsoft .
All interesting points .
And the discussion continues …

Lord Baden - Powell , the founder of the Boy Scouts , responded enthusiastically to a Nazi charm offensive aimed at aligning his movement with the Hitler Youth in the run-up to the Second World War , according to secret MI5 documents .
The colonial warrior , whose best - selling military training manuals started the Scouting phenomenon , was wined and dined by senior Hitler Youth figures and Joachim von Ribbentrop , the German ambassador to Britain , who made a lengthy plea in 1937 for the two organisations to be put in " closer touch " .
The proposed alliance between the Scouts and the Hitler Youth , whose members were indoctrinated in anti-Semitism and told they would become " Aryan supermen " , coincided with growing alarm in MI5 at a sudden influx of uniformed German youngsters taking part in pre-war cycling tours around Britain .
Amid newspaper warnings that the touring parties of Hitler Youth were " spyclists " gathering information on Britain 's infrastructure , the head of the security service ordered police and Special Branch officers to report on the activities of the two - wheeled " fifth columnists " as they made their way around Britain from Surrey to Aberdeen and were treated to " sausage and mashed potato " suppers by Rotary Clubs and Scouts groups .
The documents , released by the National Archives in Kew , Surrey , reveal Baden - Powell 's enthusiasm for the brown - shirted Hitler Youth during a visit to London by Hartmann Lauterbacher , the chief of staff of the Nazi organisation , in November 1937 .
Noting approvingly that Lauterbacher , whose visit included tours of Eton and an Army physical training school , wanted to build strong ties between the British and German youth movements , Baden - Powell spoke in glowing terms of Von Ribbentrop , the senior Nazi who became the architect of Hitler 's foreign policy .
In an internal Scout Association memo obtained by MI5 about a dinner with Von Ribbentrop at the German embassy , Baden - Powell wrote : " I had a long talk with the Ambassador who was very insistent that true peace between the two nations will depend on the youth being brought up on friendly terms together in forgetfulness of past differences .
" He sees in the Scout Movement a very powerful agency for helping to bring this about if we can get into closer touch with the Jugend Movement in Germany .
I told him that I was fully in favour of anything that would bring about a better understanding between our nations . "
Baden - Powell , who later read Mein Kampf and praised it is as a " wonderful book " , added that Von Ribbentrop had invited him to visit Hitler and he had lifted a ban on Scouts wearing their uniforms while visiting Germany in the hope that British youngsters would head off on visits to the Third Reich .
But in reality , the ageing Chief Scout , who died in 1941 aged 83 , had fallen for an exercise in Nazi duplicity .
While Von Ribbentrop was outwardly enthusiastic about an Anglo - German alliance , he had soured dramatically towards Britain and was privately advising Hitler of the inevitability of war with London .
By the time of the outbreak of hostilities , Baden - Powell featured in the Black Book – the SS masterlist of people to be arrested if Germany successfully invaded Britain .
The documents show that while Baden - Powell was receptive to the overtures of the Nazis , MI5 felt obliged to investigate public concerns about the sudden appearance of Hitler Youth in the UK .
Reports from Special Branch officers detail the movements of cycling parties in locations from Caernarfon to Spalding and Harwich to Aberdeen to assess whether they were on a clandestine intelligence operation .
Public suspicion was heightened when the magazine German Cyclist offered some advice on what its members might do while riding abroad .
It said : " Impress on your memory the roads and paths , villages and towns , outstanding church towers and other landmarks ...
Note the names , places , rivers , seas and mountains .
Perhaps you may be able to utilise these some time for the benefit of the Fatherland .
" Should you come to a bridge which interests you , examine its construction and the materials used .
Learn to measure and estimate the width of streams .
Wade through fords so that you will be able to find them in the dark . "
The secret files suggest that no evidence was found of espionage by the Hitler Youth but also record how the British government " strongly deprecated " any entente cordiale with the Scouts .
An intelligence manual issued to MI5 and MI6 agents in 1944 , warned : " The Hitler Youth is not a Boy Scout organisation .
It is in no respect comparable to any organisation for young people known to the Western World .
" It is a compulsory Nazi formation , which has consciously sought to breed hate , treachery and cruelty in the mind and soul of every German child .
It is , in the true sense of the word , ' education for death ' . "

Other new revelations from Kew
Too drunk to be a threat to security
* Brendan Behan , the Irish playwright and some - time IRA activist , made no secret of his liking for a tipple .
As he put it : " I only drink on two occasions – when I am thirsty and when I 'm not . "
According to his secret MI5 dossier , his opinion of himself as a drunk was shared by the British Security Service as it tracked his activities from an attempt to murder two Irish police officers at the age of 19 to his response a decade later when he was arrested at Newhaven docks that : " I will explain everything , but not now as I am suffering from a hangover " .
The file released at the National Archives in Kew , west London , shows that MI5 officers reached the conclusion that the maverick Irish wit and raconteur was such a boozer that he was not a serious threat .
Behan , who died at the age of 41 and was best known for his play the The Quare Fellow and his book Borstal Boy , spent eight years in prison for a series of IRA attacks carried out when he was a young man , including an unauthorised solo mission to blow up Liverpool docks .
His record of violence meant MI5 watched him for the rest of his life even though he apparently halted his attacks in 1947 .
But his personal file , which details how his post was intercepted and his phone calls tapped , shows that the Security Service quickly reached the conclusion that Behan 's dissolute behaviour meant he was a danger only to himself .
One report , dated June 1956 , stated : " The attached note on Brendan Behan may possibly be of interest .
Source considers that as an individual he is too unstable and too drunken to be particularly dangerous . "
Another document summarises a telephone call between Behan and Communist Party organiser Barbara Niven in August 1957 in which the playwright said he was " where he always was – he was not an English man , he was a communist ; the comrades did not always agree with him " .
The MI5 officer noted : " I assumed from the above conversation that Brendan was either a little mad or drunk . "
' A potential menace wherever she was '
* A glamorous suspected Nazi agent caused a scandal when she developed a " most undesirable familiarity " with British intelligence officers in wartime Cairo .
One married officer asked Sophie Kukralova to be his wife and a second threatened to have her arrested as a spy unless she slept with him , according to declassified MI5 documents .
Kukralova was arrested and interned by the British in Palestine during the war after arousing suspicion for her close interest in military matters , unexplained wealth and claims of top - level links to the Nazi regime .
A March 1944 report to MI5 noted : " With her cosmopolitan and unscrupulous character , her interest in espionage , her unusual knowledge of armaments and military affairs , Sophie would , if released , be a potential menace to security wherever she was . "
The Obama administration ’s plan adopts some drilling proposals floated by President George W. Bush near the end of his tenure , including opening much of the Atlantic and Arctic Coasts .
Those proposals were challenged in court on environmental grounds and set aside by President Obama shortly after he took office .
Unlike the Bush plan , however , Mr. Obama ’s proposal would put Bristol Bay , home to major Alaskan commercial fisheries and populations of endangered whales , off limits to oil rigs .
Actual drilling in much of the newly opened areas , if it takes place , would not begin for years .
Mr. Obama said several times during his presidential campaign that he supported expanded offshore drilling .
He noted in his State of the Union address in January that weaning the country from imported oil would require “ tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development . ”
Perhaps in anticipation of controversy , the new policy has been closely held within the administration .
White House and Interior Department officials began briefing members of Congress and local officials in affected states late Tuesday .
It is not known how much potential fuel lies in the areas opened to exploration , although according to Interior Department estimates there could be as much as a three - year supply of recoverable oil and more than two years ’ worth of natural gas , at current rates of consumption .
But those estimates are based on seismic data that is , in some cases , more than 30 years old .
The first lease sale off the coast of Virginia could occur as early as next year in a triangular tract 50 miles off the coast that had already been approved for development but was held up by a court challenge and additional Interior Department review , officials said .
But as a result of the Obama decision , the Interior Department will spend several years conducting geologic and environmental studies along the rest of the southern and central Atlantic Seaboard .
If a tract is deemed suitable for development , it is listed for sale in a competitive bidding system .
The next lease sales — if any are authorized by the Interior Department — would not be held before 2012 .
Nuclear Disarmament The Missile Shield Deadlock between the US and Russia
The US and Russia are currently negotiating a successor to the START nuclear disarmament treaty .
But continued American plans for a missile shield in Europe have proven to be a major stumbling block .
President Obama 's vision of a nuclear - free world is in danger .

The American Civil Liberties Union sued state prison officials and a private company Thursday , claiming violence is so rampant at the Idaho Correctional Center that it ’s known as “ gladiator school ” among inmates .
The ACLU filed the lawsuit against Nashville , Tennessee - based Corrections Corp. of America in U.S. District Court in Boise .
The lawsuit says Idaho ’s only private prison is extraordinarily violent , with guards deliberately exposing inmates to brutal beatings from other prisoners as a management tool .

The group contends the prison then denies injured inmates medical care to save money and hide the extent of injuries .
Steve Owen , the company ’s director of public affairs , said it had not yet been served with the lawsuit and was reserving comment .
Steven Conry , company vice president of facility operations , previously maintained the prison is a safe and well - run facility .
Idaho Department of Correction Director Brent Reinke also said he had not yet seen the lawsuit and could not immediately comment .
Stephen Pevar , senior attorney for the ACLU , said he has sued at least 100 jails and prisons , but none came close to the level of violence at Idaho Correctional Center .
“ Our country should be ashamed to send human beings to that facility , ” he said .

The ACLU is asking for class - action status and $ 155 million in punitive damages — the entire net profit reported by the company in 2009 .
The ACLU says the money should go to lead plaintiff Marlin Riggs , who sustained permanent facial deformities and other medical problems after he was savagely beaten in his cell .
Guards use violence to control prisoner behavior , forcing inmates to “ snitch ” on other inmates under the threat of moving them to the most violent sections of the prison , ACLU - Idaho executive director Monica Hopkins says .

Hopkins says inmates will be beaten by fellow inmates if they become known as a snitch .
If they refuse to give up names , the guards will have them beaten anyway , she says .
“ It does n’t do us any good as a society to put people in there where they have to turn to other gangs and become gang members to protect themselves , ” she said .
“ The thing is , there ’s a constitutional duty to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners . ”

The lawsuit also refers to an investigation by The Associated Press based on public records requests that found the level of violence at the prison was three times higher than other Idaho prisons , and that Idaho Department of Correction officials believed it was also dramatically underreported by Corrections Corp. of America and inmates .
At the time of that report , Conry maintained the prison is safe and well run .
The Idaho Correctional Center houses about 2,000 prisoners .
The ACLU contends it is understaffed , with sometimes only two guards on duty to control prison wings with more than 350 inmates .

The ACLU lawsuit details the inmate - on - inmate attacks of about two dozen men , all of whom say they told guards they were in danger of being assaulted , had been assaulted or needed medical care after an assault .
In all the cases , the ACLU contends the men were summarily denied help .
Riggs , the lead plaintiff in the case , claimed members of a violent gang on his cell block told him in May 2008 that he’d be beaten unless he started paying “ rent ” to the gang .
He said in the lawsuit he told correctional officers about the threat and begged to be transferred to another cellblock , but the guards refused .

Riggs managed to call his family that day and tell them about the threats .
But within moments of the phone call , Riggs says he was beaten by inmates , knocked down and kicked repeatedly in the face and torso .
The beating was so bad , the ACLU contends , that blood was spattered on the ceiling of Riggs ’ cell and pooled on the floor .
Guards eventually intervened and took Riggs to an infirmary where a doctor told him his nose was broken and tried to reset it .
However , the doctor refused to take X - rays and ignored several other broken bones in his face , the lawsuit claims .
Riggs was denied medical care for six months before being taken to an ear , nose and throat specialist , who said he needed immediate surgery , according to the lawsuit .

He ended up with a plate in his cheek , pins in his jaw and a permanent dent on the side of his face , and still suffers from blurry vision , headaches , pain , discomfort and mental trauma , the suit states .
A Federal judge has dismissed a complaint against the National Security Agency 's ( NSA ) Bush - era warrantless wiretapping programme , prompting suggestions the US government is now able to mount mass surveillance operations unhindered by the courts or constitution .
Five AT&T customers sued the NSA after it emerged it had persuaded the telco to provide a wiretap in a major internet traffic exchange in San Francisco .
The five claimed the programme , revealed by an AT&T whistleblower , had violated privacy laws .
Late on Thursday , Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that because the internet traffic of millions of Americans had been caught up in the dragnet , the harm alleged in the complaint was not specific to the plaintiffs , so the case should not proceed .
" The court has determined that neither group of plaintiffs / purported class representatives has alleged an injury that is sufficiently particular to those plaintiffs or to a distinct group to which those plaintiffs belong ; rather , the harm alleged is a generalized grievance shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens , " wrote the Judge .
The government had also argued that the case should be dismissed because it would use its state secrets privilege to withold the necessary evidence , but the court did not rule on whether that was allowed .
Barack Obama was criticised by civil liberties groups early in his presidency for authorising his attorney general to use the secrecy privilege , a tactic planned by Bush administration lawyers .
The Elecronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , whose lawyers brought the case in 2008 , expressed deep disappointment .
" This ruling robs innocent telecom customers of their privacy rights without due process of law .
Setting limits on Executive power is one of the most important elements of America 's system of government , and judicial oversight is a critical part of that , " said EFF legal director Cindy Cohn .
The group said it would appeal against the dismissal .
The full ruling is here ( pdf ) .
Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , the NSA must get a warrant from a special secret court to carry out domestic wiretapping .
In the wake of 9/11 , however , Dick Cheney authorised it to harvest , analyse and store vast quantities of domestic communications without a FISA warrant .
Mark Klein , an AT&T engineer at the time , revealed that the San Francisco switching hub he worked at had a secret room where NSA staff operated .
In 2008 , FISA was altered to grant AT&T and other participating telcos immunity from court action . ®
great Vid ... definitely worth watching .

Update at bottom :
Ten US states to file suit against health care reform
Ca n’t block health care reform in Congress ?
Sue .
That ’s the strategy that ’s been outlined by Virginia state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli , who confirmed Sunday that he will sue to block health care reform from becoming law .
Reports the Richmond Times - Dispatch :
Virgina will file suit against the federal government charging that the health - care reform legislation is unconstitutional , Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli ’s office confirmed last night .
Cuccinelli is expected to argue that the bill , with its mandate that requires nearly every American to be insured by 2014 , violates the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution .
The attorney general ’s office will file suit once President Barack Obama signs the bill into law , which could occur early this week .
“ At no time in our history has the government mandated its citizens buy a good or service , ” Cuccinelli said in a statement last night .
ADVERTISEMENT
Cuccinelli announced his intentions through a spokesman last Wednesday .
In a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi last week , Virginia ’s top lawyer warned Democrats of using the “ deem and pass ” approach , which would not have permitted a freestanding vote on the Senate - passed health care reform bill — a measure Democrats did n’t ultimately embrace .
But Cuccinelli plans to sue anyway .
Cuccinelli has already been the source of political controversy this year for removing sexual orientation from the state ’s non-discrimination policies .
Virginia is n’t the only Republican state that is considering lawsuits to combat Democrats ’ passage of health reform .
Prominent Republican lawyers have said legal arguments are already being drafted to throw Washington into a legal battle if health care reform passes Congress .
“ Deem and pass ” was front and center of the debate .
“ There is a lot of discussion among various lawyers and we ’ve had some conference calls , ” said Cleta Mitchell , a Washington attorney long active in GOP circles .
“ People are just distraught that the Democrats are even contemplating doing something like this .
It ’s utter lawlessness to deem a bill passed without voting for it .
It ’s horrific . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Legally , the rule is somewhat of a gray area in politics .
But Tim Jost , a law professor at Washington & Lee University , believes the health care bill would be perfectly legitimate even if Democrats were forced to use “ deem and pass . ”
“ The Constitution says that each house can write its own rules .
Those rules are up to Congress to adopt and they ’re not going to be second - guessed by the courts , ” said Tim Jost , a law professor at Washington & Lee University .
“ As long as there is a vote on the language of the Senate bill , however they go about doing this , then the Senate bill is adopted by the house and they ’ve met the requirements of the Constitution . ”

Ten US states to file suit against health care reform
WASHINGTON ( AFP ) – Ten US states plan to file a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of health care reform as soon as President Barack Obama signs it into law , Florida ’s attorney general said Monday .
ADVERTISEMENT
Republican Bill McCollum , who is running for governor in the upcoming November mid-term elections , led the charge to challenge a provision which would require most people to buy health insurance or else pay a fine .
He is joined by the Republican attorneys general of South Carolina , Nebraska , Texas , Utah , Pennsylvania , Washington , North Dakota , South Dakota and Alabama .
“ The health care reform legislation passed by the US House of Representatives this last night clearly violates the US Constitution and infringes on each state ’s sovereignty , ” McCollum said in a statement .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If the President signs this bill into law , we will file a lawsuit to protect the rights and the interests of American citizens . ”
Obama ’s Republican foes have waged a political war on the historic health care overhaul and have vowed to repeal it should they retake the House and Senate seeking an edge in November mid-term elections .
The governor of Idaho signed a bill last week blocking federal mandates requiring individuals in his state to purchase health insurance .
Some 38 states have either filed or announced their intention to file similar legislation , according to the American Legislative Exchange Council , which opposes the health reform bill .

The Netherlands ' biggest cannabis - selling coffee shop has been fined almost $ 15 million for breaching the country 's relatively lax drug laws .
A Dutch court fined the owner of Amsterdam 's Checkpoint cafe after police seized more than 200 kilograms of cannabis on the premises .
Licensed cafes are only allowed to stock half a kilogram of cannabis under Netherlands law , a limit often flouted .
The Dutch court said the $ 14.7 million fine would have been higher had it not been for a lax approach to the sales and use of soft drugs .
It said authorities had known for years about the thousands of people visiting Checkpoint , but did not act .
Sentences for other workers and suppliers ranged from warnings to those who rolled joints to six - week jail terms .
Ruthless in its simplicity .
Diabolical in its detail .
And so , so much fun watching coworkers yell " COLLATE " for hours on end .

Southwest Airlines planes prepare for departure from Oakland International Airport in Oakland , California in this May 29 , 2006 , file image .
REUTERS / John Gress
( Reuters ) - A government watchdog faulted the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) for allowing Southwest Airlines
Co to fly jets that had not undergone mandatory maintenance work , violating stipulated safety rules , the Wall Street Journal said .
The Office of Special Counsel said on Thursday that the company failed to complete certain required maintenance involving rivets around the window frames of 55 of its Boeing 737 aircraft , the paper said , citing the counsel ’s documents .
Southwest voluntarily disclosed the information to a senior FAA inspector who was also a supervisor in the local office charged with overseeing the airline , the Journal said .
But the inspector did not determine why the company had never completed the repair work or ensure that the necessary maintenance work was eventually completed , the paper added .
“ These issues have been previously addressed through comprehensive audits by the FAA ... our own audits , and work by outside consultants , ” a Southwest spokesperson told the paper .
The spokesperson told the paper that the airline officials “ are confident that we have identified and remedied the issues . ”
“ A second investigation has shown that some FAA managers continue their willingness to look the other way ” rather than enforce strict compliance with maintenance requirements and voluntary disclosure rules , the paper said , quoting Associate Special Counsel William Reukauf .
Southwest Airlines and the FAA could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours .

Lastly , and most least , here is some guy ’s Lego - themed play on how it would turn out if Indiana Jones replaced Short Round .
Here ’s another take on this :
After several weeks of speculation , that its digital distribution service for games , Steam , would be coming to Macs .
The software serves as Valve 's exclusive digital delivery system for its suite of titles , including Team Fortress 2 and Portal , as well as an array of AAA titles from publishers like EA , Activision , Capcom and more .
According to the announcement from Valve , the Mac variation of Steam will serve native Mac software , not inconsistent , processor - taxing emulators .
The announcement of Steam for Mac marks a huge advancement for gaming on Apple computers , which had otherwise been perceived to be poor gaming machines .
Could this be the dawn of Mac gaming as a viable software platform ?
As it currently stands , the number of developers that produce games either exclusively for Mac , or simultaneously with Windows versions , is extremely limited .
Among those who produce titles for Mac are Blizzard and , curiously enough , Microsoft , but their efforts are clearly more focused on Windows products .
Alternatively , developers have sought third - party porting services to bring their titles to Mac , although such services are inefficient due to release delays , licensing and technical issues .
Apple gained some ground in the gaming space with the inclusion of Boot Camp , which allows for the partitioned use of Windows in their latest , Intel - powered machines .
While Boot Camp essentially allows
Mac owners the ability to play any Windows game , it requires the purchase of a full Windows OS and a partitioned reboot of their system – far from an ideal solution
Why are games for Mac so hard to find ?
One argument has been that Apple machines are underpowered , so much so that they can't run complex 3D games .
While that may have been true in the past , nothing could be further from the truth today .
Apple laptops and computers are powered by integrated and dedicated graphics processors from NVIDIA , ranging from the 9400 M in MacBook Pros to ATI Radeon 4670 in the Mac Pro towers .
The other , more accurate , argument is that Mac operating systems command a comparably small global market share of roughly five percent .
While five percent of a global demographic is nothing to scoff at , committing resources to tailor content to an even smaller subset of users within that minority can be tough to justify .
Retailers also recognize the smaller market impact of Mac games , and have subsequently limited retail placement for Mac titles , ported or otherwise .
Without a sizable distribution structure , outside of Apple itself , of course , sales of Mac games are understandably low .
Steam could be the key to expanding the Mac platform .
Valve will be taking the first step by offering their largest titles in native Apple formats when the service arrives in April , but they 'll also be following it with the day one , cross - platform release of Portal 2 this Fall .
But Valve 's strategy goes beyond offering content and a method of delivery on Macs , they are taking an aggressive value - added approach by offering cross-platform purchases and multiplayer integration .
In other words , when you download a game on Steam for Mac , the Windows version will also be available to you free of charge and you will be able to play multiplayer games with friends who use Windows machines on your Mac .
As has always been the case , the success of Mac gaming relies on the efforts of publishers , but with Steam , they have a new , direct method of delivery that could turn the tide .
Because every Friday for the past two years the best place to meet and chat with the Portland tech community has been Beer and Blog , a gathering of bloggers helping bloggers over beers that has steadily grown to become the de facto happy hour for the Portland startup and tech scene .
[ HTML1 ]
Whenever I hear about tech types from out of town swinging by Portland , the first question out of my mouth is always — always — this : “ Any chance you ’re going to be here on Friday ? ”
Why ?
Because every Friday for the past two years the best place to meet and chat with the Portland tech community — as a community — has been Beer and Blog , a gathering with humble beginnings as an ad hoc support group of bloggers helping bloggers over beers that has steadily grown to become the de facto happy hour for the Portland startup and tech scene — whether you happen to blog or not .
And now , that little happy hour is all growed up in Internet years .
Beer and Blog is celebrating its second anniversary today .
They ’ve accomplished a ton over the past year .
Making sure people had blogs , helping people find jobs , lining up sponsors so attendees could have some freebies .
And I ’d also personally like to take the time , once again , to thank all of the Beer and Blog organizers and regulars for their help with 30 hour day .
There were many many families who had a very happy holiday thanks to your efforts and generosity .
We could n’t have done it without you .
So thank you .
Back to our heroes .
Now , to celebrate their success , they ’re stepping it up by having a Sexy Nurd do a set and more .
SexyNerd is such a rock star that the paparazzi will be there , of course , to capture him mingling with us beer and bloggers .
Pose with SexyNurd in your best Sexy or Nurd and you ’ll end up in the tabloids and on the SexyNurd blog .
You ’ve been warned !
This is just the beginning of another great year for Beer and Blog .
And there are already some pretty interesting events slated , including — word around the campfire says — a visit from the Mayor .
So take off work a bit early and head down to the Green Dragon .
It ’s been a really productive first week .
You deserve it .
And go spend some time getting reacquainted with the Portland tech community you know and love .
It ’s going to be a good year .
You ’re going to be seeing a lot of these folks do a lot of great things .

Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told the American Israel Public Affairs Council on Monday that “ Jerusalem is not a settlement . ”
He continued that the historical connection between the Jewish people and the land of Israel can not be denied .
He added that neither could the historical connection between the Jewish people and Jerusalem .
He insisted , “ The Jewish people were building Jerusalem 3,000 years ago and the Jewish people are building Jerusalem today . ”
He said , “ Jerusalem is not a settlement .
It is our capital . ”
He told his applauding audience of 7500 that he was simply following the policies of all Israeli governments since the 1967 conquest of Jerusalem in the Six Day War .
Netanyahu mixed together Romantic - nationalist cliches with a series of historically false assertions .
But even more important was everything he left out of the history , and his citation of his warped and inaccurate history instead of considering laws , rights or common human decency toward others not of his ethnic group .
So here are the reasons that Netanyahu is profoundly wrong , and East Jerusalem does not belong to him .
1 . In international law , East Jerusalem is occupied territory , as are the parts of the West Bank that Israel unilaterally annexed to its district of Jerusalem .
The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Hague Regulations of 1907 forbid occupying powers to alter the lifeways of civilians who are occupied , and forbid the settling of people from the occupiers ’ country in the occupied territory .
Israel ’s expulsion of Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem , its usurpation of Palestinian property there , and its settling of Israelis on Palestinian land are all gross violations of international law .
Israeli claims that they are not occupying Palestinians because the Palestinians have no state are cruel and tautological .
Israeli claims that they are building on empty territory are laughable .
My back yard is empty , but that does not give Netanyahu the right to put up an apartment complex on it .
2. Israeli governments have not in fact been united or consistent about what to do with East Jerusalem and the West Bank , contrary to what Netanyahu says .
The Galili Plan for settlements in the West Bank was adopted only in 1973 .
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin gave undertakings as part of the Oslo Peace Process to withdraw from Palestinian territory and grant Palestinians a state , promises for which he was assassinated by the Israeli far right ( elements of which are now supporting Netanyahu ’s government ) .
As late as 2000 , then Prime Minister Ehud Barak claims that he gave oral assurances that Palestinians could have almost all of the West Bank and could have some arrangement by which East Jerusalem could be its capital .
Netanyahu tried to give the impression that far rightwing Likud policy on East Jerusalem and the West Bank has been shared by all previous Israeli governments , but this is simply not true .
3. Romantic nationalism imagines a “ people ” as eternal and as having an eternal connection with a specific piece of land .
This way of thinking is fantastic and mythological .
Peoples are formed and change and sometimes cease to be , though they might have descendants who abandoned that religion or ethnicity or language .
Human beings have moved all around and are not directly tied to any territory in an exclusive way , since many groups have lived on most pieces of land .
Jerusalem was not founded by Jews , i.e. adherents of the Jewish religion .
It was founded between 3000 BCE and 2600 BCE by a West Semitic people or possibly the Canaanites , the common ancestors of Palestinians , Lebanese , many Syrians and Jordanians , and many Jews .
But when it was founded Jews did not exist .
4. Jerusalem was founded in honor of the ancient god Shalem .
It does not mean City of Peace but rather ‘ built - up place of Shalem . ”
5 . The “ Jewish people ” were not building Jerusalem 3000 years ago , i.e. 1000 BCE .
First of all , it is not clear when exactly Judaism as a religion centered on the worship of the one God took firm form .
It appears to have been a late development since no evidence of worship of anything but ordinary Canaanite deities has been found in archeological sites through 1000 BCE .
There was no invasion of geographical Palestine from Egypt by former slaves in the 1200s BCE .
The pyramids had been built much earlier and had not used slave labor .
The chronicle of the events of the reign of Ramses II on the wall in Luxor does not know about any major slave revolts or flights by same into the Sinai peninsula .
Egyptian sources never heard of Moses or the 10 plagues & etc. Jews and Judaism emerged from a certain social class of Canaanites over a period of centuries inside Palestine .
( See Daniel Lazare ’s Harper ’s article on the archeological disproof of the Bible , preserved at this website ( I am not endorsing the web site ) .
6. Jerusalem not only was not being built by the likely then non-existent “ Jewish people ” in 1000 BCE , but Jerusalem probably was not even inhabited at that point in history .
Jerusalem appears to have been abandoned between 1000 BCE and 900 BCE , the traditional dates for the united kingdom under David and Solomon .
So Jerusalem was not ‘ the city of David , ’ since there was no city when he is said to have lived .
No sign of magnificent palaces or great states has been found in the archeology of this period , and the Assyrian tablets , which recorded even minor events throughout the Middle East , such as the actions of Arab queens , do n’t know about any great kingdom of David and Solomon in geographical Palestine .
7 . Since archeology does not show the existence of a Jewish kingdom or kingdoms in the so - called First Temple Period , it is not clear when exactly the Jewish people would have ruled Jerusalem except for the Hasmonean Kingdom .
The Assyrians conquered Jerusalem in 722 .
The Babylonians took it in 597 and ruled it until they were themselves conquered in 539 BCE by the Achaemenids of ancient Iran , who ruled Jerusalem until Alexander the Great took the Levant in the 330s BCE .
Alexander ’s descendants , the Ptolemies ruled Jerusalem until 198 when Alexander ’s other descendants , the Seleucids , took the city .
With the Maccabean Revolt in 168 BCE , the Jewish Hasmonean kingdom did rule Jerusalem until 37 BCE , though Antigonus II Mattathias , the last Hasmonean , only took over Jerusalem with the help of the Parthian dynasty in 40 BCE .
Herod ruled 37 BCE until the Romans conquered what they called Palestine in 6 CE ( CE= ‘ Common Era ’ or what Christians call AD ) .
The Romans and then the Eastern Roman Empire of Byzantium ruled Jerusalem from 6 CE until 614 CE when the Iranian Sasanian Empire Conquered it , ruling until 629 CE when the Byzantines took it back .
The Muslims conquered Jerusalem in 638 and ruled it until 1099 when the Crusaders conquered it .
The Crusaders killed or expelled Jews and Muslims from the city .
The Muslims under Saladin took it back in 1187 CE and allowed Jews to return , and Muslims ruled it until the end of World War I , or altogether for about 1192 years .
Adherents of Judaism did not found Jerusalem .
It existed for perhaps 2700 years before anything we might recognize as Judaism arose .
Jewish rule may have been no longer than 170 years or so , i.e. , the kingdom of the Hasmoneans .
8 . Therefore if historical building of Jerusalem and historical connection with Jerusalem establishes sovereignty over it as Netanyahu claims , here are the groups that have the greatest claim to the city :
A. The Muslims , who ruled it and built it over 1191 years .
B. The Egyptians , who ruled it as a vassal state for several hundred years in the second millennium BCE .
C. The Italians , who ruled it about 444 years until the fall of the Roman Empire in 450 CE .
D. The Iranians , who ruled it for 205 years under the Achaemenids , for three years under the Parthians ( insofar as the last Hasmonean was actually their vassal ) , and for 15 years under the Sasanids .
E. The Greeks , who ruled it for over 160 years if we count the Ptolemys and Seleucids as Greek .
If we count them as Egyptians and Syrians , that would increase the Egyptian claim and introduce a Syrian one .
F . The successor states to the Byzantines , which could be either Greece or Turkey , who ruled it 188 years , though if we consider the heir to be Greece and add in the time the Hellenistic Greek dynasties ruled it , that would give Greece nearly 350 years as ruler of Jerusalem .
G. There is an Iraqi claim to Jerusalem based on the Assyrian and Babylonian conquests , as well as perhaps the rule of the Ayyubids ( Saladin ’s dynasty ) , who were Kurds from Iraq .
9 . Of course , Jews are historically connected to Jerusalem by the Temple , whenever that connection is dated to .
But that link mostly was pursued when Jews were not in political control of the city , under Iranian , Greek and Roman rule .
It can not therefore be deployed to make a demand for political control of the whole city .
10 . The Jews of Jerusalem and the rest of Palestine did not for the most part leave after the failure of the Bar Kochba revolt against the Romans in 136 CE .
They continued to live there and to farm in Palestine under Roman rule and then Byzantine .
They gradually converted to Christianity .
After 638 CE all but 10 percent gradually converted to Islam .
The present - day Palestinians are the descendants of the ancient Jews and have every right to live where their ancestors have lived for centuries .

TBILISI , Georgia , March 15 ( UPI ) --
A fake television report of a Russian military invasion sparked widespread panic in Georgia and puts the country 's anti-Russian President Mikhail Saakashvili under pressure .
Georgians turning on TV sets Saturday evening were greeted with what appeared to be a frightening breaking news report -- state - owned Imedi TV said the Russians had invaded .
Advertisement
The report , introduced by a concerned - looking host , showed images of Russian fighter jets thundering over the border and tanks rolling toward Tbilisi .
The host said Saakashvili had been killed .
The report sparked immediate panic -- too fresh were the memories of a real conflict between the countries 18 months ago .
Georgians left their homes , the cell phone network collapsed as worried parents tried to call their children , and families packed their belongings , ready to flee the country .
They need n't have worried :
The report , it quickly surfaced , was fake .
Much like Orson Welles in 1939 when his radio program , despite disclaimers during the broadcast , had many Americans believing there had been an invasion from Mars , the Imedi TV report was a fabricated mass media phenomenon .
While the TV channel ahead of the screening warned that the report was but a " scenario , " viewers who tuned in only a minute late had no chance to see that they were watching a mock newscast .
Only at the end of the report did the channel inform viewers again that the report was fake .
Yet by then , most of the damage had been done .
There were reports people suffered heart attacks , with many admitted to the hospital for shock - related conditions .
Hundreds of angry Georgians assembled in front of the TV station Saturday night , demanding an apology .
Opposition politicians say the station , owned by a friend of Saakashvili , aired the report to strengthen the president , who is one of the Kremlin 's fiercest opponents .
It came only a few days after Nino Burjadnadze , the opposition leader in Georgia , met with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in a bid to improve ties with the Kremlin .
The fake report said Burjadnadze had cooperated with the Kremlin in the attack on Georgia .
The opposition leader is outraged .
" I can't imagine any normal country where things like that could be possible , where somebody could call you a traitor , " Burjadnadze said in comments to al - Jazeera .
" I am more than sure the Georgian people will make a choice for stability , for unity of the country , for democracy , and for that , we need to change this criminal , irresponsible government . "
Saakashvili , who said he had no knowledge of the report , sent his spokeswoman to the station in a bid to defuse tensions .
She later said there should have been an on - screen warning to identify the report as fake .
In his overall assessment of the situation , Saakashvili sided with the report , however .
The Russian threat as simulated on TV remained " very much real , " he said Sunday .

A carbon nanotube ( shown in illustration ) can produce a very rapid wave of power when it is coated by a layer of fuel and ignited , so that heat travels along the tube .
Graphic : Christine Daniloff
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A team of scientists at MIT have discovered a previously unknown phenomenon that can cause powerful waves of energy to shoot through minuscule wires known as carbon nanotubes .
The discovery could lead to a new way of producing electricity , the researchers say .
The phenomenon , described as thermopower waves , “ opens up a new area of energy research , which is rare , ” says Michael Strano , MIT ’s Charles and Hilda Roddey Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering , who was the senior author of a paper describing the new findings that appeared in Nature Materials on March 7 .
The lead author was Wonjoon Choi , a doctoral student in mechanical engineering .
Like a collection of flotsam propelled along the surface by waves traveling across the ocean , it turns out that a thermal wave — a moving pulse of heat — traveling along a microscopic wire can drive electrons along , creating an electrical current .
The key ingredient in the recipe is carbon nanotubes — submicroscopic hollow tubes made of a chicken - wire - like lattice of carbon atoms .
These tubes , just a few billionths of a meter ( nanometers ) in diameter , are part of a family of novel carbon molecules , including buckyballs and graphene sheets , that have been the subject of intensive worldwide research over the last two decades .
A previously unknown phenomenon
In the new experiments , each of these electrically and thermally conductive nanotubes was coated with a layer of a reactive fuel that can produce heat by decomposing .
This fuel was then ignited at one end of the nanotube using either a laser beam or a high - voltage spark , and the result was a fast - moving thermal wave traveling along the length of the carbon nanotube like a flame speeding along the length of a lit fuse .
Heat from the fuel goes into the nanotube , where it travels thousands of times faster than in the fuel itself .
As the heat feeds back to the fuel coating , a thermal wave is created that is guided along the nanotube .
With a temperature of 3,000 Kelvin , this ring of heat speeds along the tube 10,000 times faster than the normal spread of this chemical reaction .
The heating produced by that combustion , it turns out , also pushes electrons along the tube , creating a substantial electrical current .
Combustion waves — like this pulse of heat hurtling along a wire — “ have been studied mathematically for more than 100 years , ” Strano says , but he was the first to predict that such waves could be guided by a nanotube or nanowire and that this wave of heat could push an electrical current along that wire .
In the group ’s initial experiments , Strano says , when they wired up the carbon nanotubes with their fuel coating in order to study the reaction , “ lo and behold , we were really surprised by the size of the resulting voltage peak ” that propagated along the wire .
After further development , the system now puts out energy , in proportion to its weight , about 100 times greater than an equivalent weight of lithium - ion battery .
The amount of power released , he says , is much greater than that predicted by thermoelectric calculations .
While many semiconductor materials can produce an electric potential when heated , through something called the Seebeck effect , that effect is very weak in carbon .
“ There ’s something else happening here , ” he says .
“ We call it electron entrainment , since part of the current appears to scale with wave velocity . ”
The thermal wave , he explains , appears to be entraining the electrical charge carriers ( either electrons or electron holes ) just as an ocean wave can pick up and carry a collection of debris along the surface .
This important property is responsible for the high power produced by the system , Strano says .
Exploring possible applications
Because this is such a new discovery , he says , it ’s hard to predict exactly what the practical applications will be .
But he suggests that one possible application would be in enabling new kinds of ultra-small electronic devices — for example , devices the size of grains of rice , perhaps with sensors or treatment devices that could be injected into the body .
Or it could lead to “ environmental sensors that could be scattered like dust in the air , ” he says .
In theory , he says , such devices could maintain their power indefinitely until used , unlike batteries whose charges leak away gradually as they sit unused .
And while the individual nanowires are tiny , Strano suggests that they could be made in large arrays to supply significant amounts of power for larger devices .
The researchers also plan to pursue another aspect of their theory : that by using different kinds of reactive materials for the coating , the wave front could oscillate , thus producing an alternating current .
That would open up a variety of possibilities , Strano says , because alternating current is the basis for radio waves such as cell phone transmissions , but present energy - storage systems all produce direct current .
“ Our theory predicted these oscillations before we began to observe them in our data , ” he says .
Also , the present versions of the system have low efficiency , because a great deal of power is being given off as heat and light .
The team plans to work on improving that .

WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator John Barrasso ( R - WY ) , chairman of the Senate Republican Conference , released the following statement on the anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks :
“ We pause today to remember the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives on September 11 , 2001 , when al - Qaeda terrorists turned commercial airplanes into weapons of mass destruction .
“ We pray for all the 9/11 victims and their families .
We will forever honor our 9/11 heroes – the bright lights of that dark day .
“ Some of the greatest 9/11 heroes were in fact the victims themselves .
We especially recall the passengers and crew of United Flight 93 .
These brave souls began the war on terror when they fought back .
Incredibly , they waited until they were over Pennsylvania farmland , saving countless lives on the ground .
“ We also pay tribute to our first responders , firefighters , police , and service men and women , who put their lives on the line .
“ On this day of remembrance , we renew our resolve to protect this great nation and keep the American people safe . ”
Things are getting pretty heated in the Capitol with crowds of anti-Reform / Tea Party activists going through the halls shouting slogans and epithets at Democratic members of Congress .
As our Brian Beutler reports , a few moments ago in the Longworth office building , a group swarmed a very calm looking Henry Waxman , as he got on the elevator , with shouts of “ Kill the bill ! ” “ You liar !
You crook ! ”
Not long before , Rep. Barney Frank got an uglier version of the treatment .
Just after Frank rounded a corner to leave the building , an older protestor yelled “ Barney , you faggot . ”
The surrounding crowd of protestors then erupted in laughter .
At one point , Capitol police officer threatened to throw a group of protestors out of the building but that only seemed to inflame them more ; and apparently none were ejected .
Note that this was in the Longworth building , not the Capitol building proper .
But I ’m a bit surprised that this is being allowed to occur anywhere in the Capitol complex .
From Brian ’s description it sounds like menacing .
Ford Motor Co. F 0.91 % will announce Tuesday it is adding a second shift at its Chicago assembly plant , creating 1,200 jobs and enabling the company for the first time to hire some new union workers at significantly reduced wages .
The contracts that Ford , General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC signed in 2007 allow the auto makers to fill jobs vacated by older workers who leave or retire with new hires earning a little more than $ 14 an hour on average — about half what current workers received when they started .
Newer workers also get reduced benefits .
The new " second tier " wage was a big concession for the United Auto Workers union , whose workers have enjoyed some of the highest manufacturing wages in the world .
It agreed to accept reduced pay for newly hired workers in an effort to help make the Detroit Three more competitive with foreign car makers that use nonunion labor in their U.S. plants .
GM and Chrysler hired some workers at the reduced wage but laid off all or most of them when the companies slashed jobs as the recession and downturn in auto sales deepened .
Ford never hired lower - wage union workers .
But with sales now showing signs of recovery , both the Big Three and foreign car makers are increasing production and adding factory jobs .
Hiring a second shift of workers at Ford 's Chicago plant should trigger the hiring of entry - level workers , said Jim Tetreault , Ford 's vice president for North America manufacturing , though he declined to estimate how many .
Sean McAlinden , chief economist at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Mich. , said he suspects
Ford will be able to hire a few hundred workers at the lower wage , and possibly as many as 600 .
Even a few hundred would improve the economics of the Chicago plant .
Besides the lower wage , new workers also get 401 ( k ) accounts for retirement instead of pension plans that Ford is obligated to pay out for years .
It will still probably take years for Ford and the other Detroit auto makers to bring their total labor costs down to the level of their foreign competitors , Mr. McAlinden said .
Even with recent concessions , an hour of union labor costs GM about $ 59 , including wages and the cost of all benefits , he estimated .
The gap can be closed only if GM does " mass hiring of entry - level workers , " Mr. McAlinden said , adding he does n't expect that to happen until at least after 2015 based on U.S. production estimates through then .
At Ford , the contract with the UAW limits the number of lower - wage workers to 20 % of the company 's total work force .
Ford also must see how many current but laid - off workers will apply for jobs in Chicago .
About 1,000 who will be idled at Ford 's Louisville , Ky. , plant and 600 others who were idled but remain on the payroll will be first in line for the Chicago jobs .
It is unlikely all of the Chicago jobs will be filled by those workers because some will opt not to move .
The Louisville plant also is supposed to reopen next year and will recall many workers .
" There will be new people hired at Ford , " said Bob King , the UAW 's vice president in charge of relations with the car maker .
Mr. King is the union leadership 's nominee to succeed UAW President Ron Gettelfinger .
GM has no plans to hire workers at the lower - tier wages this year , said spokeswoman Sherrie Childers Arb .
The company still has about 6,500 laid - off workers who have the right to take jobs at existing wages as they open up , she said .
GM expects the number of its workers on indefinite layoff to fall when the auto maker adds a third shift at its Lansing Delta Township plan in Michigan and Fort Wayne factory in Indiana , she added .
Chrysler has " several hundred " laid - off workers who have the right to jobs , according to a person familiar with the matter .
Ford 's Chicago plant builds two large sedans , the Ford Taurus and Lincoln MKS .
The second shift will be added to produce a redesigned Ford Explorer sport- utility vehicle later this year .
Ford plans to spend $ 400 million to ready the Chicago plant for SUVs .
Ford now builds the Explorer in Louisville but that factory will be converted to small - car production next year .

A quarter century ago , Windows was n't everywhere .
In fact , some were doubtful it would ever ship at all .
And Tandy Trower was there .
Few people understand Microsoft better than Tandy Trower , who worked at the company from 1981 - 2009 .
Trower was the product manager who ultimately shipped Windows 1.0 , an endeavor that some advised him was a path toward a ruined career .
Four product managers had already tried and failed to ship Windows before him , and he initially thought that he was being assigned an impossible task .
In this follow - up to yesterday ’s story on the future of Windows , Trower recounts the inside story of his experience in transforming Windows from vaporware into a product that has left an unmistakable imprint on the world , 25 years after it was first released .
Thanks to GUIdebook for letting us borrow many of the Windows images in this story .
– David Worthington
Microsoft staffers talk MS - DOS 2.0 with the editors of PC World in late 1982 or early 1983 .
Windows 1.0 would n’t ship for almost another two years .
From left : Microsoft ’s Chris Larson , PC World ’s Steve Cook , Bill Gates , Tandy Trower , and founding PC World editor Andrew Fluegelman .
In the late fall of 1984 , I was just past three years in my employment with Microsoft .
Considering the revolving doors in Silicon Valley at that time , I already had met or exceeded the typical time of employment with a high - tech company .
Over that time I already had established a good track record , having started with product management of Microsoft ’s flagship product , BASIC , and successfully introduced many versions including the so - called GW - BASIC which was licensed to PC clone vendors , various BASIC compilers , and a BASIC interpreter and compiler for the Apple Macintosh .
As a result I had been given the overall responsibility for managing Microsoft ’s programming languages , which included FORTRAN , Pascal , COBOL , 8086 Macro Assembler , and its first C compiler for MS - DOS .
It was at this point that things took a significant turn .
I had just gone through one of those infamous grueling project reviews with Bill Gates , who was known for his ability to cover all details related to product strategy , not only those on the technical side .
Borland ’s Turbo Pascal had just come out , seemed to be taking the market by storm , and looked like a possible competitor to Microsoft BASIC as the language that was shipped with every PC .
While Microsoft had its own version of Pascal , it had been groomed as a professional developer ’s tool , and in fact was the core language Microsoft wrote many of its own software products in before it was displaced by C .
Bill Gates made it quite clear that he was not happy .
At $ 50 for the Borland product vs. the Microsoft $ 400 compiler , it was a bit like comparing a VW to a Porsche .
But while Turbo Pascal was lighter weight for serious development , it was almost as quick for programming and debugging as Microsoft ’s BASIC interpreters .
And Pascal was the programming language that most computer science students most typically studied .
The new Borland product would require serious strategy revisions to the existing plans to port Microsoft Pascal to a new compiler architecture .
But it also required thinking about how to address this with our BASIC products .
Could a Turbo BASIC be on the horizon ?
In any case , Gates made it quite clear that he was not happy .
Returning to my office I was somewhat devastated .
In the days that followed , as I tried to come up with a revised strategy , I was uncertain about whether I should even continue in this role .
I had come to Microsoft from a consumer computer company where I had primarily managed a variety of entertainment and education software .
Even in my early career at Microsoft I had managed its early PC games like Flight Simulator , Decathlon , and Typing Tutor .
And I had loved managing BASIC , not just because it was the product the company was best known for , but because BASIC helped me get my own start in the PC business , and I believed it allowed a wide audience to tap into the power of PCs .
Now my job had evolved to where I was managing a family of products mostly for a highly technical audience .
So , I spoke with Steve Ballmer , then my direct manager and head of Microsoft ’s product marketing group , and suggested that perhaps I was the wrong person for this job .
A couple of weeks later , Ballmer called me in and proposed that I transfer over to manage Windows .
Sounds like a plum job right ?
Well , that was n’t so obvious at the time .
Windows had been announced the previous year with much fanfare and support from most of the existing PC vendors .
However , by the time of my discussion with Steve , Windows still had not shipped within the promised timeframe and was starting to earn the reputation of being “ vaporware . ”
In fact Ballmer had just returned from what we internally referred to as the “ mea culpa ” tour to personally apologize to analysts and press for the product not having shipped on time and to reinforce Microsoft ’s definite plans to complete it soon .
Windows was developing a reputation for career death .
Further , Microsoft ’s strategy to get IBM to license Windows had failed .
IBM had rejected Windows in favor of its own character - based DOS application windowing product called TopView .
With IBM still the dominant PC seller , Microsoft would have to market Windows directly to IBM PC users .
It would be the first time the company sold an OS level product directly to end -users ( unless you count the Apple SoftCard , a hardware card that enabled Apple II users to run CPM - 80 applications on their Apple IIs , which I had also previously managed ) .
Since I had been the product manager that had the most experience with marketing technically oriented products through retail channels ( rather licensed to PC vendors ) , Ballmer thought the job might be a good fit .
In addition , he pointed out that since Windows was intended to expand the appeal of PC through its easier - to - use graphical user interface , it should appeal to my more end - user product experience and interests .
At that point Windows was no longer considered the company ’s star project , as it had become a bit of an embarrassment .
Even internally there were doubts among some in the company that Windows would ever ship .
Also , because Ballmer had already burned though four product managers to try to get there –people who now had been either reassigned or were no longer at Microsoft –the product was developing a reputation for career death .
Apparently prior to offering the job to me , Ballmer had tried to persuade Rob Glaser , already recognized as a bright , up - and coming talent , to take the position .
But Glaser turned him down .
When Glaser heard that I was offered the position , he even stopped by to counsel might that it would be a bad career move .
This made me think that perhaps the offer to me was a ploy by Gates and Ballmer to fire me because of their disappointment in dealing with Turbo Pascal and my suggestion that perhaps my assignment to managing programming languages was a poor choice on their part .
It seemed clever : give me a task that no one else had succeeded with , let me fail as well , and they would have not only a scapegoat , but easy grounds to terminate me .
So , I confronted Gates and Ballmer about my theory .
After their somewhat raucous laughter they regained their composure and assured me that the offer was sincere and that they had confidence in my potential success .
So , in January of 1985 I transitioned over the Windows team , but even as I assumed my new role , I discovered that the Windows development architect and manager , Scott McGregor , a former Xerox PARC engineer , has just resigned .
Ballmer himself took up McGregor ’s role as the development lead in addition to his other responsibilities .
Shaping Up Windows
My first task was to assess of what was done and what was left to be done as well as come up with a marketing strategy of how to sell an OS add - on to end users , a task that was a significant challenge because no Windows applications existed at that time .
How to sell a new application interface without any applications ?
I discovered that while the three core functional components of Windows ( Kernel–memory management , User–windowing and controls , and GDI – device rendering ) were mostly in place there was still a substantial amount of work to be done , and Ballmer had given me only six months to finalize the product and get out the door .
This did n’t bother too much since I had currently held the record for getting a product from definition to market in the shortest time .
Windows needed to be finished , not further tweaked in any way that jeopardized getting it out that summer without further embarrassment .
There was n’t much time to make changes .
Ballmer was emphatic not to redefine what was already done , even though McGregor had changed Windows from its original overlapping windows design to a tiled windows model and every windowing system out there or under development featured overlapping windows .
There also was not enough time to change the Windows system font displayed in title bars and control labels from a fixed width typeface to a proportional typeface , which made the overall look a bit clunky , especially in comparison to the newly announced Macintosh interface .
Steve ’s promise was that in the next release I would get creative freedom to make any significant changes to the product ’s interface .
I could add some functionality to make it more appealing to end -users , but overall the product needed to be finished , not further tweaked in any way that jeopardized getting it out that summer without further embarrassment .

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader , called the president ’s move “ yet another episode of choosing a partisan path despite bipartisan opposition . ”
Another Republican , Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , said in an interview that he could understand Mr. Obama ’s frustration ; he said that most of the other nominees were noncontroversial and that his concern was centered primarily on Mr. Becker .
“ He has a precedent , ” Mr. Coburn said of the president , “ Others have done it , so I ’m not critical of him doing it .
But I am critical of the Becker appointment because he does n’t have the votes . ”
Recess appointments are a common tool for presidents frustrated by the confirmation process .
Mr. Obama ’s action puts him on a par with Mr. Bush , who had made 15 recess appointments by this point in his presidency .
Mr. Bush had an especially intense tussle with Democrats over judicial appointees ; during the course of his two terms in office , he made a total of 171 recess appointments , although 72 were to part - time positions , according to the Congressional Research Service .
President Clinton made 139 recess appointments .
With the exception of Mr. Becker , the White House said most of the 15 nominees being installed by Mr. Obama have bipartisan support .
Indeed , in a sign that Mr. Obama did not want to go too far in inflaming partisan passions , he resisted using his executive powers to install one of his most contentious candidates , Dawn Johnsen , an Indiana University law professor , to lead the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department .
Ms. Johnsen has drawn the ire of Republicans for her work as a lawyer for NARAL Pro-Choice America as well as her outspoken opposition to the Bush administration ’s counterterrorism policies .
Saturday ’s announcement is certain to cheer some of Mr. Obama ’s strongest supporters , who have been arguing that the president should take on Republicans in a more forceful way .
Gay rights advocates were elated to see Chai R. Feldblum , a Georgetown University Law professor who advocates on gay issues , claim a spot on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as a result of Mr. Obama ’s action .
But perhaps no group will be as heartened as union leaders .
For months they had complained that Mr. Obama was too timid in responding to Republican opposition to Mr. Becker , a former associate general counsel for the A.F.L. - C.I.O. and the Service Employees International Union .
Labor leaders were also unhappy that the labor relations board has been largely paralyzed since January 2008 because only two of its five seats have been filled since then .
Mr. Obama also appointed Mark Pearce , a New York labor lawyer , on Saturday to fill a fourth seat on the board .
Last month , the Democrats fell eight votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a threatened Republican filibuster of a vote for Mr. Becker .
Two Democrats , Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Ben Nelson of Nebraska , joined Republicans in the 52 - to - 33 vote .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The number of head and neck cancers linked to a virus spread by oral sex is rising rapidly and suggests boys as well as girls should be offered protection through vaccination , doctors said Friday .

Despite an overall slight decline in head and neck cancers in recent years , cases of a particular form called oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) have increased sharply , particularly in the developed world .
This growth seems to be linked to cancers caused by the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , scientists said in a report in the British Medical Journal .
Two vaccines -- Cervarix , made by GlaxoSmithKline , and Gardasil , made by Merck & Co -- can prevent HPV , which causes virtually all cases of cervical cancer , the second most common cancer in women worldwide .
Many rich nations have launched HPV immunisation programs for girls to try to protect them from the common sexually transmitted virus before they become sexually active .
The scientists , led by Hisham Mehanna of the Institute of Head and Neck Studies at University Hospital Coventry , said while including boys in immunisation plans has been seen as too expensive , it may be time to look again .
“ We need to look at the evidence again to re-evaluate the cost - effectiveness of male children in light of this new and rapidly rising incidence , ” he said in an interview .
Analyst Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon in London said such studies would dispel worries about sales prospects for HPV vaccines , and repeated his ‘ buy ’ recommendation for Glaxo stock .
“ The emergence of new data such as this may increase motivation amongst national vaccination authorities worldwide to re-double efforts to vaccinate children before they become sexually active , ” he said in an equity research note .
Glaxo shares were slightly lower , in line with a weaker European pharmaceutical sector and down 0.4 percent by 0905 GMT .
More than 500,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed annually in women and it kills around 200,000 a year .
Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer among men and women , with about 640,000 new cases each year worldwide .
A recent study found the risk of developing oropharyngeal carcinoma was linked to a history of six or more lifetime sexual partners , four or more lifetime oral sex partners , and , for men , an earlier age at first sexual intercourse .
“ Sexual transmission of HPV -- primarily through orogenital intercourse -- might be the reason for the increase in incidence of HPV related oropharyngeal carcinoma , ” wrote Mehanna .
The scientists pointed to recent studies which showed a 70 percent increase in the detection of HPV in biopsies taken to diagnose oropharyngeal carcinoma in Stockholm since the 1970s .
HPV - related cancer was also reported in 60 - 80 percent of recent biopsy samples in studies in the United States , compared with 40 percent in the previous decade , they wrote .
Mehanna said the findings had other important health implications .
Patients with HPV - related head and neck cancers were typically younger and employed , he said , and because their tumors appeared to be less deadly than those caused by factors like smoking and drinking , patients may also live longer with the physical and psychological effects of treatment .
“ This means they would need prolonged support from health , social , and other services , and may require help in returning to work , ” he said .
Who knew blowing a goats pipes would sound like that ?

Behold disciples of Nod , for the end is soon upon us .
Electronic Arts ’ award - winning and best - selling Tiberium saga is coming to a powerful conclusion with Command & Conquer 4 , which will introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay , while retaining the core compulsions that fans have come to love over the series ’ history .
It is the year 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction .
Tiberium , the mysterious , alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative ( GDI ) and the Brotherhood of Nod , is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable .
Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane , Nod ’s prophetic leader , emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power .
But he cannot build this " Tiberium Control Network " without GDI ’s cooperation .
Thus , the two opposing factions – GDI and Nod – inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause : to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind .
After 15 years , the network is nearly complete , Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized , newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress .
It is then that the world ’s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help , and what will he want in return .

AggroReview : Starcraft II Impression
by Binh Nguyen [ Tuesday , 9th of March 2010 - 06:05 PM ]
Please leave your questions , comments and concerns and thanks for listening to AggroReview
I would expect the editor of any automotive blog to have owned and driven a massive number of vehicles to give some kind of legitimacy to the blog itself .
For that reason , I feel that it is my duty to the readers to own and drive as many vehicles as possible , and for that , I thank you .
Between my own personal automotive obsessions and working as a technician , I have driven hundreds of cars , each with it ’s own intricacies , oddities , and personality .
How trustworthy are my gearhead opinions though ?
Why continue on this automotive journey with me if you do n’t even know where I have been ?
I think at this point in our internet relationship , it ’s time that you learned about the triumphant rise and epic fall of my first daily driven vehicle .
I did n’t realize it at the time , but I really loved that truck more than I can explain .
Something about it was special to me , though I am still unsure of what .
Triumphant Rise :
When I was 15 , I had about $ 500 to my name from dogs chasing me my newspaper route days , and I knew that the pinnacle of life was knocking on my door .
I was getting my license soon .
Sure I already owned 1 car , which will undoubtedly come up in future musings , but I needed a car that I could actually drive daily .
A car that moved under its own power , maybe something with wheels and a running engine .
After harassing my parents for a while , they finally agreed to let me get a second car a little early .
( Thanks Mom and Dad ) .
I immediately ripped through the “ Vehicles for Parts ” , and “ Antique Autos ” sections of the local Want Advertiser searching for the perfect older car to drive daily .
A Dart would be cool , I thought aloud … or maybe an Iroc , OH how about a 1939 Studebaker , that would be really cool too ..
The weeks steadily passed and my parents shot down every dumb idea I had , thankfully .
Then my mom came home one day and said that a person that she knew had a 1987 Dodge Ram 50 for $ 500 that needed some work .
Initially , I was n’t so sure , but within a day or two I had found pictures of some Ram 50’s in MiniTruckin magazine that made me fall in love .
I scrounged up every last penny I could find , and I bought it .
It was the beginning of a very special relationship .
The first thing I did when I got it home was to rebuild the carburetor .
That ’s what you ’re supposed to do right ?
It took a few tries , but I got the carburetor back on the truck and got it running again , albeit only slightly better than before I had touched it .
Nevertheless , I pressed on .
I changed fluids , fixed exhaust , and even fixed the leaky power steering .
After an eternity ( a few weeks ) had passed , I got my license and began driving my newly improved Ram 50 .
We quickly became great friends , and each weekend , I would spend endless time improving different areas of her :
– Removed rust and rot
– Straightened all the metal
– Added bucket seats
– Lowered 3 inches
– New tires , polished chrome wheels
– Absurdly loud stereo system
– Tinted window
– Bug guard ( they were cool then )
– Tonneau cover
– Custom frenched license plate in the tailgate
– Painted neon green brake drums and calipers
The Epic Fall :
It was beautiful on so many levels , and perfect for cruising the beaches .
Rust free , dent free , and just a really astonishingly clean truck .
Although the local law enforcement were not fans of my tailgate , it really did set my truck apart from the rest .
Mine was special .
After about a year of driving the truck , I began thinking irrationally .
For some unknown reason , I decided that I could not handle the slowness of the truck any longer , and I needed a faster vehicle .
What an idiot !
I put the truck on the front lawn for sale for $ 1000 obo , and a guy I knew gave me $ 800 cash for it .
He then drove away my original $ 500 purchase price , about $ 1000 in upgrades , and thousands of hours of making it perfect .
All because I was an idiot .
Years pass , and the truck vanishes from sight and everyone ’s memory but my own .
It was only a year after selling it that I had realized the mistake that I had made .
I constantly dreamed about turning back time , but without a Delorean , I just could n’t .
I jumped from one car to the next to the next , desperately trying to find the magic that my little Ram 50 and I once had , but the magic just could n’t be found .
It was gone for good .
Months turned to years , and my brother and I needed something to do one hot summer day .
We decided to challenge the junkyards in a game of mud , oil , and grease .
It was always a great time and would have been again , but destiny had other plans .
There she sat , my beloved 1987 Dodge Ram 50 .
Smashed on every corner , missing wheels , and another truck sitting on her roof .
I felt sickened .
Something I had worked so very hard on was now crushed right before my eyes .
It was truly an awful feeling that I would not want any other gearhead to go through .
I reluctantly approached the truck knowing full well that I had done her wrong .
A silent heart felt apology was in order as I slowly meandered my way around the back of the truck .
My custom tailgate , the green drums , the lowering blocks , the interior , the tint .
It was all still there , just horrified in every sense of the word … .
I spent a few minutes thinking about all the great times we had , snapped off some pictures for memories , and then shamefully walked away .
Amazingly , this saga did n’t end that day in the junkyard , but “ The Reincarnation ” is a story best left for another day .

Sources say Harlem Democrat Charles Rangel will step down as chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee soon , NBC News has learned .
He may make the move as early as tonight as pressure mounts and sources told NBC that either Michigan Democratic Rep Sander Levin or California Democrat Pete Stark will temporarily take over the committee .
Some details still need to be ironed out , but the sources said Rangel has been pushed to step down before the House voted on a bill to forcefully strip him of the coveted chairmanship .
When questioned directly by NBC News Tuesday night , however , Rangel denied the move .
Asked if he was chairmain tonight and would he still be chairman tomorrow Rangel said , " You bet your life on it . "
But sources still said he would be out soon .
A Democratic member close to the situation told NBC News " tomorrow [ Rangel ] will take a leave of abesence until ethics investigation is over . "
Rangel has been under fire ever since an ethics committee released a report Thursday that found that he violated House rules by accepting two corporate - sponsored trips to the Caribbean .
Rangel countered Friday that the ethics report " exonerates " him because it says there is no evidence that he knew the trips were sponsored by corporations .
The report said his staff knew who paid for the trips .
Following the report , even Democrats began asking Rangel to step down .
“ The citizens of his home state sent him here , that 's their decision , " said Rep. Gene Taylor ( D - Mississippi ) , who lead the charge in asking Rangel to relinquish his post .
" But members of the [ Democratic Caucus ] made him chairman of that committee , and he should step down until all this is resolved . ”
Mar. 16 , 2010  --
Neither border crossings , nor sniffer dogs , nor extensive search efforts by authorities are keeping potheads from their appointed task : getting high .
According to U.S. government officials , more marijuana is now being shipped through the U.S. Mail than in recent memory .
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service , whose seizures of marijuana parcels have increased by more than 400 percent since 2007 , says increased seizures almost always indicate a much larger crop being shipped .
" There is no better way to ship drugs right now , " said San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne , whose city is one of the most popular in the country for using the mail to ship marijuana .
" It 's going up all the time . "
Drugs are often concealed inside everyday items , like computer towers , car stereo amplifiers or microwaves .
Inspectors recently came across cans that appeared to be " Teasdale " canned corn .
But when inspectors cracked the cans open , there was n't corn inside .
Instead , they found bags of marijuana .
The smugglers heat sealed the drugs in bags , ensured the weight was the same as what was listed on the can , and used a can sealer to mask the smell .
The increase is a continuing trend .
The total pounds of marijuana seized by inspectors , as well as the number of parcels containing the drug , have increased every fiscal year since 2005 .
And postal inspectors , increasingly , have their hands full .
There was an 84 percent increase in the amount of marijuana seized from 2007 to 2008 and a 180 percent increase between years 2008 and 2009 .
Inspectors uncovered 8,453 lbs. in 2007 , 15,521 lbs. in 2008 , and 43,403 lbs. of marijuana in 2009 .
In that same period , the total number of inspectors has remained relatively constant .
The U.S. Mail has always been an attractive way to ship pot , authorities say .
It is seen by drug dealers as a good alternative to having someone drive a shipment cross-country , where one risks arrest and loss of product if stopped by law enforcement .
However , the recent spike in marijuana mailings can also be explained by increased demand for the drug and by inspectors improving law enforcement techniques .
Now , inspectors are working to determine which mailboxes are attractive targets for traffickers .
Targeting ' Hot beds ' for Shipping Marijuana
They have become more efficient in what 's known as ZIP Code targeting , said Peter R. Rendina , a postal inspector and national spokesperson for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service .
Through the course of investigations , inspectors identified which mail centers see the most drugs .
Inspectors from other geographical locations are sent to assist those mail centers until problem becomes more manageable .
" Right now , we 're really seeing an uptick in drugs being shipped through the southwest to destinations throughout the U.S. , " said Rendina .
Of the 3,621 parcels of marijuana intercepted by inspectors nationwide in 2009 , 75 percent were in the border towns of Texas , New Mexico , Arizona , and California .
The area is seen as a " hotbed " for using the Postal Service to transport marijuana .
While post offices in the southwest region have seen the most drugs come through , other parts of the U.S. are n't immune .
Last month , a New Jersey man was arrested for allegedly purchasing methamphetamine in California and mailing it to Newark , N.J.
After obtaining a search warrant for the parcel , inspectors say they found 300 grams of meth inside .
The case is still pending .
Illegal drugs are also being shipped to the Midwest .
In the rural stretches of north - central South Dakota , a woman was expecting a new television at her home in Walworth County .
When a large box was delivered to her doorstep , she assumed the television had arrived .
Instead of finding a television inside the box , she found three bricks of marijuana , totaling 50 lbs .
" It was not what she expected , " said Sheriff Duane Mohr , who believes a Mexican drug cartel sent the package to the wrong address .
" It had an international post stamp on it , but they were crafty enough to print off a return address label with a Motorola logo on it just to make it look legitimate . "
Mohr estimates the drugs had a street value of $ 100,000 .
Why Mailing Marijuana is Attractive
There are 1,614 inspectors at mail centers across the country looking for suspicious packages .
Every day , they comb through the thousands of pieces of mail .
Many inspectors employ the help of canine teams to locate packages containing drugs , though parcels are often packed with mustard , peanut butter , axel grease or coffee beans to cover up the drugs ' odor .
There is " an attraction to shipping through the mail because they think they can be anonymous , " said Rendina .
Rendina explained that drug cartels believe there is less risk in having a mule drop off a package at the post office , instead of driving a U - Haul full of product across the country .
But arrests are happening .
In 2009 , 1,278 people were busted for using the mail to transport drugs .
To identify potential suspects , inspectors conduct interviews , review video surveillance , and examine paper trails , like when and where the package is scanned .
Inspectors also use intelligence about drug cartels and analyze drug trafficking trends , which they obtain on their own or by working with other federal law enforcement agencies , like the U.S. DEA .
Inspectors offer a $ 50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of individuals shipping illegal substances through the U.S. Mail .
Rendina says the reward money comes from asset forfeiture .
While marijuana mailings have increased , shipments of other drugs have declined .
Between fiscal years 2008 and 2009 , there were fewer seizures of cocaine , heroin , opium , and methamphetamine .

A probable cause hearing began Wednesday for nine Oakland County residents charged in a case in which local law enforcement is challenging the state ’s law that allows distribution of medical marijuana .
The accused were associated with Clinical Relief , a Ferndale marijuana dispensary , and were arrested Aug. 25 .
An alleged warehouse in Macomb County and two clinics in Waterford Township also were raided , leading to other arrests .
All of the Ferndale defendants are free on bond , and 43rd District Judge Joseph Longo did not decide Wednesday whether to bind them over for trial in Oakland County Circuit Court .
The hearing continues Friday .
About 50 people demonstrated outside the hearing in favor of the medical marijuana law and against the crackdown .
Lawyers for the defendants said no laws were broken because the clinic operated within rules established by the law that voters passed in 2008 .
They said Oakland County ’s prosecutor and sheriff brought the charges to test the state ’s law .
There have been arrests and confusion over the law statewide .
A Michigan Court of Appeals judge in September urged state legislators to clarify the “ inartfully drafted ” law , which he said has become a “ nightmare . ”
A Troy police officer , who served as an undercover investigator with the Oakland County Narcotics Enforcement Team , testified Wednesday that in July she went into Clinical Relief with a counterfeit medical marijuana card and lied to a clinic worker about suffering headaches and experiencing neck pain from a car crash to get an eighth of an ounce of marijuana .
Defense lawyers argued that because the state considers issuance of the cards private medical information , there is no way for a marijuana dispensary to confirm if a card is real or fake .

Music is composed of discrete elements or sounds called notes .
Musical notation describes these elements in terms of their pitch ( related to the note 's frequency ) , their arrangement in time ( when they begin to sound ) , and their duration , ( how long they should last ) .
The signs we use are called note signs or notes .
In English - speaking countries , in a general sense , a series of rising pitches are named using the first seven letters of the Roman alphabet : A B C D E F G.
The sequence continues indefinitely , restarting from A when moving beyond G , or moving from A to G when moving below A .
By convention the notes rise in pitch as one moves from A to B to C , etc .
We will learn later that there are additional notes where , using A as an example , the note a semitone ( half note ) higher bears the additional name ' sharp ' ( thus A sharp ) while the note a semitone ( half note ) lower bears the additional name ' flat ' ( thus A flat ) .
In the Netherlands , the letters A to G are also used , but otherwise the ' Dutch ' system follows the ' German ' system , so - called because it originated in Germany , which also uses H . We describe this system in section 3 below .
2 Unusual Note Naming Convention in Scottish Bagpipe Music
The bagpipe chanter has a range of nine notes commonly written as the sequence G A B C D E F G A , where A is the key note .
In fact the notes C and F are C# and F# ( i.e. each sounding a semitone higher than written ) but because in the traditional way of playing the notes are never modified the notation leads to no ambiguity .
More recently players have begun to use special cross-fingerings to flatten by a semitone the notes written C and F .
Because bagpipe music has traditionally notated these two sharps as naturals , players now notate the ' flattened ' notes as Cb and Fb , although they actually sounds as C and F respectively .
Reference :
Bagpipe tuning 3 The Notes B & H and Solfeggio solfa , solfeggio ( Italian m. ) , Solfeggio ( German n. ) , solfège ( French m. ) , solfeo ( Spanish m. )
In almost all European countries , except those whose main language is English or a Romance language , the ' German ' system is used .
This also uses the letters A to G of the Roman alphabet , but reserves B for the note called B flat in the ' English ' system , and uses H for the note that is B natural ( or just B ) in the ' English ' system .
An exception is found in The Netherlands , and more recently in Sweden , where note names usually follow the ' English ' system , using B , rather than H , for B natural .
In the ' German ' system , the names of notes that are a semitone ( or half note ) higher or lower , receive the suffixes - is ( in Swedish , - iss ) and , unless the note name is a vowel , - es ( in Swedish , - ess ) respectively .
When the note name is a vowel ( i.e. A or E ) the suffix - es ( in Sweden , - ess ) is reduced to -s ( in Sweden , - ss ) .
Chapter 9 includes a table detailing the various European systems .
This system of suffixes is used also in The Netherlands .
Younger musicians in Sweden are now often taught a system similar to that used in the Netherlands , using b , biss and bess instead of the older h , hiss and b .
When musicians from different generations converse about note names they have to agree which naming convention they will use .
Magnus Johansson tells us that he has students who use h when with him , and b in other circumstances .
In European and other countries whose main language is a Romance language , the pitch names are based on the solfeggio syllables : do ( or ut ) , re , mi , fa , so ( or sol ) , la , si ( or ti ) .
A Greek reader , Christos Kontas , informs us that the Greek pitch naming system , which follows the Italian convention , is also based on the solfeggio .

personal communication from Erik Magnus Johansson on the naming of notes in Sweden 4 Note Naming in Japan Denise Owen who works in Japan has sent us the following note : Both Japan and Korea use " fixed do " and pronounce them according to their language : Japan : do , re , mi , fua ( one syllable ) , so , ra , shi , do .
Korea : to , re , mi , pa , so , ra , shi , to .
( In Korean the initial " t " or " d " is unvoiced at the beginning of a word but voiced within the word . )
The iroha Japanese system that was used during and after WW II when they did n't want to use Western names ( though they were still using Western - style music ) starts on our pitch A and is : i , ro , ha , ni , ho , he , to .
Thus , the treble clef is to - on kigo ( the sound of to clef ) and bass clef is he - on kigo ( the sound of he clef ) .
Sometimes keys are named in orchestral movements and such according to this system : ( ha choucho = C major , ni tancho = d minor ) .
Otherwise keys are generally named according to the German system .
Guitar players use the English letter system in Japan .
Conservatories use the German system .
Elderly people and some music theory ( for example , clefs naming ) still sometimes use the iroha system .
And " fixed do " is taught in schools .

Additional Notes on The History of Music Notation including the origin of B and H in German notation 5 Pitch Class and Octave Equivalency
The human ear tends to hear notes an octave apart as being essentially " the same " .
For this reason , in the Western system of music notation , such notes are given the same pitch name and are said to be members of the same pitch class .
Thus , the name of a note any number of octaves above or below A is also named A and all As are members of the pitch class A .
This is what we call octave equivalency , and is closely related to the concept of harmonics , a subject we consider later in lesson 27 .

The note signs are placed on a grid formed of horizontal lines and spaces .
This grid is called the staff or stave .
The plural of either word is staves .
Although , in the past , staves could have many different different numbers of lines , today the most common staff format has five lines separated by four spaces and is know as the pentagram .
When numbering the lines , it is a widely used convention to number them from the bottom ( 1 ) to the top ( 5 ) of each staff .
The spaces between the lines are numbered too , again from the bottom ( 1 ) to the top ( 4 ) .
We illustrate two common formats - the upper is usually used for music where only one note is played or sung at any particular time ( for example , solo parts for flute , trumpet , violin , voice , etc. ) while the lower , two staves coupled together with a curly brace and a systemic barline , is used where many notes might be played at the same time ( for example , solo parts for harp , piano , organ , etc. )
Music is read from ' left ' to ' right ' , in the same direction as you are reading this text .
The higher the pitch of the note , the higher vertically the note will be placed on the staff .
Such notation is called diastematic or intervallic .
2 Placing Notes on the Staff Note signs may lie on a line ( where the line passes through the note - head ) , in the space between two lines ( where the note - head lies between two adjacent lines ) , in the space above the top line or on the space below the bottom line .

Note signs outside the range covered by the lines and spaces of the staff are placed on , above or below supplementary lines , called leger ( or ledger ) lines , which can be placed above or below the staff .
Where two or more consecutive notes are written using leger lines , in order to make the notes easier to read , the lines for each note are always horizontally separated from those of the note following .

To set the pitch of any note on the staff a graphical symbol called a clef ( from the Latin clavis meaning key ) , clef sign or clef signature , is placed at the far left - hand side of the staff .
The clef establishes the pitch of the note on one particular line of the staff and thereby fixes the pitch of all the other notes lying on , or related to , the same staff .
It is common practice to visualise each clef as a part of a much larger grid of eleven horizontal lines and ten spaces known variously as the Great Staff , Grand Staff , Great Stave or Grand Stave .
Note the relationship between the Great Staff and most commonly used clefs , treble ( top left in the picture below ) , bass ( bottom left in the picture below ) and alto ( right in the picture below ) .
It should be stressed that , historically , there never was a staff of eleven lines .
It is solely a ' construct ' or ' device ' used by theorists to demonstrate the relationship between various staves and clefs .
The note we call middle C and which lies in the middle of the alto clef ( for clarity , we have shown it in red ) , lies one line below the five lines of the treble clef and lies one line above the five lines of the bass clef .

The treble clef is also called the G clef or G2 because the centre of the clef curls around the the horizontal line ( 2 ) , marked in red in the diagram below , associated with the note G above middle C .
The treble clef symbol is actually a stylised letter G .
The clef was originally known also as the violin clef and is still called this in some countries .
However , to avoid confusion this name is best avoided in English as it can be confused with the French violin clef which is a different clef and is described in lesson 14 .
When drawing this symbol freehand it is easiest to start from the bottom of the symbol and end with the curl around the G line .

The bass clef is also called the F clef or F4 because the two dots in the clef symbol lie above and below the horizontal line ( 4 ) , marked in red in the diagram below , associated with the note F below middle C .
The bass clef symbol is actually a stylised letter F where the two horizontal lines of the letter have been reduced to two dots .
When drawing this symbol freehand it is easiest to start from the large dot and end with the tail at the bottom of the symbol - after which one adds the two dots on either side of the F line .

Why is middle C so named ?
This interesting question was posed by a teacher in the United States of America .
The naming of the notes and position of middle C arise from the way we set out our great staff .
Guido d'Arezzo ( c.995-1050 ) called the first line on the lower staff by the Greek letter gamma .
The lowest note in the scale was called ut and was placed on gamma .
This first note was soon called gamma ut , which contracted to gamut .
At some point , French musicians began referring to the whole scale ( by then an octave ) as the gamut , a typical example of metonymy , the rhetorical or metaphorical substitution of a one thing for another based on their association or proximity .
The term was next extended to refer to the musical range of an instrument or voice .
By the seventeenth century gamut was further generalized to mean an entire range of any kind .
Naming notes with syllables rather than letters is an example of solmization .
The syllables Guido d'Arezzo chose to use in the system he developed in the eleventh century as an aid in the teaching of sight - singing , namely ut , re , me , fa , sol , la , are taken from the hymn Ut Queant Laxis Resonare Fibris .
This is explained more fully in the entry for Ut Queant Laxis Resonare Fibris taken from the Catholic Encyclopedia to which we have added some extra detail .
2 Ut Queant Laxis Resonare Fibris Ut Queant Laxis Resonare Fibris is the first line of a hymn in honour of St. John the Baptist .
The Roman Breviary divides it into three parts and assigns the first , Ut queant laxis , etc. , to Vespers , the second , Antra deserti teneris sub annis , to Matins , the third , O nimis felix , meritique celsi , to Lauds , of the feast of the Nativity of St. John ( 24 June ) .
Durandus says that the hymn was composed by Paul the Deacon on a certain Holy Saturday when , having to chant the Exsultet for the blessing of the paschal candle , he found himself suffering from an unwonted hoarseness .
Perhaps bethinking himself of the restoration of voice to the father of the Baptist , he implored a similar help in the first stanza .
The melody has been found in a manuscript of the tenth century , applied to the words of Horace 's Ode to Phyllis , entitled Est mihi nonum superantis annum .
The hymn is written in Sapphic stanzas , of which the first is famous in the history of music for the reason that the notes of the melody corresponding with the initial syllables of the six hemistichs are the first six notes of the diatonic scale of C .
This fact led to the syllabic naming of the notes as Ut , Re , Mi , Fa , Sol , La , as may be shown by capitalizing the initial syllables of the hemistichs : Guido of Arezzo , a Benedictine monk , showed his pupils an easier method of determining the sounds of the scale than by the use of the monochord .
His method was that of comparison of a known melody with an unknown one which was to be learned , and for this purpose he frequently chose the well - known melody of the Ut queant laxis .
Against a common view of musical writers , Dom Pothier contends that Guido did not actually give these syllabic names to the notes , did not invent the hexachordal system , etc. , but that insensibly the comparison of the melodies led to the syllabic naming .
When a new name for the seventh , or leading , note of our octave was desired , Erich van der Putten suggested , in 1599 , the syllabic Bi of labii , but a vast majority of musical theorists supported the happier thought of the syllable Si , formed by the initial letters of the two words of the last line ( Si because J and I were then both written I ) .
Si was much later changed to Te by a Miss S. A. Glover and John Curwen so that each degree of the scale would have a unique single letter abreviation used for written notation .
This was the start of the movable doh method of teaching which lasted in the UK for a hundred years ( see Tonic Sol-fa ) .
In the sixteenth century , Hubert Waelrant replaced the Ut by a Do as he judged the ut syllable difficult to pronounce .
( The Latin u was pronounced differently by the French , Flemish , Germans , English and others ) .
In some countries ( particularly France and Belgium ) the Do ( and the other syllables ) became fixed replacing the orginal note names .
Others have suggested that Ut was replaced by Do , the first syllable of Dominus , in 1673 , at the suggestion of Giovanni Maria Bononcini .
3 The Hexachord esacordo ( Italian m. ) , Hexachord ( German m./n. ) , hexacorde ( French m. ) , hexacordo ( Spanish m. )
The solmisation syllables were applied to sequences of six notes ( e.g. C - D - E - F - G - A ) called hexachords ( Greek : hexa = six , chorde = string or note ) .
There are three hexachords starting on the notes g , c and f .
The note letter names of the upward scale from gamma ut then read gamma , A , B , c , d , e , f , g , a , b , c ' , d ' , e ' , f ' , g ' , a ' , b ' , c ' ' , d ' ' , e ' ' Having chosen the name of the bottom note and defined the sequence from there upwards , all the others follow .
With a five line per stave arrangement , the line between the staves in C , which , in medieval times , was called c sol fa ut , is today called middle C. Notes are named from bottom to top - i.e. sol fa ut rather than ut fa sol .
The extensions sol fa ut describe the position of this particular c in the progression of hexachords , starting on gamma ut , then restarting a fourth higher ( c fa ut ) , and finally starting a fourth above that ( f fa ut ) after which the sequence begins again on the g one octave above gamma .
In order to maintain the correct intervallic relationship within each hexachord , the hexachord starting on f has a b flat ( b rotundum ) for fa while the hexachord starting on g has a b natural ( b quadrum ) for mi .
This produces two different Bs , B fa and B mi , which are a semitone apart .
The hexachords on f , g and c were termed ' soft ' ( molle ) , ' hard ' ( durum ) and ' natural ' respectively .
These mediaeval terms have persisted in German with the naming of keys , namely dur ( German : hard - for major ) and moll ( German : soft - for minor ) , and the convention for naming the notes b flat and b natural which are called respectively B and H .
As it happens , middle C , lies just about in the middle of the standard piano keyboard and for this reason most pianists assume that the description ' middle ' is a reference to this accident of piano manufacture .
The term ' middle ' is applied only to the note c and not to the register within which it lies .

If you look at the note names below the stave in the example above , you will notice that the first two note names after gamma are shown capitalised ( A and B ) , the next seven note names ( from c to b ) are in lower case , that the seven note names after that ( from c' to b' ) have a single prime ' ( other writers may use superscript i ) , and the final three note names ( from c " to e " ) have a double prime '' ( other writers may use superscript ii , or small numbers - ii would then be 2 ) .
Helmholtz notation describes an octave as a series of notes starting with the note name c ( thus , c , d , e , f , g , a , b ) with different octaves being distinguished by the use of upper and lower case and sometimes subscript or superscript prime ( ' ) or i. the key to Helmholtz Pitch notation , using i rather than prime , is that : a Helmholtz scale always starts on a c B is the note immediately below c while b is the note immediately below ci the note c in the different octaves are shown by the sequence :
C ii , C i , C , c , c i , c ii , c iii
or , in Sweden for example :
C 2 , C 1 , C , c , c 1 , c 2 , c 3 in the ' so - called ' German method , the note middle C is denoted by the letter c with a horizontal line lying above it , each octave above that bears an additional horizontal line .
Thus :
 = c , c , and so on ... some authors write C i as CC , C ii as CCC and C iii as CCCC ( see , however , English Octave - Naming Convention below ) the note c two ledger lines below the bass clef is C the note ' middle c' is ci the note ' gamma ut ' ( Γ ut ) in Guido d'Arezzo 's system ( the bottom line of the bass clef ) is G in Helmholtz ' notation Helmholtz developed this system in order to accurately define pitches in his classical work on acoustics Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen als physiologische Grundlage für die Theorie der Musik ( 1863 ) , translated into English by A. J. Ellis as On the Sensations of Tone ( 1875 ) .
Today , Helmholtz notation is used widely by scientists and doctors when discussing the scientific and medical aspects of sound in relation to the auditory system .
Helmholtz notation may be used also to distinguish octaves .
The octave from lower case c to b is called the ' small octave ' while that from c' to b' is called the ' one - line octave ' , ' one - line ' referring to the single prime ' or , using what was once called ' the German method ' , to a horizontal line placed across the top of note name ( see table below ) .
The next octave c'' to b'' is called the ' two - line octave ' ( in the German method two horizontal lines are placed above the note name ) and so on upwards .
The octave written with capital letters , C to B is the ' great octave ' .

English Octave - Naming Convention ::
Key word :
distinguishing octaves 1 English Octave - Naming Convention
A source of confusion when using the multiple C octave notation is the fact that some authors , particularly English authors writing about the organ , use a different convention for CC which they associated with C two leger lines below the bass staff , CCC for C an octave lower and CCCC for the C two octaves lower .
CC is generally the lowest note on the manuals of an organ and is called an 8 ft. note because that is the length of an open pipe required to produce it .
As pitch drops an octave as a pipe is doubled in length so CCC is called a 16 ft. note and CCCC is called a 32 ft. note .
Another feature that distinguishes the English octave - naming convention from that of Helmholtz ( see above ) is that each octave runs from G to the F seven notes above .
In this regard , it follows the convention adopted by Guido d'Arezzo where each octave is named from gamma ut , the G on the bottom line of the bass staff .
Helmholtz 's octaves , of course , run from C to the B above .
Two particular octave names that follow the English system are in alt ( G above the treble stave to the F above , inclusive ) , and in altissimo ( the octave above in alt ) .
Franco -Belgic Octave - Naming Convention ::
Key word :
distinguishing octaves 1 Franco - Belgic Octave - Naming Convention
The Franco - Belgic note naming system sets the C two leger lines below the bass clef as Do 1 , Do uno or Do primera .
Each C one octave higher is named by increasing the subscript number by 1 .
So , middle C is Do 3 , while C two leger lines above the treble clef is Do 5 .
The note a' ( in the Helmholtz system ) , which is used to set pitch , is La 3 in the Franco - Belgic system .
The system that uses letters of the alphabet to name the different pitches is called , by the French , Notation allemande et anglo - saxonne ( German and Anglo - Saxon notation ) .
Scientific Pitch Notation ::
Key word :
distinguishing octaves 1 Scientific Pitch Notation / Note - Octave Notation / American Standard an alternative naming convention called ' Scientific Pitch Notation ' , ' Note - Octave Notation ' or American Standard Pitch Notation : the lowest c on a grand piano is named C1 ( alternatively C1 , C ( 1 ) , C[ 1 ] or C 1 ) notes in the octave below C1 have their appropriate note name followed by the number 0 notes lying between C1 and the note one octave higher ( written C2 , C ( 2 ) , C[ 2 ] or C 2 ) have their appropriate note names followed by the number 1 each succeeding octave above that advances the number by one on a piano ' middle c' is C4 , C ( 4 ) , C [ 4 ] or C 4 the note a whose pitch is set by international standard is A4 , A ( 4 ) , A [ 4 ] or A 4 C4 is equivalent to ci in Helmholtz notation the note ' gamma ut ' ( Γ ut ) in Guido d'Arezzo 's system ( the bottom line of the bass clef ) is G2 in Scientific Pitch notation Note that the symbol Cb4 means " the pitch one semitone ( chromatic step ) below the pitch C4 " and not " the pitch - class Cb in octave 4 . "
Thus , Cb4 is the same pitch as B3 , not B4 .
The letter name is first combined with the Arabic numeral to determine a specific pitch , which is then altered by applying accidentals .
For this reason , the notation C4b would be slightly more consistent , though significantly less legible .

The convention for naming octaves is fairly arbitrary but can be useful when considering how chords , that is groups of notes played together , sound .
Keeping the notes well spread apart significantly strengthens the effect of a chord .
We illustrate one naming convention below .

Many domestic pianos , electronic keyboards and the like have ranges smaller than that of a full concert grand .
These small range keyboards are called ' short ' keyboards .
Counting the notes on a ' short ' keyboard will not be an appropriate way of working out the Scientific Pitch names of notes ; for this reason , we favour Helmholtz notation ( described immediately above ) .
MIDI ::
Key word :
MIDI protocol
General MIDI
patch bank
note number mapping 1 MIDI
The MIDI protocol is a music description language in binary form .
Each action of musical performance is assigned a specific standardised binary code or ' instruction ' .
Because MIDI was designed originally for keyboards many of the actions are percussion oriented .
To sound a note in MIDI language you send a " Note On " message .
Assigning that note a " velocity " determines how loud it plays .
Other MIDI messages include selecting which instrument to play , mixing and panning sounds , and controlling various aspects of electronic musical instruments .
From the moment the MIDI 1.0 Standard was finalized in the early 1980s it was clear that certain matters had been overlooked .
There was no specification for the way patch numbers were assigned to particular instruments , at least not until Roland proposed an addendum to MIDI 1.0 called General MIDI ( or GM ) in the late 1980s .
By creating a stand ' patch bank ' the user could be certain that each of the 128 patches produced the sound specified , whether it might be a Grand Piano ( patch 1 ) or a Nylon String Guitar ( patch 25 ) .
There were also deviances in regards to Note Number mapping .
For example , some manufacturers mapped middle ' C ' to MIDI Note Number 60 ( see the diagram below ) .
However , others mapped it to Note Numbers 72 or 48 .
Another shortcoming in the specification was that the MIDI standards do not designate octaves .
The standard merely designates ' middle C ' as being note number 60 .
Two octave designations have been devised .
One version of the MIDI system uses C3 to designate ' middle C' ( MIDI note 60 , 261.626 Hz ) .
That means that the octave designation for MIDI note " 0 " would be " - 2 " or notated as C - 2 .
A second version uses the lowest note available to the MIDI system ( MIDI note 1 , 8.176 Hz ) to designate Octave " 0 " with the notation of C0 .
In this system , ' middle C' ( MIDI note 60 , 261.626 Hz ) is octave 5 with the notation of C5 .

This is an abridged version of the information on F. Ishmael J. M. Stefanov - Wagner 's site .
Solfege is a method of ear - training which uses the assignment of syllables to degrees of the scale to assist a singer 's memory of pitch .
In the European hexachord ( six note ) system of Ut - Re - Mi - Fa - Sol - La , codified by Guido d'Arezzo ( 990 - 1055 ) and used for hundreds of years , the six notes have to be overlapped when naming a full octave .
For a full description go to the section on middle C .
There were rules to determine from which hexachord the syllable for a given note would be sung .
The continental six - note Ut - Re - Mi was simplified in England to the four - note system which you can see by following the scale from C to C as Fa - Sol - La - Fa - Sol - La - Mi - Fa .
[ This system was known as Lancashire or Old English Sol- fa ] .
This is what the English colonists brought with them when they set sail for the New World , and upon which the early New England singing masters based their lessons and developed their aids to reading .
[ It was then called Fasola ] .
The Sternhold & Hopkins Psalter was first printed in England in 1562 with melodies for 46 tunes .
The printer John Windet thought that solmization was a useful enough aid in sight - singing that the tunes in his 1594 edition of the Sternhold & Hopkins Psalter had initials for the syllables ( U R M F S L ) printed beneath the notes .
In the foreword it was explained : ... I have caused a new print of note to be made with letter to be joined to every note : whereby thou mayest know how to call every note by his right name , so that with a very little diligence thou mayest more easilie by the viewing of these letters , come to the knowledge of perfect solfeying ... the letters be these U for Ut , R for Re , M for My , F for Fa , S for Sol , L for La .
Thus where you see any letter joyned by the notes you may easilie call him by his right name , ...
Across the ocean and a century later at Boston in 1698 the ninth edition of the Bay Psalme Book ( printed since 1640 with texts only ) featured the addition of 13 two - part tunes , with four - note syllables indicated by letters printed beneath the staff .
This is thought to be the first music printed in the New World .

Rev. John Tufts
An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm - Tunes in a Plain & Easy Method first appearing between 1714 and 1721 had the further innovation of printing the initial letters ( M - F - S - L ) on the staff in place of the note - heads .
Durations are indicated by the extra dots to the right of the letter - each dot doubles the length of the note .
Westminster , in three parts with new notation by John Tufts .
Printed in Boston .
From the edition of 1727 .
The first book printed with shaped noteheads , using " patent notes " was the Easy Instructor , by Wm. Smith and Wm. Little in 1801 .
( To see a facsimile of this book click here . )
The shapes used then are still in use to this day : fa : sol : la : mi : Andrew Law's
The Musical Primer of 1803 , used similar shaped notes but interchanged somewhat from the assignments of Smith & Little and without the customary five - line staff .
[ American notations where different note - head shapes were associated with different syllables is known as ' Patentnote ' or ' Buckwheat ' notation . ]
By 1815 in Boston the fuguing tunes , shape - notes and the fa-sol - la solmization that facilitated them had become ( so the reformers thought ) obsolete and interest in them was maintained primarily to the far south and west .
In these parts of the country though , the hymns and music were taken to heart and survive to this day .
One such example is William Walker 's Southern Harmony , first printed in New Haven in 1835 , revised several times and there are those who still sing from a current printing of a facsimile editions of the version of 1854 .
Another is Benjamin Franklin White 's Sacred Harp , first published in 1844 , most recently revised in 1991 .
The Fasola tradition , which uses shape note notation , is one of unaccompanied singing , that is , without any assistance by instruments .
Thus when singing shape - note hymns it is the practice first to " sing the notes " , that is , to sing the fa-sol - la syllables corresponding to the shapes in the music before singing the text .
This serves to set the tune in memory and enables persons to more easily sight - read previously unseen or unheard music .
Tunes are sung in relative pitch , rather than at an absolute pitch derived from A=440 Hz. ; referred to as " Pitch of Convenience " , a long standing tradition as can be seen from directions for setting the first Note from the Bay Psalm Book .

Tonic Sol-fa ::
Key words :
J. S. Curwen

Tonic Sol-fa
Curwen Institute
functional solmization
Galin- Paris - Chevé
fixed do solfeggio
moveable do solfeggio 1 Tonic Sol-fa In 1840s England , J. S. Curwen ( 1816 - 1880 ) introduced a system , earlier developed by Sarah Glover of Norwich ( 1785 - 1867 ) in her Scheme for Rendering Psalmody Congregational ( 1835 ) , which was designed to help in the sight - reading of music .
The system was called the Tonic Sol - fa method .
Curwen 's method later incorporated French time names ( derived from Aime Paris 's Langue de durées ) and devised pitch hand signs which , in a modified form , are familiar to contemporary music teachers as part of the popular Kodály method .
John Curwen was an English congregational minister and he had taught himself to read music using Sarah Glover 's book as an introduction to the idea of Tonic Sol - fa .
Religious and social ideals of equality motivated him to create and promulgate an entire method of teaching based on this idea , for he believed that music should be the inheritance of all classes and ages of people .
At considerable expense to himself , he published his own writings , which included a journal entitled Tonic Sol - fa Reporter and Magazine of Vocal Music for the People .
After 1864 he resigned his ministry to devote most of his time to what had become a true movement in mass music education .
He and his son John Spencer Curwen incorporated a publishing firm , J. Curwen & Sons , eventually adding Tonic Sol - Fa Agency to its name .
It became an important publisher of educational music .
In 1869 John Curwen established the Tonic Sol - Fa College , which just over 100 years later established the Curwen Institute in London .
Though Curwen did not truly invent Tonic Sol - fa , he developed a distinct method of applying it in music education , one that included both rhythm and pitch .
William McNaught , a devoted student of the Tonic Sol - fa Method , is said by his son to have thought of it as " musicianship of the mind with the voice as its instrument . "
You may remember that middle ' c ' is named ' sol fa ut ' in medieval music theory ( see above ) and that the ' c ' one octave above ' middle c ' is named ' sol fa ' .
It is from these two syllables ' sol ' and ' fa ' that the system derives its name and explains the presence of the hyphen between ' sol ' and ' fa ' .
The essence of the Curwen system is that the key - note ( or tonic ) is called ' doh ' .
It is followed , in an ascending major scale , by the notes ' ray ' , ' me ' , ' fah ' , ' soh ' , ' lah ' , ' te ' before returning to ' doh ' , one octave higher than the first ' doh ' .
' doh ' is moveable - in other words , it depends on the key in which the piece of music is set , which note will be ' doh ' .
In fact , ' doh ' is always the key - note .
Curwen 's system , called functional solmization , uses names to describe a note 's function ( tonic , dominant , etc. ) rather than its pitch , and contrasts with the continental system where ' doh ' is immoveable and always represents the note ' c ' whatever the key in which the piece of music is written .
Curwen 's note names are actually no more than an anglicised form of Guido d'Arezzo 's nomenclature with ' doh ' replacing ' ut ' and the addition of ' te ' for the seventh note of the scale which is otherwise absent because d'Arezzo names only the six notes of the hexachord .
An apparent disadvantage is a lack of chromatic notes or any distinction between the same note but in different octaves .
Here Curwen appears to have turned to the Galin - Paris - Chevé moveable do system named after Pierre Galin [ Exposition d'une Nouvelle méthode ( 1818 ) ] and Émile - Joseph Chevé ( 1804 - 1864 ) , Chevé 's wife Nanine Paris and Nanine 's brother Aimé Paris ( 1798 - 1866 ) [ E. Chevé ( Mme Nanine Paris ) Méthode élémentaire de musique vocale ( 1864 ) ; E. Chevé ( M. & Mme ) Méthode élémentaire d'harmonie ( 1846 ) ; E. Chevé ( M. & Mme ) Exercices élémentaires de lecture musicale à l'usage des écoles primaires ( 1860 ) ] .
This system named the notes of an ascending major scale , starting on the tonic , with the numerals 1 - 7. 0 denotes a rest .
The use of numerals harks back to a suggestion made in 1742 by Jean - Jacques Rousseau although the idea was not new .
Similar proposals had been made by in France by Jean Jacques Souhaitty ( 1667 ) and in England by William Braythwaite ( 1638 ) .
The Galin - Paris - Chevé system used dots placed above or below a numeral to identify the octave of that particular note .
Other schemes included ticks , or different cases or print styles .
Today , scale syllables have become more standardised and include chromatic notes .
in ' fixed do ' solfeggio , the notes of the chromatic scale are named using the solfeggio or Latin names which in French , English , Italian and German are : rising or ascending scale C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B natural
H ( German ) c do
ut ( French ) di re
ré ( French ) ri mi fa fi sol
so ( English ) si la li ti
si ( Continent ) do
ut ( French ) falling or descending scale c B natural
H ( German ) B flat
B ( German ) A Ab G Gb F E Eb D Db C do
ut ( French ) ti
si ( Continent ) te la le sol
so ( English ) se fa mi me re
ré ( French ) ra do
ut ( French ) Some writers call the Aretinian or solfeggio syllables ' Italian ' when they are actually derived from a verse in ' Latin ' from syllables of which Guido d'Arezzo took his note names , with some additions and modifications as noted above ( for example replacing si with ti for B natural ) .
Using a ' moveable do ' system , full chromaticism is not needed , because a tune is normally re-notated into each new key , by re-positioning the do ( or ut in French ) , even if that key lasts only for a few bars .
Some , however , hold to the view that using Tonic Sol - fa with full chromaticism loses the advantages of simplicity and readability .
In this case no distinction is made between chromatic notes .
So G flat , G natural and G sharp are all named sol under solmisation although the correct inflection is used when naming notes other than under solmisation , i.e. sol bemolle ( G flat ) , sol ( G natural ) and sol diesis ( G sharp ) .
In Italy , as in other parts of Continental Europe , when chromatic names are not being used , many teachers use si not for G sharp but , as in the modified Latin system , for B natural .

Oh , bollocks !
After hearing for days that Verizon Wireless would be pushing out the highly anticipated Android 2.1 update to its stable of Droid users , along comes this .
Internal company documentation clearly states that the aforementioned update wo n't be going down today , and there 's no clear indication of when it will .
To quote : We knew things were just too quiet after the noon hour , and now we know why .
An impromptu support group meeting has been scheduled for 1:30 PM ET , though we 're hearing the location is still being decided ...
RUDD : It ’s one of the most specific , inventive , amazing movies ever !
REUBENS : I did n’t write it as a kids ’ movie .
I wrote it to have a wide range .
I still have kids who come up to me and say , “ That moment when Large Marge turned around — I still ca n’t watch ! ’
It ’s like the people in my generation who , if you mention Walt Disney , will within 30 seconds start reliving scenes of the wicked stepmother from Sleeping Beauty [ 1959 ] .
There were just things in Disney movies that probably were too scary for kids . . .
RUDD : Big Adventure was Tim Burton ’s first film , right ?
That seems like a match made in heaven .
REUBENS : Tim went to CalArts , strangely enough , but he was there after me and we did n’t know each other .
I turned in the script of the movie with a list of about 200 directors I had gotten out of a directors ’ book who I thought were good .
The studio then settled on one director who was n’t on my list and that I thought was absolutely wrong .
I made a stupid stink to my manager about it , and my manager said , “ Are you crazy ?
You have a green - light approved movie if you go with this guy they are asking for . ”
I said , “ I ’m sorry .
It ’s not the right guy .
I spent 15 years getting to this point .
I gotta have the right director .
Someone who can put their own stamp on it . ”
So I went to a party , and somebody at the party had just seen Frankenweenie [ 1984 ] , Tim Burton ’s short film that he made for Disney .
Shelley Duvall was in Frankenweenie , and I knew Shelley , and so I called Shelley and she said , “ Oh my god , Paul , you and he are so perfect together . ”
When I screened the short film the next day , I knew in the first six shots that I wanted him to do it .
It was absolutely incredible .
It was the biggest piece of luck early on in my career that I could have had .
We were completely simpatico .
He was 26 years old at the time .
My friends would come on the set and go , “ Which one ’s the director ? ”
And I ’d point him out , and they ’d go , “ Come on , no .
Where ?
Which one ’s the director ? ”
RUDD : Did you ever hate the character and want to move on without ever going back ?
REUBENS : I never really thought that the character was over with .
I ’ve been so widely quoted as saying it ’s over , and I ’m never doing it , and it ’s dead and all that .
But I never said any of that .
After five seasons of the CBS show , I was so exhausted .
I needed a nice big break from the character , and I took it .
I ’ve wanted to redo it for a long time , but the timing was never really right .
And I have been doing other work as an actor , which is exciting .
And I feel like I ’ve finally found that balance as an actor of working on other people ’s films and on this one at the same time .
I never really had that at the peak of Pee - wee Herman .
I did n’t have time to do anything other than Pee - wee .
I feel really good about the film script .
We did a - roundtable - reading recently , and I ’m very excited .
In the series we never left the playhouse .
But in the film we go completely out of the playhouse .
It ’s all the puppets , particularly those giant clunky puppets that should never be out of the - playhouse , on a full - on road - trip epic adventure .
There ’s something funny about that right off the bat .
I mean , Chairry should never be out of the playhouse !

Well , They Are At It Again
[ UPDATE 12 Feb 2010 : Well , I found a CRU letter that describes the update process ( in comments below ) and it ’s not pretty .
It looks like there is no particular “ ready date ” for the GHCN data set .
While the data are supposed to be ready a few days after the end of the month ( the first distribution of monthly data between national meteorology departments is supposed to happen the 4th of the month ) the process as described by Phil Jones in one of the ClimateGate emails is far more ersatz and has no specific bounds on when data are to be thought ready enough to use .
In particular there is a second distribution that is supposed to happen between the 18th and the 20th of the month ( implied as a quality update ) that might well have entirely missing records included .
So it looks like you never know when the data are ‘ ready ’ .
It is n’t when the data set appears , nor even when it is updated , nor even the end of the month .
So at this point we ’ll have to treat these as “ missing in action ” lists rather than KIA .
At least for another week or two .
Also , Dallas Fort Worth has been found in the “ failed QA file ” .
It would seem that rather than having a record with a - 9999 missing data flag , the record is simply dropped until such month as there is a valid datum , then the record comes back , but with the - 9999 flag for the failed month . ]
Do n’t know what to make of this list yet , other than it directly ‘ gives the lie ’ to the assertion that thermometer ‘ drops ’ were / are entirely an artifact of GHCN being a creation at a historical moment in time ( i.e. made in 1990 ’s era so that ’s why they drop out then in The Great Dying of Thermometers – which itself ignores The Lesser Dying in 2006 ) .
It also shows that the excuse of things being dropped for not electronically reporting is pretty much a lie , too .
I note that Dallas Fort Worth Airport is on this list and I ’m pretty sure they have electronic reporting …
From the NASA / GISS web site , as confirmation :
(*) Dallas - Fort W 32.9 N 97.0 W 425722590000 4,037,000 1947 – 2009
Note the end date of 2009 .
And Strasbourg airport is on the list too , so it ’s not just an America thing …
I ’ve not examined this list for any patterns , nor re-done any of the prior “ by latitude ” and “ by altitude ” reports to see what the changes do to the world .
For now , it ’s just another “ Dig Here ” list .
( Though a casual look at the altitude field shows a fair number of 1000 m and 2000 m stations died . )
Oh , and the list is also confirmation that the extraordinary hatred of thermometers shown by the managers of GHCN continues , unabated .
Particular emphasis seems to have landed on Africa ( already poorly covered ) and Asia , with a modest effort to eradicate more of South America .
By comparison , Europe is only slightly mauled …
[ chiefio@Hummer data ] $ wc -l 2009_uniq_station_list
1597 2009_uniq_station_list
[ chiefio@Hummer data ] $ wc -l 2010_uniq_station_list
1113 2010_uniq_station_list
So from 1597 we drop to 1113 .
That ’s a drop of 30 % .
Just shy of 1/3 of the stations , taken out back and shot this year .
But once you decided that you can just make up any missing data , then who needs to actually read the thermometers any more ?
Ok , enough of my complaint .
Here is the list .
If anyone notices anything interesting about their part of the world , feel free to let us all know .
Remember that the StationID ( that first field ) is structured as 1 digit of continent then 2 that tell the particular country , then 8 for the particular station and substation .
So records that start with 1 are Africa , 2 Asia , 3 South America , 4 North America , 5 Pacific , 6 Europe , 7 Antarctica , 8 Ships at sea ( a very few geographic spots with few records as a ship happens by and reports ) .
I will break up the list into groups by continent , but notice that there are no “ 8 ” stations on the list and only one from Antarctica .
Oh , and there were 2 stations added , so I ’ll list them here at the top :

Off the right hand edge of the table ( not visible on some browsers ) are some of the technical fields , like the A flag for “ Airstation ” ( where you often see 1 x - 9 for a rural non-airport and 1A - 9 for a “ rural ” airport .
The A is airport while x is not .
You can shrink the font size or just look at the page source if you wish to see the rest of the record .
The only ‘ interesting bit ’ other than the A flag is the imagination applied to the ‘ terrain type ’ ; where what used to be in a surrounding region when a map was made ages ago , is what is asserted to be present today ( where Dallas Fort Worth Airport is described as warm fields and woods … in the midst of one of the more extended urban areas on the planet … ) .
If folks really care , I ’ll put the same data in as ‘ ragged right ’ so you can see it easily .
Oh , and those first two numbers after the name are LAT and LON followed by reported elevation and elevation from a map grid .
Then the Urban Suburban Rural flag .
Also visible ought to be population in thousands and then the start of a block of codes ( that includes the airstation flag ) .
A -9 population is rural .
Zugverkehr : Osten protestiert gegen Bummel - Bahn
Mit ihren jüngsten Streichplänen hängt die Deutsche Bahn AG vor allem Sachsen und Thüringen noch weiter ab .
Das regt nicht nur die Grünen , sondern auch CDU und FDP auf .
DRESDEN taz |
In Sachsen und Thüringen regt sich breiter Widerstand gegen die jüngste Streichliste der Deutschen Bahn und ihre Pläne zum Fahrplanwechsel im Dezember .
Anlass ist einerseits die Verschiebung längst überfälliger Ausbaumaßnahmen auf den Strecken von Leipzig und Berlin nach Dresden oder auf der so genannten Sachsen - Franken - Magistrale nach Nürnberg .
Aber auch das Angebot von ICE - Zügen von Berlin Richtung München über Leipzig wird halbiert und alle zwei Stunden auf kürzerem Weg über Halle geführt .
In Ost - West - Richtung von Frankfurt / Main nach Dresden werden die Bahnhöfe Eisenach und Weimar nur noch im Zweistundentakt bedient .
Grund für die Fahrplanausdünnung sind nach wie vor ungelöste Probleme mit der Neigetechnik , die höhere Kurvengeschwindigkeiten erlauben würde .
Erneut müssen ICE - Züge zum Austausch von Radsätzen in die Werkstätten .
Diese Probleme hatten bereits auf der kurvenreichen Franken - Magistrale zu Fahrzeitverlängerungen und einem kleinerem Angebot geführt .
Die erneute Verschlechterung der Bahnanbindung hat in Sachsen nicht nur bei den Grünen , sondern auch bei den Regierungsparteien Union und FDP das Fass zum Überlaufen gebracht .
" Es darf nicht sein , dass der Freistaat so zum Abstellgleis wird " , ließ sich Ministerpräsident Stanislaw Tillich vernehmen .
In Dresden schrieben die Mitglieder des so genannten Kulturquartiers , ein Zusammenschluss von Kultur - und Tourismusinstitutionen , einen offenen Brief an Bahnchef Rüdiger Grube .
Auch Thüringens Verkehrsminister Christian Carius ( CDU ) beklagte die Einschränkungen .
Sein Amtskollege Karl - Heinz Daehre ( CDU ) in Sachsen - Anhalt sieht den neuen ICE - Halt in Halle " mit einem lachenden und einem weinenden Auge " , weil der Osten generell eine bessere Bahnanbindung brauche .
Schon 2008 hatte eine Studie des Hamburger Weltwirtschaftsinstituts Chemnitz , Leipzig und Dresden als die am schlechtesten auf der Schiene erreichbaren Großstädte Deutschlands bezeichnet .
Das Bundesverkehrsministerium gab im gleichen Jahr das EU - Projekt eines Entwicklungskorridors nach Prag auf .
Auch die Anbindung der Grenzstadt Görlitz hat sich verschlechtert .
Geradezu blamabel erscheinen die Verhältnisse auf der Strecke Dresden - Berlin , die von der Dampflok 03 im Jahr 1937 schon einmal in 100 Minuten bewältigt wurde und für die man heute 37 Minuten länger braucht .

The Trailhead Queen was dead .
At first , there was no overt sign that her long life was ending : no fever , no spasms , no farewells .
She simply sat on the floor of the royal chamber and died .
As in life , her body was prone and immobile , her legs and antennae relaxed .
Her stillness alone failed to give warning to her daughters that a catastrophe had occurred for all of them .
She lay there , in fact , as though nothing had happened .
She had become a perfect statue of herself .
While humans and other vertebrates have an internal skeleton surrounded by soft tissue that quickly rots away , ants are encased in an external skeleton ; their soft tissues shrivel into dry threads and lumps , but their exoskeletons remain , a knight ’s armor fully intact long after the knight is gone .
Hence the workers were at first unaware of their mother ’s death .
Her quietude said nothing , and the odors of her life , still rising from her , signalled , I remain among you .
She smelled alive .
The deception was made easier by the fact that in life she had never given orders or led them in activities of any kind — even though she could have performed all their tasks if she chose .
She had taken the only initiatives she ever took all in a burst , at the beginning of her adult life , when she had abandoned the colony of her birth and , along with it , her mother and her sisters .
First , she had spread her four membranous wings and flown into the air .
There , she ’d joined a swarm of flying males and other virgin queens .
One of the males had caught her .
He ’d clamped his legs around her body , and the couple had spiralled down to the ground .
On landing , he had used the large claspers at the rear end of his body to hold their genitalia together as he completed the insemination .
Within five minutes , the act was finished , and the queen shook the male loose .
All the sperm she had received flowed up into a special bag - shaped organ in her abdomen , where it would stay until called on to fertilize her eggs .
It might last for years into the future .
Each sperm was endowed with a potential life span equal to her own .
In contrast , the father of all her children was programmed to die almost immediately after the mating .
The only thing that he had ever done was accept meals regurgitated to him by his sisters , as if he were a nestling bird , and wait , and wait some more , and finally take the one short flight from his home , followed by five minutes of copulation .
In other words , the male was no more than a guided missile loaded with sperm , his life ’s work a single ejaculation .
Afterward , he was left with only one instruction , to be enforced if necessary by his sisters :
Do n’t come back .
He had been issued a one - way ticket .
He had no chance at all of survival .
A delicate creature , he could not find food , or feed himself if he stumbled across some .
He would die by dehydration , or crushed in the beak of a bird , or chopped into pieces by the jaws of an enemy ant , or , less quickly , pierced by the bloodsucking proboscis of an assassin bug .
To escape the same fate , the newly mated future Queen of the Trailhead Colony , full - brained and powerfully muscled , hurried to find shelter .
She had to get back underground as quickly as possible .
First , however , she had to take a few minutes to shed her wings .
To do that , she simply bent her middle legs forward , pressed them against the base of the wings , and snapped them off .
This mutilation caused no injury to the rest of her body ; it caused no pain .
The Queen was a parachutist who slipped her harness upon landing .
Now she could move more quickly to avoid the ants , spiders , and other predators hunting around her in the grassroots jungle .
Soon she came upon an open space between grass clumps , a small clearing at the Lake Nokobee trailhead .
By luck she had found an ideal site to build a nest .
She began at once to dig a vertical tunnel in the sandy clay soil .
Her movements were swift and precise , and within minutes she had deepened the shaft to more than her body length .
This provided her some degree of protection , but she needed to proceed as quickly as possible .
Her life remained in constant danger .
At a predetermined depth , which she measured by the time it took her to climb up and down the shaft , the young Queen turned to the side and began to excavate a wider space .
She continued until she had fashioned a round chamber about three times wider than the vertical shaft .
Her safety was now enhanced but not insured .
Predators and marauding ants could still climb down the shaft to attack her .
But at least now the enemies would be confined to a narrow space by the walls of the shaft and forced to confront the young Queen ’s thrusting stinger and snapping jaws head on before they could reach her vulnerable body .
Even with the excavation of the first chamber complete , the Trailhead Queen had heavy work ahead .
First , she laid a small cluster of eggs on the earthen floor .
These tiny objects she was compelled to lick continuously .
It was an urgent task : to the peril from enemies above was now added the threat of bacteria and fungi teeming in the soil all around her .
If the eggs were not regularly cleaned and coated with antibiotic saliva , they would soon be overgrown by an invading mold and consumed .
From a single bacterium in the soil , millions could proliferate on any ant tissue left unprotected .
But the dice fell right for the Queen of the Trailhead Colony .
As tiny larvae hatched from her eggs , she fed them food secreted from a large gland that partly filled her head and emptied through her mouth .
This baby food was manufactured from her own fat stores and was created by the metabolism of her now useless wing muscles .
From the reserves of her own body , the young Queen reared a dozen workers .
All were female .
They were tiny and weak , barely able to perform the work necessary for the little colony to survive .
By necessity , they came into the world as midgets .
If each had been larger , fewer of them could have been reared — too few to provide sufficient labor for the survival of the newborn colony .
Some of these pioneers , guided entirely by instinct , because no one existed to teach them , set out to forage for food .
Others took care of the Queen and reared the next generation of workers to maturity .
Still others devoted time to enlarging the nest .
Failure to perform all these tasks with exactitude would have meant death for the colony .
The young Queen could no longer help .
She herself desperately needed help to continue living .
Her expendable body tissues were depleted .
They had almost all been fed to the larval daughters , and now she was starving .
The first foragers venturing timidly away from the nest were able to bring back a few scraps of food .
Their prizes included a fallen mosquito , a bit of shed caterpillar skin , and a newly hatched spiderling , which was enough to keep the colony alive and allow the Queen to regain some of her weight and strength .
The workers of the next generation , raised on food harvested from terrain outside the nest , were somewhat larger and stronger than the first generation .
They began to dig out more tunnels to accommodate the growing population .
As the colony expanded , its home became a labyrinth of chambers and connecting galleries — an enemy - proof fortress .
A mound of excavated soil formed above it , reinforcing the roof and retaining the warmth of the sun .
As the months passed , the Queen , growing heavy with egg - filled ovaries , retreated ever deeper into the earth , distancing herself from the still dangerous nest exterior .
She had become an extreme specialist : she laid eggs , while the workers performed all the labor necessary to raise her offspring , their sisters .
They were the Queen ’s hands and feet and jaws , and increasingly they replaced her brain .
They functioned together as a well - organized whole , dividing up the tasks without regard to their own welfare .
The Trailhead Colony began to resemble a large , diffuse organism .
In a word , it became a superorganism .
By the time the colony had reached its full mature size , two years after the nuptial flight of the Queen , it contained more than ten thousand workers .
It was able , in the following year , to rear virgin queens , and males , and through them to give birth to new colonies .
By that time the Queen was producing eggs at the average rate of one every fifteen minutes .
Heavy and torpid , she lay in the royal chamber at the bottom of the subterranean nest , five feet below the surface , a distance of four hundred ant lengths .
By human scale , the ant city was the equivalent of two hundred underground stories .
The mound of excavated soil capping the nest added another fifty stories aboveground .
The Queen may not have been the leader of this miniature civilization , but she was the fountainhead of all its energies and growth , the key to its success or failure .
The metronomic pumping out of fertilized eggs from her twenty ovaries was the heartbeat of the colony .
The ultimate purpose of all the workers ’ labor — their careful construction of the nest , their readiness to risk their lives in daily searches for food , their suicidal defense of the nest entrance — was that she continue to create more altruistic workers like themselves .
One worker , or a thousand workers , could die and the colony would go on , repairing itself as needed .
But the failure of the Queen would be fatal .
Now , after twenty more years , the catastrophe had occurred .
The death of the Queen was the greatest challenge the colony had faced since the days of its founding .
Yet the workers could not take action until they were certain that the Queen was dead .
Already , they knew that something was not right , that something unnamed had settled upon them , but they did not yet realize the extent of the problem .
So the Trailhead Colony thrummed on for a while longer with bustle and precision .
Like a large ship at sea , it could not be easily diverted from the shoals in front of it .

Because ants live most of their lives in underground darkness , they cannot communicate through sight or sound .
Pheromonal , they think only in taste and smell .
The members of the Trailhead Colony transmitted their messages using about a dozen chemical signals , which they picked up by smelling one another constantly with sweeps of their antennae .
An ant who was well fed said to a less well - fed nest mate , Smell this , and if you are hungry eat .
If the ant approached and was in fact hungry , she extended her tongue , and the donor ant rewarded her by regurgitating liquid directly into her mouth .
When a wood thrush flew by the Trailhead mound carrying a grasshopper to her own nest and dropped part of the crushed insect to the ground , a patrolling worker found it in less than a minute and triggered a chain action .
The worker examined the grasshopper , tasted it briefly , then ran back to the nest entrance .
On the way , she touched the tip of her abdomen repeatedly to the ground , laying down a thin trail of chemicals .
Entering the nest , she rushed up to each nest mate she passed , brushing her face close to theirs .
With their antennae , her nest mates detected both the trail substance and the smell of grasshopper .
The signals now proclaimed , Food .
I have found food .
Follow my trail !
Soon a mob of ants ran out , followed the trail , and gathered around the delicious grasshopper haunch .
Some of the first to arrive ran back to the nest , laying trails of their own , reinforcing the message , saying , Come on , come on , we need help .
The ants still by the grasshopper piece began to drag it toward the nest entrance .
A catbird perched on the branch of a nearby tree saw the activity and swept down to investigate .
She pecked at the grasshopper , scattering the ants and injuring several .
The ants expelled a pheromone from a gland that opened at the base of their jaws .
A chemical vapor spread fast .
It shouted , Danger !
Emergency !
Run !
First we did n't know who shouted " Baby Killer ! " at Rep. Bart Stupak last night , during the health care debate .
Joe Barton knew , but he was n't talking .
Then , we found out :
It was Lubbock 's own Rep. Randy Neugebauer , which , according to Jim anyway , sounded familiar .
Neugebauer .
Neugebauer .
Neugebauer .
( Also : It 's fun to say . )
Schutze just knew he'd heard that name before .
And so off to the Nexis database he went -- clearly , he 's got a column due and is procrastinating .
And so , after the jump , you 'll find what he likes to call Great Moments in History with Randy Neugebauer .
One in a series of one .
Collect 'em all .
Great Moments in History with Randy Neugebauer by Jim Schutze
November 21 , 2008 : Randy Neugebauer , Republican congressman from Lubbock , Texas , opposes bail - out for American auto industry : " I am not convinced that further government spending will address the issues of these struggling automotive companies or our economy . "
February 19 , 2009 : Neugebauer opposes mortgage relief : " I remain concerned that the government could be rewarding borrowers and lenders who made poor investment decisions at the expense of families who made responsible decisions . "
February 21 , 2009 : Neugebauer attacks Obama administration for proposing stimulus spending .
" They never were selling the plan .
They were selling fear . "
April 15 , 2009 : Neugebauer compares President Obama to England 's King George III : " We 've got the government picking winners and losers in the economy .
That 's exactly what the king of England was doing , picking winners and losers based on who they were . "
May 20 , 2009 : Neugebauer opposes Obama 's proposed fuel efficiency standards : " I believe the administration cannot continue to tinker with the economy and enact standards that will place greater burden on hardworking Americans , stifle the economy and hinder an already struggling automotive industry . "
June 26 , 2009 : Federal Election Commission rules that Neugebauer may pay himself for the use of his own private yacht , harbored in the Washington area , for parties to raise political donations for himself .
" The congressman appreciates today 's ruling from the FEC and will abide by the guidelines that have been put forth , " says Chanda Allen , campaign spokeswoman .
June 30 , 2009 : Neugebauer is one of three Texas Congressional members to sponsor bill requiring presidential candidates to prove they were born in America -- the so - called Birther Bill .

" The people that elected you are obviously idiots , " Olbermann says on his show .
August 17 , 2009 : Despite disavowals by members of his own party , Neugebar continues to support claim that President Obama wants to create " death panels " to kill old people .
" This is yet another example of the terrible flaws in this legislation , " Neugebauer says .
August 28 , 2009 : Neugebauer announces $ 250,000 fund - raising goal to knock off liberal incumbents .
" All sorts of people have come up and asked me , ' What can we do to stop a lot of the things going on in our country ? ' "

" I deeply regret that my actions were mistakenly interpreted as a direct reference to Congressman Stupak himself . "
Right now , healthcare reform is the subject of a fierce partisan debate in Washington DC .
There 's a reason for this :
The US healthcare system is really messed up .
It needs fixing .
Recognizing this does n't need to be partisan .
Sure , Democrats , Republicans , and libertarians may have vastly different ideas of how to fix the system , and no compromise may be possible , but there is a lot to be depressed about .
Fotini Christia , a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who has recently spent time in Afghanistan , sets out the latest ideas on how to measure the success of such operations .
As the biggest anti-Taliban offensive in Afghanistan since 2001 continues , the challenge of how to hold on to and rebuild areas previously held by insurgents remains .
Like a magician who says , " Pick a card , any card , " Stanford University computer scientist Debashis Sahoo , PhD , seemed to be offering some kind of trick when he asked researchers at the Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine to pick any two genes already known to be involved in stem cell development .
Finding such genes can take years and hundreds of thousands of dollars , but Sahoo was promising the skeptical stem cell scientists that , in a fraction of a second and for practically zero cost , he could find new genes involved in the same developmental pathway as the two genes provided .
Sahoo went on to show that this amazing feat could actually be performed .
The proof - of - principle for his idea , to be published online March 15 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , opens a powerful , mathematical route for conducting stem cell research and shows the power of interdisciplinary collaborations in science .
It also demonstrates that using computers to mine existing databases can radically accelerate research in the laboratory .
Ultimately , it may lead to advances in diverse areas of medicine such as disease diagnosis or cancer therapy .
Biologists have long used math and statistics in their work .
In the simplest case , when looking for genes involved in a certain biological process , they look for genes that have a symmetrical correlation .
For instance , if they know gene A is involved in a certain process , they try to determine if gene C is correlated with gene A during the same process .
Four years ago , while studying for his doctorate in electrical engineering with advisor David Dill , PhD , professor of computer science , and co-advisor Sylvia Plevritis , PhD , associate professor of radiology , Sahoo took an immunology class and realized that many of the relationships in biology are not symmetric , but asymmetric .
As an analogy , Sahoo noted that trees bearing fruit almost certainly have leaves , but trees outside of the fruiting season may or may not have leaves , depending on the time of year .
Sahoo and Dill realized that these asymmetric relationships could be found by applying Boolean logic , in which the researchers established a series of if / then rules and then searched data for candidates that satisfied all the rules .
For example , scientists might know that gene A is very active at the beginning of cell development , and gene C is active much later .
By screening large public databases , Sahoo can find the genes that are almost never active when A is active , and almost always active when C is active , in many other types of cells .
Researchers can then test to determine whether these genes become active between the early and late stages of development .
In the paper , lead author Sahoo looked at gene expression patterns in the development of an immunological cell called a B cell .
Starting with two known B - cell genes , Sahoo searched through databases with thousands of gene products in milliseconds and found 62 genes that matched the patterns he would expect to see for genes that got turned on in between the activation of the two genes he started with .
He then examined databases involving 41 strains of laboratory mice that had been engineered to be deficient in one or more of the 62 genes .
Of those 41 strains , 26 had defects in B cell development .
" This was the validation of the method , " Sahoo said .
" Biologists are really amazed that , with just a computer algorithm , in milliseconds I can find genes that it takes them a really long time to isolate in the lab . "
He added that he was especially gratified that the information comes from databases that are widely available and from which other scientists have already culled information .
Sahoo is now using the technique to find new genes that play a role in developing cancers .
" This shows that computational analysis of existing data can provide clues about where researchers should look next , " he said .
" This is something that could have an impact on cancer .
It 's exciting . "

PARENTS looking to steer their teens away from drugs may want to encourage them stay in bed longer .
Lack of sleep seems to lead to increased drug use – not the other way around , as many researchers previously concluded – and this is likely to be a pattern of behaviour that teenagers acquire from their friends .
“ Your sleep is going to influence my sleep and that will make me more likely to do drugs , ” says Sara Mednick , a neuroscientist at the University of California , San Diego , who led the study .
Establishing whether one behaviour leads to another …
Today 's youth are generally not the self - centered , antisocial slackers that previous research has made them out to be , according to a provocative new study co-authored by a Michigan State University psychologist .
In a scientific analysis of nearly a half - million high - school seniors spread over three decades , MSU 's Brent Donnellan and Kali Trzesniewski of the University of Western Ontario argue teens today are no more egotistical -- and just as happy and satisfied -- as previous generations .
" We concluded that , more often than not , kids these days are about the same as they were back in the mid-1970s , " said Donnellan , associate professor of psychology .
The study appears in the research journal Perspectives on Psychological Science .
Donnellan acknowledges that many people will be surprised by the findings , which refute previous studies classifying today 's youth as selfish loafers with extremely high levels of self - esteem .
But while much previous research has relied on " convenience studies " of relatively small samples of young adults , Donnellan said , the current study analyzes the psychological profile data of 477,380 high school seniors from 1976 to 2006 .
The data comes from the University of Michigan 's federally funded Monitoring the Future survey , which each year tracks the behaviors , attitudes and values of American students .
In other findings :
Today 's youth are more cynical and less trusting of institutions than previous generations .
But Donnellan said this is generally true of the broader population .
The current generation is less fearful of social problems such as race relations , hunger , poverty and energy shortages .
Today 's youth have higher educational expectations .
Ultimately , Donnellan said , it 's common for older generations to paint youth in a negative light -- as lazy and self - absorbed , for example -- which can perpetuate stereotypes .
It can be easy , he added , to forget what it 's like to grow up .
" Kids today are like they were 30 years ago -- they 're trying to find their place in the world , they 're trying to carve out an identity , and it can be difficult , " Donnellan said .
" But lots of research shows that the stereotypes of all groups are much more overdrawn than the reality . "
" It ’s not me , which is one silver lining to this entire story because at least I can point to it and say , ‘ Look , that ’s not me . ’
It ’s not the picture that I have in my passport and it ’s not the picture that I have on my face that I walk around with every day , " he said .
The Tech - Savvy Marussia Car is Russia 's First Sportscar
The images above are of Marussia , Russia 's first sportscar .
Nikolai Fomenko is the designer behind Marussia 's launch ; Fomenko 's creation is an electric car with a six - cylinder engine that will hit 100 kph in five seconds flat .
The Marussia car 's high - tech interior is comprised of video screens , GPS , Bluetooth , and a 4GB Yota network .
This Russian supercar will set you back around $ 100,000 when it is released .
Implications -
The creators of futuristic car models that are tech - savvy factor in modern consumer trends such as the move towards eco-friendly consumption .
Consumers are looking to stay ahead of the game on what is up and coming , and businesses fulfilling this need by incorporating current patterns into futuristic projections will see considerable profit and consumption levels from the general public as well as those wishing to live in luxury .

New RIAA Plan ' Just A Scarecrow '
All for show , to scare off P2P users ...
Remember about a year ago , when the RIAA leaked word to the Wall Street Journal that they were replacing their misguided tactic of suing grandmothers and college students with a new anti-piracy system ?
That system involved ISPs , who would implement piracy filters and voluntarily boot heavy P2P users from the network .
Of course as 2009 progressed the ISPs made it clear they wanted nothing to do with the RIAA 's system , and a year later the program -- which supposedly already had companies like AT&T and Comcast on board -- is nowhere to be found .
CNET takes a look at what happened to the plan : quote : Multiple music sources have told me over the past month the RIAA leaders were feeling pressure to drop the lawsuit campaign , but were also being lobbied by some at the labels to put some kind of deterrent in place , even if totally toothless .
They did n't want the public to think there were n't any consequences to pirating music , even if the reality was exactly that .
According to those sources , the announcement about the ISP strategy last December was little more than a scarecrow .
That 's not to say that ISPs have n't That 's not to say that ISPs have n't ramped up the number of warnings they 've sent users to keep the entertainment industry and lawmakers at bay , but those warnings remain largely toothless .
Only one ISP we know of ( Cox Communications ) admits to actually booting repeat offenders from the network , and Cox tells us they only wind up booting a tiny fraction of their customer base -- after giving them countless warnings to scale back their P2P usage .
This wo n't make a dent in piracy , so it still only seems like a matter of time before Uncle Sam is convinced by his Hollywood friends to pass a law forcing ISPs to boot users and implement filters .
We 're curious : how many " Notice of Claim of Copyright Infringements " have you received from your ISPs ?
Have you ignored them ?
Has there been consequences for ignoring them ?

Clarksville , TN 2 recommendations cline3621 Premium Member Times change , so has the media , and medium .
Now , flash forward 27 years , to the present , where most people under the age of 20 have never seen or held a cassette tape , or vinyl record .
They have their Ipod , or in my case the Archos 5 internet media tablet , which is better than the Ipod .
( Take that Apple ! )
Why is people recording ( or copying ) music from a disinterested 3rd party , like a website , newsgroup or p2p a problem to the RIAA ?
I do n't think its any different than the alternative we had in the 1980's .
Just my personal opinion .
Also before the corporate shills show up and call me a thief , and so on , I pay for Napster , I 've been paying for Napster for about 3 years now , and will continue to pay for their service as long as i get value for my money .
Or I completely download their entire catalog , and use tunebite to remove the drm .
( I better buy more multi- terabyte hard drives then )
You want to know the reason most people pirate ?
Convenience !
It 's usually cheap or free , there is no drm , ( I remove the drm that comes with Napster ) you get what you want in a timely manner , and so on .
When you want to be legal about something its usually the complete opposite of the qualities I listed above .
I remember getting into a pissing match with some lady at Microsoft years ago , due to getting a scratched windows98 oem cd .
They wanted me to pay $ 50 to have a replacement sent to me after paying for the original copy .
I think the lady on the other end of the phone got pissed when I laughed in her face , and told her , " No thanks ma'am , I 'm gonna borrow my friends cd and make a copy " .
See ?
That was convenient for me .
And yes I did make a copy of a Win98SE OEM cd .
If and when its convenient for a person to pay for legal media , be it music , movies or software , most people will .
Case in point .
My copy of Windows 7 .
Totally legit , other than Vista this is the only other OS I 've paid for , because it was convenient !
I downloaded Windows 7 Ultimate X64 from Microsoft in about 1 hour , paid them $ 139 for it , and got emailed the key .
It was that simple .
Unfortunately until the old geezers pushing their " its 1970 " business model go away , we are going to be stuck with the logic of :
This is our cd , ( or software , or movie ) your only paying to listen to it , by yourself , in your own house , and no one else may listen to it unless they pay us first , and you can only play it on this player .
This is the type of bullshit that cause DIVX to fail .
If you remember walking around a circuit city store around this time in 1998 you know what I 'm talking about , and not the video codec .
On one final note , I can remember getting a nasty email from some of the people at Fox 's corporate broadcast arm .
I wished I would have saved them , as well as my replies .
I thought they were quite comical .
Anyways here is the story .
Back in 2005 ( i think it was 2005 ) they started showing " 24 " in January .
They would play the entire season from January to end of April early May time frame .
They would start by playing the first 2 episodes on a Sunday .
Usually after the AFC championship game .
Well on this Sunday , the game went off at 8:15 pm eastern .
No problem , start playing the tape at 8:15 pm .
Unfortunately there were several affiliates , who did n't preempt their local 10:00 pm news .
So people missed the last 15 - 20 minutes of the 1st episode .
People got pissed .
This is where I come in .
I recorded said episode to my dvr .
I then set up my own streaming media server .
I went to fox 's " 24 " message board and told people how to open their media player to my domain name ( at the time ) to watch the last 20 mins of the show .
I was in such a hurry I actually left the commercials in .
I started the streaming media center , and figured " oh hell 20 people or so will show up " oh god i was wrong .
In that 20 minutes I was using windows media encoder 9 , encoding at roughly 700 kbps , and had at one point about 63,000 different computers connected and watching .
The scary point is that
some really savvy people pulled an internet whois and started sending me emails .
One guy actually pulled my phone number from it .
The phone call and most of the emails were to say thanks and so on .
The phone call scared the shit out of me though .
I do n't post personal info when I register domain names now , learned my lesson there .
However I got 2 emails directly from fox .
They were pissed off .
You would think they would be happy I was rebroadcasting they show , with commercials in no less and not for any financial gain on my part .
Basically the first was a cease and desist .
The second seemed to me more of an arrogant and sarcastic ' up yours , do n't you know who we are ? ' email , to which I replied " yes , your a multi-billion entertainment conglomerate , who can't even stream a show from your website , while one of your fans , using inexpensive computer hardware , did your job for you , at no cost to you , your welcome " .
I wished I would have saved those emails .
I would have posted them on here for your reading pleasure .
I have n't typed anything this long in some time now .
I 'm tired and going to bed .
Good night , and merry Christmas .
My name is Brad .
I am 33 years old .
I was a child during the 1980's .
Most children , ( back then ) did n't have much money at their disposal .
Am I the only one to record music from an FM radio ?
I know I 'm not .
I would say millions of people did that at one point in their lifetimes .
Is that ' copyright infringement ' ?
According to the RIAA it is .
Did that kill the music business ?
Of course not .
Did it negatively impact their bottom line ?
Of course not .
Were vinyl records , tapes , or early cds laden with drm ?
Of course not .
When you paid for your music you got generally what you wanted , and you were able to do what you wanted with the media .
However , when you recorded from the radio , you always got the one or two songs you wanted , as well as a few seconds of DJ banter sometimes , and you were still able to do what you wanted with the tape .
Hell there are times I record from my Sirius satellite radio .
And now that I think of it , the music industry had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the satellite radio / streaming music business .
They fought like hell to kill the TimeTrax hardware and software .
Now , flash forward 27 years , to the present , where most people under the age of 20 have never seen or held a cassette tape , or vinyl record .
They have their Ipod , or in my case the Archos 5 internet media tablet , which is better than the Ipod .

Growing to feed Chinese demand , Australian mining lacks workers Australia 's immigration minister , Chris Evans , has announced policy changes to attract more highly skilled workers .
He criticised the current trend for new arrivals to sign up for cookery or hairdressing courses to gain residency .
Mr Evans said Australia would abolish the current list of 106 skills in demand and review a points test used to assess migrants .
His comments were welcomed by the mining sector , which is struggling to meet China 's demand for raw materials .
" We had tens of thousands of students studying cookery and accounting and hairdressing because that was on the list and that got them through to permanent residency , " Mr Evans told Australian radio .
Catering to high - end " We want to make sure we 're getting the high - end applicants , " the immigration minister said .
We need the people on the job now and the demand going forward will be even greater as these projects get off the ground
Steve Knott
Australian Mines and Metals Association
He said the new immigration intake would focus on health workers , including more doctors and nurses , as well as engineering and mining .
Australia 's mining sector is struggling to find tens of thousands of staff to support major firms like BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto as they expand to meet China 's growing demand for resources .
" We need the people on the job now and the demand going forward will be even greater as these projects get off the ground , " Australian Mines and Metals Association Chief Executive Steve Knott told Australian radio .
" The boom in the resources sector , particularly in the north - west of Western Australia , has been quite strong so we welcome the decision that has been made , " he said .
Fraud reports
Many overseas students from Asia seek residency in Australia after completing vocational courses at private colleges , usually in hairdressing and catering .
Education experts have been calling on Australia to overhaul its foreign student sector after reports of fraud and that students were using the system purely to gain residency in Australia .
Last year 170,000 people applied to live and work permanently in Australia as skilled migrants , but there were just 108,100 places available , he said .
Mr Evans added that all lower - skilled applications lodged before 1 September 2007 , when English language skills and work experience requirements were easier , would have their applications withdrawn and application fees worth A $ 14 million ( $ 12.15 million ) refunded .
Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that 4.4 million people in Australia were born overseas .

Do n’t forget to move your clocks forward this weekend .
And then do n’t forget to be more careful in the days after you adjust your clocks .
Because a recent study found that the hour of lost sleep was related to increased job - related injuries .
Probably because sleepy workers were less alert .
The work appeared last September in the Journal of Applied Psychology .
[ see http://bit.ly/coie2b]
Organizational behavioral psychologists Christopher Barnes and David Wagner analyzed reports filed with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health about injuries that took place in mines .
The study looked at all reports between 1983 and 2006 .
And they found that compared with other days , more injuries happened on the Monday after daylight saving time went into effect .
And the injuries were more severe .
Survey data found that people sleep on average 40 minutes less on the Sunday night right after the time change .
The data also revealed that on Mondays after the switch to standard time — when we gain an hour of sleep — there ’s no significant differences in sleep or injuries .
So enjoy that extra hour of sunlight in the evening .
Carefully .

Try Spicy Steve Nachos , iPad Thai and an Apple Cheese Plate
and pay homage to the greatest consumer electronics company of all time .
OK , I admit to being a Mac Fanboy .
I 've got a MacBook , an iPhone and I 'll be first in line for a new iPad when it hits the shelves .
But I 'm also a foodie with time on his hands .
So what better way to show appreciation for my much - loved Apple products than to create a tasty sculpture in the form of Apple 's venerable leader ?
And with Apple 's latest blockbuster product launch just around the corner , I figured that my iPad Launch Party would be the perfect place for the unveiling .
You ARE going to an iPad launch party , are n't you ?
Steve 's piercing gaze and strong personality
make him a natural choice for bold food pairings .
Steve 's piercing gaze and strong personalitymake him a natural choice for bold food pairings .
I figured that cheese was a great medium for food carving , and would go well with many a tasty meal .
Mozzarella has the right consistency , is pliable when melted slightly , and its pasty - white color matches the skin tone of many a computer geek like Steve and myself .
See below for directions on how to create your own Cheese Head and for three tasty recipes that go perfectly with Steve Cheese .
Creating His Steveness
If you 're going to create your own tasty CEO goodness , make sure you 've got some good pictures to reference while you carve .
I used the one above , along with one or two profile shots so I could get the full 3D effect .
Start out with a few of those big blocks of mozzarella cheese .
You can hold them together with toothpicks or chopsticks that have been neatly clipped .
Next up , carve out the basic human skull shape .
Do n't worry too much about the details yet — just go for the large feature areas .
Map out where you 're going to put the eyes , nose and chin .
A paring knife — I 'm a fan of this one — works great for this type of work and for the detail work to follow .
The nose and ears require detailed carving , so work on those separately .
You can attach them with glue made of gobs of slightly melted cheese .
In fact , as you progress , those melted cheese blobs should be applied liberally to give the head its smooth , human look .
Finally , apply the beard and hair using a flat spoon filled with ground pepper .
Be careful with this step — it 's a pain to remove specs of pepper once they 've stuck to the cheese .
Now that your Steve is carved and ready to go , choose from one of the following three delicious recipes to complete your meal .
Please follow the recipes carefully — you should resist the temptation to throw Steve onto your barbecue at all times .
Recipe # 1 : Apple Cheese Plate
Ingredients
1 Steve Jobs Cheese Head
Assorted gourmet cheeses such as brie , camembert or stilton
Crackers
Fruit
The cheese plate allows your guests to get a good look at Steve 's entire head .
This recipe is a great one to choose if your sculpture has few imperfections .
Simply mount the head on a base of partially - melted cheese and arrange various food items around the edges .
Guests will be reluctant to take a carving out of your masterpiece , so you might have to be the first to dive in .
I recommend starting with a nose or an ear — that way your guests will know you mean business .
The pepper adds some zing to the somewhat - bland mozzarella .
Recipe # 2 : Spicy Steve Nachos Supreme
Ingredients
1 Steve Jobs Cheese Head
Jalapenos
Tomatoes
Sour Cream
Olives
Tortilla chips
Steve has been known to be somewhat " spicy " to his underlings , especially around product launch time .
What better way to celebrate this personality trait than with hot 'n spicy nachos ?
The preparation is simple — line a cast - iron pot with tortilla chips and rest Steve comfortably on top .
Garnish with tomatoes , jalapenos and olives .
Be sure to show off
Steve to your guests at this point , since he 'll be unrecognizable soon enough .
You 'll want Steve to melt quickly without burning the chips , so bake covered at 375 degrees until the cheese is bubbly .
Remove glasses and serve with a side of sour cream and / or salsa .
Recipe # 3 : iPad Thai
Ingredients
1 Steve Jobs Cheese Head
1 Large serving Pad Thai .
Recipes found here
Tired of waiting for your new iPad ?
This tasty iPad Thai will tide you over , and it costs a lot less too .
Simply prepare Pad
Thai the way you usually do — any variation will be fine .
Arrange the noodles on an attractive platter , while leaving room for Steve in the middle .
Mount Steve in a well of noodles and provide a knife for those guests who'd like a little cheese with their fusion cuisine .
More Info
I 'll be serving iPad Thai at our iPad launch party — how about you ?
Let me know if you create your own Steve food creation .
If anyone has the gumption to put Steve into a pressure cooker , please get in touch .
Oh , and let me know if you 've got any ideas for what to do with two pounds of melted , pepper - infused mozarella cheese .
But to say that she disappeared into these roles is not quite accurate .
Rather , she used the particularities of these disparate characters to reveal some essential facet of herself , an ineffable but unmistakable Streepness .
In one of the few skeptical assessments of this elusive quality , Pauline Kael , reviewing “ Sophie ’s Choice , ” suggested that Ms. Streep was too controlling , too calculated , to create characters of full and spontaneous humanity .
“ It could be that in her zeal to be an honest actress , ” Ms. Kael speculated , “ she allows nothing to escape her conception of a performance . ”
Often , though , this thoroughness was a virtue , bringing to vaguely conceived , unevenly executed films ( like “ Sophie ’s Choice , ” and also “ Out of Africa ” ) a discipline and clarity they otherwise would have lacked .
Not a greater dimension of realism , exactly  Ms. Kael was on to something in intuiting a crucial element of premeditation in Ms. Streep ’s performance  but a precision that made the characters interesting even as it called attention to the virtuosity of the actress portraying them .
Given the bias that reflexively elevates heavy over light when it comes to screen acting , it may seem perverse to argue that the much - lauded dramatic roles of the ’ 80s are preparation for the comic flowering that began at the end of that decade with movies like “ She - Devil ” and “ Postcards From the Edge . ”
Ms. Streep hardly abandoned drama , or the bravura explorations of challenging accents and hairstyles .
( See her syllable - perfect turn as the bored , expatriate Italian farmwife in the perpetually underrated “ Bridges of Madison County . ” )
But she began to reveal a playful , mischievous side , an anarchic impulse that , joined to her formidable timing and technique , has blossomed in the past 10 years or so .
You can hardly say , looking at “ The Devil Wears Prada ” or “ Julie & Julia , ” that her gift for deep mimicry has diminished .
Or that , in “ Doubt , ” her commitment to dramatic intensity has waned .
In her portrayal of Julia Child , the posture , the voice , the bubbly blend of ruthless drive and irrepressible joie de vivre are almost uncanny .
But these days impersonation is the province of every aspiring biopic star .
Ms. Streep ’s Julia
Child is never anything other than a performance , a fusion of two strong personalities rather than the absorption by one into another .
You never forget that you are watching Meryl Streep inhabiting a version of Julia Child , and instead of distracting you from the truth of Julia , this awareness is what enables you to understand her .
It is our familiarity with Ms. Streep that makes her exploration of a more private Julia Child both credible and exhilarating .
Similarly in her frequent forays into the world of cinematic statecraft , she can be an entirely convincing senator or cabinet secretary while still being , in every syllable and flourish , Meryl Streep .
She is also , evidently , enjoying herself , and the delight in watching Ms. Streep these days  whether as a spacey folk singer in “ A Prairie Home Companion , ” a romantically confused divorcee in “ It ’s Complicated , ” or even that steely Irish - American street cop of a nun in “ Doubt ”  comes partly from a sense of shared pleasure .
All of the old discipline is there , but she seems to be having more fun .
In an exclusive report , Kitco has just released yet another stunner in the world of precious metals .
It turns out that Eric Sprott has attempted to purchase gold from the IMF , according to information provided to Kitco by Frank Holmes , CEO of US Global Investors .
" I just spoke with Eric Sprott , who bid to buy [ the IMF 's remaining gold on the block ] and they refuse to sell it . "
As Kitco points out , " the IMF might be holding out for a bigger buyer or a central bank or for higher prices .
But Holmes argues the IMF 's rejection of Sprott 's bid means markets are being manipulated . "
Back to Holmes : " I think there is a lot of manipulation done by governments around the world in the currency markets which affect the bond markets so to me it 's just normal course . "
Holmes concludes " with an election year there may be a gold rally that could be two standard deviations , or $ 300 dollars , to the upside .
So you could see gold run to $ 1300 to $ 1500 quite easily . "
This all is occurring as ever more pundits finally realize that as fiats are discredited across the world , the only safe , non-dilutable resource is gold .

The City of Churches is a hotbed of atheists - and they 're keen to start spreading the word .
So what has got the non-believers all fired up ?
CODY GOUGH'S BREAK with his faith came when he lit a cigarette in front of his father .
The Jehovah 's Witness had spent two decades in the church , with nightly Bible study and three meetings a week .
" I lived and breathed the religion from birth , " he says .
" It was my reality , the framework from which I built my understanding of the world . "
But doubts began to grow until he did n't believe any longer .
Even then the young man spent a year pretending , because to give up his faith meant giving up his family and friends .
Associating with anyone outside the church is strongly discouraged .
His aunt had already disowned her son for that reason .
Even after Gough stopped attending meetings , he still could n't bring himself to say the words to his dad .
In desperation and wracked with nerves he lit up a cigarette - strictly forbidden by the church - and his father instantly understood .
" What about the rest of your family ? " he said .
" Your friends ? "
Gough said : " That 's up to them .
I can't fake it anymore . "
Now 23 , Gough says his move towards atheism was a gradual one .
" As soon as you 're confronted with anything that goes against ( the religion ) your mind shuts off , " he says .
" Whenever evolution was mentioned I 'd disregard it .
It 's like brainwashing . "
Gough says reading evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins ' atheist manifesto The God Delusion sealed his doubts .
Apart from detailing contradictions in the Bible and outlining various philosophical arguments , the book focuses on the process of evolution and the concept of " the selfish gene " - the idea genes are entirely focused on self preservation .
" At any other time if I 'd read it I would n't have been ready , but I read about the selfish gene and it was so simple , " Gough says .
" I was surprised I 'd been against it so long as it was so logical . "
Gough is one of an increasing number of Australians declaring themselves atheists .
While the Christian churches will see some of the year 's best attendance figures this Easter weekend , there are more than twice as many non-believers as church goers .
Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show the number of people identifying themselves as atheists or stating " no religion " on the census grew by more than a third to 18.8 per cent between 2001 and 2006 .
A further 11.2 per cent declined to answer the question , meaning as many as a third of Australians do n't believe in God .
Among young people the proportion is even higher .
A 2006 study by Monash University , the Australian Catholic University and the Christian Research Association found that just 48 per cent of people born between 1976 and 1990 believe in God .
And when it comes to the godless , Adelaide is atheism central .
The City of the Churches is home to the Atheist Foundation of Australia , an organisation that campaigns on behalf of a secular society .
It was the AFA website , which recently clicked up its one millionth unique visitor , that Gough turned to for information as he weighed up his beliefs .
It 's a Wednesday evening in Eastwood and the unfaithful have gathered for the AFA 's annual general meeting - held , somewhat ironically , in an old church hall .
I 'm keen to see exactly what this bunch of heretics and blasphemers get up to as they plan their godless activities .
David Nicholls , who looks like a former hippie with his white mullet , goatee and glasses , opens proceedings with a bit of humour .
After all , if there 's no afterlife , you 'd better get your laughs in this one .
" Did you hear they 've set up a dial - a- prayer service for atheists ? "
Nicholls tells the assembly .
" You ring it - and it just rings and rings and rings . . . "
Boom , boom .
And then it 's down to business .
About 30 well - dressed , mostly silver - haired people sit around politely discussing the meaning of life - or lack of it .
And Nicholls ' president 's address is n't that far removed from a sermon .
He preaches that the only truth can be found in atheism , details the ever increasing numbers of converts to the cause , and praises the prophet Richard Dawkins for spreading the good word .
" The winds of change have unleashed a new wave of enthusiasm for humanity . . . to exist on planet Earth without interference from numerous dogmatic interpretations of ancient writings , " he solemnly tells the congregation .
" They are no longer relevant in the modern era and . . . promise continued divisiveness and even the risk of total destruction of the biosphere . "
As tempting as it is to continue this " atheism as religion " metaphor , it does n't really stand up to close examination .
Because among atheists nothing is sacred , everything is up for debate , and there appears to be only one commandment :
Thou shalt always produce the evidence or be accused of talking poppycock .
For example , Nicholls ' swerve towards apocalyptic global - warming doom - mongering is immediately challenged by one of the members who is as sceptical of climate change as he is of God .
As Nicholls explains later : " The only thing atheists have in common is that they do n't accept there is a God.
Everything else is up for grabs . "
The foundation is enjoying its best publicity in years thanks to the refusal by the advertising company APN Outdoor to run a $ 16,000 campaign on buses promoting atheism , modelled on the successful British campaign that has since spread throughout the world .
While APN has happily run Christian advertisements before , late last year it baulked at the slogan : " Atheism - because there is no credible evidence " , and rejected two compromise versions that merely suggested the public " Celebrate reason " or " Sleep in on Sunday mornings " .
Nicholls is both outraged on principle and delighted in practice about a ban that 's resulted in him being interviewed more than 50 times by every major media outlet in the country .
The AFA has launched anti-discrimination proceedings in Tasmania and Victoria and a prominent Sydney law firm has offered to take the case , pro bono , to the Supreme Court .
" Our cause has had much more public interest than had the ad companies simply taken our money and done the ads , " Nicholls says .
The atheist bus campaign is part of a new willingness among some atheists to spread their godless humanism .
Stephen Downs , the head of the School of Theology at Flinders University , says the emergence of vocal atheists demonstrates that religion remains strong .
" One reason why there 's this phenomenon of a small group of militant atheists writing publications - like Richard Dawkins - is there was an assumption religion would die out , " he says .
" But it has n't .
Pentecostal and evangelical protestant churches have grown enormously and religion has become involved in politics .
That freaks out secularists . "
Like many , Downs is uneasy with the developments in atheism .
" In the past atheists did n't actively promote it , or ridicule and denigrate people practising religion , " he says .
There certainly seems a new acceptance among the public for doing just that .
Musical comedian Tim Minchin has been playing to crowds who applaud wildly as he mocks believers and sends up creationists .
Like Downs , Minchin cites the rise of the Pentecostal churches and the emergence of Family First as reasons atheists are taking a more aggressive stance .
" Suddenly people are getting the feeling that the nice movement towards secularism is being arrested and is actually being challenged , and people like us need to go , ' hang on ! ' " he says .
" Now they . . . are getting into politics like Family First .
Stem cells and abortion debates that require intelligent , sensible debate , are being ruined by people saying : ' Yeah , but I know what God thinks . ' "
The reason for this new acceptance of atheism probably lies in the fact that organised religion 's influence on society is dwindling .
These days , 91.6 per cent of the population does sleep in on Sunday mornings ( or at least , does n't go to church ) .
And while many have focused on the growth of Hillsong and other Pentecostal Christian churches , they have only added a net 13,800 converts over the past decade , according to the multi-denominational Christian Research Association .
Over the same period , the ranks of atheists have grown by hundreds of thousands .
However , the numbers are murky .
Neither religious nor atheist groups have much faith in the census data .
This is because they were designed to measure identification with religious belief - not belief itself or its absence .
Demographer Bernard Salt says the data underestimates the number of atheists because some people who do n't believe in God tick " Christian " purely because they were brought up in Christian households or went to Christian schools .
" Twenty per cent of the population are declared atheists and I would say another 20 per cent are ' practising ' atheists , " he says .
" And , of course , parents tick a box for their children saying : my child is Catholic or Protestant .
By the time you work it out probably 40 per cent of the population are atheist . "
Phillip Hughes , from the Christian Research Association , also says the data is flawed .
" Some people who write ' no religion ' are spiritual and religious ; they just do n't wish to identify with religious groups . "
Hughes says the rate of atheism has n't changed much since the 1970s : what has occurred has been a " drift to secularisation " .
" People are adopting a non-religious approach to life , but that 's different to atheism because they do n't think there is no God , they just choose to live without regard to the question , " he says .
Hughes says a large group of people do n't know what to think and just try and muddle through without dwelling on the subject too much .
" Secular by default , not atheist by commitment , " is how he puts it .
" Militant atheism is a product of the 1970s , " he says .
" ( The AFA ) are a group who formed in the 1970s and it was part of the rejection of religious traditions that happened then with a fair degree of passion and anger , and the feeling the church and faith had let people down and was misguiding people . "
He says younger atheists - most of whom have never believed - do n't have the same anger .
The term " militant atheist " riles Nicholls .
" What is a militant atheist ? " he asks .
" If you say gays should be allowed to be married is that militant ?
We do n't have people bare - breasted running through the streets waving their swords about saying , ' Darwin rules ! '
Atheists are n't like that . "
So what are atheists like ?
It 's hard to generalise but they 're more likely to be young , well - educated and professional .
And according to 39 studies carried out in the past 80 years , the more intelligent a person is , the more likely they are to be an atheist .
Nicholls says people join or contact the AFA for a variety of reasons .
" I think people would be surprised by how many people are angered by religious intrusions in schools , " he says .
But these sorts of inquires do n't translate into big numbers .
" Atheists are n't big joiners .
We 'll never have numbers like at a church . "
I speak with a number of atheists at the AGM .
Mary Gallnor , 73 , says she became an atheist at six after being told the central tenets of Catholicism .
" I thought what they were telling me was just shocking , " she says .
She joined AFA 15 years ago as part of her campaign to help change the law to allow the terminally ill to die with dignity .
" The only people who do n't support voluntary euthanasia really are religious , " she says .
( Interestingly , surveys show that even among the religious there 's overwhelming public support ) .
Fifty - something Michael Cunnington is at his first meeting .
Originally from Leeds , England , he experienced what he calls " Irish Catholic indoctrination " as a child .
" It took a while for me to realise what they were teaching me to do was to believe , rather than to think , and I resent that , " he says .
Even though he did n't believe in God , Cunnington says he called himself an agnostic for years .
" I did n't want to cause any offence to anybody , " he says .
Two recent developments convinced him to change his mind - the banning of the atheist bus ads and when Catch the Fire Ministries leader Danny Nalliah called the Victorian bushfires God 's punishment for the state 's abortion laws .
" Religion is quite bloody militant and it's quite prepared to enforce is views on society , " Cunnington says .
" They need to know we 're not all in the closet and there are a lot of people out here prepared to stand up and say , ' I 'm an atheist , ' and let them know we exist . "
New member Louise Warren says she had a " very fundamentalist Baptist " upbringing and went through a very gradual conversion to non-belief .
" People think you 're going to hell because you lost the faith , " she says .
" But once I realised there was n't such a place , it was n't hard . "
Her feelings about religious instruction are part of what prompted her to come along tonight , although she 's not sure if she agrees with Dawkins and Nicholls , both of whom call it " child abuse " .
" Those are pretty strong words but still , that 's what I went through and it does affect children , " she says .
" I feel strongly about indoctrinating children into believing something that I do n't believe is true . "
A member for two decades , Ronald Evans , 63 , joined the Australian Skeptics in the mid-1980s .
He put up $ 10,000 of his own money as a challenge to anyone who could demonstrate anything paranormal or supernatural .
" That was 25 years ago and my money is still safe , " he says with a grin .
Debunking mystics led him to re-evaluate his agnosticism .
" If you 're a rational person you think about everything , about how science and reality works .
And when you do , you really have to become an atheist .
It 's just inevitable . "
But lots of intelligent people think about religion and do believe in God , I point out .
" The first thing you should do is read the Bible - it 's dreadful , " he argues .
" It 's amazing the number of Christians who 've never read the Bible .
It 's full of murder and rape and ethnic cleansing .
Religion in general is the cause of all - well , most of the world 's problems , " he says .
This is a familiar refrain of atheists , and the equally familiar retort from the other side has been played out countless times in tit - for - tat letters to the editor in newspapers and websites .
" People involved in religions have been involved in bad behaviour but it 's certainly not exclusive to people of faith , " Downs says .
" How do you explain ideological atheists like Pol Pot , Mao Zedong or Stalin ? "
Umaru Yar 'Adua has only given one radio interview since becoming ill
Nigeria 's forthcoming election could be held three months earlier than scheduled if electoral reforms are adopted , officials have announced .
The election is due next April but one reform proposes bringing it forward to allow time for legal challenges before the next president is sworn in .
Rescheduling the poll would also end uncertainty caused by the ill - health of President Umaru Yar 'Adua .
Politicians are considering changes proposed after a flawed 2007 vote .
Electoral commission head Maurice Iwu said the presidential poll would either be held on 22 January or 23 April 2011 .
Mr Yar 'Adua 's term of office expires in May but he is not expected to stand again .
He went to Saudi Arabia for medical treatment in November last year and , despite returning to Nigeria recently , he has not been seen in public since .
This has left a political vacuum and various factions are jockeying for power .
In his absence , Vice - President Goodluck Jonathan has been installed as acting leader .
But the ruling People 's Democratic Party has said its candidate in the next election will be a northerner - ruling out Mr Jonathan .
The BBC's Caroline Duffield in Lagos says reform is crucial if Nigeria is to avoid another cycle of violence and vote - rigging next year .
But opposition politicians have complained that the government diluted the proposals before they were sent to parliament .
" To the east , the high Andes mountains prevent humidity from moving in from the Atlantic with clouds .
The higher you are , the less humidity there is , and thus the light from the stars go through less atmosphere and is distorted less when it hits the telescope . "
The great debate for middle - class commuters — to drive or take transit — is now a no - brainer for many who are finding it cheaper and faster to take their cars .
The recession has changed the way commuters think .
Gas prices are down and transit fares are up ; freeway traffic is looser , while transit service is less frequent .
For three years , Veronique Selgado took BART from the East Bay to her job working for an airline at San Francisco International Airport .
But she recently switched to driving because BART raised fares and upped its SFO round - trip surcharge from $ 3 to $ 8 , boosting her daily trip cost to nearly $ 20 .
“ It ’s outrageous , ” Selgado said .
“ At what point do they stop raising the prices , when it ’s $ 50 a day to go round - trip to work ?
At what point does BART stand back and say , ‘ People ca n’t pay that much to commute ’ ? ”
The math also stopped adding up for Castro Valley computer data analyst David Ross , 53 .
After BART and AC Transit raised fares , and BART started charging $ 1 to park at the Castro Valley station , he and his girlfriend began paying $ 14.25 each day on transportation .
With gas at around $ 3 per gallon — the price in California has risen lately but is still down from the peak of $ 4.61 in 2008 — since October they have been paying $ 14.50 to drive and park in Oakland instead .
“ The time savings is worth more than any costs , ” said Ross , who now leaves for work with his girlfriend each morning at 6:30 instead of 5:55 .
Although transit riders often say they enjoy their commute more , ridership is dwindling by the day .
“ I hate driving , I ’ll be honest , ” said 26 - year - old Vicky Liaw .
But after giving public transit a try , she drives anyway , from the Berryessa neighborhood of San Jose to her job in the purchasing department at Virgin America in Burlingame .
She forks over $ 180 to $ 220 per month in gas because it simply takes her too long , about an hour and a half , to take transit to work .
The recession is not only changing the way people get around but also where they are going .
Some commuters said they now try to work from home once or twice a week , or have begun looking for jobs closer to home .
Hercules resident Craig Watson , laid off from his electrical foreman position in San Francisco a year ago , decided to find a job closer to home largely to cut down on his public transportation bill .
He now drives to his new job in nearby Richmond , and no longer has to spend $ 400 a month on BART tickets .
“ Giving up public transportation has meant a significant boost to my income .
I can literally make my car payment with the savings , ” said Watson , a single parent who is also using the extra money to feed his family .
The shift in transportation cost and convenience is also putting some commuters in tricky ethical dilemmas :
Should they continue to take transit for its societal benefits , or save personal time and money by driving ?
Some said they felt a sense of remorse for leaving transit , but the alternative was just too enticing to pass up .
Watson , a lifelong Bay Area resident , said he took pride in taking transit to reduce pollution and congestion .
“ But I must say , I ’m actually feeling relieved financially and emotionally to abandon public transportation , ” he said .
Trip time also plays a major role in commuters ’ decision - making process .
Millbrae resident Robert Smith , 63 , had taken BART and Golden Gate Transit to his job in Sausalito because his employer provided transit vouchers , but eventually he threw up his hands , bought a Honda Civic and started driving .
It took him 2 ﻿1/ 2 hours each way by train and bus , turning his nine - hour workday into a 14 - hour endeavor .
Now he drives , and it takes him 45 minutes each way , which he said is well worth the extra gas and toll bridge costs .
“ It just got to the point where it was too much of a hassle time - wise , ” Smith said .
“ It ’s just not worth it . ”
Many commuters agree that , if convenience and cost were equal between transit and driving , they would ditch their cars in an instant .
But all too often that ’s not the case , now more than ever .
Rick Mann loves public transit but hates the two hours and 15 minutes it takes him to walk from his Milpitas home to a transit station , catch a train , transfer to another train and then walk to his job as a software engineer in Sunnyvale .
So he drives instead .
It takes him 10 to 15 minutes .
“ I ’m all for taking longer on public transit , ” said Mann , 40 .
“ But that was too much — eight , nine times longer than what it would take driving .
It really does n’t make any sense for me to take public transit to get to work . ”

( CNN ) -- After 19 years together Linda Murphy and Donna Swartwout tied the knot at 12:01 a.m. Friday , when New Hampshire 's law legalizing same - sex marriage took effect .
They were among several couples early Friday who married under a full moon on the steps of the New Hampshire Statehouse in Concord .
At midnight , New Hampshire became the fifth state to allow same - sex couples to marry , joining Connecticut , Vermont , Massachusetts and Iowa .
The couple , who live in Hudson , New Hampshire , said they wanted to be married as soon as they could .
" We were thrilled and proud of New Hampshire ... it was a such a historic moment , " Murphy said .
Swartwout said the marriage gives them " words and language that the rest of the world uses . "
" When my nephew asks , ' Who 's Linda ? "
I get to say , ' she's my wife , ' " she said .
Andromeda is the closest large galaxy to us , 2.5 million light - years from the sun .
Nasa has published the first images from its Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer , or Wise , which has been scanning the skies since January .
" Wise has worked superbly , " said the agency 's Ed Weiler in Washington DC .
The images include a comet , a " star factory " 20,000 light years away in our Milky Way galaxy and our nearest large neighbour , the Andromeda spiral galaxy .
Wise will search on until October when its supplies of frozen coolant for chilling instruments will run out .
Comet Siding Spring could provide clues about the solar system 's birth .
It 's hoped it will find many more comets and , from them , provide information about the birth of our Solar System .
It 's also looking for asteroids and cool stars called brown dwarfs .
By the time the mission ends the explorer should have scanned the sky one - and - a - half - times with its " infrared goggles " , revealing objects not visible to the naked eye .
" All these pictures tell a story about our dusty origins and destiny , " said Peter Eisenhardt , Wise project director at Nasa in California .
" Wise sees dusty comets and rocky asteroids tracing the formation and evolution of our solar system .
We can map thousands of forming and dying solar systems across our entire galaxy .
" We can see patterns of star formation across other galaxies , and waves of star - bursting galaxies in clusters millions of light years away , " he explained .

Despite their name , rice cookers are essentially giant steamers , so anything that benefits from moist cooking does great in the contraption .
Fish , chicken , dumplings , vegetables — all kinds of good stuff .

The economy is no stranger to creating its own fantasy world with little or no relation to the real one .
We witnessed the damage that can cause when the banks thought they had stumbled on financial alchemy and could transform bad debt into good – economic base metal into gold .
Now it 's possible that a much bigger error is coming to light .
The rise and rise of global corporations lifted on a wave of apparent productivity gains may have been little more than a mask for the reckless liquidation of natural capital .
It 's as if we 've been so distracted by our impressive speed of economic travel that we forgot to look at the fuel gauge or the cloud of smog left in our wake .
A new UN report estimates that accounting for the environmental damage of the world 's 3,000 biggest companies would wipe out one - third of their profits .
Any precise figure , however , is a matter of how risk is quantified and of where you draw the line .
In 2006 , for example , the New Economics Foundation ( NEF ) , of which I am the policy director , looked at the oil companies BP and Shell , who together had recently reported profits of £ 25 bn .
By applying the Treasury 's own estimates of the social and environmental cost of carbon emissions , we calculated that the total bill for those costs would reach £ 46.5 bn , massively outweighing profits and plunging the companies into the red .
Yet in exercises like this , we quickly hit the paradox of environmental economics .
By putting a price on nature , hopefully it makes it less likely that we will treat the world , and its natural resources , as if it were a business in liquidation .
Yet there is a point when it becomes meaningless to treat the ecosystems upon which we depend as mere commodities with a price for trading .
For example , what price would you put on the additional tonne of carbon which , when burned , triggers irreversible , catastrophic climate change ?
Who would have the right to even consider selling off the climate upon which civilisation depends ?
The avoidance of such damage is literally priceless .
If that sounds dramatic , consider that last September a large , international group of scientists published a paper in the journal Nature which identified nine key planetary boundaries for key biological systems upon which we depend .
They found that we had already transgressed three of those , and were on the cusp of several others .
All are potential points of no return as such complex systems begin interacting .
The huge advantage of the UN work is that it attempts to improve the feedback system between the economy and its ultimate parent company , the biosphere .
Better risk assessment and value measurement is essential to help prevent what happened to banks happening to the planet .
The concept of a balanced budget , so loved by conservatives in relation to finance and spending , seems to be an alien concept when the consumption of natural resources and the production of waste is concerned .
Yet it is far more important to achieve a balanced environmental budget than an economic one .
You can always print more money , but you can't print more planet .
As John Ruskin put it , " There is no wealth but life . "

A FedEx Express 727-200 Aircraft equipped with a Rockwell - Collins GNLU - 930 Multi-Mode Receiver landed using a Raytheon - developed military ground station .
Raytheon designed and developed the differential GPS ground station under an Air Force contract for the Joint Precision Approach and Landings System ( JPALS ) program .
The FedEx Express 727-200 aircraft at Holloman successfully conducted a total of sixteen Category I approaches .
After completing a number of pilot flown approaches for reference the aircraft conducted six full autolands using the JPALS ground station .
“ The consistency of the approaches allowed us to proceed to actual autolandings with very little delay , ” said Steve Kuhar , Senior Technical Advisor Flight Department for FedEx Express .
The aircraft was guided by differential GPS corrections , integrity information , and precision approach path points transmitted from the Raytheon developed JPALS ground station .
Although the approaches were restricted to Category I , accuracies sufficient to meet Cat II / III requirements were observed .

That is August 25 , 2001 .
You got 3 weeks before 9/11 they successfully land a 727 and then some of the same employees are on the flights on 9/11 that were highjacked .
Then Saudis are smuggled out of the Raytheon Airport two days after 9/11 .
During this time you have power downs in the World Trade Center and the night before , Bush slept in a Florida Hotel on September 10th , 2001 .

Hypothesis :
There are people involved here that were put on those planes to basically ‘ kill the people who knew ’ about the government ’s involvement in the highjacking that day or even possibly knew .
And then the saudi’s were flown out of the country before they could be rounded up by the FBI and asked about it .

Marlborough – Oct. 1 , 2001 A government - industry team accomplished the first precision approach by a civil aircraft using a military Global Positioning System ( GPS ) landing system Aug. 25 at Holloman AFB , N.M. , Raytheon Company announced today .
A FedEx Express 727-200 Aircraft equipped with a Rockwell - Collins GNLU - 930 Multi-Mode Receiver landed using a Raytheon - developed military ground station .
Raytheon designed and developed the differential GPS ground station under an Air Force contract for the Joint Precision Approach and Landings System ( JPALS ) program .
The JPALS system is being developed to meet the Defense Department ’s need for an anti-jam , secure , all weather Category II / III aircraft landing system that will be fully interoperable with planned civil systems utilizing the same technology .
Raytheon and the U.S. Air Force have been conducting extensive flight testing for JPALS at Holloman over the last three months .

Only 3 weeks after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , a patent was applied for regarding a system that would override pilot control from an autopilot equipped aircraft and redirect such an aircraft to a predetermined destination via pre-programmed autopilot settings .
This patent cites the Differential Global Position Satellite research and development conducted by Honeywell and NASA during the mid-1990s .
“ ” A method for … deactivating on - board control of the autopilot system ; directing the autopilot system to fly the aircraft to a landing . ”
“ One optional feature of the invention disables the aircraft ’s communications equipment . ”

http://www.freedomfiles.org/war/noarabs77.htm
And at the same time people hold that very belief , and the belief that ‘ Truthers ’ and other Bush Haters are just tinfoil hat wearers at the same time .
The upvotes you are getting disgust me , but at least it represents the hypocritical nature of Democrats who so conveniently forget 9/11 while clamoring on like people have n’t been trying to put Bush and Cheney in jail for the past 8 years .
Race baiting and ignorant .
Commence downvote of me though .
nosayso is the problem with the left , they are intelligent but willfully ignorant when it suits them .
Where were you ( GOP ) for the past 8 years meets where were YOU ( Democrats ) for the past 8 years in regards to 9/11 research .
Where was Pelosi when Bush / Cheney needed to be impeached , but it is the teabaggers fault ?
Fuck yoo , coward Dems
Democrats are quick to say that nobody complained about Bush for 8 years , but when presented with 8 years of 9/11 and other research to prosecute Bush , they are Bush ’s most ardent supporters and apologists .
Makes no sense right ?
eh ? eh? not a bad theory right … it ties every event on 9/11 including the weird discrepancies together …
9/11 was a botched sting operation maybe ?
thoughts ?
Let the hijackers hijack the planes and then remote land them and arrest them … but if somebody had other plans and got access to the remote instead … then we got what happened .
The FBI has a history of catching people in the act … was 9/11 no different ?
Was bush playing dumb to catch these guys in the act and the raytheon remotes did n’t work ?
Were the passengers aware that the planes would be hijacked and is that why they did n’t try to overcome the hijackers because they thought the govt .
would land the planes with the remotes ?
everything backs up that theory … how they got on the planes , the fbi’s history of catching terrorists in the act , raytheon employees on the planes , them getting into the cockpit , bush saying he did n’t know about it , all the secrecy , the 9/11 commission being intimidated ,
It would explain how they got on the planes , how raytheon employees were on the planes , why israelis were infiltrating agencies and the government diverting Norad .
They wanted to remote land the planes and arrest the hijackers , but somebody else got access to the remote .
In 2001 , Raytheon ’s Contracts declined from 5.2 billion to 4.9 billion from the year 2000 , and since 2001 they have increased to 12 billion a year in military contracts .
CNN destroys Obama on allowing Raytheon Lobbyist to bypass his Lobby rules .
All of the planes that hit a target on 9/11 were carrying Raytheon employees .
Research it .
Is n’t it true that on 9/11/01 , the FBI and Bush Administration Brazzenly thought they could remote the planes to safety using Raytheon ’s employees and equipment , and people who knew about the sting who thought it might go wrong placed put options while others avoided flying altogether ?
raytheon employees on every flight that hit a target , makes sense to me that raytheon was the company technology they were using to ‘ bait and trap ’ these hijackers like roaches in those planes .
Bush and Cheney were probably like , ‘ yeah give it a chance ’ knowing full well that if it did n’t work they had a back up plan in place , which was deny everything and blame Bin Laden .
The put options can be explained by this also , an investigation not available to the public .
If people knew the FBI was going to attempt such a risky sting op , then they would place some put options on these companies and take stock risks if they did n’t believe it was going to work
The warning text messages , the people told not to fly , officials told not to fly … i think there is a ‘ in the know crowd ’ that is aware that in the days leading up to 9/11 , the fbi sting op about to take place was beginning to be leaked out because people were nervous it would n’t work .
who knows , but once you prove it is a sting operation gone wrong and they were using the remotes , a whole political firestorm starts and an investigation is inevitable .
Us here just have to prove that much , the rest is up to the Attorney Generals and Investigators .
I wo n’t go to far into things i can’t logically piece together .
And you asked , how could they f up a sting 4 times … well that is n’t for us to figure out here , but we CAN agree that it follows logic that the remotes were used to capture these guys like roaches in a trap , or a mouse thinking they got the cheese or something … after that , we do n’t need to prove anything else by logic because the professionals will have to reveal the rest of it .
They probably can’t though , because the raytheon sting op is probably a state secret or classified because it involves national security or something along those lines .
This would explain why no one has come forward yet .
We just have happened to logically put 2 and 2 together here .
I would love to ask why this theory has not been put forth before … is it so ‘ not obvious ’ to assume it or even present it in 8 years of 9/11 truth , a group that has been proven to be led by the government itself ?
The government loves to move its opponents chess pieces for good reason , but 9/11 truth looks like it turned out to be an illusion to deflect people from figuring out why the raytheon employees were on those flights .
9/11 as a sting operation gone wrong is the best explanation you can give for that day .
NOBODY has made this obvious call , because people are too busy blaming the government or supporting it in regards to 9/11 …
When have you heard this obvious theory ?
Never .
Because the 9/11 truth movement has been infilitrated by the government to push people to prove it was the government ’s plan to carry out these attacks … but in essense , the planes were to land safely and the terrorists arrested at the airports ( see flight 77 flight path in your research ) as in any sting operation they people have to be caught in the act .
What went wrong ?
yeah , as in “ let the remotes land the plane at dullies airport ” .
Anyone researching 9/11 as much as i have can look at this ‘ theory ’ i have and apply it to EVERY aspect of the 9/11 story .
It fits .
But you have to be open minded enough to hypothetically apply it an give it a chance to work ‘ in theory ’ .
it is ‘ the lone gunman ’ish , but it is using that technology to capture the terrorists .
Why has that never been presented as a theory , i think it would be safe to assume that ‘ remote controlled boeings ’ were built for a reason in the 1990 ’s and someone at the table had to suggest the ‘ great idea ’ of using these remotes to capture terrorist hijackers who think they have successfully hijacked a plane
I use these bits of logic …
the fbi has a history of catching terrorists in the act , as we have seen this year .
the planes on 9/11 were 1/3 full and if you look at the flight lists you ’ll find government affilated employees and contractors , including raytheon employees that tragically died that day in those flights .
the technology was available and tested in the NORAD drills from 9/4/01 to 9/11/01
the U.S. government was warned , as we all know , of an impending attack .
We know that they were monitoring these hijackers for months before 9/11 and monitoring Bin Laden as well , so it is safe to assume they knew where they were on the morning of 9/11 .
The Sting Op theory fits better than any other theory , because the two other theories : 1 . The government just messed up or 2 .
The government attacked itself to go to war … each do n’t make complete sense when applied to the facts .
I also look at the warnings people had with text message , the warnings that the mayor of San Fran had not to fly and i think it was ashcroft who was told not to fly also .
Intelligence agencies around the world were warning the u.s. of an attack , and lastly the first lobbyist to bypass the Obama Administration ’s “ no lobbyist rule ” was from Raytheon .
Now , speculating , you can jam a remote signal using a C130 aircraft .
This is just speculation though , i cannot logically say what may have went wrong with the sting op to catch these guys alive and use them as proof to fund the intelligence agencies and go to war with Afghanistan or something to that affect .
Most of the hijackers resided near cia / fbi/nsa centers prior to 9/11 so they could be monitored .
The put options could have been put on the airlines by people who knew about the sting op and its potential for failure .
Bush and Cheney could use either outcome of the sting for their eminent war plans .
Bin Laden and these guys were being monitored , meaning people knew they were getting on the planes and when .
NORAD and the FAA may have been out of the loop on this ‘ black op ’ so they had to be flown out of the area so no planes would interfere with landing the planes safely and catching the hijackers in the act and alive .
Raytheon , BAE systems and military and other people of interest are on all of the 9/11 flights .
this removes the question , “ why would the government attack itself ” .
it did n’t in this theory , it just took a risk that went horribly wrong .
People were warned by text message prior to 9/11 , mousaad agents filming the event from Urban Moving Systems may have been tipped off to the sting operation in advance , The Danish PM and other heads of state may have been tipped off to how the U.S. was going to catch these hijackers and people in the U.S. were warned not to fly in the days leading up to 9/11 .
going out into the real ‘ theory ’ , the wtc may have been ‘ prepared to fall ’ as a contingency plan if the sting op to catch these guys using the raytheon remotes failed .
No they built remote control planes , maybe they were on the planes to fly them from their seats , or hack into the plane from the inside .. like an fbi sting operation to land the planes and arrest the terrorists .
But something went wrong and neither the raytheon hackers nor the people on the ground to remote the planes to a safe landing using whatever devices they had on them .
The raytheon employees were visibly nervous the days and nights before 9/11/01 , if you read up on it .
My theory is the fbi new exactly when the hijacking was , and tried to catch al qaeda in the act … allow them into the cockpit and then remote the planes to saftey .
Bait and Catch .
Then present them to the citizenry as reason we have to go to war in afganistan .
Look at the trajectory of flight 77 , if it kept going it would have landed at dullies airport .
Raytheon lost employees on every flight that hit a target .

Now , if this is not coincidental enough for you :
What are the odds that Raytheon also had one office in the WTC2 ?
( AP , 9/11/01 ) http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/background/tenants.html
It was located in 91st floor in WTC2 .
Raytheon shared the floor with Washington Group and Gibbs & Hill .
While 13 employees of Washington Group died http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/lists/by-…
None died from Raytheon and Gibbs & Hill : http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/lists/by-…
This is rather surprising as after the hit of the second plane only four people survived who were above the 78th floor where the plane hit .
http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2001/worldtradecen… ”
Same for GM employees , none were on the flights .
Yet there were raytheon employees on every flight the hijackers hijacked that hit a target … amazing luck for al qaeda there .
continued from other comment .
Dong Lee , Ruben Ornedo , and Chad Keller all worked for Boeing .
Lee also worked for the NSA .
Stanley Hall , “ the dean of electronic warfare , ” ( along with Peter Gay , David Kolvacin , and Kenneth Waldie on other flights ) , worked for Raytheon .
William Caswell was a particle physicist who worked for the Navy .
His job was so classified that his family had no clue as to what he did and did not know why he was flying to California .
Charles Droz , LCDR USN Ret , was a software developer for EM solutions ( manufacturer of Wide Area Networks ) .
Robert Penniger worked for BAE Systems , ( ” an industry leader in flight control systems ” ) , whose Board is comprised of many from the intelligence community .
BAE has apparently removed their Board of Directors page , but it list a “ who ’s who ” of high level connections to the CIA , DARPA , and NSA .
( See the appendix for a list of outside directors of BAE Systems that were not on Flight 77 . )
Robert Ploger and his wife were added “ late ” to the original CNN passenger list .
He is the son of Major General Robert R Ploger USA , Ret , another “ flag ” link .
The other “ late ” addition was Sandra Teague , a physical therapist at Georgetown University Hospital .
John Sammartino and Leonard Taylor worked at Xontech ( missile defense ) , another company connected to the intelligence community , also with ties to Boeing .
Vicki Yancey worked for Vreedenberg Corp , yet another company connected to the intelligence community .
Her father describes her death as a “ planned murder . ”
Her widower works for Northrup - Grumman .
Mary Jane Booth was in a position to know what was going on at Dulles Airport as secretary for American Airlines general manager .
John Yamnicky , 71 , Capt USN Ret , was a defense contractor for Veridian who had done a number of “ black ops , ” according to his son .
The physicians , lawyers , biotech representatives , and “ human interest ” victims who were aboard , could also provide important clues , but in the interest of space , we will save them for future consideration .
Many readers recall a particular Fox Television TV show called “ The Lone Gunmen ” which was aired on March 2 , 2001 [ Download Episode ] .
In the show , the bad guys control a passenger airplane by remote control with intentions of flying it into the World Trade Center .
The villains were a Pentagon insider faction ; the motive to inflame the public and thereby legitimate new military budgets and operations .
Life indeed imitates art .
It has been reported that some people were warned not to fly that day .
One was reported to be Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco .
Another was author Salman Rushdie .
The person on that flight MOST likely to be warned was Robert Speisman .
He was an executive at Lazare Kaplan , a diamond merchant , and son in law of Maurice Templesman .
Templesman was Jackie Kennedy ’s long time lover and is highly connected according to Time Magazine .
Time also reported about about his “ special access ” to the National Security Council .
He has also “ stepped out ” with Madeleine Albright .
I attempted on three occasions to obtain a final passenger list from American Airlines .
They refuse to give a list and in fact wo n’t even verify that they gave the first list to CNN .
Since the list is in the public domain , I find it curious that they would not take ownership nor provide a current , “ correct ” list .
Would it even be necessary to “ lure ” all expendables onto the designated death flights ?
Why not just grab those you want to get rid of and then slip them into the pile later ?
Have you seen an interview with the check - in personnel for the flights who can tell us who actually got on any of these flights ?
Not a chance .
In fairness , Washington , D.C. and it ’s suburbs draw a great number of contractors for the military and intelligence communities in their normal course of business .
It may be mere coincidence that these passengers were all on the same flight ; however ; the government refuses to release information which would relieve our concerns .

Autopsy : No Arabs on Flight 77 By Thomas R. Olmsted , M.D
I am an ex Naval line officer and a psychiatrist in private practice in New Orleans , a Christian and homeschool dad .
It troubled me a great deal that we rushed off to war on the flimsiest of evidence .
I considered various ways to provide a smoking gun of who and why Sept 11th happened .
Astute observers noticed right away that there were no Arabic sounding names on any of the flight manifests of the planes that “ crashed ” on that day .
A list of names on a piece of paper is not evidence , but an autopsy by a pathologist , is .
I undertook by FOIA request , to obtain that autopsy list and you are invited to view it below .
Guess what ?
Still no Arabs on the list .
In my opinion the monsters who planned this crime made a mistake by not including Arabic names on the original list to make the ruse seem more believable .
When airline disasters occur , airlines will routinely provide a manifest list for anxious families .
You may have noticed that even before Sep 11th , airlines are pretty meticulous about getting an accurate headcount before takeoff .
It seems very unlikely to me , that five Arabs sneaked onto a flight with weapons .
This is the list provided by American of the 56 passengers .
On September 27th , the FBI published photos of the “ hijackers ” of Flight 77 .
Meanwhile , back at the ranch , the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ( AFIP ) , does a miraculous job and identifies nearly all the bodies on November 16th 2001 .
The AFIP suggest these numbers ; 189 killed , 125 worked at the Pentagon and 64 were “ passengers ” on the plane .
The AA list only had 56 and the list just obtained has 58 .
They did not explain how they were able to tell “ victims ” bodies from “ hijacker ” bodies .
In fact , from the beginning NO explanation has been given for the extra five suggested in news reports except that the FBI showed us the pictures to make up the difference , and that makes it so .
Now , being the trusting sort , I figured that the government would want to quickly dispel any rumors so we could get on with the chore of kicking Osama / Sadaam ’s butt ( were n’t these originally two different people ? ) .
It seemed simple to me .
. . produce the names of all the bodies identified by the AFIP and compare it with the publicized list of passengers .
So , I sent a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request to the AFIP and asked for an expedited response , because we were getting ready to send our boys to war on the pretext that Osama / Saddam had done the deed .
Fourteen months later , a few US soldiers dead , many Iraqi civilians pushing up daisies , and I finally get the list .
Believe me that they were n’t a bit happy to give it up , and I really have no idea why they choose now to release it .
No Arabs wound up on the morgue slab ; however , three ADDITIONAL people not listed by American Airlines sneaked in .
I have seen no explanation for these extras .
I did American the opportunity to “ revise ” their original list , but they have not responded .
The new names are : Robert Ploger , Zandra Ploger , and Sandra Teague .
The AFIP claims that the only “ passenger ” body that they were not able to identify is the toddler , Dana Falkenberg , whose parents and young sister are on the list of those identified .
The satanic masterminds behind this caper may be feeling pretty smug about the perfect crime , but they have left a raft of clues tying these unfortunates together .
The Passengers
In the foregoing , I presented evidence from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ( AFIP ) , that there were no Arabs on American Airlines Flight 77 .
This does n’t really jibe with the official story , so someone is n’t telling the truth .
This list itself is suspect because there is a special group of “ bone guys ” that are called in whenever the government needs an “ adjustment ” to their story .
About “ bone guys ” :
No , we ’re not talking folks that hang around secret Ivy League fraternities .
On May 31 , 2002 , the Washington Post had this to say about ‘ bone guys ’ :
“ … When remains of the Waco dead or 9/11 Pentagon victims or Desert Storm casualties — or most recently Chandra Levy — need to be studied , the bone guys at the Smithsonian are called in .
The bone guys read skeletons like intricate topological maps .
Sometimes they can make identification from a skull fragment the size of a quarter .
They can read race in the teeth and gender in the brow .
They can tell you who had an asymmetric nose .
They can tell you who may have been a factory worker , because bones grow more pronounced to accommodate certain muscles , and who may have been a weaver or a tailor , based on grooves in the teeth where thread was held … . ”
In other words , these were the fellows who helped tidy up the government ’s story at Waco and are “ studying ” the Sept 11th remains as well .
By now you have probably heard that many of the “ hijackers ” named by the FBI are alive and well .
The Information Times , an on - line publication , reported that Saudi Arabia ’s Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al - Faisal told the Arabic Press after meeting with President George W. Bush on Sept. 20 : “ It was proved that five of the names included in the FBI list had nothing to do with what happened . ”
According to The Orlando Sentinel , the Saudi Arabian embassy confirmed that four of the five mentioned by Al - Faisal – Saeed Alghamdi , Mohand Alshehri , Abdulaziz Alomari and Salem Alhazmi - are not dead and had nothing to do with the heinous terror attacks in New York and Washington .
( source : Christopher J. Petherick – American Free Press )
From photos of all of those that perished on that flight , it is clear that none are even “ Arab looking . ”
This seems to rule out Arabs sneaking aboard under assumed names .
If you are familiar with Operation Northwoods ( see Body of Secrets by James Bamford or thumbnail description here ) then you know that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) has both the will and ability to orchestrate an “ operation ” such as Sept 11th if they decided it was for the “ greater good . ”
Not saying that they choose to conduct September 11 attack , but they clearly have the ability .
According to Bamford , “ Operation Northwoods ” was not planned by any “ rogue element ” but proposed by General Lemnitzer , himself , and then thankfully spiked by President Kennedy .
Think also of FDR ’s foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor as exposed by Robert Stinnett in his book Day of Deceit .
Stinnett actually agrees with FDR ’s decision to allow it to happen .
Brush up on the Lusitania hoax , the USS Liberty cover - up , the Gulf of Tonkin fiction , and the Gulf War I falsified satellite photos , etc. if you are not convinced that government officials are capable of stretching the truth ( for our own good , of course ) .
It is very hard to keep a secret of this gravity .
One possible way to cut down chatter is to eliminate as many witnesses as possible , preferably during the crime itself .
Critics of “ conspiracy theorists ” have tried to nullify talk of remote controlled planes as being the talk of lunatics .
Global Hawk ( Raytheon ) is a large military aircraft that has flown 7000 miles without a pilot as discussed in this Air Force public affairs article , and is being widely used in the current Iraq war .
They also make large commercial planes for FedEx that fly by remote control as reported by the Associated Press .
The “ success ” of this operation depended on the planes reaching their destination .
Would the planners ( be they Arab or otherwise ) trust poorly trained “ pilots ” when this technology was at their disposal ?
Reported only in a Portuguese newspaper , The Portugal News Weekend Edition ( May 8 , 2002 ) , a group of US pilots deliberated nonstop for 72 hours in an independent analysis of the 911 story .
The inquiry stated , “ The so - called terrorist attack was in fact a superbly executed military operation carried out against the USA , requiring the utmost professional military skill in command , communications , and control . ”
Captain Kent Hill USAF
Ret , a friend of Chuck Burlingame ( the pilot of Flight 77 ) , confirmed the ability of flying aircraft from the ground .
An ex Vietnam fighter pilot said , “ Those birds either had a crack fighter pilot in the left seat , or they were being maneuvered by remote control . ”
The following list of passengers was gathered from many sources posted on the Internet :

Wayne Madsen Report : Barack Obama ’s post - graduate CIA employment
I ca n’t say I was particularly close to Barack – he was reserved and distant towards all of his co-workers – but I was probably as close to him as anyone .
I certainly know what he did there , and it bears only a loose resemblance to what he wrote in his book .
fta
Dan Armstrong by the way …
“ Obama ’s Account of New York Years Often Differs From What Others Say
Some say he has taken some literary license in the telling of his story .
Dan Armstrong , who worked with Mr. Obama at Business International Corporation in New York in 1984 and has deconstructed Mr. Obama ’s account of the job on his blog , analyzethis.net , wrote : “ All of Barack ’s embellishment serves a larger narrative purpose : to retell the story of the Christ ’s temptation .
The young , idealistic , would - be community organizer gets a nice suit , joins a consulting house , starts hanging out with investment bankers , and barely escapes moving into the big mansion with the white folks . ” ”

Were the September 11th attacks an FBI / Raytheon Joint Sting Operation gone ‘ jammed ’ by a third party signal ( Israel ? ) , which sabatoged the remote landings of the jets at the airports and pending arrests which would have offered proof to the American people that war with Afghanistan was needed ?
• Look up 9/11 commission ‘ minders ’ on google .
• Look up 9/11 and raytheon .
• Look up FBI investigation into put options ( you wo n’t find it , just a ‘ closed case ’ like the anthrax attacks case , with a 2 minute explanation at a press conference .
• Look up ‘ hijacker remains ’ , the results of this investigation has not been released to the public .
• Look up the two pieces of evidence that the government uses to blame al qaeda for 9/11 ( 2004 bin laden video released on the eve of the 2004 us election and the 9/11 commission , both easily discredited by common sense . )
There is no definitive proof that 19 hijackers from germany , saudi arabia and the UAE caused 9/11 .
• Look up the attempted ‘ gold robbery ’ on 9/11 .
• Look up “ we still do n’t know to this day why Norad told us what they told us ” , direct quote from the 9/11 head commissioner .
On its face you could easily disgard 9/11 as something not to at least look into , but if you do look into the things above , you will have a better understanding that there were more elements at work here , especially at the airports where the planes left from .
Also , if you apply the same devices that intelligence agents apply during interogations to figure out if someone is lying to comments the Bush Administration made about 9/11 , they are obviously lying .
Good luck .
Remember , Bush said “ no one could have envisioned this happening … no one in our government anyway ” , that means he knew about someone in another government envisioning it before it happened , but did not heed the warnings .
As far as anything past that , its classified .
It is obvious that the FBI tries to catch people in the act to get convictions , 9/11 may have been a sting operation to try to catch the terrorists in the act , while using raytheon remote technology to land the planes at the aiports and make the arrests , after the terrorists attempted the hijackings .
They could then use that as proof to the American people that a war was needed , but specific jamming devices could have damanged the Raytheon remotes and caused the planes to crash .
Where the jamming devices came from ( urban moving systems , mousaad , C130 planes ) we ’ll never know , if this is the case .
But the Sting Op theory is the best theory out there .
Discussion of 9/11 commission letter to Norad regarding the C130 “ literally following the plane that hit the pentagon ” , talks about a missle and the plane arriving around the same time ( or just before to make a dent in the wall for the plane , which would explain the lightpoles and the witnesses ) .
Original 9/11 commission letter to Norad : “ The C130 encountered flight 77 west of the Pentagon and literally followed it as it crashed into the pentagon .
This is the first we learned of this aircraft ( Norad did not mention it at the hearing ) .
It raises a number of questions … ”
I think the word “ literally ” means a little more here .
I ’ve heard on videos ( of course I will search for the link and evidence so give me a second ) that two planes flew over the pentagon .
Maybe literally means that it “ literally ” followed it in its flight path .
http://www.sheilacasey.com/2009/04/new-research-contradicts-pentagon-911-story.html
This could be why the flight path ’s are in dispute … because there were two flight paths , two planes flew over the pentagon and i’m hearing speculation that one of them fired missles into it .
Speculation though at this point .
One scenerio could be that the airliner flew in and the cargo plane shot some missles into it to finish the job .
Wow , this is fucked up .
“ Incredibly , once Ranke explained that 13 witnesses had all placed the jet at the north side of the Citgo station , on a trajectory that could not have knocked down the five light poles , England changed his story and declared that he was not where all the photographs show him to be , but actually well north of Columbia Pike – where no light poles were knocked down .
Ranke showed England numerous photos of himself , his damaged cab and the downed light pole on the bridge over Columbia Pike .
Even faced with incontrovertible evidence of his exact location , England resolutely maintained that pictures do n’t always tell the truth and that the accident with the light pole had taken place much further north . ”
Could it have been a missle fired by the cargo plane to land in the pentagon at the SAME time as the airliner hit , to soften the blow of the airliner so it would penetrate the walls ( and leave no evidence ) .
Imagine the flight hitting the pentagon at the same time a missile did .
( or near the same time ) .
People would see the airliner , but would miss the missile , it happened at once ?
Holy shit .
Original 9/11 commission letter to Norad : “ The C130 encountered flight 77 west of the Pentagon and literally followed it as it crashed into the pentagon .
This is the first we learned of this aircraft ( Norad did not mention it at the hearing ) .
It raises a number of questions … ”
Which could account for there being no video of the plane hitting the pentagon , because the pilot may have parachuted out of it .

“ Real people have known addresses .
But the current whereabouts of Eddie Shalev is unknown .
As reported by David Griffin , a 2007 search of the national telephone directory , plus Google searches by research librarian Elizabeth Woodworth , turned up no trace of him .
A LexisNexis search by Matthew Everett also came up dry . [ 35 ]
Recent searches by Woodworth and myself indicate that an “ Eddy Shalev ” resided in Rockville , Maryland as recently as 2007 .
However , the associated phone number is no longer in service .
The 9/11 memorandum raises the possibility that Shalev may have returned to Israel . ”
Ed Shalev was n’t the only Israeli to escape to israel .

Two men whom police described as Middle Eastern were detained in the township by federal imigration authorities after being found with detailed footage of the Sears Tower in Chicago .
Plymouth Police encountered the men after an officer responded to Pizzeria Uno on the 1000 block of West Ridge Pike at 2:40 p.m.
Thursday for a report of illegal dumping , according to reports .
A manager there advised the police officer that a tractor - trailer was observed backed up to the dumpster at the rear of the restaurant .
The manager noticed a freshly dumped pile of furniture adjacent to the dumpster , according to police .
The manager confronted the vehicle ’s operator , a Middle Eastern man , police said .
The man , who later identified himself as Moshe Elmakias , 30 , denied that he did anything and fled the scene , heading west on West Ridge Pike , according to police .
The manager was able to provide township police with the Florida registration number of the tractor - trailer and said that a sign posted on the side of the vehicle read “ Moving Systems Incorporated ” and included a phone number , police said .

“ Five Israelis are arrested for “ puzzling behavior ” related to the WTC attacks .
Shortly after an FBI lookout bulletin was issued for a van with the words “ Urban Moving Systems ” written on the side , officers with the East Rutherford Police Department in New Jersey stop the van after matching the license plate number with the one given in the bulletin .
According to the police report , Officer Scott DeCarlo and Sgt. Dennis Rivelli approach the van and demand the driver exit the vehicle .
The driver , Sivan Kurzberg , does not obey after being asked several more times , so the police physically remove Kurzberg and four other men from the van and handcuff them .
They have not been told the reasons for their arrest , but Kurzberg tells them , “ We are Israeli .
We are not your problem .
Your problems are our problems .
The Palestinians are the problem . ”
Again before the police have made any mention of the 9/11 attacks , another one of the arrested men says , “ [ W ]e were on the West Side Highway in New York City during the incident . ”
In fact , it will later be determined they were on the roof of a building at Liberty State Park , watching and videotaping the first crash into the WTC ( see Shortly After 8:46 a.m. September 11 , 2001 ) .

Bush ’s Government Kooks intimidated the 9/11 Ommission with agents called “ minders ” who sat in and minded commission interviews and sometimes even answered questions for those being interviewed .
Nice investigation , no really …
“ As a result , witnesses have not responded to our questions . ”
It does n’t matter how many times Fox News plays the Hannity 9/11 commission is truth , 9/11 families special … the commission was intimidated by the Bush Administration and did not get the truth .
‘ One minder “ acted as a participant , ” “ responded to inquiries ” and “ consulted with ” the interviewee .
She took verbatim notes in all three interviews she attended , doing so while sitting next to the interviewees in two of them .
In addition , in one interview she “ sighed heavily repeatedly . ” ’
“ 9/11 has been investigated but the conspiracy theories have n’t stopped .
They will never stop until the truthers see an investigation that agrees with their theories . ”
Ok , so ‘ minders ’ sat in on the interviews and there was an agreement on its ‘ scope ’ between Bush and the Commission , that ’s cool ?
http://www.scribd.com/doc/13279605/911-Commission-Memo-Executive-Branch-Minders-Intimidation-of-Witnesses
Ok , maybe this is your first time on the internet or something , but my other comment in this thread contained this link .
Bush had people at the interviews intimidating them , called ‘ minders ’ … that completely invalidates “ The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States ” .
It also says there that the commission and the executive branch “ agreed on the scope of the investigation ” .
Those are the 9/11 commissions words , not mine .
Learn a thing or two .
“ You do n’t know it yet and it ’s likely that the information will ever filter through your psychosis . ”
Once again , what you need people to ‘ know ’ and what the truth is are two different things .
To force people to ‘ believe ’ something without having the facts behind it or having a sham investigation behind it is the actual psychosis .
Only a mentally challenged person would believe the 9/11 commission , as you call it , was not a joke … that is based on the 9/11 commissions words against ‘ minders ’ , not my opinion .
Have an independent investigation , or are you afraid to ?
To big of a area of coverage for the independent investigation , is n’t that right ?
No bush and cheney there to save you anymore so you take to the internet to save yourselves .
The truth wins in the end , do n’t ever forget that .
No where have I mentioned opinions about anything that happened on 9/11 , i have criticized the investigation in the post .
that ’s it .
If you want to make it obvious that you wish for the conversation to go into the muddy waters of opinion you are doing a great job .
But on its face , the investigation was a joke , and we do n’t have a legitmate one to this day .
What will it reveal ?
Not sure , but it might be worth investigating 9/11 for real at least once … without minders there to babysit .
You have no idea what everyone else believes about anything , you are one person at a computer .
If that is not the final word on the matter , where is the second word ?
9/11 is under the rug .
As soon as NIST needed to revise their report , their credibility was out the window and showed they did n’t include all the facts or get it right .
I could have done a report too , but if someone says its wrong and i’m affiliated with the government who is in question , i have no credibility .
You have to be dumb to not understand that .
A independent of government investigation has not been done .
Having the ‘ scope of the investigation ’ agreed upon by zeilkow and bush is a joke .
Once again , dumb to believe it was thorough or even had the balls behind it to look into it on that high level .
And I beg to differ , the truth will win when a independent investigation without government minders there reveals all the facts from witnesses that may have been intimidated the first time by those ‘ minders ’ .
Seek help growing a spine .
You also ca n’t bring yourself to type the word ‘ minders ’ or acknowledge their existence .
I win .
Memo shows proof that the Bush Administration had people ( minders ) sit in on the interviews conducted by the 9/11 commission to intimidate and , in some cases , answer questions for the witnesses directly .
Nice investigation .

“ TRIPOD had originally been scheduled to take place on September 12th , 2001 , at Pier 92 . ” The Office for Domestic Preparedness was assigned to Dick Cheney by George W. Bush on May 8 , 2001 and had a role in this bioterror drill turned 9/11 command center in NYC a day earlier .
So whenever these people got there , monday or tuesday ( some may have arrived before that ) it is either evidence of pre-planning by cheney or a sheer coincedence that FEMA had teams on the ground ready to go by ‘ chance ’ .
According to a May 22 , 2002 Press Release from the NYC Office of Emergency Management , the TRIPOD , or ‘ Point - of - Dispensing ’ drill , was successfully held that day .
The Press Release states :
“ TRIPOD had originally been scheduled to take place on September 12th , 2001 , at Pier 92 – which ironically had served as the temporary home of OEM shortly after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 . ”
The release also mentions that the TRIPOD exercise is supported by “ The Office of Justice Programs , through the Office for Domestic Preparedness ” .
The Office for Domestic Preparedness was the effort assigned to Dick Cheney by George W. Bush on May 8 , 2001 .
Although reports indicate that Cheney never convened any meetings of this Task Force prior to September 2001 , it seems that there must have been some sort of planning involved with the organization and scheduling of Operation TRIPOD for September 12 , 2001 .
With all of the unpleasant news of 9/11 , it must have pleased Cheney that the scheduling of this drill made the pre-assembled emergency team immediately available to New York City .
Who would have thought ?
Major questions exist as to why FEMA would deny being in New York City prior to 9/11 without mentioning the 9/12 bioterror drill .
These questions must now be addressed as the initial suspicions of those who learned of the Tom Kenney statement have been clearly validated .
The coincidental presence of a large FEMA team in NYC at the location , Pier 92 , which became the Command Center for the entire emergency operation is disturbing .
An alert press and a legitimate 9 - 11 Commission should have raised this issue long ago .
September 11 was going to be a busy day at the OEM .
Staff members arrived early to prepare for Operation Tripod , an exercise that would test the plan to distribute antibiotics to the entire city population during a bioterrorism attack .
July 25 , 2001 – “ Yesterday was also the beginning of a 90 - day transition period in which control will move from the Port Authority to the partnership of Silverstein Properties and Westfield America . ”
So lots of things moving in and out of the buildings ?

So the Mafia while the port authority was there , managed to get passed security , but trained intelligence / military / al qaeda could n’t have gotten passed during the transition period between the PA and silverstein properties ?
That is exactly when they would try it
See this transition ?
Then look at the transition effect of NORAD drills on 9/11 … things moving around … things go more unnoticed … hey where does this box go … who are those workers over there moving things around … old security out , new security in …. this is all unrelated to the towers falling ?
The sale of the twin towers is completely unrelated to 9/11 ?
Completely ?
C’mon , any rational person can see what was happening here .
Madoff 2 ? Silverstein , Jew , says ‘ he was referring to ’the firefighters ’ when he said “ pull it ” in regards to building 7 … Problem : Firefighters were already out of the building .
Passport survives Crash and Collapse , found by FBI a few blocks away .
Significant piece of evidence .
Wait , how would they know it was evidence though , the 9/11 attacks happened a few days before and the 9/11 report was years later .
The 9/11 hijackers obtained 13 driver ’s licenses ( two of which were duplicates ) and 21 USA or state - issued identification cards .
So why would they have their passport on their person during a domestic flight , easily available for the FBI to find on the street after the planes entered the WTC ?
The “ Arab looking hijackers ” the 9/11 phone calls describe could have been agents from Israel impersonating Arab men , with fake passports .
Unless someone here can verify the remains of the hijackers .
Oh wait , you ca n’t do that because the FBI wo n’t let you .
If someone had gained access to which Muslim ’s were being monitored by the FBI at the time , could the 19 hijackers on September 11th have used fake passports with these names ?
“ Chertoff is “ as tough on terrorists as he was on the Democrats in the Whitewater investigation , ” oh , except for when he let Urban Moving Systems flee the country …
“ ‘ To the best of my knowledge , my client Urban Moving Systems and Dominik Suter are not targets , ’ said attorney Jay Hamill of Jersey City .
‘ This is an informational situation .
We ’re cooperating completely and have objected to nothing they ’ve requested . ' ”
“ Dominick Suter , closed his business days after the Sept. attacks and returned to Israel .
He was in such a hurry that some of Urban Moving System ’s customers were left with their furniture stranded in storage facilities . ”
Urban Moving Systems was run by Mossad out of New Jersey in 2001 , the Anthrax letters were mailed from New Jersey , the Recent Corruption arrests were Rabbis in New Jersey , put two and two together on why the investigation is a mess , its a cover up , we know who it would lead to .
I ’ll bet Michael and Benjamin Chertoff know a good reason why the wikipedia page for Urban Moving Systems is so undetailed
“ What authorities have not elaborated on is the connection between the confiscated Sears Tower video that was found in Pennsylvania and the antics of Urban Moving System ’s employees . ”
Times Online in November 2001 regarding the gold under the WTC – “ At first police believed the terrorist attack was an attempted gold robbery . ”
“ The sources said the gold was found in a delivery tunnel under 5 World Trade Center . ” … oh ok … wait … why was it in the delivery tunnel on September 11th ?

For 100 years the Arab and Muslim world have known that when it comes to European and American imperialistic designs on the Middle East there are two separate universes with separate political , economic , racial , and legal standards .
With self assured arrogance , hypocrisy , and double standards western powers reserved the " right of might " to inflict devastating invasions , occupations , mass murders , ethnic cleansing and the Anti-Jewish cleansing of Europe by gifting a land , without ownership or right , to European Jews who proceeded to emulate European colonialism to attack and ethnically cleanse an innocent people from their land .
Israel was born by England 's illegal gifting of a foreign land and subsequently immorally supported by the United States at the expense of a hapless population living under the most dire and brutal of occupations .
Throughout the history of their imperialistic , colonial designs those western powers and Israel , the fate of the indigenous populations was never an issue or matter of concern to these warring states .
From the Native Americans , North and South , to Africans , Arabs , Muslims , Asians , and the Aborigines of Australia and New Zealand , their lives , history , religion , culture and language were fodder for extinction to satisfy the economic greed of western powers .
In 1917 , a simple typed letter of 68 words signed by Lord Balfour , foreign minister of England and addressed to the Jewish banker , Lord Rothschild , proscribed Palestine , still under Ottoman rule , " a national homeland for the Jews . "
It became known as the “ Balfour Declaration ” and used a manifesto by Zionists to justify their illegal , immoral , and genocidal design on Palestine .
" In Palestine , we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country … Zionism , be it right or wrong , is rooted in age - old traditions , in present needs , in future hopes , of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land . ” - Lord Balfour , UK Foreign Minister From David Lloyd George ( “ We have the right to bomb niggers ” ) , Prime Minister of England 1916 - 1922 - to Lord Arthur Balfour , UK Foreign Minister 1916 - 1919 and author of the 1917 Balfour Declaration - to President Truman - to the current Vice President of the United States , Joseph Biden , all have declared themselves to be “ Zionists ”
Not since World War II has one western leader , not even one , ever been charged or prosecuted for war crimes against humanity .
While Holocaust museums are being erected around the world , often at tax payers expense , not one single museum in a western capital , with the exception of Latin America , has ever been built to memorialize the genocides against African Americans , Latinos , Africans , Arabs , Muslims , Asians , and Aborigines - all victims of imperial holocausts .
These days in London an “ inquiry ” , not trial , named after its chair , Chicot Inquiry , has been looking into the reasons and justifications that led to the massively illegal war and devastation of an innocent nation , Iraq .
So far , former British government officials have presented evidence that the war was “ illegal ” , did not have support from the U.N. , nor from the entire world except for UK and US , - that Tony Blair had been told that there were no Weapons of Mass Destruction , and that intelligence was “ sexed up ” and manipulated to justify Blair ’s war crimes against Iraq .
Blair launched his war crime against Iraq with the same zeal , lies , and fear mongering propaganda used by George Bush , Dick Cheney and Pau Wolfowitz .
Paul Wolfowitz , Deputy Secretary of the Department of Defense , called by Time Magazine , the “ Architect ” of the Iraq War , was asked in a Vanity Fair interview , May 2003 , why was the Iraq War based on Saddam ’s alleged possession of WMD’s .
This time , he actually told the truth .
Wolfowitz stated : “ For bureaucratic reasons , we settled on one issue , weapons of mass destruction , because it was the one reason everyone could agree on . ”
As a second reason he stated that the war gave the U.S. the opportunity to withdraw its troops from Saudi Arabia where Saudi hostility against the presence of the troops was high .
Tony Blair ’s lies to the British people , despite their immense opposition to the war , and to Parliament have been aptly documented .
But this arrogant war criminal , ironically a MidEast " peace envoy " , told the Chicot Inquiry that he did not lie about his justifications for war and unconscionably stood by his false assertions for the devastating illegal war .
He was unrepentant and unremorseful for the millions of dead , injured , and displaced Iraqis .
Nor was he unrepentant for the sacrifice of British soldiers .
In true narcissistic and pathological fashion he said he would make the same decision to invade Iraq again today .
Even Saddam ’s death would n’t have stopped their messianic psychosis to invade Iraq .
Got to do it for Oil and Israel .
Blair quotes that reveal a pathological liar with no conscience but possessing a hypocritical racist soul , much like all Israeli leaders , including today ’s war criminal du jour , Netanyahu .
“ Yes , there are consequences of war .
If we remove Saddam by force , people will die and some will be innocent .
And we must live with the consequences of our actions , even the unintended ones . ”
“ Ridding the world of Saddam would be an act of humanity .
It is leaving him there that is in truth inhumane . ”
“ The document discloses that his military planning allows for some of the WMD to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them . "
- Foreword to UK Government dossier on
Iraqi weapons of mass destruction
Tony Blair 's arrogant testimony to the Chicot Inquiry is a blatant genocidal example of a western leader trying to justify the unjustifiable .
Both Blair and Bush knew beforehand that Iraq had no WMD's and that their falsified intelligence came from an alcoholic liar ( “ Curveball ” ) and Iraqi dissident , Ahmad Chalabi , whose lies gave Blair and Bush the weapons for mass destruction of Iraq .
The British Intelligence even plagiarized statements from a U.S. PhD student ’s thesis on Iraq which included the outrageous claim that Saddam can launch WMD ’s within 45 minutes .
Blair in true contempt to truth and history used Bush ’s fallback position that 9/11 changed their outlook on world affairs and became their pretext for a world “ war on terror ” .
Blair ’s testimony showcased that the best defense was a good offense .
The U.N. , Fourth Geneva Convention , I.C.C. , and International Laws were created by western powers and thus easily manipulated and selectively applied by them to the third world and not to themselves who self ascribe the right to devastate in the name of self defense , even pre-emptively .
Using such logic any nation can invade another pre-emptively if it can manufacture hysteria , lies and self perceived threats to itself .
Thus China is totally justified to invade Taiwan , Russia can invade Poland and the Czech Republic given America ’s deployment of missile defense systems , Cuba can invade the U.S. , Turkey can invade Armenia and so on .
Within this cabal of righteous powers is Israel , a nation born out of violence , terrorism , and ethnic cleansing ; a nation that has repeatedly launched pre-emptive wars using the western mantra of " self defense " .
Israel , a state unlike any other that commits genocides with total impunity daring the world to criticize much less consider prosecuting its leaders for documented crimes against humanity , as evidenced by the Goldstone Report .
Not satisfied with the bloodshed in Iraq , Blair has the audacity to call for the same devastation of the Muslim nation du jour , Iran , thereby joining the Israeli motivated policy of “ next stop , Tehran ” .
Iran , like Iraq , poses no threat to either , the west or Israel , even if it does possess nuclear weapons .
Would Iran commit suicide or would it insanely nuke Israel thereby committing a holocaust against Palestinians , the very people Iran loves and defends ?
Would it destroy Jerusalem , while causing massive nuclear radiation in the entire region and risking massive nuclear retaliation from Israel , a state in possession of hundreds of nuclear weapons and a non-signatory to the Non Proliferation Treaty ?
Blaming , then bombing Muslims seems to be Blair's , Obama's , and Israel 's policy .
Nuclear Israel , demonstrably a criminal nation , is untouchable while non-nuclear Muslim nations are bombable .
Justice lies in the eye of the criminal .
TRUTH has always been the enemy of western civilization and in due time will be its undoing .
" The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence .
Westerners often forget this fact , non-Westerners never do . "

Military Restructures Afghanistan Police Contract

An obscure Army contracting office with ties to the private security firm Blackwater has formally lost control of a lucrative contract to train Afghan police , the Pentagon and U.S. military officials in Afghanistan confirmed to TWI .
[ Security1 ]
The office , known as the Counter - Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office or CNTPO , came under criticism from the Government Accountability Office earlier this month for having only a marginal relationship to the training of Afghan police .
CNTPO has responsibility for the military ’s counternarcotics efforts , not the training of foreign military forces , and only received control over the contract after the U.S. military last year moved to take it away from the State Department and sought to rapidly award the contract to one of the five companies with which it does business — one of which is Blackwater .
That bureaucratic shift prompted a protest from State ’s contractor , DynCorp , which stood to lose millions from the switch and argued that a counternarcotics office was an improper choice to award a contract for police training services .
On March 15 , the Government Accountability Office agreed , formally saying that the military ’s solicitations were “ outside the scope of [ CNTPO 's ] existing contracts ” according to a top GAO procurement official , Ralph O. White .
But GAO also did not formally say that CNTPO had to be stripped of its contract authority , creating confusion over the future of the contract .
According to several officials , the U.S. / NATO military command in Afghanistan responsible for training Afghan security forces , known as NTM - A or CSTC - A , have decided keeping CNTPO involved would invite the same complaints that prompted GAO to scotch a contract worth up to $ 1 billion .
“ NTM -A / CSTC - A has seen the GAO ruling , is reviewing it and evaluating how to proceed in a manner that most effectively meets legal requirements and advances the key goal of helping to train an effective Afghan National Police Force , ” said Lt. Col .
Mark Wright , a Pentagon spokesman .
Reached in Kabul for comment , Lt. Col. David Hylton , a spokesman for NTM - A / CSTC- A , confirmed that “ we ’re reevaluating how to proceed . ”
Hylton added that every aspect of the contract was up for discussion within the command , and he guessed that no decisions would be made about even how to move forward with the bidding process until mid-April at the earliest .
The contract first garnered attention last month , when CNTPO ’s connection to Blackwater appeared in a late - February Politico story .
The same day the story ran , the Senate Armed Services Committee released a report accusing Blackwater employees of improperly taking hundreds of rifles and pistols for personal use out of a U.S. military weapons depot in Afghanistan intended to supply those very same Afghan policemen .
Scott Amey , the general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight , observed that the military “ tried to fit a square peg into a round hole ” by giving a counter - narcoterrorism office awarding duties for a police training contract .
“ The best case scenario now is that this [ contract ] will operate through an open process that will allow anyone to come to the table , ” Amey said .
CNTPO initially got the contract because its existing relationships with the five security contractors meant that it could rapidly award a bid for a mission identified by the military as vital to the U.S. war effort , a process that entailed restricting the eligible pool of bidders .
“ If the government has an immediate need , it could conduct a limited competition with vendors with proven capabilities ” to meet the contract requirements , Amey said .
Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan , has identified that need as immediate .
“ There ’s a shortage of trainers , ” McChrystal said at a press briefing on March 17 .
“ And we have been very unequivocal in our statement of that , both to Washington , D.C. , and of course , more appropriately , to NATO . ”
DynCorp ’s old contract with the State Department expires in August .
Hylton said NTM - A / CSTC - A had not yet made a decision on whether to seek a temporary extension of DynCorp ’s contract .
Col. John Ferrari , a senior officer in the training command ’s programs directorate , was in charge of the decision - making process for the revised contract .
A spokesman for DynCorp , Jason Rossbach , said that the company — which the Iraq inspector general has criticized , along with the State Department , for negligent book - keeping over the police - training contract — awaited the outcome of NTM - A / CSTC - A ’s contract restructuring .
“ We ’re interested in bidding , whatever the government decides to do , ” Rossbach said .

There are now considerably more tigers in captivity than in the wild Governments need to crack down on illegal tiger trading if the big cats are to be saved , the UN has warned .
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) meeting in Doha , Qatar heard that tiger numbers are continuing to fall .
Organised crime rings are playing an increasing part in illegal trading of tiger parts , CITES says , as they are with bears , rhinos and elephants .
Interpol is working with CITES to track and curb the international trade .
Last year , World Bank chief Robert Zoellick said the global black market in wildlife products was worth about $ 10 bn per year , making wildlife the third most valuable illicit commodity after drugs and weapons .
Global medicine Despite attempts to protect tigers , numbers have approximately halved over the last decade , with fewer than 3,200 remaining in the wild .
The decline is seen across sub -species and in most range states .
Many populations are small , and are threatened by deforestation as well as poaching .
" If we use tiger numbers as a performance indicator , then we must admit that we have failed miserably and that we are continuing to fail , " said CITES secretary - general Willem Wijnstekers .

" Although the tiger has been prized throughout history , and is a symbol of incredible importance in many cultures and religions , it is now literally on the verge of extinction . "
CITES enforcement officials said government agencies including police and customs needed to step up efforts to combat the illegal trade .
Although China and other East Asian countries are the principal consumers of tiger parts , exports travel much further afield .
Earlier this month , Operation Tram , co-ordinated by Interpol and including enforcement authorities in 18 countries , netted medicines containing wildlife products worth an estimated $ 10 m .
Tigers , bears and rhinos were among the animals used in making the medicines .
Traditional cures Conservationists also point to China 's tiger farms as a threat to the wild animals .
Although China does not officially permit the sale of goods from these farms , in practice several investigations have revealed tiger parts are being sold .
Campaigners warn this perpetuates a market into which wild tiger parts can be sold , often commanding a higher value as products made from wild animals are perceived to be more " potent . "
Just before the CITES meeting opened , the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies ( WFCMS ) called on traditional medicine practitioners to abandon the use of tiger parts .
" We will ask our members not to use endangered wildlife in traditional Chinese medicine , and reduce the misunderstanding and bias of the international community , " said WFCMS deputy secretary Huang Jianyin .
" The traditional Chinese medicine industry should look for substitutes and research on economical and effective substitutes for tiger products . "
A resolution before the fortnight - long CITES meeting calls for greater co-operation between regional enforcement authorities to cut down the tiger product trade , and to ensure that breeding operations are " consistent with the conservation of wild populations " .

" Allowing the death penalty for repeat sex offenders who rape a child younger than 6 , punishing adults who provide liquor to teens in their homes by as much as life in prison and requiring at least one hour of counseling before a couple can seek a divorce all won the support Monday of a House committee .
House Bill 2965 is an attempt to comply with a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling , which basically nullified a 2006 law that allowed execution or life without parole of a person convicted of a second offense of rape or other sex crimes involving a child under 14 years old .
Rep. Rex Duncan , the bill 's author , said the intent of his measure is to allow the death penalty or life without parole for convicted sexual offenders who are convicted of raping a child less than 6 years old .
" If the Supreme Court someday finds that this statute is unconstitutional I do n't believe that the defendant would be entitled to a new trial or sentencing because it would revert back to the only other sentence that is available which would be life without parole , " said Duncan , R - Sand Springs .
For parents , the frontlines of the war on drugs may involve common household items such as nail polish , glue , bleach , or air freshener — this according to the results of a new national health study .
In fact , according to information compiled by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ) from 2006 through 2008 , more 12 - year - old children are “ huffing ” or inhaling dangerous chemicals than using marijuana and cocaine combined .
Furthermore , according to a March 11 SAMHSA press release that helped kick off National Inhalants & Poisons Awareness
Week , their findings “ show a rate of lifetime inhalant use among 12 year olds of 6.9 percent , compared to a rate of 5.1 percent for nonmedical use of prescription type drugs ; a rate of 1.4 percent for marijuana ; a rate of 0.7 percent for use of hallucinogens ; and a 0.1 rate for cocaine use . ”
In an interview with Reuters , SAMHSA Administrator Pamela S. Hyde called the findings “ frustrating because the danger comes from a variety of very common household products that are legal , they ’re easy to get , they ’re lying around the home and it ’s easy for kids to buy them .
Kids and parents do n’t think of these things as dangerous because they were never meant to be used to be intoxicating . ”
According to the National Drug Intelligence Center ( NDIC ) , symptoms of inhalant abuse are similar to alcohol intoxication and include dizziness , hallucinations , belligerent behavior , impaired judgment , disorientation , inattentiveness , and depression , especially when substances are used over a long period of time .
Furthermore , the NDIC website warns that death from huffing harmful products “ can occur after a single use or after prolonged use .
Sudden sniffing death ( SSD ) may result within minutes of inhalant abuse from irregular heart rhythm leading to heart failure .
Other causes of death include asphyxiation , aspiration , or suffocation . ”

She is now approaching six months old .
The list of the biggest earners in finance usually reads like a Who ’s Who of Wall Street .
But these days , it reads more like a Who ’s That ?
It turns out that some of the highest - paid financial executives in America work far from the canyons of Lower Manhattan , at companies that have largely avoided the outcry over the return of hefty paydays on Wall Street .
Topping the list is John G. Stumpf , head of Wells Fargo , the bank based in San Francisco , according to an analysis of 2009 compensation in the industry .
Mr. Stumpf was paid a personal best of $ 18.7 million in cash and stock for 2009  up 64 percent from 2007 , just before the financial crisis struck .
Mr. Stumpf is making twice as much as Lloyd C. Blankfein , his counterpart at Goldman Sachs .
Mr. Blankfein  who for many Americans has come to symbolize this new period of Wall Street riches  was paid $ 9.7 million for 2009 , less than some expected .
The First American Brain Drain
Baris Guzel is the kind of fellow who used to find his future in America .
Not anymore .
Guzel is a 25 - year - old student from Turkey working on his master ’s degree in engineering management at Duke University .
He and four friends plan to launch a company offering a free online tool that would allow website operators to poll their readers .
It might work , it might not .
That ’s what American entrepreneurship is all about .
Or it used to be .
Unfortunately for America , Guzel is thinking about opening his venture in Germany .
“ It is hard for foreigners to get a job these days [ in the US ] , ” he explains to Business Week .
“ In Germany , it is easy to obtain a working visa . ”
Guzel ’s story says a lot about America ’s future – and how you need to invest during the coming decade .
It ’s a brutal truth : America is losing some of its most promising entrepreneurial talent – the legions of young foreigners who come to study at US universities .
In recent years , foreign students snagged 60 percent of engineering doctorates in the United States .
If you widen the pool to doctorates in engineering , mathematics , computer science , physics and economics , foreigners still accounted for 50 percent .
Immigrants were CEOs or lead technologists at over 50 percent of Silicon Valley startups in the last decade .
Immigrants co-founded Google , eBay , Intel , and Yahoo , among others .
Time was when these students exited the academy , they stayed stateside .
Ninety - two percent of Chinese Ph.D.s in science and engineering remained in the United States for at least five years after their studies – and 85 percent of Indians .
No more .
One of Guzel ’s professors , Vivek Wadhwa , goes so far as to say “ the United States may be experiencing the first brain drain in its history . ”
In 2009 , Wadhwa was among four researchers from Duke , Harvard , and Berkeley who compiled a survey of more than 1,200 foreign - born students for the Kauffman Foundation .
The number of Chinese who plan to stay is now just 54 percent , while the number of Indians who expect to remain is 58 percent .
What ’s more , only seven percent of Chinese students surveyed and 25 percent of Indian students believed the American economy ’s best days still lay ahead .
But overwhelming majorities of both Indian and Chinese students believed their home country ’s best days still lay ahead .
No doubt that ’s linked to their perceived job prospects .
And that perception is colored by the successes their countrymen already achieved after returning home .
Wadhwa and his colleagues previously surveyed foreign students who ’d already returned to their home countries .
“ Only 10 percent of the Indian returnees held senior management positions in the United States , ” he says , “ but 44 percent found jobs at this level in India .
Chinese returnees went from 9 percent in senior management in the United States to 36 percent in China .
Opportunities for professional advancement were considered to be better at home than in the United States by 61 percent of Indians and 70 percent of Chinese . ”
P.J. Lavakare ’s experience backs up those numbers .
He ’s an Indian “ pioneer ” of this migration pattern .
He earned a Ph.D. from the University of Rochester on a Fulbright scholarship in 1963 and returned home to shepherd generations of young Indians through the same process .
Nowadays , he says , “ attractive job offers in the Indian corporate sector have given a new dimension to the mobility of Indian scholars who are now considering returning to India to take up challenging and lucrative assignments in the growing multinational sector in India . ”
That is , instead of taking a low - paying job in an Indian university , they can take a relatively high - paying one at a multinational corporation .
Follow The Capital , Follow The Brains
Most Americans would have a hard time wrapping their minds around this domestic “ brain drain . ”
The US has always been the land of opportunity … the beacon of hope … for the rest of the world .
Or so we ’ve grown up telling ourselves .
After all , “ brain drains ” are what used to happen to other countries – Warsaw Pact fossils living under Moscow ’s thumb , or the soft - socialist nations of Western Europe .
But if the kind of people who helped build Google , Intel , and eBay now choose to do the same in the countries where they came from , then it pays to follow the money – and the brains .
In other words , if you have n’t yet expanded your investment horizons beyond US - based companies , there ’s no better time than now to start – because the Googles of tomorrow will likely be found outside American shores .
One very simple way to get started is to buy the India Fund ( NYSE : IFN ) .
It ’s a closed - end mutual fund that trades just like a US stock .
It gives you exposure to every facet of India ’s economy , which is forecast by the World Bank to grow faster than anywhere else in 2010 – including China .
You get a cross-section of the Indian economy – energy , finance , telecom – but this is an actively - managed fund that seeks to outperform the Indian market as a whole .
If you ’d put money in The India Fund in the autumn of 2008 – as world markets were in full panic mode – you ’d have been up 31 % a year later .
We anticipate much better is still to come .
You wo n’t want to trade in and out of this fund .
Just tuck it away in your portfolio and let it ride for a few years .

Andrey Ternovskiy , creator of Chat Roulette , just might be sitting on the hottest Internet property since Facebook was founded five years ago .
But he ’s not American .
He ’s Russian .
And that ’s putting him smack in the middle of some powerful forces .
On the one hand , Russia investors backed by the Prime Minister himself are egging him to stay .
But the freedom and riches of America might just draw him away .
That tension is outlined in the first profile of Ternovskiy to appear , published by German daily Der Spiegel .
Just check out this amazing scene , in which Yuri Milner–a Russian investor with a net worth is around $ 680 million and who ’s Facebook ’s largest overseas backer–tries to entice Ternovskiy :
Milner and Ternovskiy talk for an hour and a half .
The multimillionaire
would like to go into business with the teenager , who has n’t been to
school in weeks and is on the verge of being expelled because of his
truancy .
After all , Ternovskiy is a businessman now .
Milner wants to
buy 10 percent of Chatroulette .
He wants Ternovskiy to name his price
but the teenager simply strings the entrepreneur along .
And the stakes , of course , are international in scope :
… The combined value of Google , Microsoft and Facebook amounts to
roughly $ 500 billion , or about a third of the Russian economy ’s annual
output .
So if Russia–which has more than 50 million Internet users
and boasts one of the fastest - growing markets –hopes to catch up ,
then it will need to keep talents like Ternovskiy at home .
But Ternovskiy does n’t sign with Milner straight away .
He wants to
think about Milner ’s offer first .
How much is his idea really worth ?
Some estimates put it at worth somewhere between € 10 million and €30
million .
And should he join forces with a Russian business partner or
with an American company ?
The profile has a few fascinating tidbits –Ternovskiy is busy trying to keep “ freaks and fuckers ” off the site .
And the pictures are priceless –the fresh - faced tyke as he grins in a bedroom filled with empty bookshelves , or out in front of his grim Soviet - era housing complex .
But more troubling for Milner and Russia , he ’s planning on at least visiting America to hear out investors .
“ The Internet is my world .
It connects Moscow with the West , ” he says .
And he ’s always dreamed about owning a Silicon Valley start - up .
There ’s been lots of talk that American is on the decline , because we
no longer draw the smartest young immigrants .
But it ’s telling that
Ternovskiy ’s dreams seem to be drawing him here .
Be true to yourself , and better romantic relationships will follow , research suggests .
A new study examined how dating relationships were affected by the ability of people to see themselves clearly and objectively , act in ways consistent with their beliefs , and interact honestly and truthfully with others .
In other words , the ability to follow the words of William Shakespeare : " to thine own self be true , " said Amy Brunell , lead author of the study and assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State University 's Newark campus .
Findings showed that college students who reported being more true to themselves also reported more positive dating relationships .
" If you 're true to yourself , it is easier to act in ways that build intimacy in relationships , and that 's going to make your relationship more fulfilling , " Brunell said .
The study appears online in the journal Personality and Individual Differences and will be published in an upcoming print edition .
Participating in the study were 62 heterosexual couples , all of whom were college students .
The participants completed a long list of questionnaires in three separate sessions that took place about two weeks apart .
The first set of questionnaires probed how true participants were to themselves , a characteristic that psychologists call " dispositional authenticity . "
This was measured through the answers to questions like " For better or for worse , I am aware of who I truly am . "
In the second phase , participants answered questions examining various aspects of their relationship functioning , including their willingness to discuss their emotions with their partner , and whether they kept secrets .
The third phase involved measures of relationship satisfaction and personal well - being .
Overall , the study found that both men and women who reported being more true to themselves also behaved in more intimate and less destructive ways with their partner , and that led to them feeling their relationship was more positive .
In addition , they also reported greater personal well - being .
But the study revealed an interesting gender difference in how authenticity in men and women affected their partners , Brunell said .
Men who were more true to themselves had partners who showed more healthy relationship behaviors .
However , there was no significant relationship between women being true to themselves and men's relationship behaviors .
That finding may be the result of relationship gender roles in our society , she said .
" Typically in dating and marital relationships , the women tend to be ' in charge ' of intimacy in the relationship , " Brunell explained .
" So when men have this dispositional authenticity , and want to have an open , honest relationship , it makes women 's job easier - they can more easily regulate intimacy , " she said .
But since men have less of a role in developing relationship intimacy , they were not affected as much by whether their partners were true to themselves or not .
The study also confirmed findings from other studies that show that when men or women act in constructive , healthy ways in a relationship , it increases their partners ' satisfaction with the relationship .
Brunell said being true to yourself does n't mean that you should accept all of your flaws and not try to make positive changes in your life .
But you should be aware of both your limitations and areas where you can improve .
One payoff could be better romantic relationships .
" It should n't be a surprise , but being true to yourself is linked to having healthier and happier relationships for both men and women , " she said .

McLaren are expected to make some minor upgrades ahead of Melbourne McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton believes rivals Red Bull are " ridiculously faster " than the rest of the F1 field .
Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel led in Bahrain before slipping to fourth , with team - mate Mark Webber eighth behind Ferrari 's winner Fernando Alonso .
" The Red Bull is ridiculously faster than anyone else 's car .
It 's insane , " said Hamilton .
Red Bull clinched victory in the final three races of last season to finish second in the constructors ' standings .
And Hamilton believes the Milton Keynes - based team , the only leading outfit to retain the same driver line - up over the summer , hold an advantage in the current campaign .
606 : DEBATE
There is no reason , besides reliability , why Vettel or even Webber should not win the championship
rarewarefan
" At the end of the year , they had so much more than us , even though we had won a couple of grands prix , " he said .
Vettel was impressive in qualifying on pole position round the Sakhir circuit and had built a commanding lead of over five seconds on Alonso before his first pit-stop .
A faulty spark plug was blamed for the subsequent loss of power that saw the German overtaken by Alonso , his Ferrari team - mate Felipe Massa and Hamilton .
Hamilton believes Melbourne 's street circuit suits his McLaren better than the Middle East .
" I 'm looking forward to Melbourne .
I like the circuit , I think we will go well there and I do n't think we will have the same problems that slowed our progress in Bahrain , " he said .
Hamilton finished third on his F1 debut at Albert Park , before returning in 2008 to claim the first victory of his championship - winning season .
But it was the scene of controversy for the 25 - year - old last season as he was disqualified for misleading race stewards , an incident that prompted the sacking of McLaren sporting director Dave Ryan .
Practice for the Australian Grand Prix , the season 's second race , begins in Melbourne on Friday .

Several readers had follow - up questions in response to this article .
Luke 's responses can be found in How FarmVille Scales - The Follow - up .
If real farming was as comforting as it is in Zynga 's mega - hit Farmville then my family would have probably never left those harsh North Dakota winters .
None of the scary bedtime stories my Grandma used to tell about farming are true in FarmVille .
Farmers make money , plants grow , and animals never visit the red barn .
I guess it 's just that keep - your - shoes - clean back - to - the - land charm that has helped make FarmVille the " largest game in the world " in such an astonishingly short time .
How did FarmVille scale a web application to handle 75 million players a month ?
Fortunately FarmVille's Luke Rajlich has agreed to let us in on a few their challenges and secrets .
Here 's what Luke has to say ...
The format of the interview was that I sent Luke a few general questions and he replied with this response :
FarmVille has a unique set of scaling challenges which are unique to the application .
The game has had to scale fast and far .
The game had 1 M daily players after 4 days and 10 M after 60 days .
At the time of launch , the largest social game was 5 M daily players .
Currently , FarmVille has 28 M daily players and 75 M monthly players 9 months after launch .
That makes the monthly player base of FarmVille larger than the entire population of France .
There are two fundamental characteristics that make FarmVille a unique scaling challenge : it is the largest game in the world and it is the largest application on a web platform .
Both of these aspects present a unique set of scaling challenges that FarmVille has had to overcome .
In terms of technology investment , FarmVille primarily utilizes open source components and is at its core built off the LAMP stack .
In order to make FarmVille scale as a game , we have to accommodate the workload requirements of a game .
A user 's state contains a large amount of data which has subtle and complex relationships .
For example , in a farm , objects cannot collide with each other , so if a user places a house on their Farm , the backend needs to check that no other object in that user 's farm occupies an overlapping space .
Unlike most major site like Google or Facebook , which are read heavy , FarmVille has an extremely heavy write workload .
The ratio of data reads to writes 3:1 , which is an incredibly high write rate .
A majority of the requests hitting the backend for FarmVille in some way modifies the state of the user playing the game .
To make this scalable , we have worked to make our application interact primarily with cache components .
Additionally , the release of new content and features tends to cause usage spikes since we are effectively extending the game .
The load spikes can be as large as 50 % the day of a new feature 's release .
We have to be able to accommodate this spikey traffic .
The other piece is making FarmVille scale as the largest application on a web platform and is as large as some of the largest websites in the world .
Since the game is run inside of the Facebook platform , we are very sensitive to latency and performance variance of the platform .
As a result , we 've done a lot of work to mitigate that latency variance : we heavily cache Facebook data and gracefully ratchet back usage of the platform when we see performance degrade .
FarmVille has deployed an entire cluster of caching servers for the Facebook platform .
The amount of traffic between FarmVille and the Facebook platform is enormous : at peak , roughly 3 Gigabits / sec of traffic go between FarmVille and Facebook while our caching cluster serves another 1.5 Gigabits / sec to the application .
Additionally , since performance can be variable , the application has the ability to dynamically turn off any calls back to the platform .
We have a dial that we can tweak that turns off incrementally more calls back to the platform .
We have additionally worked to make all calls back to the platform avoid blocking the loading of the application itself .
The idea here is that , if all else fails , players can continue to at least play the game .
For any web application , high latency kills your app and highly variable latency eventually kills your app .
To address the high latency , FarmVille has worked to put a lot of caching in front of high latency components .
Highly variable latency is another challenge as it requires a rethinking of how the application relies on pieces of its architecture which normally have an acceptable latency .
Just about every component is susceptible to this variable latency , some more than others .
Because of FarmVille 's nature , where the workload is very write and transaction heavy , variability in latency has a magnified effect on user experience compared with a traditional web application .
The way FarmVille has handled these scenarios is through thinking about every single component as a degradable service .
Memcache , Database , REST Apis , etc. are all treated as degradable services .
The way in which services degrade are to rate limit errors to that service and to implement service usage throttles .
The key ideas are to isolate troubled and highly latent services from causing latency and performance issues elsewhere through use of error and timeout throttling , and if needed , disable functionality in the application using on / off switches and functionality based throttles .
To help manage and monitor FarmVille 's web farm , we utilize a number of open source monitoring and management tools .
We use nagios for alerting , munin for monitoring , and puppet for configuration .
We heavily utilize internal stats systems to track performance of the services the application uses , such as Facebook , DB , and Memcache .
Additionally , when we see performance degradation , we profile a request 's IO events on a sampled basis .
Lessons Learned
There 's not quite as much detail as I would like about some things , but there are still a number of interesting points that I think people can learn from :
Interactive games are write heavy .
Typical web apps read more than they write so many common architectures may not be sufficient .
Read heavy apps can often get by with a caching layer in front of a single database .
Write heavy apps will need to partition so writes are spread out and / or use an in -memory architecture .
Design every component as a degradable service .
Isolate components so increased latencies in one area wo n't ruin another .
Throttle usage to help alleviate problems .
Turn off features when necessary .
Cache Facebook data .
When you are deeply dependent on an external component consider caching that component 's data to improve latency .

The wanderings of a modern ronin .
I do n't have much to say about this game that has n't been said before .
I love the concept , I love the level design , and in a lot of ways it 's a fantastic game .
I know some people did n't like the anime - style cut scenes , but I had no problem with them .
( I did find the killing of Merc just a bit too predictable .
:P )
And yes , the game is short .
I bet you could easily run through it ( ha ! ) in 5 hours if you were really determined .
Neither of these are real problems , though .
In fact , I 'm not sure I believe either of them could be considered a flaw at all .
That said , Mirror 's Edge does have two big issues .
One is the same one I 've been harping on since I played the demo more than a year ago .
The other is entirely new and does n't emerge fully until you 've played the whole game .
Let me strike at these issues tangentially first , and then I 'll unload the napalm ...
Do you know what the hardest button to press on the 360 controller is ?
It 's LB .
It expertly combines an awkward , wrist - twisting position with the handicap of being on the non-dominant hand .
Also , making that awkward reach to LB tends to screw up the position of your entire left hand , thus throwing off movements of the left stick .
Now what would you say about a game that chose to assign its most - used function - say , JUMP ! - to the most difficult to press button on the controller ?
Furthermore , what would you say about a game that in addition to doing that , also assigned the second - most used function in the game to LT , thus forcing the player to switch back and forth between the two constantly ?
Furthermore furthermore , said game also requires ( yes , REQUIRES ) you to make extremely fast - reaction presses of both of the above buttons , synchronized with fast and highly - precise movements of the left stick ?
A terrible idea , you say ?
Obvious bad design ?
Likely to make the game extremely frustrating and annoying ?
In fact , such a thing would be likely to single - handedly ruin an otherwise great game ?
If that 's what you said , then congratulations !
You 're smarter than every single person on the Mirror 's Edge dev team !!
Exacerbating the horribly designed controls is the fact that the devs were also fucking lazy as shit and did n't allow control customization !
This is another thing I keep screaming about , and nobody ever listens .
Seriously , you incredibly stupid fucks : how long would it have taken you to make a little " press the buttons you want to use for jump , crouch , quick - turn , attack , disarm , and use " thing ?
I have no idea how long you spent coding up all four of the different control schemes available , but however long it took , that was a total waste of time and effort on your part , because ALL OF THEM ARE FUCKING BROKEN !
Do I have to sledgehammer you in the face with this ??
Alrighty then :
The most used function goes on the button that is easiet to press .
In this case JUMP GOES ON A !!
FUCKING DUH !!!!
Even the shittiest , stupidest ,
I could rant about the horrible brokenness of the controls for hours .
In fact , many people have .
Take a look at this image comparing the buttons you have to press in Mirror 's Edge vs. Assassin 's Creed .
From http://www.pixelpoppers.com/2010/01/mirrors-edge-what-went-wrong-and-why.html
You might look at that and say to yourself : " No way does a game actually expect me to do that . " absolutely expects you to do that .
And do it with pretty precise timing , to boot .
Believe it or not , it 's actually not that hard once you get the hang of it .
But how much more fluid and intuitive ( and easier to learn , and less error - prone when performed under stress in the later levels ) would it have been if you could just do A to jump , B to quick - turn , and A to jump again ?
It would be at least ten times easier .
And it would make the game at least twice as much fun .
In fact , I do not believe it would have detracted from the experience of the game one iota .
It would simply have made playing the game more fluid and less frustrating .
For a game that prides itself on runner 's flow being an integral element of the gameplay , the face - smashingly obvious broken nature of the controls ... well , it 's nothing short of unbelievable .
The controls are just god-awful , period .
Just playing the three - minute long demo will show you how obviously , glaringly , insanely horrible they are .
' Nuff said .
The game 's other major flaw is that you play an unarmed and unarmored little girl , and yet the game constantly throws 4 + large , armed opponents at you .
Opponents who are way more than happy to unprovokedly shoot you in the back 27 times as you 're running away from them .
And ask questions later .
This trend goes to its most annoying and insane extreme when you get locked inside a cramped little low - ceiling underground parking garage .
Where you are forced to fight head - on through six guys outfitted in full riot gear and toting machine guns .
( Yes , really ! )
Oh , did I mention that the only way out of said garage is through an elevator that has no cover around it at all ?
And there 's no distracting the riot gear guys either - they wo n't follow you away from the elevator no matter what you try .
Do n't even bother trying to run though , you 'll be cut to ribbons by machine - gun fire in the 3 / 4 of a second it takes you to turn from the call button to the elevator door .
You have no choice but to attempt an unarmed beat - down on six trigger - happy goons with body armor and machine guns !
The words " utter suicide " pretty much sum this situation up . :P
The entire design of this bit is just so obviously to completely fuck over the player , it had me raging by the third time through .
I lost count of how many times I had to try it before I even came close to completing it .
They even went so far as to put unnecessary columns on all the walls , so you can't wall - run / kick anyone for a slightly easier disarm .
The whole section is a stupid exercise in rote pattern memorization .
You can't deviate even the slightest bit from the path and specific moves the designers chose for you to go through here , or you 'll get ten bullets to the chest in an instant .
It 's a total mockery of the supposed " freedom " and " multiple path " ideas that the game is supposed to be founded upon .
Getting through the parking garage was at least three times harder than the real final battle at the end of the game .
They repeat this " locked in with riot police " theme twice more in later bits of the level .
The key difference in both of these repeats ( neither of which was nearly as bad ) is that there 's actual cover around to duck behind , and elevated walkways / tunnels that you can use to get a better angle on your opponents .
But that parking garage level is just horrible .
I can't sum it up any better than that previously posted review did :
[...]
While Faith 's tactics are best suited to dealing with one or two enemies at a time ( as her own allies remind her ) the game has a tendency to throw several enemies at her simultaneously .
And even if she manages to disarm one , the others gun her down while she completes the animation .
Only after beating the game ( and earning Test of Faith ) did I realize something - usually when Faith comes under attack , one or two of the enemies approach her separately from the others who hang back in a group .
The game is giving Faith a gun .
She is supposed to take it in single combat , and then use it to kill the rest of the group - despite the fact that everything else about the game discourages the use of guns .
Philosophically , this is a result of divided vision .
The game encourages quick disarms and combat avoidance - and then forces the player head - on into firefights .
The game disagrees with itself about how it should be played [... ] .
After having played through ME start to finish , I no longer believe their choice of bad control scheme and insanely frustrating combat was accidental .
Not at all .
They knew EXACTLY what they were doing when they chose the worst possible buttons for the most - heavily used jump , crouch and quick - turn functions .
They knew EXACTLY what they were doing when they repeatedly and blatantly forced a small , unarmed girl into a frontal assault against ten riot - gear and machine - gun equipped tanks .
These two glaring flaws in the game both serve one purpose : TO MAKE IT LAST LONGER .
It was Publisher bullshit , pure and simple .
They played a beta build of the game with decent controls and combat scenarios that were n't completely unfairly tilted against Faith , and they said , " Oh man , this is just too easy ... "
So they intentionally fucked up the controls , and doubled the number of enemies in every location .
All in the name of not being a 5 hour game .
Well fuck you , DICE and / or EA .
I see what you did there , and it ruined what otherwise might well have been game of the year .
If there 's anything that the game industry should have learned from Portal , it 's that a game does not need to be 30 hours long to be great .
But you did n't learn , and consequently you fucked up Mirror 's Edge .
Fucked it up so badly that despite loving the concept of this game to death from the very first second I ever heard about it , and in fact loving all the platforming parts of the game to death ...
I 'm going to still very solidly recommend that nobody buy this game .
EVER .
I will personally loan my copy of Mirror 's Edge to anyone who wants to play it .
Please , please , DON'T GIVE MONEY TO FUCKHEADS WHO RUIN GREAT GAMES IN THE NAME OF ARBITRARY LENGTH !
Do n't give money to EA for this game !
Do n't give DICE money for this game !
Play my copy and be done with it .
I 'll personally drive my copy out to you , just so you do n't pay anyone money for this game .
DO NOT support the arrogant , stupid cock - monglers who would ruin what easily could have been my favorite game of all time , with their stupid inability to see the sublime beauty and genius right in front of them .
Edit :
It 's easy to bitch and whine ; a bit harder to make constructive suggestions .
In that spirit , let me suggest two big things that would have gone a long , long way towards making Mirror 's Edge the great game that it easily could have been .
First - A non-braindead control scheme .
Let me emphasize : Setting up the controls in the way I 'm about to suggest is not a substitute for allowing control customization .
If you do n't allow players to pick what button they want for what function , then you 're just a lazy , arrogant moron .
One who is convinced that YOUR control setup is not only the very best one , but also the only possible way that could ever work .
And if that 's what you think , then you 're both wrong AND dumber than a fucking post .
You must allow control customization .
That said , here is how I would set up my controls :
Jump / Up : A
Quick - turn : B
Crouch / Down : X
Attack stays on RT .
It works great there - very visceral and immersion enhancing .
Disarm can stay on Y , or you can move it to RB .
Y is a little faster to hit , but there 's a nice intuitive aspect to having Disarm and Attack on complimentary buttons - you 're not likely to be both attacking someone and disarming them at the exact same time .
( This is why having fire on RT and reload on RB works so well in FPS games . )
Anyway , whichever of RB/Y is used for disarm , the other one would then take over the " slow - mo " function .
This puts the commonly used together " slow - mo " and disarm functions on buttons right near each other .
( I think since RB is harder to hit than Y , I would put slow - mo on RB and Disarm on Y .
You tend to hit slow - mo well in advance , so having it on a more difficult to hit button is n't as big a deal .
And highly time sensitive on - the - fly disarms will be easier with Y. )
This control scheme would have worked a million times better in so many ways .
Let me give you just a few examples :
Common action : Run and jump
Old way : LS , LB
New way : LS , A
As I noted before , using LB for anything is a horrible choice for multiple reasons .
First , it 's the hardest button on the controller to reach , and it's on the non -dominant hand .
Thus leading to slow , imprecise button presses .
Second , reaching for it tends to screw with your left stick control because of the way you have to twist your hand around .
Contrast this with the new way .
Where your smarter hand gets to quickly and precisely hit the easiest button on the controller , without interfering at all with your left stick motions .
Also , notice that doing a roll - landing is just a matter of hitting X as you 're about to land .
A lot easier and more precise on a short - travel button using your dominant hand , than having to quickly move your non-dominant hand from the previous awkward LB down to LT , and then having to precisely hit a long - travel trigger .
Common combo : Wall - run , Quick - turn , Jump
Old way : LS , LB , RB , LB
New way : LS , A , B - A
Notice that the old way not only ( again ) commits the sin of using LS and LB at the same time , but also forces you to awkwardly move your right hand up to RB , thus screwing up your whole grip on the controller .
The new way , by contrast , is easy to learn and will quickly become intuitive .
Also notice again how easy it is to tack on a X while still holding down the final A , to tuck your legs while in the air .
This allows you to make jumps over barbed - wire fences or reach places you can't quite get to with your legs dangling .
The same holds true with tacking on a second turn - jump maneuver after the wall - jump .
You just do B - A again - so easy !
Making these moves fluid and intuitive would have been a massive enabler of the whole " freedom of movement " / " choose your own path " thing the developers were so jazzed up about .
It would have encouraged experimentation , even playing around .
As opposed to the old way , which encourages you take the most conservative , slowest , fewest button presses , most boring path .
Common combo : Crouching Attack / Jump kick
Old way : LS , LB / LT , RT
New way : LS , A / X , RT
Once again the horrible combination of LS and LB rears its ugly head .
It 's particularly bad in this case , because this is a move you 're going to be doing in the heat of combat , where your life is on the line and you 're nervous , and precise control of LS to dodge multiple streams of incoming gunfire is absolutely crucial .
The new way is much easier and harder to screw up .
Point - jump - kick .
Point - roll - kick .
The sequence A , RT is quick , intuitive and extremely fluid .
X , RT is a little harder , but it 's still easier than moving your hand from LB down to LT , while you 're also simultaneously trying to hit RT .
I could go on for pages here , but I think you get the idea .
Putting jump on LB was the worst possible choice they could have made - and I think they knew it .
Bad controls can ( and regularly do ) ruin otherwise good games .
In this case , the worst possible choice of button did , in fact , ruin an exceptional game .
Finally : Provide an explicit on - screen momentum meter .
This would help the player learn which moves build momentum ( like the counter - intuitive fact that vaulting over an obstacle builds momentum ) , and would also give them a better idea if they have enough momentum to make that long jump ahead .
This might break immersion a little , but no more so than being frustrated as hell because you do n't understand why you made that jump last time , but this time ( when you ca n't tell that you did anything different ) you failed it and fell to your death .
This meter could go away in hard mode , so those who did n't want the hint would n't have to use it .
Second - Fixing combat .
For a game that 's supposed to encourage stealth , evasion and acrobatic attacks , ME pretty much failed in every way to make a correct enemy AI for this style of play .
First of all , every enemy in the game is a trigger - happy psychopath who seems to get off on shooting people in the back .
These guys are so bloodthirsty they do n't even bother drawing their guns ; they keep their gun in - hand constantly so as to be able to pump you full of lead as quickly as humanly possible .
This pretty much puts the kibosh on any kind of fancy acrobatic attacks .
They 'll kill you in the air as you 're halfway through a jump - kick - in fact , they frequently do exactly that .
:P
Secondly , they 're psychic .
They seem to know exactly where you are at all times , even when you get the drop on them , sneak up behind , or are beyond a wall .
This is particularly unrealistic with the SWAT guys wearing full body armor , who have helmets that screw with their ability to look up , and presumably the body armor messes with their ability to turn their torso .
This pretty much kills any attempts at stealth stone dead .
Thirdly , there are too many enemies and they refuse to break up their groups .
This leads to your only choice being utterly suicidal frontal assaults .
You can run right past a guy with a machine gun , even punch him along the way , and he still wo n't chase you .
There 's no surprising people from around corners , or drawing enemies away from a location .
It makes evasive tactics ( Faith 's strongest weapon ) completely useless .
The fix for these problems could be to make enemies less bloodthirsty ( more prone to run up and attempt a melee attack ) , or by giving them more weaponry options ( batons / tasers / beanbag rounds for shotguns ) instead of just opening fire with their pistol or machinegun on sight .
This would give Faith a chance to execute acrobatic attacks on them , instead of being constantly cut down in a hail of machine gun fire in mid-disarm .
Making enemies less psychic and / or more prone to chase would give Faith a better chance to pull off stealth attacks and / or evade .
All of these traits could scale by difficulty level , so those who liked it insanely hard could still have enemies who are bloodthirsty , psychic , and refuse to move an inch from where they 're standing ( thus forcing a frontal assault ) .
You could even do something where the game remembers from level to level how pacifistic you 've been , and enemies become increasingly reluctant to use lethal force on you if you 've consistently refused to use guns .
Speaking of scaling with difficulty level , how about scaling the number of opponents with difficulty level ?
The very first time you encounter enemies in the game , there are FOUR of them .
Just to catch a little girl , in a stairwell !
( And , at the risk of repeating myself , these four empty their guns at you within 3 / 4 of a second after spotting you - while you 're running away from them ! )
I really do n't think there needed to be four guys there .
I 'm not even sure there needed to be three .
I realize the game is trying to teach you to run away , but even so , it 's just flagrantly excessive .
Two trigger - happy lunatics would have been plenty to get me running like fuck .
Three is plenty on Normal .
On Hard , I could see four or even five .
But not on Normal difficulty .
When we talk about combat , another nice side - effect of an explicit momentum meter surfaces .
Your momentum determines how much slow - mo time you have for disarms .
If you could know that before making an attack on an enemy , you 'd have a much better chance of successfully executing a disarm .
This would be far more true to the spirit of the game than the way it is now .
Where you end up running at a guy in full riot gear head - on , with no idea if you have any slow - mo at all .
Again , the meter goes away in Hard mode , so those who like the uncertainty and challenge can still have it .
Lastly : Never design a level in such a way as to entirely deprive Faith of her acrobatic attacks .
Yes , I 'm talking about those walls with a column on them every four feet in the underground parking garage , preventing you from executing a wall - kick and easier disarm .
The only place in that section to execute a wall - kick is off the side of the truck ... which was conveniently parked right next to three swat guys with machine guns , so you 'd only get one step along the side of the truck before getting swiss - cheesed by three streams of machine - gun fire .
P.S. That fucking helicopter carrying three guys with machine guns has NO FUCKING BUSINESS being in the first few levels .
Save that shit for the last few outside levels .
Or if you 're gonna put it in the early levels , at least restrict it to Hard mode .
I do n't have much to say about this game that has n't been said before .
I love the concept , I love the level design , and in a lot of ways it 's a fantastic game .
I know some people did n't like the anime - style cut scenes , but I had no problem with them .
( I did find the killing of Merc just a bit too predictable .
:P )
And yes , the game is short .
I bet you could easily run through it ( ha ! ) in 5 hours if you were really determined .
Neither of these are real problems , though .
In fact , I 'm not sure I believe either of them could be considered a flaw at all .
That said , Mirror 's Edge does have two big issues .
One is the same one I 've been harping on since I played the demo more than a year ago .

Making these moves fluid and intuitive would have been a massive enabler of the whole " freedom of movement " / " choose your own path " thing the developers were so jazzed up about .
It would have encouraged experimentation , even playing around .
As opposed to the old way , which encourages you take the most conservative , slowest , fewest button presses , most boring path .
Common combo : Crouching Attack / Jump kickOld way : LS , LB / LT , RTNew way : LS , A / X , RTOnce again the horrible combination of LS and LB rears its ugly head .
It 's particularly bad in this case , because this is a move you 're going to be doing in the heat of combat , where your life is on the line and you 're nervous , and precise control of LS to dodge multiple streams of incoming gunfire is absolutely crucial .
The new way is much easier and harder to screw up .
Point - jump - kick .
Point - roll - kick .
The sequence A , RT is quick , intuitive and extremely fluid .
X , RT is a little harder , but it 's still easier than moving your hand from LB down to LT , while you 're also simultaneously trying to hit RT .
I could go on for pages here , but I think you get the idea .
Putting jump on LB was the worst possible choice they could have made - and I think they knew it .
Bad controls can ( and regularly do ) ruin otherwise good games .
In this case , the worst possible choice of button did , in fact , ruin an exceptional game .
Finally : Provide an explicit on - screen momentum meter .
This would help the player learn which moves build momentum ( like the counter - intuitive fact that vaulting over an obstacle builds momentum ) , and would also give them a better idea if they have enough momentum to make that long jump ahead .
This might break immersion a little , but no more so than being frustrated as hell because you do n't understand why you made that jump last time , but this time ( when you ca n't tell that you did anything different ) you failed it and fell to your death .
This meter could go away in hard mode , so those who did n't want the hint would n't have to use it .
Fixing combat .
For a game that 's supposed to encourage stealth , evasion and acrobatic attacks , ME pretty much failed in every way to make a correct enemy AI for this style of play .
First of all , every enemy in the game is a trigger - happy psychopath who seems to get off on shooting people in the back .
These guys are so bloodthirsty they do n't even bother drawing their guns ; they keep their gun in - hand constantly so as to be able to pump you full of lead as quickly as humanly possible .
This pretty much puts the kibosh on any kind of fancy acrobatic attacks .
They 'll kill you in the air as you 're halfway through a jump - kick - in fact , they frequently do exactly that .
: PSecondly , they 're psychic .
They seem to know exactly where you are at all times , even when you get the drop on them , sneak up behind , or are beyond a wall .
This is particularly unrealistic with the SWAT guys wearing full body armor , who have helmets that screw with their ability to look up , and presumably the body armor messes with their ability to turn their torso .
This pretty much kills any attempts at stealth stone dead .
Thirdly , there are too many enemies and they refuse to break up their groups .
This leads to your only choice being utterly suicidal frontal assaults .
You can run right past a guy with a machine gun , even punch him along the way , and he still wo n't chase you .
There 's no surprising people from around corners , or drawing enemies away from a location .
It makes evasive tactics ( Faith 's strongest weapon ) completely useless .
The fix for these problems could be to make enemies less bloodthirsty ( more prone to run up and attempt a melee attack ) , or by giving them more weaponry options ( batons / tasers / beanbag rounds for shotguns ) instead of just opening fire with their pistol or machinegun on sight .
This would give Faith a chance to execute acrobatic attacks on them , instead of being constantly cut down in a hail of machine gun fire in mid-disarm .
Making enemies less psychic and / or more prone to chase would give Faith a better chance to pull off stealth attacks and / or evade .
All of these traits could scale by difficulty level , so those who liked it insanely hard could still have enemies who are bloodthirsty , psychic , and refuse to move an inch from where they 're standing ( thus forcing a frontal assault ) .
You could even do something where the game remembers from level to level how pacifistic you 've been , and enemies become increasingly reluctant to use lethal force on you if you 've consistently refused to use guns .
Speaking of scaling with difficulty level , how about scaling the number of opponents with difficulty level ?
Theyou encounter enemies in the game , there are FOUR of them .
Just to catch a little girl , in a stairwell !
( And , at the risk of repeating myself , these four empty their guns at you within 3 / 4 of a second after spotting you - while you 're running away from them ! )
I really do n't think there needed to be four guys there .
I 'm not even sure there needed to be three .
I realize the game is trying to teach you to run away , but even so , it 's just flagrantly excessive .
trigger - happy lunatics would have been plenty to get me running like fuck .
Three is plenty on Normal .
On Hard , I could see four or even five .
But not on Normal difficulty .
When we talk about combat , another nice side - effect of an explicit momentum meter surfaces .
Your momentum determines how much slow - mo time you have for disarms .
If you could know thatmaking an attack on an enemy , you 'd have a much better chance of successfully executing a disarm .
This would be far more true to the spirit of the game than the way it is now .
Where you end up running at a guy in full riot gear head - on , with no idea if you have any slow - mo at all .
Again , the meter goes away in Hard mode , so those who like the uncertainty and challenge can still have it .
Lastly : design a level in such a way as to entirely deprive Faith of her acrobatic attacks .
Yes , I 'm talking about those walls with a column on them every four feet in the underground parking garage , preventing you from executing a wall - kick and easier disarm .
The only place in that section to execute a wall - kick is off the side of the truck ... which was conveniently parked right next to three swat guys with machine guns , so you 'd only get one step along the side of the truck before getting swiss - cheesed by three streams of machine - gun fire .
P.S. That fucking helicopter carrying three guys with machine guns has NO FUCKING BUSINESS being in the first few levels .
Save that shit for the last few outside levels .
Or if you 're gonna put it in the early levels , at least restrict it to Hard mode .

review you referenced ( http://www.pixelpoppers.com/2010/01/mirrors-edge-what-went-wrong-and-why.html).
First , thanks for reading and linking to my review .
I 'm glad you enjoyed it . :)
Second , just want to clear something up - that comic ( http://www.virtualshackles.com/64) that I posted originally came from Virtual Shackles ( http://www.virtualshackles.com/), not me .
Finally , something you might find interesting given how big an issue the control scheme and lack of customization is for you .
They discussed in the Afterthoughts interview ( http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3172300) why they made that choice - and they claim it's for a reason completely unrelated to playtime inflation . :)
1UP : Speaking of which , how come you did n't give players the option to customize their controls ?
This seems odd , especially in a game that depends so much on mastering the controls .
[ Producer Tom Farrer ] :
We made the decision to limit the control customization options for the very reason that it was important to master them .
We found that many players instinctively wanted to move the " up " button to A [ on 360 , or ] X on PS3 , since that is where they are used to having " jump " in first - person games .
We had removed all movement controls from the face buttons because having them there actually lessens the degree of control available to the player .
If you have to take your thumb off the right analog to jump , you immediately lose a lot of control and make the game more difficult for yourself .
So for this reason we wanted the movement controls to stay on the shoulder buttons .
We actually used a similar control scheme for Battlefield 2 : Modern Combat on the PS2 .
After some initial complaints , players started to realize the benefits there .
Whether you agree with their reasoning or not , I found it interesting to at least know their justification .
Thanks again , and happy gaming !

This still does n't answer why they would put jump on the left .
Most of us are right - handed , and I utterly fail to see any good reason to put the most used function in the game on the non-dominant hand .
In addition , doing that works against their goal of better control because , as I explained , the reach up to the bumper screws with your control of the left stick .
Bottom line , they 're just plain wrong here .
They had a reasonable idea , but their implementation was just thoroughly broken as shit .
And then they compounded the broken by not allowing control customization .
These guys did n't learn from history .

Here 's something that will make the controls instantly make sense :
The lead platform was PS3 .
That does n't excuse having broken controls on the follow platform , but once you realize all the devs were working on PS3's when they designed the control scheme , with the big fat L1 / L2/R1/R2 buttons , working with sixaxis controllers where L1/L2 are the logical resting points of the hands and L2 / R2 get triggered every time a cat sneezes , it all makes so much more sense .
Agreed re : the combat situation , that was just some bad design .
I was playing to get the " no guns " trophy , and did n't get it .
I 'm not sure if it 's because I accidentally kicked a cop off a ledge in one scene , or because I could n't finish another without shooting out a window , but either way somewhere in there I lost my no -guns mojo .
I was controller - throwingly pissed when that happens , because I beat that parking garage bit without picking up a gun .
AHGUAHUGHAUGHARUHGAUHGAUHGUAHGUAHGUAHGUH
AGH .
Interestingly , the DLC is all jump puzzles , and it 's just marvelous .
Much more fun than the regular game .

I should really try it on a PS3 .
I bet it is much better there , purely due to the controller shape .

I do n't know what you were doing wrong but Mirror 's Edge was one of the easiest ( and best , beside the point ) games I 've ever played , if you could n't manage to move your tiny brain to press a button that was put there by the Microsoft , not dice , then I say you should go back to preschool =\ Reply | Thread | Link
Spot on .
Why did they give stealth training in the tutorials ?
You literally can not perform one stealth kill in the game and you 're right , the enemines know exactly where you are , even in airvents !!!!!!

The luck of the Irish was not with the city of New Haven this weekend , whose annual St. Patrick ’s Day Parade took place on Sunday .
Yet not even one of the most devastating storms in Connecticut ’s recent history could keep parade - goers from taking to the streets to show their Irish pride .
The greater New Haven St. Patrick ’s Day Parade was scheduled to go on , rain or shine , according to the parade ’s Web site .
First started in 1842 , the parade is the largest St. Patrick ’s Day Parade between New York and Boston , and is the sixth - oldest parade in the country .
The parade is also recognized as a “ Local Legacy ” by the Library of Congress , according to Walter Nester , parade chairman for the 2010 event .
[ poll id = ” 19 ″ ]
“ The parade attracts on average 250,000 to 300,000 spectators annually to the streets of New Haven making it the largest single day event in the state , ” said Nester .
“… More than 3,000 marchers come from as far away as Ireland to participate , ” he said .
“ The parade itself represents the culmination of a year long , totally volunteer effort . ”
The parade , which was preceded by a Mass at St. Mary ’s Church on Hillhouse Avenue , followed its traditional route , starting on the corner of Chapel Street and Sherman Avenue , and ending on Orange Street .
However , festivities were not limited to the streets : Irish establishments such as Sullivan ’s Playwright , Lansdowne , Anna Lifffey ’s and Anchor Bar were all packed throughout the parade .
“ Anna Liffey ’s was a blast , ” said Connecticut resident Daniel Berg - Johnsen , 22 , who dressed head to toe in green for the occasion .
“ I was Irish jig dancing while a guy was playing the bagpipes and another playing the snare with a circle of like , 30 people around me ! ”
Chapel Street also hosts a number of other bars , who benefitted from the thousands of spectators in search of a good Irish beer .
“ The drink prices and covers were outrageous , ” said Berg - Johnsen .
“ But the weather was awful … most people just wanted to stay off the streets . ”
As the saying goes , when Irish eyes are smiling , they ’re probably up to no good .
Along with its rich history and legacy , the New Haven St. Patrick ’s Day Parade has also been traditionally known as the only day where people can bring their own alcoholic beverages and drink publicly in New Haven .
In recent years , spectators have taken advantage of police “ looking the other way ” to people drinking illegally from open containers in the streets , according to an article on wfsb.com .
This year , the police presence was strong , with an additional 50 officers ready to ticket anyone caught publicly drinking .
“ It ’s getting to the point where it has gotten out of control , ” said New Haven Assistant Police Chief Ken Gillespie in the wfsb.com article .
“ It ’s not people having a beer , it ’s people coming out staggering drunk and causing problems . ”
However , some parade - goers feel that drinking at the St. Patrick ’s Day should be expected and even tolerated .
“ It ’s all part of the experience , ” said Connecticut resident Briana Ready , 21 .
“ I attend the parade every year , and this year I can finally drink … legally .
You can bet I ’m going to celebrate with more than a few beers .
I did n’t brave this weather for nothing , ” she said .
“ Unfortunately drinking is associated with the parade .
However , we do not allow drinking in the parade by marchers …
The decision to enforce the open container law is a Police Department initiative this year which we , the parade organizers totally endorse , ” said Nester .
A press release on the New Haven Police Department ’s website quotes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , whose statistics “ show that over the past five years , 851 people lost their lives in motor vehicles crashes during the St. Patrick ’s Day holiday .
Out of that number , 327 were killed in crashes that involved a drunk driver or motorcycle rider ( operator ) with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or higher . ”
The New Haven Police Department has not yet released statistics on the number of arrests made at this year ’s parade .
Palin : Anti-HCR Violence Stories Are ‘ Ginned Up ’
Created : March 26 , 2010 16:27 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
At a rally for Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , Sarah Palin — who I do think has been unfairly attacked as a source of “ violent ” backlash against health care — dismissed outright the idea that opponents of reform were reacting violently .
Palin called it a “ ginned - up controversy about us common - sense conservatives kinda inciting violence , ” inspiring someone in the crowd to yell that activists would oppose the bill “ with our votes ! ”
“ That ’s right ! ” said Palin .
“ When we take up our arms we ’re talking about our vote . ”
McCain , who made multiple promises to “ repeal ” the health care bill — “ we ’ll fight it in the courts , we ’ll fight it in the streets ” — called the uprising against health care a “ peaceful revolution . ”
In an interview , Rear Adm .
Gregory Smith , the top military spokesman in Afghanistan , said that the United States military was currently employing nine International Media Ventures civilian employees on routine jobs in administration , information processing and analysis .
Whatever else other International Media employees might be doing in Afghanistan , he said , he did not know and had no responsibility for their actions .
By Mr. Pelton ’s account , Mr. Furlong , in conversations with him and his colleagues , referred to his stable of contractors as “ my Jason Bournes , ” a reference to the fictional American assassin created by the novelist Robert Ludlum and played in movies by Matt Damon .
Military officials said that Mr. Furlong would occasionally brag to his superiors about having Mr. Clarridge ’s services at his disposal .
Last summer , Mr. Furlong told colleagues that he was working with Mr. Clarridge to secure the release of Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl , a kidnapped soldier who American officials believe is being held by militants in Pakistan .
From December 2008 to mid-June 2009 , both Mr. Taylor and Mr. Clarridge were hired to assist The New York Times in the case of David Rohde , the Times reporter who was kidnapped by militants in Afghanistan and held for seven months in Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
The reporter ultimately escaped on his own .
The idea for the government information program was thought up sometime in 2008 by Mr. Jordan , a former CNN news chief , and his partner Mr. Pelton , whose books include “ The World ’s Most Dangerous Places ” and “ Licensed to Kill : Hired Guns in the War on Terror . ”
Top General Approached
They approached Gen. David D. McKiernan , soon to become the top American commander in Afghanistan .
Their proposal was to set up a reporting and research network in Afghanistan and Pakistan for the American military and private clients who were trying to understand a complex region that had become vital to Western interests .
They already had a similar operation in Iraq — called “ Iraq Slogger , ” which employed local Iraqis to report and write news stories for their Web site .
Mr. Jordan proposed setting up a similar Web site in Afghanistan and Pakistan — except that the operation would be largely financed by the American military .
The name of the Web site was Afpax .
Mr. Jordan said that he had gone to the United States military because the business in Iraq was not profitable relying solely on private clients .
He described his proposal as essentially a news gathering operation , involving only unclassified materials gathered openly by his employees .
“ It was all open - source , ” he said .
I was at Best Buy one day and I noticed a bunch of games on sale but one game stood out the most ( maybe because it was the only one worth getting ) and it was WrestleMania X8 .
I picked it up and went home and was expecting a below average game but boy was I wrong .
After playing with it for about 5 hours I decided to read some reviews on the internet and try to understand why this game did n’t get good scores .
Well after reading a couple I realized that many were comparing this game to No Mercy when they really should have been comparing it to Smackdown .
THQ even announced that they would not be working with AKI and still people were expecting a No Mercy sequel when they knew they were going to get more of a Smackdown type game .
No offense to my co-worker Ron Teeter but in my opinion his review did not do this game justice and I ’m writing this review to set things straight .
Presentation
The game starts off with some highlights of Wrestlemania X8 and is really nice to watch but the background music is so borrrriiinnnngggg .
Well I thought things would get better but not only did the opening music suck but so does the menu screen music .
It kind of reminded me of Gameboy music .
Well anyways the Menu layout is fairly simple , just pick what type of match you want and how many players are going to play yada - yada - yada .
Overall really user friendly .
Graphics
When I played Smackdown on PS2 I was n’t that impressed at all with the character models .
For some strange reason they always looked like poster cut-outs and cartoony .
I was really hoping Yukes would make the graphics appeal to me in WMX8 and boy did they .
The character models now look “ realer ” and smooth and sometimes even show how well they designed their muscles .
The character models are beautifully done .
The arenas on the other hand are just plain AMAZING .
The detail they put into the arenas really surprised me .
The lighting effects in the game are used really well to give the arenas that special touch as well .
Let me get one thing straight though , these arenas and character models still do n’t compare to those in Raw , but really come close .
REALLY CLOSE .
Sound
The entrance music as we all know is a big part of the experience and just gives you the atmosphere and Yukes did a wonderful job with the quality of the music they inserted in their game .
On the downside though there still is no commentary , which at that point was inexcusable .
Even if it was bad , they still should have put it in with an option to turn it off .
I just simply cannot forgive Yukes for that .
Another downside is the in - game music .
Yes just like in the Smackdown series Yukes has yet again put in some techno beat and it just does n’t flow with the game .
ANOTHER downside is that Yukes DID NOT get licenses to all the superstars theme songs .
So far I noticed Booker T , Tazz , NWO do not have their original songs .
On the bright side though ( finally a good thing ) they did substitute them very well .
The hits also sound real
Gameplay
I want to get things straight with you right now .
I did enjoy the AKI games but always thought Yukes series was better .
Maybe it was the speed of their games or how many more options their games had ….. I do n’t know .
Well to say the least the gameplay in WMX8 is superior to that of Smackdown in many ways .
First off , in my opinion , the controls are very simple .
A is to grapple , B is to punch , Y is to go against the ropes and both L and R are used to reverse your opponents moves .
I really do n’t see what ’s so awkward about the controls .
They seem basic but play beautifully so what ’s the problem I have no idea .
What ’s also great about the title is that it keeps things running at 60 fps no matter what you ’re doing .
So no more annoying slowdowns like in No Mercy .
The game is also somewhat quick like Smackdown which is great because you want things to run fast in this type of game .
On the downside though the game is glitchy but not glitchy as in your arm goes through your opponents , because that will hardly ever happen , but glitchy as in you kick out of the pin but the referee still counts .
This can get annoying at times but I noticed it rarely happens .
While it will cost you the WWE belt sometimes it ’s not nearly as annoying as the A.I .
It just seems the computer reverses your moves WAY to much even when their spirit is down ( Yes there is a spirit meter now that indicates if your doing really good in the game or really bad . )
What ’s the most annoying part is that even after you hit your finisher and decide to hit them with a weapon just for good measure they get right back up as if you had never hit your finisher to begin with .
While the A.I has its downsides , it does n’t mean you ca n’t win and the game is still very , very playable and enjoyable .
One of my biggest dislikes about this game is that it features absolutely no story mode .
This is a major blow but then again the way Yukes incorporates their stories in their games suck ( ie : Smackdown 3 ) but still either way they should have thrown one in there just to satisfy the hardcore fans .
One really has to hope though that Yukes corrects this in the next installment of this franchise .
Features
This game like the wrestling games before it ( except Royal Rumble on the DC and RAW on the Xbox ) has loads of match types and options .
Here ’s a run down
Path of a Champion - Just pick the belt your aiming for and select your superstar and your ready to become the next big thing
Create a Superstar ( CAW ) -
In my opinion this is not the best CAW but not the worst .
It just gives you the basics but I was really hoping they would have gone a little deeper with such an important option .
Battle For The Belts - Select a custom belt and get ready to rumble for it ( Note : this option requires 2 players )
Tag - Your basic tag match pitting you and a buddy against 2 computers
Handicap - Do n’t feel you can take down
The Rock by yourself well grab a partner and then you can both whoop him WWE style
Fatal 4 - Way - Square off against 3 opponents and who ever gets the first pin wins the match
Battle Royal - Eliminate one opponent at a time to emerge victorious
Royal Rumble - Your basic Royal Rumble with the option of setting how many will participate and if they come at random but unlike the Smackdown Royal Rumbles , once your out your out for good .
Match Types
Normal Match - Just you against a buddy or the computer
Hardcore Match - Surround yourself in weapons and use them at all cost in order to win your match

After you ’ve gotten all the belts there is n’t really anything to unlock except a few characters and arenas but that ’s it .
But the multi-player is what keeps this game alive it ’s just really fun and probably the best in a wrestling game .

Inquiring minds are listening to President Obama proclaim Health Care Premiums Will Decrease 3000 % .
Basic Math
While prices of goods and services can rise an infinite amount , the most prices fall is 100 % , to zero .
Of course bids on a piece of property could turn negative if a toxic waste dump was found on a site .
However , Obama is discussing HealthCare , not liabilities associated with toxic waste cleanup .
Assume , you pay $ 5,000 a year for health insurance .
To see a 3000 % drop , your healthcare provider would have to pay you $ 145,000 to take the insurance .
This is not FantasyLand , the Twilight Zone , or Bizarro World where health care has a negative cost and providers pay you to take coverage .

Es cierto que nuestra democracia está llena de trampas toleradas : se rebasan los topes de los gastos de campaña , se usan recursos públicos , hay dinero del narcotráfico y en la mayoría de los estados los medios de comunicación son parciales y hacen coberturas inequitativas .
También es cierto que nuestra clase política deja mucho que desear y que a nadie en su sano juicio le gustaría ver reelecto al gobernador de Puebla , ni al de Oaxaca , ni a cientos de presidentes municipales y a un buen porcentaje de los actuales legisladores .
Dicho todo lo anterior , la actual clase política mexicana , esa que no le gusta a nadie y que sale reprobada en todas las encuestas , es justamente producto de las reglas que nos rigen actualmente , entre ellas la de la no reelección .
Nuestra democracia nos parece muy deficiente , nuestra clase política un desastre , pero Carlos Loret de Mola y la gran mayoría de nuestros lectores prefieren básicamente no moverle para que no acabemos peor .
Consciente de que me encuentro en franca minoría respecto a este tema , quiero insistir .
Tenemos sobradas pruebas de que la no reelección ha producido un sistema de incentivos perversos .
Por eso hoy Peña Nieto y dos o tres gobernadores más tienen controlada a una gran parte de la bancada del PRI en el Congreso federal , algunos les deben directamente sus candidaturas y otros apuestan a que son presidenciables y buscan a través de la lealtad hacia ellos mantenerse tres años más en la política .
El sistema de incentivos derivado de la no reelección produce diputados dependientes , obedientes y flojos .
Carne de cañón para cualquier componenda y arreglo ajeno al interés de los ciudadanos .
¿ Para qué leer o estudiar una iniciativa si el sentido del voto lo decidirá uno de los líderes ?
¿ Denunciar un exceso en el gasto , una redacción con dedicatoria ?
¿ Porqué lo harían si lo más probable es que hoy les cueste la carrera ?
Por eso es urgente cambiar las reglas para que la iniciativa , el compromiso con causas , el voto consciente , la preocupación por el electorado , el cuidado de la imagen pública , el respeto por la legalidad y las instituciones sean factores que pesen en el comportamiento de los legisladores .
Y sí , también hay que limpiar la realidad electoral — como pide Carlos — mejorar la fiscalización de los partidos políticos , exigir al IFE que sea un árbitro real , que el Tribunal Electoral deje de hacerse de la vista gorda .
Pero para que los legisladores le quieran entrar a esos temas , tenemos que lograr primero que sus prioridades coincidan con los de la ciudadanía .
Lo cual está lejos de ser el caso hoy en día .
Globalization in Pakistan The Football Stitchers of Sialkot
The city of Sialkot in Pakistan produces as many as 60 million hand - stitched footballs in a World Cup year .
The firms here are running out of new workers since child labor was abolished .
Western buyers may have a clear conscience , but the children of Sialkot now toil in the local brickworks instead .
A fully anti-optimized TNWMLC layout is a joke and a nightmare to type .
It 's also the only keyboard layout that has its own fashion line .
carpalx — design your own keyboard
Save your carpals and reach typing guru status with your own keyboard layout , such as the fully optimized QGMLWB layout .
Alternatively , use your power for evil and create a carpal - breaking TNWMLC layout to embarass office prima donnas and punish sluggish workers .
And TNWMLC is the only layout with its own line of Brazilian clothing .
Purpose of Carpalx
The carpalx project introduces a quantitative model for typing effort and applies it to ( a ) evaluate QWERTY and popular alternatives , such as Dvorak and Colemak and ( b ) find the keyboard layouts that minimize typing effort for a given set of input documents .
In the work presented here , these documents are English text , but they can be anything , such as corpora in French , Spanish and even programming languages , like C or Python .
While there are many alternate layouts , the Carpalx project proposes new layouts and a fully - baked parametric model of typing effort .
Way !
Carpalx in Brazilian Fashion
In a collaboration that brings keyboard layout design and fashion together — what a combination !
— Brazilian designer Julia Valle used the carpalx worst layout ( TNWMLC ) as a design element in her Winter 2011 line .
The work was shown in a show in Rio de Janeiro .
Julia accented the clothes with beautiful necklaces made out of parts of an 1956 Smith Corona typewriter .
This project is nearly cosmic in alignment of eclectic interests .
Keyboard layout research is subverted to generate the most difficult English layout , which is then transformed into beautiful clothing design .
This cross-pollination of ideas has particular meaning to me , since I once dabbled in fashion photography .
QWERTY — you 're fired
Try typing " stewardesses " .
Tough , eh ?
Type the word several times and your left hand will need a break .
Now type " chrząszcz " ( Polish for " beetle " ) .
Nearly impossible , eh ?
Type the word once and you 've had enough .
The problem is n't you — it 's your keyboard layout .
Well , maybe it's you but solving that falls outside my mandate .
Figure 1 .
The ubiquitous QWERTY keyboard layout .
Chances are good that your keyboard layout is based on this arrangement of keys .
If your language is n't English , your layout may differ significantly from QWERTY .
The QWERTY layout is a boon and a bane .
It is a boon because it 's everywhere and , if you learn to type on it , your skill is portable .
It 's a bane because its design makes typing more difficult than it should be .
It 's also the subject of an urban legend , which states that the origin of QWERTY can be traced to the mechanical design of typewriters .
The layout was chosen to slow typists down and reduce jamming .
I myself am guilty of subscribing to this myth until Andrew Dennison pointed me to a Smithsonian Magazine article The Legend of the QWERTY Keyboard , which tells the full and real history of the layout .
Hint : it 's not the typewriter that influenced the layout but the way in which it was used .
Of course , the limitation with any layout is that it excels for only one kind of text ( e.g. English ) .
If you spend your time typing two or more different languages and maintain the same layout , one of the languages will be more difficult to type .
If you are writing computer code , it 's likely that the code is significantly different ( in terms of character frequency and combination ) than your spoken language .
Although interpreted languages like Ruby help reduce the noise found in other languages like Perl ( I like both ! ) , it 's still likely that frequently used characters in programming ( e.g. = + -) continue to be relegated to the backwaters of the keyboard .
In these pages , I will explore other layouts and indicate their strengths and weaknesses .
I will also propose a few new layouts that were derived computationally using the carpalx typing effort model .
History of Carpalx
Redesigning a keyboard layout is n't as simple as 1 - 2 - 3 .
Or in this case , x - y - z where x , y , z are ordered to minimize typing effort !
The real difficulty in layout design lies in defining how to measure typing effort .
In other words , given a set of constraints it is easy to find a layout that minimizes them — it 's defining the constraints that is hard !
I originally started working on Carpalx to determine whether I could recreate the Dvorak layout by developing a model of typing effort .
My initial ( and naive ) hope was to create a parametric model that , when tweaked just so , would create Dvorak .
In other words , I wanted to know what set of variables were minimized in the Dvorak layout .
When I ran the optimization for my initial model design , I quickly obtained keyboard layouts that had a much lower effort than Dvorak — in other words , I improved on Dvorak ( according to my model ) immediately .
Furthermore , it quickly became clear that hunting for a model that would generate Dvorak was a hopeless task , because the number of models , unlike the number of layouts , is uncountably infinite .
I adjusted my goal , therefore , from hunting for a model to creating a justifiable typing effort model and using it to hunt for the best layout .
Could I find a layout that improved on the much - lauded Colemak ?
Carpalx is a Perl script which reads in model parameters and performs a stochastic simulation to find a layout that minimizes the effort score for a given set of model parameters .
Statistics vs Human Factors
The statistics that Carpalx uses attempt to capture the essential human factors of typing .
Fundamental considerations like finger travel distance and symmetric hand use can easily be agreed upon .
More nuanced ones , like finger rolling and curling vs extending are harder to pin down — but extremely important .
It 's realtively easy to improve on QWERTY .
It 's much harder to refine a layout that already achieves all the fundamental improvements .
already good layout .
The Workman layout incorporates advanced human factors and discusses their application to Dvorak and Colemak .
In recent conversation with Stephen O'Connor ( Sep 2011 ) , who has analyzed the Workman layout , I 've been persuaded to seriously reconsider the parameters in my effort model .
In particular , the model does not consider the possibility that the index , middle and ring fingers have different prefered motions , for a given travel distance .
For example , most will agree that the ring finger prefers to extend for the W rather than curl to the equidistant X .
On the other hand , the index finger has easier access to V than R .

Methods Behind Carpalx
I used existing keyboard layouts such as QWERTY , Dvorak , Colemak , Arensito and others , to help generate a model of typing effort .
By evaluating these layouts using candidate models , I could determine whether the models were .
For example , it 's widely known that Colemak is easier to type on than QWERTY and I made it a requirement that any model would corroborate this ( obviously ) .
Moreover , I built into the model certain layout characteristics that were universally seen as advantageous .
While some layout characteristics remain disputed ( e.g. how frequently should the pinky be used ? ) , others such as reducing finger travel distance ( by increasing use of home row ) , reducing same - finger row jumps and reducing repeated finger alternation on the same - hand hand can be agreed upon .
These and other features form a list of beneficial layout characteristics .
Carpalx uses a parametrized model to account for finger distance , hand / row / finger penalties and stroke path penalties to accomodate different habits of typists .
Those with disadvantaged fingers ( hurt or missing ) or hands ( hurt or missing ; a missing hand is ultimately debilitating unless you use a one - handed keyboard ) .
Carpalx uses simulated annealing , a type of Monte Carlo optimization , to discover a keyboard layout for which the effort of typing the input documents is low .
Some of the desired improvements that can be directly influenced by the model during layout optimization in carpalx include
increasing hand - alternation or at least hand - balancing
or at least reduction in same - finger typing
typing improve finger flow , such as finger rolling
, such as increasing use of stronger typing fingers and reducing use of the pinky
limiting difficult stroke paths during typing , such as upward row progressions ( e.g. nse )
Over time , the model evolved to be measure the extent of desired ( and undesired ) properties by three distinct effort components : base effort , penalties and stroke path .
These components make up the total typing effort and evaluate a layout .
For example , the comfortable key stroke combinations ( e.g. ' afj ' is a nice rolling motion , while ' but ' is not , and ' omy ' is very uncomfortable ) are measured using the stroke path .
Carpalx was designed to investigate better layout for English text .
Therefore , it does not support independent migration of a key 's shift states .
Carpalx currently understands one shift state ( for capitalization ) but the lower case and upper case characters are always bound to the same key .
Identifying optimal layouts for languages that make use of diacriticals ( è é ë etc ) by allowing both character and diacritical keys to migrate independently is not currently possible .
Ranking Words
Carpalx uses a variety of statistics to characterize a layout 's performance .
While quantitative and therefore directly comparable , these values can be hard to interpret and translate to typing in practise .
The algorithm itself is very flexible — it 's a Monte Carlo ( non-deterministic ) optimizer .
Ideally , what it should optimize is n't an abstract typing effort but rather directly the actual meaningful metrics like hand asymmetry , hand / finger repetition , row jumping and so on .
It turns out that these are all improved by the algorithm , but through the effort metric as a proxy and not directly .
To give a more subjective impression of a layout 's fitness , I have , in addition , ranked words based on the effort ( per unit length ) required to type them .
I have ranked words for QWERTY , Dvorak , Colemak , QGMLWY ( fully optimized , Colemak - like ) , TNWMLC ( worst layout for English ) .
Some of the words are tabulated below .
Keep in mind that word effort was calculated here per unit length , and is therefore not proportional to the length of the word .
layout words , by ease of typing easiest average hardest QWERTY alleges , fiddle , jiffle , kiddie ingent , limnery , pignorative , sumphishly pazazz , pizzazz , poppas , razzer Dvorak condensity , equation , ethion , theist defile , fiddleys , suborder , unenviable allvar , lazars , plazas , razzly Colemak desiring , sentry , steeps , stints implete , leafgirl , mythify , odours cazzie , pazazz , pizzazz , razzle QGMLWY anneals , arbitrator , attend , neatly besigh , incursive , lauder , sparing buzzwig , fizzle , puzzle , zyzzyva TNWMLC bedbug , culmed , jazzed , knocking , wizzen bunglesome , flouting , grunewald , miltier hetter , sheeter , teeter
Benefits of a New Layout
I 'm neither the first nor last person to search for a better keyboard layout .
Consider the Dvorak , Colemak , Arensito , or Capewell layouts .
If you spend a great deal of your time typing QWERTY and experience pain and discomfort due to the repetitive nature of the task , consider using one of these alternate layouts , such as Colemak or one of the fully optimized layouts presented here .
A new layout will
immediately and significantly slow down your typing , giving your fingers and wrist some much needed rest
the accompanying frustration in learning the new layout will make you take more frequent breaks from typing , thereby giving your fingers and wrist even more of the much needed rest
Then , as you gain experience with the new layout , it will
reduce the effort of productive typing , for documents within your specific domain ( you train carpalx using a learning set ) , and
ensure that nobody else uses your keyboard
If your goal is to achieve the last point immediately , consider using carpalx in conjunction with Das Keyboard .
You Must Be Joking
If all this sounds like an informercial , it is only because I am taking the subject of switching keyboard layouts with a modicum of skepticism and am allowing myself a certain license to parody my own process .
Only a small minority of typists use a non-standard layout .
Here , by standard layout , I mean whatever layout is found in the closest internet cafe near you .
In North America , QWERTY is the standard and very few people type on a different layout .
Realistically , we are very unlikely to switch layouts from whatever the local standard is ( I argue here that the local standard should be changed ) .
It 's simply too hard to re-train — kudos to those who have done it !
I am under no delusion that anyone will read the contents of these pages and immediately run home to scrape off key markings on their standard layout and remap their keys to another layout , or some of the new layouts described here .
Of course , if you were to do this I would recommend the partially optimized QWKRFY layout which achieves a significant typing effort reduction with only 5 keys swaps ( for English text ) .
I make some practical suggestions of how to go about doing this below .
International Layouts
Carpalx can work with any language .
The input text can be a spoken language a programming language , or any set of characters that is typed .
The current limitation of carpalx in how alternate shift states for a key are handled .
At the moment , each key has two shift states ( two characters that it can represent ) .
With the QWERTY these shift states represent lower / uppercase , digit / punctuation or punctuation / punctuation .
The two shift states always travel together on a key .
For example , ; and : are always assigned the same key , whatever its final location on the keyboard might be .
Therefore , the location of shift state characters cannot be optimized independently .
Languages that have a lot of diacritical marks , extra characters are accessed using AltGr key on international keyboards .
These special characters represent the 3rd , or higher , shift state on a key .
In order for carpalx to meaningfully interpret and optimize shift states , further work on the code is required .
My own experience is limited to typing English .
I would like to hear from international users who are interested in applying Carpalx to their languages .
Should shift state characters be allowed to migrate independently of the characters that are accessed directly ?
What are your opinions about how the effort model should be adjusted to describe typing states ( e.g. shift + altgr ) ?
Alternative Physical Keyboards
I often get asked whether Carpalx can be applied to non-standard keyboards , such as ergonomic , split or those otherwise different from the traditional 101 key keyboards .
The answer is " yes " .
But there 's a disclaimer ( as usual ) .
While it 's true that Carpalx can be applied to any physical layout — it does n't actually depend on any kind of key placement — the sanity of the output of the optimizer is dependent , in the very least , on the sanity of the input .
This means that the parameters that define the typing effort model need to be thoughtfully selected , ideally motivated by a lot of experience on the keyboard .
When you go about to applying Carpalx to a keyboard , you start by defining the finger travel distance , which you 'd measure for your keyboard , and then define some row and finger penalties and the scores that penalize hand rolling motions .
These last two are pretty subjective and here 's where experience on the keyboard is needed .
If the keyboard is a prototype — and nobody yet has any experience on it — then you 'd pick penalty scores parsimoniously and work from those .
The split vs not - split keyboards is n't something that fundamentally carpalx can address .
For example , there 's no way for me to quanify the additional " comfort " or reduced " effort " of having your wrists oriented in a particular way .
Even on a regular keyboard , people have different wrist angles .
For example , my hands sit with my knuckles at about a 30 degree angle , which would be pretty much the same as if they were on a split keyboard with knuckles parallel to the keys .
Typing Tools - Facilitating Migration to a New Layout
windows - portable keyboard layout ( PKL )
If you are using Windows , I suggest you download and install Portable Keyboard Layout ( PKL ) .
This is a small , self - contained application that allows you to change keyboard layouts on the fly .
Bring it with you on a USB key , for example , to have access to your layouts at all times .
Layouts for Programming
Many of you have asked whether I 've tried to generate a keyboard layout specific to programming .
While I have n't done any evaluation on code , it 's very doable .
However , keep a few things in mind .
First , the extent to which placement of symbols affects the overall score will depend on the proportion of those symbols in the code .
If there 's a lot of text , such as comments , or if the variable names are long , any penalties due to bad ergonomics of a poorly placed symbol character in the layout might get lost in the noise .
Second , character n- grams in programming are a lot less predictable .
the typing effort model that carpalx implements uses two and three key combinations to assess typing difficulty .
For language , this is useful because the frequency of n- grams is fixed for a language .
However , with programming , n- grams that use symbol keys are unpredictable .
A " ] " may be as likely after an " a " as it is after a " z " .
This makes things like finger and hand alternation hard to optimize .
If you 're looking for a layout for programming , take a look at the programmer Dvorak layout .
Although I have not tried this layout , I 'm instantly surprised by a couple of things — these may be naive initial impressions .
First , I 'm surprised that the " { " and " } " are both on the left hand but " [ " " ( " open with left hand and close " ] " and " ) " with right .
Depending on the language , some combinations like " [ { " and " } ] " are going to be common and having them symmetrically arranged is a good reinforcement .
Second , I 'm surprised that the assignment " = " is in the middle of the keyboard , which is a long way for the index finger to stretch for such a common operator .
Finally , there 's also the impact that the programming environment has on typing .
A lot of environments auto complete strings , functions and auto close brackets and parentheses .
Depending on your workflow , it may be that the closing " ] " , for example , is mostly auto closed and hardly ever typed .

Advertisement Controversial larger ferries will continue between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight despite the High Court ruling they were unlawfully introduced .
A campaign group brought the legal challenge after Wightlink introduced three new ships on its Lymington to Yarmouth route in February 2009 .
A judge declared the move was a breach of the European habitats directive .
Wightlink said the breach was not intentional and it had believed that it was acting in accordance with the law .
The Lymington River Association ( LRA ) argued that the bigger W class ferries created a greater wash and were damaging the Lymington River with its protected mudflats and salt marshes , which are rich in bird and marine life .
The historically low levels of marine risk on the river have not been eroded by the introduction of the W class ferries
Wightlink
It brought the legal challenge after Wightlink replaced its 35 - year - old fleet with the new ferries as part of a £ 57 m investment .
Mr Justice Owen , sitting in London , said Wightlink had failed to comply with its duties under the directive , which was initially " not fully and properly transposed into domestic law " .
He said he recognised that , despite his ruling , the ferry service would continue to be operated with the new ferries , subject to certain measures .
But the LRA was justified in pursuing the legal action in order to clarify the law and the challenge was not an academic exercise .
Environmental advice
In a statement , Wightlink said : " This breach was not intentional and , at the time of the decision , Wightlink believed it was acting fully in accordance with the applicable law .
" Wightlink notes the judgment , and will consider what steps it will be required to take in its role as competent authority to address this issue .
" Wightlink 's new ferries continue to navigate the Lymington River and the historically low levels of marine risk on the river have not been eroded by the introduction of the W class ferries . "
The company said that although no damage had been caused to the river , the firm was awaiting advice from Natural England before deciding on appropriate measures to ensure the area is not damaged in the future .
LRA solicitor Richard Buxton said : " This is a great judgment for the marshes and birds and other wildlife around Lymington and shows how useful European law is for properly balancing protection of the environment against commercial interests .
" It shows how our courts are able to help local people worried about the destruction of the environment they cherish in the face of a dithering government department and a big , intransigent company . "

Advertisement Europe 's Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) has produced record - breaking high - energy particle collisions .
Scientists working on the European machine have smashed beams of protons together at energies that are 3.5 times higher than previously achieved .
Tuesday 's milestone marks the beginning of work that could lead to the discovery of fundamental new physics .
There was cheering and applause in the LHC control room as the first collisions were confirmed .
LHC EXPLAINED
LHC guide in graphics and video
These seven - trillion - electronvolt ( TeV ) collisions have initiated 18 - 24 months of intensive investigations at the LHC .
Scientists hope the studies will bring novel insights into the nature of the cosmos and how it came into being .
Many of them have described Tuesday 's event as the beginning of a " new era in science " .
But researchers caution that the data gathered from the sub-atomic impacts will take time to evaluate , and the public should not expect immediate results .
" Major discoveries will happen only when we are able to collect billions of events and identify among them the very rare events that could present a new state of matter or new particles , " said Guido Tonelli , a spokesman for the CMS detector at the LHC .
" This is not going to happen tomorrow .
It will require months and years of patient work , " he told BBC News .
The LHC is one of the biggest scientific endeavours ever undertaken .
WHAT IS AN ELECTRON VOLT ?
Charged particles tend to speed up in an electric field , defined as an electric potential - or voltage - spread over a distance One electron volt ( eV ) is the energy gained by a single electron as it accelerates through a potential of one volt
It is a convenient unit of measure for particle accelerators , which speed particles up through much higher electric potentials
The first accelerators only created bunches of particles with an energy of about a million eV ( MeV )
The LHC can reach beam energies a million times higher : up to several teraelectronvolts ( TeV ) This is still only the energy in the motion of a flying mosquito But LHC beams include trillions of these particles , each travelling at more than 99.99 % of the speed of light Housed at Cern ( the European Organization for Nuclear research ) in a 27 km - long tunnel under the Franco - Swiss border near Geneva , the LHC successfully collided particle beams travelling at close to the speed of light .
The expectation is that previously unseen phenomena will reveal themselves in the resulting debris , with a key objective being the search for the much talked - about Higgs boson particle .
This is thought to have a profound role in the structure of the Universe , and would enable scientists to explain why matter has mass - something which , at a fundamental level , they have difficulty doing at present .
Cern 's director general Rolf Heuer said : " It 's a great day to be a particle physicist .
" The LHC has a real chance over the next two years of ... possibly giving insights into the composition of about a quarter of the Universe . "
Take two The LHC broke down shortly after its opening in 2008 but , since coming back online late last year , has gradually been ramping up operations .
Two proton particle beams have been circling in opposite directions in the magnet - lined tunnels at 3.5 TeV since 19 March .
Having established their stability , these beams were allowed to cross paths and collide .
This 7 TeV event , which took place on Tuesday at 1200 BST , was the highest energy yet achieved in a particle accelerator .
The LHC 's four major experiments - its giant detectors Alice , Atlas , CMS and LHCb - have now begun to gather their first physics data from the collisions , a development that Cern described as an " historic moment " .
The LHC 's detectors are examining the debris from the collisions " This is new territory , " said Professor Tonelli .
" If you want to discover new particles , you have to produce them ; and these new particles are massive .
To produce them , you need higher energies .
For the first time [ on Tuesday ] , we will be producing particles that have energy 3.5 times higher than the maximum energy achieved so far .
" This is why we can start the long journey to make major discoveries in identifying a new massive state of matter . "
At the end of the 7 TeV ( 3.5 TeV per beam ) experimental period , the LHC will be shut down for maintenance for up to a year .
When it re-opens , it will attempt to create 14 TeV events .

Scientists have raided the photosynthetic structures of leaves to figure out the most efficient way to use solar energy to turn water into hydrogen fuel .
The Artificial Inorganic Leaf , or AIL , potentially represents a major step towards a hydrogen - powered world .

A team of Chinese researchers from the State Key Lab of Matrix Composites at Shanghai Jiaotong University unveiled AIL today at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco .
They explained that their goal was to replicate natural light - harvesting techniques that plants have developed for photosynthesis .
In turn , that solar energy can be used as a sustainable , relatively inexpensive way to convert water into hydrogen , creating a clean energy source whose only byproduct is water vapor .
The researchers , led by Tongxiang Fan , argued that this represents the most promising alternative to the current carbon - based economy .

So how did the scientists do it ?
Take a deep breath , because this is more than a bit involved :
The scientists first infiltrated the leaves of Anemone vitifolia - a plant native to China - with titanium dioxide in a two - step process .
Using advanced spectroscopic techniques , the scientists were then able to confirm that the structural features in the leaf favorable for light harvesting were replicated in the new TiO2 structure .
Excitingly , the AIL are eight times more active for hydrogen production than TiO2 that has not been " biotemplated " in that fashion .
AILs also are more than three times as active as commercial photo - catalysts .
Next , the scientists embedded nanoparticles of platinum into the leaf surface .
Platinum , along with the nitrogen found naturally in the leaf , helps increase the activity of the artificial leaves by an additional factor of ten .

Initial results indicate AIL is far more efficient in its light - harvesting than any previously developed system .
Fan and his colleagues will continue to study the structures of leaves in hopes of finding ways not only to replicate nature 's techniques but also to improve upon them .

MUNICH —
The future Pope Benedict XVI was kept more closely apprised of a sexual abuse case in Germany than previous church statements have suggested , raising fresh questions about his handling of a scandal unfolding under his direct supervision before he rose to the top of the church ’s hierarchy .
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , the future pope and archbishop in Munich at the time , was copied on a memo that informed him that a priest , whom he had approved sending to therapy in 1980 to overcome pedophilia , would be returned to pastoral work within days of beginning psychiatric treatment .
The priest was later convicted of molesting boys in another parish .
An initial statement on the matter issued earlier this month by the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising placed full responsibility for the decision to allow the priest to resume his duties on Cardinal Ratzinger ’s deputy , the Rev. Gerhard Gruber .
But the memo , whose existence was confirmed by two church officials , shows that the future pope not only led a meeting on Jan. 15 , 1980 , approving the transfer of the priest , but was also kept informed about the priest ’s reassignment .
What part he played in the decision making , and how much interest he showed in the case of the troubled priest , who had molested multiple boys in his previous job , remains unclear .
But the personnel chief who handled the matter from the beginning , the Rev. Friedrich Fahr , “ always remained personally , exceptionally connected ” to Cardinal Ratzinger , the church said .
The Horizon ’s report encompasses PC Gaming revenue from every region around the world , and from every part of the PC gaming industry including retail , online gaming , digital distribution , and online advertising .
Horizon ’s research clearly shows that participation in PC gaming among consumers around the world continues to drive significant opportunities for PC vendors , gaming ISVs , supply - chain partners and accessory makers .
The latest figures were released in the annual PCGA Horizons software report prepared by market research firm DFC Intelligence .
The report also looks at some of the key trends in the PC game market .
Despite the severe worldwide recession , growth in the Asia Pacific region fueled the global PC game market .
" The most notable trend in recent years has been the movement to digital distribution and payment for subscriptions , and the growing popularity with consumers of online games as a service , " said Randy Stude , PCGA president and Intel director .
" In 2009 we saw North America and Europe experience a rapid uptake in purchasing virtual items .
This model is what drove growth in Asia and we think it is just starting to come to Western markets . "
The transition to free - to - play games and the emergence of social network sites like Facebook did cause revenue to decline in some established markets .
High - end subscription games that charge a fee of $ 10 a month or more suffered from the lack of major new releases and a decline in usage for some older products .
However , the biggest downturn was in retail boxed sales of PC games , which now accounts for less than 20 % of total revenue .
Nevertheless , the downturn in established markets was largely offset by the growth of digital distribution .
Most countries in North America and Europe saw revenue declines in 2009 of only 10 - 15 % from record highs in 2008 .
In addition , free - to - play games and social network sites continue to draw in thousands of new game players that can be progressively monetized .
" In our surveys of PC gamers in North America and Europe we found that over 70 % indicate they have bought a full game online .
Furthermore , over 50 % indicate that they have bought a virtual item , " said DFC Analyst David Cole .
" This is very positive because , when done successfully , companies in Asia have found the digital distribution model to be significantly more profitable than the traditional retail boxed goods business . "

THE renewable - fuel standard released in February by America 's Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) paints an ambitious picture of biofuels ' future .
It wants the amount of the stuff used as transport fuel to climb from 13 billion gallons ( 49 billion litres ) in 2010 to 36 billion gallons in 2022 , requiring by far the largest part of that increase to come from various advanced biofuels , rather than ethanol made from corn ( maize ) .
But although the future looks exciting , the present is rather grim .
The EPA has been forced to slash its 2010 mandate for the most widely touted of the non-corn biofuels , cellulosic ethanol , from 100 m gallons to just 6.5 m , less than a thousandth of the 11 billion gallons produced from corn in 2009 .
The fact that corn-ethanol production has continued to grow , despite the failure of a number of firms in late 2008 and early 2009 , points to the efficacy of the various protections and subsidies it enjoys ( falling maize prices helped too ) , though it says nothing about their efficiency or wisdom .
Ethanol , which is used mainly as an additive to petrol , is not a particularly good fuel : it offers only about two - thirds as much energy as petrol and can corrode pipelines and car engines .
By 2014 or earlier , ethanol production is expected to reach 10 % of America 's total fuel demand , and thus to hit a “ blend wall ” , since the EPA does not at present allow blends of more than 10 % for mainstream use .
Even as producers have urged the EPA to lift this bar , it has challenged them to move beyond corn and make ethanol from cellulose , the abundant , inedible portion of most crops .
Using inedible inputs avoids fights about diverting food crops for fuel , and frees the industry from reliance on a single commodity .
Despite ample investment , however , production costs remain high and commercialisation elusive .
Since 2007 one company , Range Fuels , has received more than $ 150 m in federal grants and guarantees for a large cellulosic - ethanol plant , but has yet to produce any .
Still , it and others are gamely pushing ahead .
A boost came last month , when Novozymes and Danisco , two Danish firms , unveiled new , cheaper enzymes which are needed to break down cellulose .
Even if cellulosic ethanol were to get cheaper , though , it would still be ethanol , a poor fuel .
The alternative is to produce something better , such as an advanced biodiesel .
According to Lux Research , based in Boston , venture capitalists invested $ 208 m in algae technologies with this sort of thing in mind during 2008 , six times as much as they spent in 2007 .
But building vast pools for algae and turning them into fuel remains tremendously expensive .
Solazyme , a Californian firm , is a promising anomaly , using algae to make fuel from sugars in dark industrial vats rather than pools .
Such strategies may work , but have yet to be scaled up .
Solazyme , tellingly , has developed other sources of revenue .
America 's government is doling out grants and loan guarantees , and oil companies are investing , too .
Solazyme has a partnership with Chevron .
Valero , America 's biggest oil refiner , has bought up troubled ethanol plants and invested in firms that use plant material , algae and rubbish to produce fuel .
BP 's broad - based portfolio includes investments in Brazilian sugarcane ethanol , cellulosic ethanol and a partnership with DuPont to produce biobutanol .
“ It still feels like the final bets have not been made , ” explains Phil New , the head of BP Biofuels .

Why is it that banking trojans are a problem when all online banks are HTTPS secured and many of them employ multi-factor authentication ?
The answer : Humans are not digital .
If we would have a network cable attached to our brain , and our brain could decrypt and encrypt SSL , there would be no problem .
However , due to the " analog " interfaces which human beings have , a web browser has to decrypt the traffic and convert it into images ( text characters , icons , et cetera ) and sounds .
This means that a malicious application that can modify the browser memory can control what the user sees , and what he then sends to the bank via in - band communications .
It is technically possible for malware to free ride on authenticated sessions with online services and feed or modify transactions .
If malware can modify the memory of the browser , or some other application , it can gain control .
This is not just a problem for online banking and not just with malware .
For example , current MMORPG games typically do quite a bit of the computation needed on the client side .
Not all of this computation is graphics processing .
This creates the possibility for cheating in games by patching the client or its memory locally on the host ( Greg Hoglund and Gary McGraw have written a book called " Exploiting Online Games : Cheating Massively Distributed Systems [ 2007 ] " on the subject ) .
Another good example of this " client - side dilemma " is voting .
Imagine sitting at home on your couch while using your web browser to vote in your local / state / national elections .
If and when this becomes possible , malware may be used to rig votes .
Today 's browser is more powerful than yesterday 's OS .
The browser is , for all practical purposes , a terminal of the bank , but it is running in a completely untrusted environment .
Actually , you could say that the Browser is the new OS .
Since important content is more and more in the cloud and accessed via the browser , malware , in theory , does not have to infect the OS at all .
Malware only needs to infect the browser and it will be able to access , steal , and modify all the necessary content .
Since most browsers have a cross- platform plugin architecture , it may even be possible to create data stealing malware that is not interested in the operating system or file system at all .
It will only exist in memory of the browser .
Currently , banking trojans do infect the OS and are typically only a problem for Windows based systems .
Banking trojans and other malware that need to bypass HTTPS security operate within the browser .
This is called a Man - in - the - Browser ( MitB ) attack .
If the malware would try to intercept the traffic from a lower OS level , it would already be HTTPS encrypted .
This is not a new phenomenon but nevertheless it is still on the upswing within most malware author 's armory .
MitB malware is typically browser dependent and most of them only target Internet Explorer ( and possible other browsers using MS WinINet API ) and lately also Firefox .
Is safe online banking impossible then ?
Aside from keeping your system clean of malware , at least " safe enough " is definitely possible .
For example , out - of - band solutions , using an SMS message to review and confirm transactions , provide a good additional layer of security .
Some have also suggested using something such as a Live Linux CD when doing online banking .
Alas , both SMS messaging and Live CDs are examples of the old " security versus usability " issue .
They 're an additional layer of security , but they can also rapidly overwhelm the analog brains of those using them .
A recent analysis of global homicide rates came up with some interesting conclusions .
It turns out that the proportion of young males , population density , degree of urbanization , and income inequality are not significant predictors of the homicide rate .
Instead , ethnic and linguistic diversity , education , and the quality of governing institutions were the most significant factors .
Although it ’s not surprising that ethnic strife and law enforcement matter for the homicide rate , there was a surprising effect found for education :
An extra year of school for the average female increased the homicide rate almost as much as one less year of school for the average male .

What executives ’ voices give away A good interrogator can often detect dishonesty by paying close attention to the way someone talks .
A new analysis of corporate earnings conference calls suggests that Wall Street might benefit from these same skills .
Using sophisticated voice analysis software , researchers found that the emotions of the executives who were grilled by stock analysts on these calls were predictive of future company performance .
When executives were positive , positive future news releases and earnings surprises were more likely , and likewise for negative emotions and negative performance .
Nevertheless , although these emotions did induce a market reaction , the analysts themselves generally incorporated positive but not negative emotions into forecasts , so stock prices did n’t completely anticipate the bad news .

It ’s cheaper to say you ’re sorry Do n’t offer me money , just say you ’re sorry .
That ’s the conclusion of a customer - service experiment with a company selling goods on eBay .
Customers who gave the company neutral or negative evaluations - a rare and public signal of disapproval - were randomly offered either an apology , a small amount of money , or a larger amount of money to rescind their evaluation .
Even though the apology was nothing more than a self - serving corporate message , customers were twice as likely to rescind their evaluation if offered the apology than if offered money .

Although none of the students expected this effect , it seems to have worked by increasing motivation - students with “ A ” tests generated more achievement - oriented words on a word - completion test .

Handsome is as handsome drives
Sure , we all know the stereotype about guys driving fancy cars to impress the ladies .
But is there a real effect , and does it also apply to men who see women driving fancy cars ?
Psychologists in Britain showed people photographs of an average - looking man or woman , each seated in either a Bentley Continental or a Ford Fiesta .
Consistent with the stereotype , women thought the man looked more attractive in the fancier car .
However , a fancy car did n’t make the woman more attractive to the men .

A fossil amphibian has come to light on land owned by FedEx and has been named Fedexia striegeli
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Fossil hunters have named a 300 m - year - old amphibian in honour of the courier service FedEx , after unearthing the creature on land owned by the company near a US airport .
The remains of the ancient amphibian , which lived 70 m years before the first dinosaurs , were recovered in 2004 from a slab of rock near Pittsburgh International Airport by Adam Striegel , an amateur fossil enthusiast on a geology field trip .
Researchers at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh described the creature on the basis of its remarkably well - preserved 12 cm - long skull , which survived fossilisation without being crushed .
A group led by David Berman , curator of vertebrate palaeontology at the museum , identified the amphibian as a new genus and species , Fedexia striegeli , in the institution 's journal , Annals of Carnegie Museum .
Fedexia belongs to a family of extinct amphibians called trematopidae , which lived at a time when the Earth 's climate was in the throes of a dramatic transition .
The planet 's oceans were increasingly becoming locked up in polar ice , causing sea levels to drop and vast swathes of land to become drier and warmer .
Gradually , some groups of amphibians , including the trematopids , left their mostly aquatic environments and became more adapted to a terrestrial habitat , returning to the water perhaps only to mate or lay eggs .
The remarkable preservation of its skull allowed palaeontologists to identify Fedexia as a trematopid , mainly by a hallmark feature of the group : an elongated external nasal opening .
When it died , what is now Pittsburgh was situated near the equator and experienced huge downpours , making an ideal environment for amphibians to flourish .
" What is particularly amazing about this discovery is that it was made by an amateur who had no prior experience in recognising vertebrate fossils in the rock , a talent that usually takes years to develop , " said Berman .
He won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1975 for Dersu Uzala , which took four years to make and helped him recover from an earlier suicide attempt .
It also won a gold medal at the Moscow Film Festival .
The trouble with moving big amounts of cash , from a criminal ’s point of view , is threefold .
It ’s bulky , it ’s heavy and it smells .
A stash of $ 1 million in mixed bills weighs around 100 pounds ( 50 kilos ) .
Specially - trained dogs can sniff out bulk cash in a heartbeat .
All of which helps to explain why drug cartels and financiers of terrorism appear to have been making increasing use of what FBI chief Robert Mueller calls a shadow banking system .
Its features include a legal loophole that allows money launderers to get around the requirement that cash or “ monetary instruments ” ( share certificates , travellers ’ cheques , money orders etc. ) in excess of $ 10,000 must be declared on entering or leaving the United States .
It is , however , perfectly legal to carry , say , $ 50,000 embedded in the magnetic stripes of so - called pre-paid stored - value cards .
They look like a credit or debit card but are not linked to a bank account , can in many cases be loaded anonymously , are not “ monetary instruments ” under U.S. law , and were labelled “ the ideal instrument for large - scale drug trafficking and money - laundering operations ” in a 2006 analysis by the National Drug Intelligence Center .
It predicted that drug traffickers , narco - terrorists and other criminals would increasingly rely on stored - value cards — “ superior to established methods of money laundering ” — because they could be used without fear of documentation , identification , law enforcement suspicion or seizure .
In other words , a shot in the arm of the global money laundering industry , an illicit enterprise that accounts for between 2 and 5 percent of the world ’s GDP , according to an estimate by the International Monetary Fund .
The Center ’s dark warnings did little to curb the rapid growth of the stored - value card industry — more than $ 300 billion a year by some estimates .
At a congressional hearing in mid-March , the FBI ’s Mueller reported that “ recent money laundering investigations have revealed a trend on the part of criminals to use stored - value devices such as pre-paid gift cards and reloadable debit cards in order to move criminal proceeds .
“ This has created a shadow banking system … ”
The largely unregulated stored - value card industry , he said , made it difficult for law enforcement to spot transaction patterns that can help identify money launderers and financiers of terrorism .
A QUESTION TO TIM GEITHNER
So if the cards are such a threat , why is there no regulation ?
It is a question two senators , Joseph Lieberman and Susan Collins , asked in a February 16 letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
The two , respectively the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate ’s Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs , last year authored an amendment to close the stored - value card loophole .
The amendment became part of an act on credit card accountability and disclosure President Barack Obama signed into law on May 22 last year .
The amendment stipulated that the Treasury Department work out regulations on the sale , issuance , redemption and international transportation of stored value cards within 270 days .
The deadline lapsed on February 16 and the letter asks for an explanation for the delay in issuing rules .
So far , there has been no reply .
It ’s not clear whether the delay is due to bureaucratic inertia , overwork in a Treasury Department busy with a deep financial crisis , or , as money laundering expert Charles Intriago put it , “ a manifestation of the unhealthy power of big money , financial institutions and their lobbyists . ”
Intriago , an anti-money laundering crusader for decades , runs the International Association for Asset Recovery , a company based in Miami .
How much dirty money flows through the stored - value card loophole is anyone ’s guess .
“ It ’s not possible to quantify how much money is moving one way or the other , ” Paul Campo , the chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration ’s office of financial investigations said in an interview .
“ But the case of Virtual Money Inc. gives an idea of the potential scale of the problem . ”
According to a government indictment that stemmed from a DEA sting operation , drug dealers using pre-paid cards issued by Virtual Money , a company based in Texas , withdrew $ 7.1 million from automatic teller machines ( ATMs ) in the Colombian city of Medellin in 2006 .
Despite the concern over more sophisticated methods of moving ill - gotten gains , carting cash across borders has not gone out of fashion .
In 2009 , government agents along the border with Mexico seized $ 39.2 million in currency , according to official figures .
That compares with around $ 10 million in 2008 and is due to more frequent checks of southbound traffic for cash and guns .
Nearly $ 40 million in confiscated cash sounds a lot .
But it is less than pocket change , in the grand scheme of things .
The U.S. Justice Department estimates that drug cartels smuggle $ 24 billion a year into Mexico , $ 40 million amounts to 0.16 percent of the estimated total .
What about the rest ?
Nobody can give a breakdown , but tighter regulations surely can’t hurt .
There may be a better way , however , for potential buyers to approach the problem .
“ Predicting interest rates is a whole lot easier than predicting home prices , ” says Glenn Kelman , chief executive of Redfin , a multistate discount online real estate brokerage company based in Seattle .
“ Before you buy the house , you buy the money , ” he says .

It ’s a little like walking into a dealership to buy a car , and finding the saleswoman immediately jotting down what your monthly payments will be and starting the negotiations there .
That ’s absolutely the wrong way to buy a car .
But for a prospective homeowner , it ’s a good place to start the analysis to determine how much house you can buy .
Instead of betting on home prices , you make a bet on whether money will become cheaper or more expensive , allowing you to buy more or less house .
That ’s where the regular Joe has a pretty good shot of being right .
You wo n’t know day to day , or week to week , what ’s happening to rates , and a jolt like a default in Greece or a change in Chinese monetary policy can throw everything off .
But , generally , the Federal Reserve is telegraphing where things are headed over the next six months .
“ I ca n’t prove to you that housing prices have definitely bottomed out , ” Mr. Kelman says .
“ I can say with a fair degree of certainty that the cost of money will go higher . ”
OF course , if rates go up , home prices tend to dampen .
Borrowing $ 300,000 at 5 percent costs you $ 1,610 a month .
If rates rise to 6 percent , that ’s $ 188 a month more , or $ 67,680 over 30 years .
Would the price of a $ 375,000 house fall because of a half - point rate hike ?
Now you are back to guessing about home prices .
Do n’t go there .
Maintain your focus .
“ People are frequently buying for the wrong reasons , ” says Frank LLosa , a real estate agent working in northern Virginia .
In most cases , he says , they think that they are getting an income tax break or that their home is an investment .
Congress could temporarily lower the age at which Americans can claim Social Security benefits as a jobs bill , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) said Sunday .
Kucinich , a liberal Democrat from the Cleveland area , said a $ 15 billion proposal he 's floating would create 1 million jobs for the U.S. economy .
The two - time presidential candidate 's proposal calls for a six - month period during which people could retire at the age of 60 .
The program would be funded by $ 10 billion in bailout funds , and $ 5 billion in stimulus funds .
" It 's voluntary and the idea is that since we already know that 70 percent of people are taking early retirement at age 62 , this idea that I have would say that -- just for a limited period , on a voluntary basis only -- if people want to take retirement at age 60 , we calculate that maybe a million people would take that , and create a million job openings and enable people to move into the workforce , while others would have their retirement secure , " Kucinich said during an appearance on Fox News .
The congressman 's proposal comes after the House had passed its own jobs proposal .
The Senate is set to take a vote on its own , different $ 15 billion jobs bill this week .
Power leads to greater errors in forecasts , according to new research led by social psychologist Dr Mario Weick at the University of Kent .
The research , to be published by the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , shows that when people feel powerful they become more optimistic and less accurate in predicting the completion time of forthcoming tasks .
The research examined for the first time the planning behaviour of powerful people and found that power drastically reduced the accuracy of forecasts with error rates soaring up to 70 % .
Dr Weick , a Research Fellow at the University 's School of Psychology , explained : ' Time is a crucial factor in people 's everyday lives .
Whether they are teachers , policy makers or engineers , people routinely plan their work and estimate the time it will take to accomplish tasks .
Interestingly , people often underestimate the time it takes to accomplish tasks .
This bias is known as the planning fallacy and derives from a too narrow focus on the envisaged goal .
The more people focus on what they want to achieve , the more they tend to neglect impediments , previous experiences and task subcomponents that are not readily apparent .
As a result , time predictions are often inaccurate and too optimistic .
Power tends to increase people 's focus on intended outcomes .
Although this can be beneficial , in the context of time planning we reasoned that power would lead to greater error in forecasts . '
The researchers carried out four experiments , showing that when people felt powerful they tended to underestimate more the time it took to accomplish various tasks , ranging from mundane activities to important projects .
Dr Weick said : ' What appears to underlie these effects is not so much that people in power have greater faith in their abilities or that they see things through rose - tinted glasses , power affects what people focus on when they plan the future , and this seems to be the root of the greater bias in powerful individuals ' time predictions . '
The findings suggest that people who are in charge and deciding on courses of action ( eg policy makers ) are more at risk to fall prey to biases in their forecasts .
The research also proposes ways to alleviate the biasing effects of power .
Specifically , forecasting accuracy could be improved by using techniques that draw people 's attention to information that lies outside their focal goal .
Moreover , changing the power structure of planning committees could also be a way to render forecasts more accurate ( eg by assigning greater weight to the predictions of individuals who do not have power ) .
The project was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council ( ESRC ) , the UK 's leading agency for research funding and training in economic and social sciences .
AIR FORCE ACADEMY —
A religious - liberty advocate said Friday that Air Force Academy officials have convinced him they ’re serious about investigating a possible case of religious harassment , easing his earlier doubts .
Mikey Weinstein , president of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , expressed skepticism earlier this month whether the academy was doing enough after a large wooden cross was found at a campus worship space for pagans and followers of other Earth - centered religions .
Speaking Friday at the academy ’s National Character and Leadership Symposium , Weinstein said his doubts were eased after a conversation with the academy superintendent , Lt. Gen. Michael Gould .
He said miscommunication within the academy caused his original concern .
He said he and Gould now have a secret , one - word code they can use to alert each other when a religious - tolerance issue arises .
The investigation is still underway , and officials do n’t know whether the placement of the cross was malicious , innocent or something in between , said academy spokeswoman Capt .
Corinna Jones .
“ Everything is not always as it seems , ” she said .
Jones said investigators have been conducting interviews , but she did n’t know whether anyone has been identified as a suspect or arrests have been made .
She said she did n’t know when the investigation might conclude .
Weinstein said he received an e-mail Thursday that might provide “ a lead to a lead . ”
He declined to give specifics but said the e-mail had been turned over to investigators .
Weinstein , an Albuquerque attorney and a 1977 graduate of the academy , started the Military Religious Freedom Foundation after some academy cadets reported in 2004 they had been harassed or ostracized over their religious beliefs , or because they were not religious .
Weinstein has accused fundamentalist Christians at the academy and elsewhere in the military of improperly pressuring subordinates to convert .
At least two armed guards were visible nearby while Weinstein was at the academy .
He said he often gets threats because of his advocacy .
Jones said the school had assigned a plainclothes armed guard to Weinstein .
More than 350 cadets , officers and others crowded into a room to hear Weinstein speak , many of them standing .
They gave him standing ovations when he was introduced , when he finished speaking and when he finished answering questions .
Weinstein told them his foundation is at war with some fundamentalist Christians in the military who put their faith ahead of their oath to defend the Constitution .
“ When you put that uniform on , there ’s only one religion : patriotism , ” he said .
More than 90 years on , recently found bodies of 250 soldiers who died during the Battle of Fromelles in the first world war need identifying .
Richard Corfield investigates
More than 90 years on , recently found bodies of 250 soldiers who died during the Battle of Fromelles in the first world war need identifying .
Richard Corfield investigates
At 6 pm on 19 July 1916 , around 6000 soldiers from the Australian 5th division and 3400 soldiers from the British 61st division went ’ over the top ’ into no man ’s land near the small town of Fromelles in northern France .
The action was intended as a diversion to the Battle of the Somme which was taking place about 50 miles to the south .
By the end of the fighting the following day more than 1900 Australian soldiers and 500 British soldiers had died .
After the first world war , a cemetery and memorial - known as VC Corner - was erected near the site to remember the Australian soldiers who had fallen .
The names of the soldiers buried there are listed on a commemorative wall - making this one of the few Commonwealth war memorials with no individual headstones .
The site then remained largely unchanged for almost 80 years until Lambis Englezos , an Australian art teacher and amateur historian , visited the area in the early 1990s .
Having studied the battle before he left Australia , Englezos could see that the number of men commemorated on the wall did not tally with the figure known to have died in the battle .
There could be only one conclusion - some of the men were still unaccounted for .
It took several years ’ work , but Englezos ’ breakthrough came when he saw an aerial photograph dated 29 July 1916 , held in the archives at the Imperial War Museum in London , UK .
Comparison with aerial photographs taken just before the Battle of Fromelles showed that eight large pits had been dug in the days immediately following the battle next to an area of woodland - named Pheasant Wood - just behind German lines .
Englezos alerted the Australian authorities , who then requested further information from the German Embassy in Australia .
Archives held in Munich showed that approximately two days after the battle , German soldiers were ordered to dig pits to bury the bodies of the British and Australian solders that still littered the battlefield .
Armed with this new evidence , the Australian government commissioned a pilot investigation .
And in 2008 , the Glasgow University Archaeological Research Division ( Guard ) confirmed that there were human remains in the graves , and that there was corroborative artefactual evidence that these belonged to some of the missing soldiers .
The Australian and UK governments then requested a formal excavation of the bodies in the pits , accompanied by archaeological , anthropological and DNA profiling to assist in the identification of the dead men .
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission ( CWGC ) , a UK - based body who construct and maintain war cemeteries and memorials , was appointed to oversee the project .
It was also decided that the bodies would be reburied in a custom - built cemetery near where they fell - in keeping with CWGC policy .
The new cemetery is currently under construction about 0.5 km from the site of the mass graves where the soldiers ’ bodies were found .
The excavation
The excavation process was carried out by a team from the UK educational charity Oxford Archaeology , led by a biological anthropology specialist called Louise Loe .
Loe ’s team started in May 2009 , and by the time they finished in October they had retrieved the remains of 250 soldiers .
Of the eight pits Englezos had identified in the 1916 aerial photographs , five were found to be full of bodies and a sixth was partly filled .
Many artefacts such as buttons , buckles and badges were also found .
From a technical point of view the work was challenging because it combined elements of both forensic and traditional archaeology , explains Loe .
’ The magnitude of the impact our results could have on waiting families who may have a relative who was buried there , is very different to the impact our discoveries about ancient human remains usually have , ’ she says .
’ In this sense , it is a humanitarian project , whereas you could argue that more traditional archaeology projects are educational . ’
At every stage of the excavation the emphasis was put on preserving the dignity of the dead , Loe says .
While the possessions were physically separated from the remains they belonged to during the excavation process for practical reasons , a tagging system meant that they can be reburied together .
Peter Francis , a spokesperson for the CWGC , reiterated the importance of the humanitarian aspect of the project .
The overriding emphasis of the excavation and hopeful identification at Fromelles was to ensure that they got the same treatment and respect as their comrades who had been found and laid to rest in the immediate aftermath of the Great War , he says .
The ID process
Using anthropological analysis , Loe ’s team were able to estimate how old the men were when they died .
But to formally identify them , the DNA of the soldiers needs to be matched to that of their modern day ancestors .
And this work is currently being carried out by LGC Forensics based in Teddington , UK , under the supervision of independent DNA consultant Peter Jones .
There are various established ways for matching DNA , but the approach taken by the LGC team is to look at two sets of genetic markers , one on the Y chromosome and the other on mitochondrial DNA , that have very little possibility of crossover and a low rate of mutation through the generations .
One of the complications is that because many of the soldiers died so young , they would not have left behind any descendants .
Looking at both the Y ( male ) chromosome and mitochondrial DNA ( which is passed down only through the female line ) , allowed the scientists to match the dead to more distant family such as the descendants of siblings or even cousins and great - cousins .
For this reason a large part of Jones ’ job has been developing family trees , to identify the most likely living candidates to provide a DNA sample against which to match the DNA from the soldiers of Fromelles .
The task is harder still when you remember that only 250 sets of remains have been recovered , and 1500 - 1600 soldiers were missing after the battle .
This means that many of the DNA samples provided by the living relatives are not relevant .
Another complication is that only about half of the families of the missing have come forward to provide DNA samples .
As the soldiers start to be identified and named by the LGC team in the coming weeks and months it is hoped that more people will come forward for profiling .
The search for DNA has focused on the soldiers ’ teeth rather than their bones , explains James Walker , the scientist in charge of the LGC Forensics laboratory team performing the analyses .
While his team extensively tested bones initially , better results were achieved from teeth because the layer of enamel covering teeth provides some protection against the soil - borne nucleases which break down DNA into progressively smaller fragments .
So far results have been encouraging .
In the majority of cases they have recovered DNA fragments in excess of the 300 base pairs ideally required for identification from both Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA .
This is particularly gratifying because nuclear ( ie Y chromosome ) DNA is much less abundant and more easily degraded than mitochondrial DNA .
The main DNA analysis of the soldiers has now been completed , Jones says , and the profiling is almost complete .
The bodies are to be reburied before the identification is complete , and once an unequivocal identification has been made the headstone of the soldier will have his name , rank and regiment appended to it in keeping with the protocols of the CWGC .
Scientific squabbles
While the identification process is proceeding well , the approach used for the DNA analysis has proven to be a point of controversy within the scientific community .
Alan Cooper , director of the Australian centre for ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide , believes that what he calls the ’ forensic approach ’ taken by the LGC team is mistaken .
His central argument is that he believes that this was a job for a university - based ancient DNA lab like his , and that universities were effectively precluded from tendering for the process by the inbuilt requirement imposed by the project design that the graves be treated ’ like a crime scene ’ .
Walker , however , says that it is entirely proper that the site should be treated in that manner , ’ At the end of the day these bodies have been underground , and to preserve the integrity of the samples it is quite relevant to treat it like a crime scene .
As soon as you have individuals trampling about at [ these ] sites DNA can get shed and this extraneous DNA can be transferred onto items and bodies there . ’
Indeed the 300 base pair approach mandated by Jones seems to be working well , suggesting that there was no need for the more sophisticated , experimental and time - consuming techniques advocated by Cooper .
Part of the requirement imposed by the Australian and British governments was that the analyses should be completed as quickly as possible to expedite giving the soldiers a timely burial .
And there is another important factor that was made clear by Jones .
’ We are not talking about one or two bodies here - if we had been , then a university lab might have been appropriate .
We are talking about 250 sets of remains and it is vital that the strictest levels of accountability be met .
That makes it appropriate for it to be handled by a forensic DNA lab .
The bar [ of the tendering process ] was set quite high and I make no apology for that . ’
Walker agrees , ’ The importance of having a forensic organisation doing the work is to do with continuity of samples .
We have the ability to set up protocols to ensure that whatever samples are taken from those remains are transferred to our laboratory and processed with a secure system for tracking the samples and knowing what happened to them .
Universities are very good at developing techniques and doing research but they are not set up for doing testing which will be scrutinised to show that the sample being processed has definitely come from the source material . ’
In the meantime the pits at Pheasant Wood have been backfilled , reploughed and seeded with grass .
By the time of the commemorative service planned for 19 July 2010 -? 94 years to the day after the Battle of Fromelles began - a wild - flower filled meadow will stand where once hundreds of Australian and British soldiers lay .
And the lost soldiers of Fromelles will finally be at peace .

You think it ’s so great being Rahm Emanuel ?
One of the enduring mysteries about White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel is why he took the job in the first place .
At the time he accepted it , he was the fourth - ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives , a position he ’d attained with considerable effort .
Two years earlier , Emanuel had chaired the House Democrats ’ campaign arm and led the party to a 31 - seat majority after a decade of futility .
It was a grueling undertaking -- Emanuel shed 14 pounds during the two - year stint , went months without a decent night ’s sleep , consumed appalling quantities of caffeine -- and it entailed significant professional risk .
Had Emanuel come up short in an election cycle many Democrats deemed their best shot in years , he might have spent the rest of his career on the backbenches .
Instead , on the eve of Barack Obama ’s victory , only three colleagues stood between him and the coveted House speakership , and they were all two decades older .
So why was Emanuel so keen to walk away ?
The short answer is that he was n’t .
Once a day between the moment Obama offered the job and the moment he took it a week later , Emanuel would call his brother Zeke - - a prominent bioethicist who would later join the administration -- and rant about why he should say no : “ I have a great life .
I ’m going to rise up in the House leadership , be the first Jewish speaker , ” he ’d bellow .
Emanuel would continue in this vein for 20 , 30 , sometimes 40 minutes .
Then he would abruptly hang up , only to start in all over again the next day .
Still , there was never much doubt he would sign on .
“ He had twenty - seven reasons - - he wants to spend time with his kids , be a devoted father .
They ’re at a tender age .
I mean , all of them were right .
But too bad , ” says Zeke , nodding at the family ethic of public service .
“ He knew he had to take the job .
He had no choice .
It was his duty .
...
It was everything that had gone into forty - nine years of him being raised . ”
One can understand Emanuel ’s hesitation .
Laboring as White House chief of staff is fantastically difficult under any circumstances , something Emanuel learned well as an aide to Bill Clinton .
Former George W. Bush chief of staff Andy Card famously arrived at the White House by 5:30 each morning and stayed until eight or nine each night .
But laboring as chief of staff during the first year or two of a presidency can be a prolonged form of torture .
A new White House tends to be heavily populated with campaign personnel , many of whom have little experience at governing , much less in the West Wing .
Yet they will have earned a claim on a job whether or not the chief of staff wants them there .
This dynamic typically fades over time , as campaign veterans get replaced by operatives with a less personal connection to the president .
When Erskine Bowles took over as Bill Clinton ’s third chief of staff in late 1996 , he brought in two new deputies , Sylvia Matthews and John Podesta .
But the tension can be a major source of frustration in the early going .
And , in fact , Emanuel was denied the luxury of choosing his own deputies .
( One of his preferred candidates , Tom Donilon , later resurfaced as deputy national security advisor . )
( Newser ) – New protection for homosexuals in federal hate - crimes laws so irked Oklahoma legislators that the state senate recently passed a measure aimed at allowing local authorities to choose not to share information with the feds on crimes the state does n’t view as hate crimes — and “ sexual orientation or gender identity ” do n’t fall under Oklahoma ’s definition .
Except , one Democrat says , the bill cites the wrong federal statute , and thus removes race - and religion - based protection .
“ This is most likely a legislative error or at least a typo , ” state Sen .
Andrew Rice tells the Oklahoma Daily , adding that the move should nevertheless outrage all groups .
The state House must still vote on the measure , and its author says the error will be corrected .

OSLO — The NATO secretary general , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , must know as a Dane that his fellow Scandinavians wo n’t be contributing much to the troop surge he has promised in Afghanistan .
With more than 1,600 soldiers in the fight ( or in Afghanistan anyway ) the Danish , Swedish and Norwegian militaries say they ’re already going full tilt .
They will stay — but expect no Viking surge .
Denmark
NYT
The Danes in particular have shown mettle , battling the Taliban in Helmand Province since 2006 and sustaining 31 deaths .
Relative to national population , the Danish death toll is nearly twice that of the United States and the highest in NATO .
Half of the Danish population still supports the country ’s energetic commitment , while only a third wants the troops to come home now , a recent Gallup poll found .
Widespread Muslim animosity toward Denmark since 2005 , when Danish newspapers published unflattering cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad , has had a bracing effect on public opinion so that even the Socialist People ’s Party backs the war .
When the current 650 - person Danish battle group under British command rotates home in February , however , its replacement will be the same size , according to a Ministry of Defense spokesman , Jacob Winther .
“ The number of soldiers we have there is already very high considering how small our country is , and we are not considering sending more , ” Mr. Winther said .
Norway
Norway ’s center - left government , which once planned a mid-2010 pullout , now insists it is in for the long haul .
But after repeated personnel cuts the past two decades the Norwegian army is down to a single brigade , and a third of it is already in Afghanistan .
“ We are almost breaking our backs trying to maintain the current level of participation , ” said Jacob Borresen , a retired rear admiral now analyzing military affairs for the Norwegian Institute for Strategic Studies .
There has been talk of sending back a small , highly decorated special forces unit that has already done several tours in Afghanistan , but government officials have discounted the idea , preferring to switch focus to civilian development efforts , as befits the land of the Nobel Peace Prize .
NYT
A solid plurality of Norwegians favors immediate withdrawal of their troops , according to a recent TNS Gallup poll , and each of the five Norwegian fatalities that have occurred since 2001 – most recently last Monday – has caused national anguish .
Norway ’s 500 infantrymen and women in Afghanistan are not available for war - zone duty , though they have been aggressive in confronting insurgents in northern Faryab Province .
According to Admiral Borresen , staying put in the north is appropriate given that American forces have “ behaved like elephants in the glass shop ” elsewhere .
Sweden
So far only two Swedes have lost their lives in Afghanistan .
But Sweden ’s role there , like Norway ’s , has grown more dangerous as the insurgency has expanded northward .
NYT
The Swedish army contingent at Mazar - i- Sharif grew from 430 to 500 people last month and might gain a few more in 2010 , according to a military spokesman .
But as a nonmember of NATO , Sweden is not formally bound to the cause .
“ I get the sense from recent firefights that the Swedes can hold their own and go toe to toe if attacked , but I ’m not sure they would go out on any search - and - destroy - type missions , ” said Tim Foxley , of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute .
“ If General McChrystal piped up and said , ‘ Please send a reinforced company south , ’ I do n’t know what the reply would be , ” he said , referring to Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the commander of the international forces .
He could always try the Danes .
Mr Ahmadinejad offered Iran 's full support to Afghanistan Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has accused the US of playing a " double game " in Afghanistan after the US used the same term to condemn Iran 's role .
Mr Ahmadinejad said the US had " created terrorists and now say they are fighting them " , as he appeared with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Kabul .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates , who is also in Kabul , has accused Iran of giving the Taliban low - level support .
Later , Mr Karzai flew to Pakistan for talks with another key neighbour .
This is Mr Ahmadinejad 's first visit to Afghanistan since both he and Mr Karzai were re-elected last year .
ANALYSIS Quentin Sommerville , BBC News , Kabul
This was a joint news conference , but it was President Ahmadinejad who did most of the talking .
At times it must have been uncomfortable listening for President Karzai .
America , his main ally in the fight against the Taliban , should leave Afghanistan for good , said the Iranian president .
Only then , would the country find peace .
It was the United States that was playing the " double game " .
This hardly sounds like grounds for compromise .
President Karzai is facing pressure from all sides .
David Miliband , the UK foreign secretary , says Mr Karzai is n't doing enough to find a political solution .
Military operations wo n't be enough to bring peace , he 's expect to say in a speech later on Wednesday .
He will say that any solution will need the full support of the country 's neighbours .
But , as President Ahmadinejad showed , those neighbours have conflicting interests , and winning that support wo n't be easy .
At a joint press conference with Mr Karzai , Mr Ahmadinejad rejected the presence of foreign military forces " as a solution for peace in Afghanistan " .
He said : " Our policy is full support for the Afghan people and Afghan government and reconstruction of Afghanistan . "
Mr Gates , who is in Afghanistan to review the progress of the current Western troop surge against the Taliban , had earlier accused Tehran of " playing a double game " of offering friendship to the Afghan government while at the same time giving " low - level support " and money to the Taliban .
The Taliban are Sunni Muslims and sworn enemies of Shia Iran , which has growing interests and influence , particularly in western parts of Afghanistan .
Mr Ahmadinejad said it was the US that was playing the " double game " .
" They themselves created terrorists and now they 're saying that they are fighting terrorists , " he said .
Mr Ahmadinejad criticised the US for its troops ' presence , saying : " Your country is located on the other side of the world , so what are you doing here ? "
Mr Ahmadinejad said that terrorism could not be defeated by armies , only by intelligence .
' Bothersome '
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul says that President Karzai said little at the joint conference , but thanked President Ahmadinejad for his support and described Iran as a realistic friend .
Mr Karzai said : " We are very hopeful that our brother nation of Iran will work with us in bringing peace and security to Afghanistan so that both our countries will be secure . "
Mr Karzai will later head to Pakistan for key talks Mr Gates , attending a base in Kabul province on Wednesday where Western troops are training Afghan soldiers , described Mr Ahmadinejad 's visit as " certainly bothersome " .
He said the US wanted Afghanistan to have good relations with its neighbours but that those neighbours must treat Afghanistan fairly .
He also said US troops might begin to leave Afghanistan before the previously stated withdrawal start date of July 2011 , depending on " conditions on the ground " .
However , he added : " We should not be too impatient .
" At the end of the day , only Afghans will be able to provide long - term security for Afghanistan . "
Mr Karzai later travelled to Pakistan , which has been accused in the past of providing a haven to the Afghan Taliban .
However , it has recently stepped up its drive to arrest Taliban leaders , including alleged second - in - command Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar .
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Islamabad says Mr Karzai will want the leaders extradited , while Pakistan will argue for more involvement in regional strategy , particularly if Western troops do start to leave Afghanistan .
Later on Wednesday , Britain 's Foreign Secretary David Miliband is expected to deliver a speech in the US , urging President Karzai to do more to find a political solution to the conflict with the Taliban .
The military effort alone will not be enough to resolve the conflict , he is expected to say , and Afghanistan 's neighbours will need to play a central role in securing peace in the country .

Lol , I remember when my siblings played this at Meez when it was still up , then I started playing it after them .
Too bad that website was down last year ... R.I.P...
David Frum * has been fired by the American Enterprise Institute ; one has to assume that this is a response to his outspokenness about the Republican failure on health reform .
In discussing the Frum firing , Bruce Bartlett asserts that AEI has muzzled its health - care experts , because the truth is that they agree with a lot of what Obama is proposing .
I find this quite believable ; back in 2003 Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation , which is supposedly harder - right than AEI , proposed a health care reform consisting of … drumroll … an individual mandate coupled with subsidies to make insurance affordable .
In short , Obamacare .
I was struck , by the way , by Butler ’s recommendation that we
Provide support to people to obtain health care based on their need , not where they happen to work , or their eligibility for welfare , or their military record , or their age .
From each according to his ability , to each according to his need ?
* I ’m informed , by family members , that Frum is a distant cousin of yours truly .

Spy chips hidden in 2.5 MILLION dustbins : 60 pc rise in electronic bugs as council snoopers plan pay - as - you - throw tax
The growing threat of a stealth tax on the rubbish we throw away was exposed by startling figures yesterday .
More than 2.5 million homes now have wheelie bins fitted with microchips to weigh their contents .
This is an increase of nearly two - thirds in just a year .
The bins , which can be electronically identified and weighed , are designed for ' pay - as - you - throw ' rubbish tax schemes .
Stealth tax : 2,629,052 homes have now been given bins with chips
Under such schemes - which are likely to be hugely unpopular - families who put out more waste will pay higher taxes to their local council .
Disclosure of the rapid spread of chipped bins followed the announcement this week of the first council to bring in a bin tax .
Bristol City is presenting its scheme as a reward for recyclers , with cash payments to homes that leave out less rubbish .
The spread of chipped bins marks the revival of a tax idea that the Government appeared to have abandoned last year .
Gordon Brown promised to ditch bin taxes in the spring of 2008 , at a point when the unpopularity among voters of fortnightly collections , strict bin rules , and the threat of pay - as - you - throw was at its height .
In January last year , ministers acknowledged that not one council had applied to test pay - as - you - throw schemes .
But yesterday , research by the Big Brother Watch campaign group showed that the use of chipped bins has quietly spread over the past year .
In March 2009 , a survey based on Freedom of Information inquiries showed there were 42 councils which used bins with microchips .
But the latest check , also based on FOI requests , put the number of authorities with electronic bins at 68 - one in five of all those that collect household rubbish .
According to the responses from town halls , 2,629,052 homes have now been given bins with chips .
Alex Deane of Big Brother Watch , said : ' The number of local councils placing microchips in bins is increasing , despite the fact that only one of them has volunteered to trial the Government 's pay - as - you - throw scheme .
' Councils are waiting until the public are n't watching to begin surveillance on our waste habits , intruding into people 's private lives and introducing punitive taxes on what we throw away .
The British public does n't want this technology , these fines , or this intrusion .
' If local authorities have no intention to monitor our waste then they should end the surreptitious installation of these bin microchips . '
The campaign group complained that the bins allow councils to examine household rubbish and sell the information to commercial concerns as well as to impose taxes .
It also warned that collection of data from chipped bins could show when households were on holiday , opening the way to abuse by criminals .
The Local Government Association said that microchips were only put in bins to improve services to the public , for example by helping the elderly .
A spokesman said : ' Microchips simply identify the house to which a bin belongs , they do not mean councils can analyse what people are throwing away or issue fines .
' Putting microchips in people 's bins can allow councils to provide people with a better service that costs less .
' If an elderly resident needs help getting their bin collected and returned , a microchip quickly flags it up to the refuse collector , saving time and money . '
However , using a microchip to identify a bin means that technology on a dustcart can then weigh it and the information can be used to prepare a tax bill .
Tories said they believed there were even more than 2.6 million homes equipped with microchipped bins , numbers of which have been notoriously hard to track in recent years .
Tory local government spokesman Caroline Spelman said : ' Labour Ministers are secretly planning to roll out bin taxes across the country after the election if Gordon Brown can cling to power .
' The Government have already forced through bin tax laws and have been funding the bin technology to collect the taxes . '
A spokesman for the Department of Environment , Food and Rural Affairs said : ' There are no Government plans to introduce microchips in bins .
' Any use of microchips is a local authority decision - some councils use them to monitor levels of waste .
This is not about spying on people or fining them . '
However , in 2008 nearly 100 councils ran investigations into the contents of their residents ' bins , in some cases to check on what rubbish they dump and in others to try to obtain information on their incomes and lifestyles .

After decades of transporting thousands of people around the globe , aircraft that are too old or too expensive come to an airfield in Gloucestershire to be scrapped .
There are several such specialist breakers around the world , but Air Salvage International ( ASI ) , based at Cotswold Airport in Kemble , is the largest in Britain and claims to be the busiest of them all .
Mark Gregory who founded ASI , explains how they go about recycling a plane .

As I mentioned before , I playtested the hell out of SpyParty at GDC this year .
I tried to take pictures of everybody playing , while simultaneously taking copious notes , as one should while people are playing your game .
Since I ’m doing the depth first design methodology , the game required a fair bit of explaining to get people up and running , but after that , everybody got into the rhythm .
First up , my old friends Mike Mika and Chris Charla .
I had added a bunch of features in on the runup to GDC , including adding console controller support to the Sniper so it could be played without needing room for a mouse , and I needed to make sure I did n’t break anything before setting it up at a big party on Tuesday night , so I had Mike and Chris over to the hotel room to pretest .
Mike and Chris have known each other forever , and so they know each other ’s game play styles pretty well .
Mike used this knowledge to his advantage when he decided to just stand around talking , while loudly flicking the camera joystick ( which does n’t move the Spy ) in time with another AI moving .
Chris took the bait and shot the civilian .
Hard core metagaming !
I really need to figure out how to get this level of in - the - same - room metagaming going across the net .
After this , Mike tweeted :
Just played ten rounds of Spy Party at GDC !
This is te best game I ’ve played in a LONG time .
Hecker is pulling it off .
5:55 PM Mar 9th
While Chris tweeted :
Just play tested Chris Hecker ’s SpyParty !
Even better the second time .
Finally wasted @mikejmika .
5:53 PM Mar 9th
Yay !
Okay , so I did n’t bust anything , now it ’s off to the party …
Tuesday night there was a private party with a bunch of awesome indie game developers in attendance , and a back room where people were setting up their games .
After working out the power situation , I set up both laptops and off we went .
In general , the game worked perfectly in this loud social environment , with the exception of the Contact Double Agent mission , which has an audio tell .
Oh well , advantage : Spy !
I think I ’m going to add a party mode where the audio tells have a visual message associated with them so you can play in a loud environment without losing any information , and also it will work as an accessibility feature for deaf people .
One great thing about the game is the Sniper side scales arbitrarily with the number of people spectating , so a lot of people can watch and help the Sniper find the Spy .
This counteracted the lack of audio for the Sniper to some extent .
By the way , you ’ll notice #numbers in some of the captions .
I did n’t catch everybody ’s name , so please post in the comments if you know who one of the mystery indies is !
The next night was the IndieCade party , and I figured it worked so well the previous night , why not set it up again ?
We closed the place down ; people played for hours .
Now back to the hotel room for more playtesting !
That ’s it for the developer pictures .
I have a bunch of photos of press playing , and I ’ll post those soon .
Do n’t forget to help me figure out who the mystery playtesters are by posting in the comments or sending me email .
Oh , and if you ’re in one of the pictures and do n’t want it to be public here , let me know and I ’ll take it down immediately .
Thanks !

ATAX : Price $ 199.95 ( w/ video )
DVD only : $ 14.95 Available : Soon Exclusively from Hoods Woods Pat. applied for .
The following photos were taken from the actual ATAX training film .
They will give you a basic idea of how this powerful tool is used !
( Incidentally , the video was filmed with a prototype .
The final design is seen above .
Everything functions in an identical manner to the video )
Sling shot rubbers can be attached to the tool so it can be used to launch arrows !
Here Hood draws the arrow launcher .
You can just see the arrow leaving the tool .
It is great for getting small game and will launch any small shaft accurately enough for hunting .
The arrow is barely visible just above the fence post in the distance !
You supply your own slingshot rubbers .
The back of the tool finds use as a hammer and pounds in a nail .
What goes in must come out !
It will also remove nails .
Here you can see the head of the nail in the rangefinder / wrench slot .
ZIP !
and the nail is out ... too fast for the camera to see ....
Add a piece of wire or a string and you have an accurate inclinometer good for judging angles and for estimating avalanche dangers .
You can even get a rough approximation of your latitude from this tool Just sight along the top of the blade and read the angle from the graphic .
In the video we show you how to estimate the height of a tree or other object with the ATAX .
Once you know how to use the inclinometer you will find many other uses for it .
below the hammer you will find a wire buster .
Fence wire , barbwire and more can be bent and busted with this unique tool .
You can also use it to grip hot bails on your coffee pot ...
Save those fingers !
SO you have a multitool ... not much good if you want to loosen a screw and it has a nut !
Here 's the answer .
The ATAX can grip the nuts and save you from going nuts !
A close up of the ATAX Nut gripper :>)
The " ULU " edge on the knife makes a super skinning tool .
In fact that was one of the most important features we designed into the tool .
One quick swipe and the skin parts so you can get at the goodies .
The rounded edge lets you slip into tight places to cut tissue without slicing holes in the skin .
It holds an edge like a razor .
When we were developing this tool , all of the local outfitters begged us to borrow our prototypes .
Now they own the real thing .
There goes the skin ...
Just like it had a zipper .
The rangefinder is simplicity itself to learn to use .
It is plenty accurate for bow hunting and great for hunters .
One of the unique features of the tool is the divot used as both a fire bow bearing and a leveler for direction finding .
The fire drill fits into the almost frictionless bearing .
The SHEATHED tool is held against the knee .
Pressure is put onto the top of the drill through the tool ... and the firebow is put to work .
It IS work but it 's great fun to learn this primitive technique .
Do n't know how to do it ?

One of the Woodsmaster series and we show you all of the steps in making and using a Bow drill .
The ATAX hangs easily on your belt and never gets in the way like big choppers can .
You can ride horseback , cycles , 4 - wheelers or just hike and it never restricts your movement ...
It 's just a little bigger than the back pocket on your jeans but it chops and cuts like a sword .
The Heavy duty Kydex sheath is reversible for left or right hand use .
The unusual design of the sheath allows for a " Quick draw " while still keeping the blade secured during periods of heavy activity .
There 's more than one way to hold the ATAX .
The handle is a nice starting point but for finer carving and shaving this grip works great too .
Each person will find many ways to hold the tool .
The video identifies all of the parts of the tool so you know what we are talking about at all times .
Here we look at the survival kit .
Incidentally , the survival kit chamber in the handle measures 2.25 " X .75 " X .25 " deep .
We keep talking about that divot ... let 's see some more ...
Here you can see the graphic and divot working as a compass / clock .
With a twig and a few drops of water you can tell directions and time of day .
North is at the bottom of the photo and it is about 4 pm Standard time ...
That 's just the beginning of what you can do with the graphic !
Laser engraving helps you to determine lots of information about your environment .
The included video tape instructs you in the use of this unique graphic .
It was in the afternoon when this shot was taken .
Can you tell how we know that ?
What time is it ?
The indicator stick can be any old stick or even a nail you cut for the purpose .
Hey !
What time is it ?
in this case you have to remember to add one hour for Daylight Savings time .
In the woods ... who cares ?
One of the prime uses for the tool is as an AX .
That 's what put the AX in ATAX .
Here we show how to bind the tool to a split stick for use as a chopper .
You do n't even need to get fancy .
Just a flexible forked limb can make the tool into a functional and reliable chopper .
Chopping down branches for shelter or other uses is a cinch with the ATAX AX .
Here we execute a branch .
Karen likes to prep chickens with the ATAX .
Even they lose their heads over this tool :>)
Yep ...
One FINE tool .
You 'll be seeing much more of this tool in the future .
But why wait to SEE it ...
Buy one while we have some in stock !
Tactical applications :
The ATAX has some clear practical applications as a tactical self defense tool .
We will be covering these in the future .
Several military units as well as advanced martial artists are developing tactical information relating to this tool .
For our purposes however ...
If you can " Flail " with your arms ... imagine what would happen to the sorry sucker that tries to attack you if you have one of these on hand ....
End of story .
We only had 100 of these made initially and we sold out almost immediately .
We then sold the next batch of 100 in record time .
If you would like one of these tools , please notify us so we can reserve one in your name now .

Allow Me to Introduce Myself
I ’m Bob Parsons .
You may know me from my GoDaddy days .
What you may not know is that I ’m also a Marine , an entrepreneur , an investor , an American business leader , and a philanthropist .
One more thing about me , I have a point of view – and I do n’t mind expressing it .
WASHINGTON — Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s State Department is spending $ 5.4 million to buy fine crystal stemware for American embassies — but it wo n’t give the US economy much of a boost .
The contract was given to a tiny Washington , DC , interior designer , which in turn subcontracted the crystal work to a Swedish firm — snubbing such US companies as the famous manufacturer in Clinton ’s own back yard , Steuben Crystal of upstate Corning .
The firm did n’t even get a chance to bid on the contract , which will outfit embassies and ambassadors ’ residences with fancy crystal for ritzy functions .
Ironically , under the no-bid contract , some of the crystal is to be custom - crafted to include the seal of the United States , although Swedes will do all of the manufacturing .
Contracting rules require any American firms that subcontract work to use a domestic firm or get a waiver .
The firm that got the contract , Systems Design Inc. , is a small interior - design firm in tony Georgetown .
The company , which is eligible for minority small - business contracts , does not appear to have done any similar work .
After getting the contract in September , the firm subcontracted to Swedish glassmaker Orrefors / Kosta Boda USA .
Department spokesman Darby Holladay said Systems Design could n’t find a domestic producer who could meet the 100 percent lead - free requirement , although a Steuben spokesman said it does manufacture lead - free crystal .

Spanish police have arrested three men accused of masterminding one of the biggest computer crimes to date -- infecting more than 13 million PCs with a virus that stole credit card numbers and other data .
The men were suspected of running the Mariposa botnet , named after the Spanish word for butterfly , Spain 's Civil Guard said on Tuesday .
A press conference to give more details is scheduled for Wednesday .
Mariposa had infected machines in 190 countries in homes , government agencies , schools , more than half of the world 's 1,000 largest companies and at least 40 big financial institutions , according to two Internet security firms that helped Spanish officials crack the ring .
It was so nasty , we thought ' We have to turn this off .
We have to cut off the head , ' said Chris Davis , CEO of Defense Intelligence Inc , which discovered the virus last year .
The security firms -- Defense Intelligence Inc. of Canada and Panda Security S.L. of Spain -- did not say how much money the hackers had stolen from their victims before the ring was shut down on December 23 .
Security experts said the cost of removing malicious program from 13 million machines could run into tens of millions of dollars .
Mariposa was programed to secretly take control of infected machines , recruiting them as slaves in an army known as a botnet .
It would steal login credentials and record every key stroke on an infected computer and send the data to a command and control center , where the ringleaders stored it .
Basically they were going after anything that would make them money , Davis said .
Mariposa initially spread by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Corp 's Internet Explorer Web browser .
It also contaminated machines by infecting USB memory sticks and by sending out tainted links using Microsoft 's MSN instant messaging software , he said .
A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company did not immediately have any comment .
The suspected ringleader , nicknamed Netkairo and hamlet1917 , was arrested last month , as were two alleged partners , Ostiator and Johnyloleante , according to Panda Security .
Panda Security Senior Research Advisor Pedro Bustamante said that one of the three was caught with 800,000 personal credentials when Spanish police arrested him .
In addition to collecting data , the three men rented out millions of enslaved machines to other hackers , according to Bustamante .
The Mariposa botnet is one of many such networks , the bulk of which are controlled by syndicates that authorities believe are based in eastern Europe , southeast Asia , China and Latin America .
While authorities sometimes succeed in shutting them down , they rarely catch the criminals behind the networks .
Mariposa 's the biggest ever to be shut down , but this is only the tip of the iceberg .
These things come up constantly , said Mark Rasch , former head of the U.S. Department of Justice computer crimes unit .
He said he suspects there were more than three people behind Mariposa , and that any ringleaders who were not arrested could soon put the network back online .

I tripped across a provocative headline in the Wall Street Journal the other day : “ They Need to be Liberated from Their God . ”
Turns out the story was about Mosab Hassan Yousef and his spying on Hamas .
Which was a little disappointing .
There ’s no doubt that Palestinian Muslims need to be liberated from their god , but given the recent explosion in documented attacks by US Christians on their fellow Americans ( as well as on reason and basic common sense ) , I thought perhaps the WSJ was going to be the first mainstream “ news ” outlet to do a story on Jesus Gone Wild !
I keep a running tab of stories that strike my interest .
Taken individually , each might suggest a particular narrow social pathology , which is to be expected in a nation of 300 million .
But over time they accumulate into a gestalt , with all the small pictures adding up to a disturbing big picture .

Item : Pope warns against witchcraft in Angola
( AFP ) – Mar 21 , 2009 LUANDA ( AFP ) — Pope Benedict XVI issued a warning against witchcraft Saturday during his visit to Angola , after calling on African leaders to battle corruption and drawing a tough line against abortion .
Item : Pope in Africa reaffirms “ no condoms ” against AIDS
YAOUNDE , March 17 ( Reuters ) – Pope Benedict on Tuesday reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church ’s opposition to the use of condoms in the fight against AIDS as he started a visit to Africa , where more than 25 million people have died from the disease in recent decades .
…
“ It ( AIDS ) cannot be overcome by the distribution of condoms .
On the contrary , they increase the problem , ” he said in response to a question about the Church ’s widely contested position against the use of condoms .
The disease has killed more than 25 million people since the early 1980s , mostly in sub-Saharan Africa , and some 22.5 million Africans are living with HIV .
Item : Rape row sparks excommunications
By Gary Duffy
BBC News , Sao Paulo A Brazilian archbishop says all those who helped a child rape victim secure an abortion are to be excommunicated from the Catholic Church .
The girl , aged nine , who lives in the north - eastern state of Pernambuco , became pregnant with twins .
It is alleged that she had been sexually assaulted over a number of years by her stepfather .
The excommunication applies to the child ’s mother and the doctors involved in the procedure .
The pregnancy was terminated on Wednesday .
Abortion is only permitted in Brazil in cases of rape and where the mother ’s life is at risk and doctors say the girl ’s case met both these conditions .
Police believe that the girl at the centre of the case had been sexually abused by her step - father since she was six years old .
Item : Did the Mormons baptize Obama ’s mother , after her death , without his knowledge or consent ?
A : Yes , they did .
A reader contacted me last week , saying that last year , in the heat of the presidential campaign , the Mormons had posthumously baptized Barack Obama ’s mother , Stanley Ann Dunham .
Baptizing the dead of other faiths , secretly and without the consent of their families , is a common Mormon practice .
For the past fifteen years the Mormons have caused quite a stir by forcibly baptizing Jewish Holocaust victims – in other words , converting them to Mormonism – despite strong objections from the Jewish community .
Thus , it ’s hardly a stretch to imagine the Mormons ’ doing this to Obama ’s mother .
Still , I had no proof .
Then yesterday , I received a document .
It ’s allegedly a screen capture of the registration - only section of the Mormon - run Web site , FamilySearch.org .
In that screen capture , excerpted above , is clearly the name and correct date of birth and death of Barack Obama ’s mother ( Stanley Ann Dunham , born 29 Nov 1942 in Kansas , died 07 Nov 1995 ) and the date of her alleged post - death baptism by the Mormons .
Item : Catholic schools bans child whose parents are gay
Last week , a standing policy of the Archdiocese of Denver denied a child from enrolling in the Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School for kindergarten next year because the student ’s parents are lesbians .
Currently the student is in the school ’s preschool program and will be allowed to finish the year , according to Jeanette DeMelo , a spokeswoman for the archdiocese .
“ It ’s clear if they only accept students with perfect parents , they would have almost nobody , ” said Beth Osnes , an organizer for the protest .
“ I know they have the right to , but why would they want to ? ”
Inside the church , the Rev. Bill Breslin addressed the issue in his sermon .
He also posted his comments on his blog .
“ If a child of gay parents comes to our school , and we teach that gay marriage is against the will of God , then the child will think that we are saying their parents are bad , ” Breslin said on his blog .
“ We do n’t want to put any child in that tough position . ”
Please note : this is happening in the People ’s Republic of Freakin ’ Boulder !
That ’s some big picture , huh ?
It ’s gotten so bad that even former president Jimmy Carter , a man as responsible as any for introducing the poison of evangelical influence into the mainstream of modern politics , has had enough .
Of course , you live here .
You read the news .
That a lot of Christians are out of control is n’t a real revelation , is it ?
But lately , the goddamned Catholic Church has been making an unusually immoral and anti-Constitutional nuisance of itself .
For instance :
Still , we ’re talking about their facilities and they ’re paying the bills , and they have the right to control their operations the way they see fit , no ?
Well , maybe , maybe not .
Ignoring the wishes of the patient , especially when those wishes are legally expressed in something like a living will , that ’s pretty appalling , but I guess you could make the argument .
Even if you won that argument , though , get a load of the latest shenanigans from our friendly Catholic Bishops , who have now offered their “ help ” in wrangling an outcome in the Senate .
You know , because that would make democracy better and stuff .
The Roman Catholic bishops signaled Thursday that if agreement is reached with House leaders on anti-abortion language , the church would work to get the votes needed to protect the provisions in the Senate — and thereby advance the shared goal with Democrats of health care reform .
“ We would strongly urge everyone , Democratic and Republican , to vote to waive the point of order , ” Richard Doerflinger , an associate director of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , told POLITICO .
“ Whether it would be enough to get to 60 votes , I ca n’t predict .
We would certainly try . ”
“ I think it ’s something we should explore , ” said Rep. Dale Kildee ( D - Mich . ) , a longtime opponent of abortion .
“ It could be something that could carry out the bishops ’ objective . ”
And why not ?
The Bishops have “ helped ” before , after all .
In November , the bishops drove a tough bargain , winning an amendment by Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) that would severely restrict the ability of even private companies to provide abortion coverage under new state insurance exchanges .
That House deal — since weakened by the Senate — is what the bishops want to revive now as part of Obama ’s final push on health care .
But to survive the Senate , any revisions would need 60 votes to overcome points of order under the expedited reconciliation procedures being contemplated .
David Dayen observes , astutely enough , that “ the Catholic bishops want to show a measure of dominance over the US government . ”
His nuanced look at the tactical knife fight of this particular backroom liturgical drama is helpful to those trying to understand how sausage law gets made .
Meanwhile , those of us out here beyond the Beltway can perhaps be forgiven for saying “ wait a sec – back the truck up . ”
An organized cabal of Roman Catholic aparatchiks are so far up Congress ’s ass that they ’re openly discussing how they ’re going to inject Vatican dogma into a US health care bill ?
Excuse me ?
The Constitution is clear that what you believe is your business , and I have no problem with that .
But when your beliefs inspire actions that hurt the innocent , that systematically victimize those who believe other things , then I start to care .
When those beliefs fuel actions that harm me and impinge on my freedoms , well , that ’s the point where it becomes self - defense , is n’t it ?

A gang of heavily armed men stormed a party inside a house in the border city of Ciudad Juárez killing 13 teenagers in the early hours of yesterday morning .
A ­further 17 young people were injured in the attack , which was apparently a mistaken drugs hit .
The gunmen arrived in a convoy of up to seven 4x4s , according to local reports .
While some gunmen closed off surrounding streets , others burst into the party and started shooting to kill .
There were conflicting reports as to whether the victims were celebrating victory in a local American Football championship , or had gathered to watch a boxing match .
It was unclear last night as to why they were targeted , but it was immediately assumed the attack was by one of the drug trafficking gangs struggling for supremacy in the city .
" The men were well - armed .
They went into the house and shot at everyone , you could hear the gunfire all around , " a neighbour said .
Army spokesman Enrique Torres said the dead were from 15 to 20 years old , and an additional 17 party - goers were wounded , some critically .
" They were about 15 men , they closed off the surrounding streets and began shooting at the house as they moved inside , " he said .
Witnesses of the slaughter told the Associated Press they thought those behind the attack were acting on false information .
" It must have been a huge mistake , " said Martha Lujan , who lives nearby .
Ciudad Juárez is just across the US border from El Paso in Texas , and is the bloodiest front in the turf wars raging around Mexico , which intensified following a government offensive launched three years ago .
More than 16,000 have died since in related violence .
Last year , more than 2,000 people were killed in Juárez , about a third of the national total .
The city has also had Mexico 's heaviest military presence , with 10,000 soldiers patrolling the streets for most of last year .
Last month the government announced it was reducing the number of soldiers present and increasing the number of federal police officers in the city .
The killing has continued regardless .
Most victims in Juárez die in ones or twos , often small - time dealers associated with one gang and killed by a rival gang .
But the ­arbitrariness of much of the ­violence has been underlined by a growing number of deaths with no apparent link to the ­underworld .
There have also been periodic massacres , such as two attacks on drug rehabilitation clinics in September last year which left 28 dead .
Another witness to yesterday 's massacre , who only gave his first name , Hector , because he feared retaliation , said he was just outside when the gunfire broke out .
He said the party was an innocuous gathering of friends targeted in error .
" I think there was some confusion , " he said .
" We 're seeking justice . "
The ongoing drug feuds in Juárez are said to be caused by the Sinaloa cartel trying to out - muscle the Juárez cartel at one of the most important points for smuggling drugs into the US .
In the 1990s , the Juárez cartel was the most powerful trafficker , but in recent years its influence has waned .
The Sinaloa cartel is led by Mexico 's most infamous trafficker of the moment , Joaquin El Chapo Guzman .
In other drug violence elsewhere yesterday , 20 gunmen attacked a police station in the Pacific port city of Lázaro Cárdenas with grenades and assault rifles , killing a police officer and a mother and her son who were in the building to pay a fine .
Further north , in the city of Navolato , the bodies of three women and two men were found in their vehicle , which was riddled with bulletholes .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The arguments against pornography are many , ranging from insistence that porn degrades women and is morally reprehensible to the assertion that pornography viewing is the cause of sex crimes .
However , over the years , there have been numerous studies done on this subject .
And , reports
The Scientist , it appears that there are links between sex crimes and pornography .
Just not the sort of links many of us might have expected .
Instead of causing sex crimes , porn might actually contribute to reducing their incidence .
Here is what The Scientist reports on the matter :
Over the years , many scientists have investigated the link between pornography ( considered legal under the First Amendment in the United States unless judged “ obscene ” ) and sex crimes and attitudes towards women .
And in every region investigated , researchers have found that as pornography has increased in availability , sex crimes have either decreased or not increased .
While that is far from a ringing endorsement , it does at least seem to indicate that pornography is n't contributing to sex crimes .
While some naysayers may point out that most offenders in prison have been exposed to porn , the fact of the matter is that nearly every male -- and a good number of females -- is exposed to pornography at some point .
It stands to reason that most offenders have viewed porn .
But other studies found that being punished for porn use might contribute to someone becoming a rapist , and not the porn use itself .
Indeed , continues
The Scientist , a repressive religious upbringing might be more of a factor in rape than porn :
Looking closer , Michael Goldstein and Harold Kant found that rapists were more likely than nonrapists in the prison population to have been punished for looking at pornography while a youngster , while other research has shown that incarcerated nonrapists had seen more pornography , and seen it at an earlier age , than rapists .
What does correlate highly with sex offense is a strict , repressive religious upbringing .
Richard Green too has reported that both rapists and child molesters use less pornography than a control group of “ normal ” males .
This sort of assertion is bound to raise a few eyebrows and even cause a little controversy .
Especially when taken alongside studies that seem to indicate that porn does n't result in feelings of misogyny .
Additionally , while there is anecdotal evidence that porn users are abusive toward their female partners , there is no evidence that pornography use is the cause of these actions .
Perhaps there are other factors , such as alcoholism or violent tendencies , that are bigger influences .
In any case , while such studies do not prove that porn is actively good for society , they do seem to imply that pornography is n't actively bad for us .

HSBC Group Chair Stephen Green recently sat down with German magazine Der Spiegel and talked about the future of the world 's economy , the moral responsibility of bankers , and his Christain faith ( he 's an Anglican minister ) .
It 's one of the more honest accounts we 've read of the crisis from the perspective of a banking chief .
Among other things , he calls the period leading up to the crash -- characterized by huge profits through the sale of overly complex instruments -- ' disgraceful ' .
Der Spiegel :
SPIEGEL : Is the crisis already over ?
Green :
In the financial sector the worst is behind us .
But the real economy will feel the effects for a long time to come .
SPIEGEL : In other words , people and governments are now paying the price for the damage the bankers have done .
Green :
And they will be paying off these mountains of debt for a few years to come .
Unemployment will continue to rise in many countries .
SPIEGEL : Many countries are deeply in debt .
Even Dubai can hardly pay its bills anymore .
How bad is this situation for the HSBC and other banks ?
Green :
We have been in Dubai since 1946 .
In fact , we were the first bank to do business there .
The country will retain its status as a regional financial center .
Dubai is not Lehman ( Brothers , the financial services firm that filed for the largest bankruptcy in US history in September 2008 , sparking a financial crisis ) .
The country has far too many assets in the form of natural resources .
It has accumulated a lot of debt but it is manageable .

Yet predictions of America ’s decline are vastly overstated .
Asia is indeed increasing its economic footprint in the world , but it still lags far behind the United States in military might , political and diplomatic influence , and even most measures of economic stability .
Asia ’s growth , the source of its current strength , also has significant limits - rising inequality , disastrous demographics , and growing unrest that could scupper development .
Nationalism in Asia will prevent the region from developing into a European Union - like unified area for the foreseeable future , allowing regional conflicts to continue , and preventing Asia from speaking , more powerfully , with a unified voice .
Over the past two years , some of the most important foreign policy thinkers have chronicled America ’s decline , and argued that Asia is rising to preeminence .
Parag Khanna ’s “ The Second World : Empires and Influence in the New Global Order ” landed on the cover of The New York Times Magazine , while Fareed Zakaria ’s “ The Post - American World ” became a bestseller .
Meanwhile , the influential former Singaporean ambassador Kishore Mahbubani , who helped spark the “ Asian values ” debate of the 1990s , released “ The New Asian Hemisphere : The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East . ” Martin Jacques , a prominent columnist for The Guardian , took the idea one step further .
In his book “ When China Rules the World , ” he contends that China ’s rise will have a greater impact on the globe than the emergence of the United States as an international power in the 20th century .
More than any recent American president , Obama displayed deep deference to his Asian counterparts .
He did so , in part , because , like many Americans , he has become convinced that this will be Asia ’s century , and that the United States must begin to accommodate itself to this stark new geopolitical fact .
A recent report by the US National Intelligence Council concluded that the world is witnessing the rise of “ major global players similar to the advent of a united Germany in the 19th century and a powerful United States in the early 20th century ... [ and they ] will transform the geopolitical landscape . ”
Major media outlets covered the president as if he was some kind of Dickensian vagrant , appealing to his increasingly powerful creditors in China for leniency .
“ Obama ’s trip reveals a relationship with a strangely lopsided quality to it , ” wrote longtime China specialist Jonathan Fenby , in one typical example of the coverage .
During his trip to Asia in November , Barack Obama seemed strangely mute .
Unlike Bill Clinton , who criticized China ’s human rights record in front of then - president Jiang Zemin , Obama largely avoided the topic of rights .
In Singapore , despite pressure from human rights activists , the president deferred to pressure to not release a statement calling for the freeing of Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi .
In Japan , the president worked valiantly to massage local sentiments , bowing deeply to Emperor Akihito - and drawing flak back in the United States from conservative critics for appearing weak .
At the recent Copenhagen climate summit , two of Asia ’s most powerful leaders , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , showed this newfound confidence .
Meeting in a back room , they pointedly tried to exclude Obama from their negotiations .
Obama ultimately had to burst into the closed - meeting like a kind of diplomatic party crasher .
But now China has assumed the mantle .
Next year , China will become the world ’s second - largest economy , according to a study by the China Policy Institute of the University of Nottingham .
The global financial crisis has badly dented the Western model of liberal capitalism , leaving Asia as the world ’s growth engine , and main banker - China alone holds some $ 800 billion in American treasury securities .
The chief economist of the Asian Development Bank , a regional organization , declared in September , “ Developing Asia is poised to lead the recovery from the worldwide slowdown . ”
China and India likely will grow by more than 7 percent this year , compared to minimal growth in the West , and other leading Asian nations , like Indonesia and Vietnam , are also predicted to post high growth rates in 2010 .
The idea of American power giving way to a rising Asia has been building for two decades .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , many in the United States predicted that Japan , which then seemed to have a hyper - charged economy , would rule the world .
But Japan ’s economy , built on a real estate bubble , imploded , and Japanese leaders never truly matched their economic power with political might ; limited by a pacifist constitution , Japan did not fight in the first Gulf War and wound up merely paying the check for much of the battle .
Conversely , if it is not to be Asia ’s century , Washington ’s strategy would be radically different .
No concessions of fading glory :
Though the United States might not be the only superpower , it could assume that , for the near future , it would remain the preeminent power , allowing Washington to dictate the terms of everything from climate change negotiations to global talks on nuclear weapons .
The future of American power is a vital question .
America ’s foreign policy choices will be directed by judgments about the United States ’ staying power , and how the United States , like Britain before it , should adapt to new powers emerging on the scene .
If , as Jacques argues , America ’s influence will naturally fade while Asia ’s grows , Washington should adopt policies similar to Britain ’s in the mid-20th century - ceding influence over large portions of the world while working to ensure that it remains an important player on a few key issues .
American leaders would have to radically shift their style , adopting a new humility while selling the US public on a diminished global role , a major comedown for a superpower .
Looming political unrest also threatens Asia ’s rise .
China alone already faces some 90,000 annual “ mass incidents , ” the name given by Chinese security forces to protests , and this number is likely to grow as income inequality soars and environmental problems add more stresses to society .
India , too , faces severe threats .
The Naxalites , Maoists operating mostly in eastern India who attack large landowners , businesses , police , and other local officials , have caused the death of at least 800 people last year alone , and have destabilized large portions of eastern India .
Other Asian states , too , face looming unrest , from the ongoing insurgency in southern Thailand to the rising racial and religious conflicts in Malaysia .
Yet there are many good reasons to think that Asia ’s rise may turn out to be an illusion .
Asia ’s growth has built - in stumbling blocks .
Demographics , for one .
Because of its
One Child policy , China ’s population is aging rapidly : According to one comprehensive study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank , by 2040 China will have at least 400 million elderly , most of whom will have no retirement pensions .
This aging poses a severe challenge , since China may not have enough working - age people to support its elderly .
In other words , says CSIS , China will grow old before it grows rich , a disastrous combination .
Other Asian powers also are aging rapidly - Japan ’s population likely will fall from around 130 million today to 90 million in 2055 - or , due to traditional preferences for male children , have a dangerous sex imbalance in which there are far more men than women .
This is a scenario likely to destabilize a country , since , at other periods in history when many men could not marry , the unmarried hordes turned to crime or political violence .
The belief in Asia ’s rise has sparked this mini-industry of books on the Eastern renaissance .
In the most apocalyptic of the bunch , such as Jacques ’ , the authors focus on how Asia ’s powers , from China to Malaysia to Singapore , are taking the final step from rising power to global hegemon - using state - directed economic policies to dominate industry after industry , while delivering what Mahbubani calls “ modernity ” - good governance , growth , and the rule of law , without the messiness of Western liberal democracy .
In fact , Mahbubani suggests that this “ modernity ” ultimately may be more appealing than Western democracy , which has not helped produce growth in Africa , Latin America , or many other democratic regions .
Other authors , like Zakaria , focus more on American decline .
Asia ’s new swagger has caused a crisis of confidence in the West that makes the fear of Japan in the late 1980s look like a mild tremor .
In the late 1980s it was only one Asian giant growing powerful , and at that time Europe , newly united after communism , looked boldly to the future .
Today many of Asia ’s nations are getting stronger , and not one major Western nation can be confident about its future growth .
Also , despite predictions that Asia will eventually integrate , building a European Union - like organization , the region actually seems to be coming apart .
Asia has not tamed the menace of nationalism , which Europe and North America largely have put in the past , albeit after two bloody world wars .
Even as China and India have cooperated on climate change , on many other issues they are at each other ’s throats .
Over the past year , both countries have fortified their common border in the Himalayas , claiming overlapping pieces of territory .
Meanwhile , Japan is constantly seeking ways to blunt Chinese military power .
People in many Asian nations have extremely negative views of their neighbors - even though they maintain positive images of the United States .
More broadly , few Asian leaders have any idea what values , ideas , or histories should hold Asia together .
“ The argument of an Asian century is fundamentally flawed in that Asia is a Western concept , one that is not widely agreed upon [ in Asia ] , ” says Devin Stewart , a Japan specialist at the Carnegie Council for Ethics and International Affairs .
Even as Asia ’s miracle seems , on closer inspection , less miraculous , America ’s decline has been vastly overstated .
To become a global superpower requires economic , political , and military might , and on the last two counts , the United States remains leagues ahead of any Asian rival .
Despite boosting defense budgets by 20 percent annually , Asian powers like India , China , or Indonesia will not rival the US military for decades , if ever - only the Pentagon could launch a war in a place like Afghanistan , so far from its homeland .
When a tsunami struck South and Southeast Asia five years ago , the region ’s nations , including Indonesia , Thailand , and India , had to rely on the US Navy to coordinate relief efforts .
America also has other advantages that will be nearly impossible to remove .
With Asian nations still squabbling amongst themselves , many look to the United States as a neutral power broker , a role America plays around the world .
German writer and scholar Joseph Joffe calls the United States today the “ default power ” :
No one in the world trusts anyone else to play the global hegemon , so it still falls to Washington .
Torfi Frans Ólafsson is Senior Producer at CCP Games , the makers of EVE Online .
He was kind enough to say a few words about the upcoming Tyrannis expansion , which features the development and control of entire planets .
Ten Ton Hammer : Can players really get into planetary interaction on the their first day of playing EVE , given all the right advantages ?
Torfi : Players will finally get access to and be capable of meddling in the affairs of entire planets .
The pilots were unhappy with just roaming the skies and controlling the universe from above .
So now they are interested in the trillions of people that live on these planets , and the riches on them that will provide a lot of opportunity and adventure .

We designed the game so that pretty much everyone who plays EVE can have a meaningful experience with the planets .
We really want to get people into interacting with planets early .
We want to allow them to have some sort of meaningful interaction on them .
Although , you will need to be a fairly experienced player to fully utilize their potential .
TTH : Since there is not going to be any way to dislodge players from the planets that they have started governing , unless it is by their own mis-governance , are planets going to be assigned on a first come , first served basis ?
Torfi : No .
The actual mechanics of how many people can occupy a planet have n't been ironed out , yet .
But the general idea is that it is not a land grab .
You can build infrastructure and interact with almost every planet in the game , regardless of whether someone has something there , already .
The problem is that the planets are going to have limited resources .
So if too many people are harvesting a planet at the same time , there will be diminishing returns .
So what you will find is that it will be much more enriching to travel to the more remote planets in the more remote systems , for planets which have n't got infrastructure built up , yet .
But of course that takes you away from the key trade hubs to which you want to deliver your manufacturables .
We are taking a lot of the things from building systems in the past and we are trying to use the best practices from what we have learned , and to avoid some of the mistakes in terms of implementing industry and markets and handing out slots .
In the past in EVE , there are a lot of systems like that .
So the general idea is that everybody can play EVE , every player can do stuff on any planet , and the more people that use a particular planet , the less valuable it is for that particular player .
And of course there are over 65,000 planets in the game .
And you can interact with each and every one of them .
Including those that are in wormhole space , which can actually be quite challenging .
TTH : I 'm guessing that different planets have different resources and that the harder a planet is to get to , the more rare its resources will be .
Torfi : Of course .
And they are all wildly different , which is exciting .
We 're making really interesting manufacturing and resource trees here , right now .
Going over ' what materials are you extracting from gas giants , what are you getting from planets which are pretty much just molten magma .
You will actually be able to put down facilities , arcologies , and cloud cities , or really tough units that you can place on very hostile worlds , to extract and manufacture from them .
And then rocket the stuff off of them , or move it out with a space elevator .
In general , of course , with more risk comes more reward .
TTH : Right , right .
Will there be a new set of skills that players will need to master ?
Torfi : Yes .
Absolutely .
Your ability to master a planet , to manufacture , build up , and manage it , will be bound by skills .
But again , the barrier of entry is really low .
We want people to get in on and get a feel for this feature early .
And also , I should mention that the planetary interaction should not be thought about as a feature to replace any action that is already going on in EVE , today .
It 's more augmenting and re-experiencing EVE .
It does n't require you to sit and grind .
You go and you build up infrastructure , but then you set up some manufacturing cycles and infrastructure , and that interacts while you are playing the game .
Then you can go back to it and make sure that everything is going well .
Lube the machines , so to speak .
And collect stuff from them to sell to someone else , or pick it up .
But in general you can actually be playing and profiting from planetary interaction while doing all of the other interesting things that you can do in EVE .
TTH : So does the core conflict that is being introduced in Tyrannis revolve more around the transport of these materials , and not so much on the planets themselves ?
Torfi : From a PvP perspective , in planetary interaction the conflict is more like too many people hogging the same resource .
It should be said , though , that with Dust 514 , all of that is going to change .
We 're not saying that your installation in high - sec is going to get blown to smithereens the day DUST hits the market , but for low - sec and zero-sec , DUST 514 will definitely play a part of allowing you to mess up other peoples ' infrastructure and have interesting gameplay connecting the planets and mercenaries down on the planets in a very meaningful way .
A way that is yet to be revealed , of course .
TTH : There 's been some talk on the forums about planetary interaction replacing NPC - seeded products on the market .
The materials like skillbooks and so forth that players are n't producing , but that show up on the market anyway .
Can you quash those rumors ?
style= " margin : 10 px ; border - collapse : collapse ; float : right ; width : 300 px ; " border= " 0 " >

style= " border : 0 px solid ; width : 300 px ; " />
Torfi : No , I can't .
Because that 's what we really want to do .
But we are probably not going to change all that overnight .
One of our goals with planetary interaction is to phase out these NPC created commodities , because we want to put the power into the hands of the players and make EVE even more sandbox -y than it is .
There are elements of EVE which we feel can use some iteration based on the experiences that we have learned , running EVE for seven years .
The NPC market is definitely one of them .
It 's been with us for a long time .
It has n't changed much .
We want to take these commodities and move them into the hands of the players .
We are not giving out publicly yet which commodities these are .
Even once we put it on the public test server , you will not be able to see what these final commodities are going to be .
TTH : On planets that lend themselves to habitation , will you be able to not only harvest resources and make commodities , but also tax the inhabitants ?
Torfi :
We 're not expecting to be able to go that much into population control , in this expansion .
This iteration is more about scanning for great deposits , mining them , building up infrastructure to refine them , and manufacturing stuff out of them on the surface of the planets .
Then launching it into space to be used by players .
TTH : Is all this effort at creating infrastructure on planets effectively creating the maps that we are going to see in DUST 514 at a later time ?
Is that something that you can talk about ?
Torfi : Not directly .
DUST 514 mercenaries will be having battles at some of the installations which are represented in planetary interaction .
But because we are eventually giving you access to all of the planets , which is a really broad spectrum of types of worlds , with different gravities and atmospheres , no atmosphere , surfaces which are just pure plasma , etc . .
You 're not going to be having DUST matches in all of those .
But you 're still going to be deploying infrastructure onto these worlds .
TTH : As far as player interaction with these planets , you mentioned that you 'll be creating the infrastructure and then coming back to pick up the materials that are harvested .
Are there other aspects to this ?
Like will you have to worry about sabotage or any other kind of variable , like dust storms or other problems occurring on these planets ?
Torfi :
It 's too soon to tell .
The thing is that we have a backlog of features that we really want to get in there .
So it 's too soon for us to commit to a few of these .
So I can't really tell whether a thing might make it or not , yet .
TTH : As far as your success with controlling a planet or part of a planet , how much of that is going to rely on controlling the space in the solar system around the planet ?
Like as part of a corporation or alliance ?
Torfi :
In 0.0 systems , we are expecting you to need sovereignty over that system for your infrastructure to function on a planet .
So that you can't have your enemy using or being in your garden , so to speak , or using your planets despite you having sovereignty over it .
Taking sovereignty really disrupts industry and messes things up .
The gameplay in high - sec will generally be more cooperative .
The goal is that people will actually be working together on the planets , benefitting from each other .
One player will not be able to serve in all roles , or specialize in all roles in the entire manufacturing and mining sector .
TTH : Will the planets have some manufacturing and research possibilities that are currently done on stations ?
Torfi :
They wo n't have the same , no .
We are not going to be competing with the industry , research and manufacturing on the stations .
And they 're not going to be competing with mining .
We are not replacing any of these game systems .
They will be a separate ecosystem , so to speak .
TTH : How will the first day of Tyrannis play out ?
You mentioned that it would n't be a land grab .
Torfi :
Well it will have people flying all over space , deploying satellites and scanning for resources .
Also launching command centers and building infrastructure .
And also starting to train the skills needed for it , of course .
Some discoveries will be made , too .
Some people will definitely be striking it rich by discovering huge deposits of valuable minerals in remote locations , and trying to keep these a secret for as long as they can .
TTH : So it will take some time to set up control and dominance over these planets and resources .
Torfi : Yes , absolutely .
TTH : Thank you so much for taking some of our questions .
I 'm sure the audience can't wait to hear more .
Torfi : Yes , thank you .
Of course , the feature is in development and we 're going to be blogging about it , as well as posting on our forums and and talking about it , as it evolves .
And we 're putting out an experimental alpha version of it on our test server .
Which will , of course , not totally reflect the final product .
But I think you will find it interesting to actually watch how it works .
TTH : Any timeline on this ?
I know you said it was a summer expansion .
Torfi :
The goal is to have it out on the test server in little more than a week .
It 's going to be very embryonic .
It 's funny , because it 's a recurring debate : we choose to put our stuff out really early , onto a test server , even if the UI is n't finished , the core experience is n't finished , and the pipeline is n't finished .
Both to get player feedback , and also just to get people hammering on it to see what it can take .
Some of us would prefer not to release anything until launch day , but we feel that it 's better to get as many eyes on the feature as possible , and as many fingers clicking the buttons as possible , as soon as possible .
But often it 's confused or mistaken for a beta or for the real thing .
What they 're watching is just active software development .
TTH : It 's been exciting to watch how you guys have involved the community with the direction of the game .
Torfi :
Thanks .
It 's really exciting for us , as well , because the community continues to surprise and amaze us , and we of course would be nothing without it .
TTH : Very cool .
Thank you so much , Torfi .
It 's been a pleasure talking to you , as always .
Good luck , and we hope to talk to you again , soon , as development progresses .

Manned torpedoes and suicide craft , used by the Imperial Japanese Navy in the final stages of World War II
This article is about the suicide torpedo .
For other uses , see Kaiten ( disambiguation )
Type of Human torpedo
Kaiten ( 回天 , literal translation : " Turn the Heaven " , commonly rendered as " turn of the Heaven 's will " , " the heaven shaker " [ 1 ] ) were manned torpedoes and suicide craft , used by the Imperial Japanese Navy in the final stages of World War II .
History [ edit ]
In recognition of the unfavorable progress of the war , towards the end of 1943 the Japanese high command considered suggestions for various suicide craft .
These were initially rejected , but later deemed necessary .
[ 2 ]
Various suicide mission vehicles were developed in the Japanese Special Attack Units .
For the Navy , this meant Kamikaze planes , Shinyo suicide boats , Kaiten submarines , and Fukuryu suicide divers or human mines .
The Kamikazes were somewhat successful , and the second most successful were the Kaitens . [ 3 ]
Research on the first Kaiten began in February 1944 , followed on 25 July of the same year by the first prototype .
By 1 August , an order for 100 units had been placed . [ 4 ]
Development [ edit ]
The very first Kaiten was nothing much more than a Type 93 torpedo engine compartment attached to a cylinder that would become the pilot 's compartment with trimming ballast in place of the warhead and other electronics and hydraulics .
The torpedo's pneumatic gyroscope was replaced by an electric model , and controls were installed which gave the pilot full control of the weapon .
The original designers and testers of this new weapon were Lieutenant Hiroshi Kuroki and Lieutenant Sekio Nishina .
They both died at the controls of Kaiten , Lieutenant Kuroki in a very early training prototype . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
In total six models of Kaiten were designed , Types 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 were based on the Type 93 torpedo .
Type 10 was the only model based on the Type 92 torpedo .
Types 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 10 were only manufactured as prototypes and never used in combat . [ 2 ]
Early designs allowed the pilot to escape after the final acceleration towards the target .
There is no record of any pilot attempting to escape or intending to do so , and this provision was dropped from later Kaiten , so that , once inside , the pilot could not unlock the hatches .
The Kaiten was fitted with a self - destruct control , intended for use if an attack failed or the impact fuze failed . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
Pilots [ edit ]
The island of Otsushima , in the Inland Sea , was used as a training site .
It was equipped with cranes , torpedo testing pits , and launch ramps , and had a large shallow bay for test running and firing .
The Kaiten Memorial Museum is now situated there .
Kaiten pilots were all men aged between 17 and 28 . [ 11 ]
Initial training consisted of sailing fast surface boats by periscope and instrument readings alone .
When a pilot had advanced past this basic training , he would begin training on Kaitens .
Training craft were fitted with a dummy warhead that contained telemetry equipment and an emergency blowing tank that could return the craft to the surface should the trainee dive to a dangerous depth .
Kaiten training started with basic circular runs to and from a fixed landmark at a reduced speed ; the training advanced to faster and more hazardous runs around rocks and through channels in deeper waters .
The more difficult runs required the pilot to surface and check the periscope repeatedly , and required conscientious adjusting of trim tank levels because of the reducing weight as oxygen was used up .
When the instructors were confident about a pilot 's abilities , they would advance the pilot to open water training against target ships .
Training at this level was often done at full attack speed , and either at night or in twilight .
The final phase of training would be a submarine launch and more open water attack runs on target ships . [ 2] [ 12 ]
Training was dangerous , and 15 men died in accidents , most commonly collisions with the target vessels .
Although the warheads were only dummies , the impact at ramming speed was enough to both cripple the Kaiten and severely injure the pilot . [ 13 ]
In action , the Kaiten was always operated by one man , but the larger training models ( Types 2 , 4 , and 5 ) could carry two or even four .
Kaiten pilots who were leaving for their final missions would leave testaments and messages behind for their loved ones . [ 14 ]
Deployment [ edit ]
Map of known Kaiten base locations at the end of World War II
Kaiten
Type 1 being trial - launched from the light cruiser Kitakami being trial - launched from the light cruiser
Kaiten were designed to be launched from the deck of a submarine or surface ship , or from coastal installations as a coastal defence weapon .
The cruiser Kitakami was equipped to launch Kaiten and took part in sea launch trials of Type 1s . [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
In addition , several destroyers of the Matsu class were also adapted to launch the weapon . [ 17 ]
In practice , only the Type 1 craft , using the submarine delivery method , were ever used in combat .
Specially equipped submarines carried two to six Kaiten , depending on their class .
The Kaiten were lashed to the host vessel on wooden blocks with a narrow access tube connecting the submarine to the lower hatch of the Kaiten .
This allowed the Kaiten crew to enter from the host submarine while submerged .
Kaiten had a very limited diving depth , which in turn limited the diving depth of the host submarine .
This is one of several factors blamed for the very poor survival rate of submarines using them , eight submarines being lost for the sinking of only two enemy ships and damage to several others .
Once the target was acquired and the host submarine was within range the pilot was briefed , the Kaiten 's starting air bottles were charged and the cockpit was ventilated .
The pilot then entered the vessel , the gyroscope was programmed with the correct bearing and depth and the pilot was given his final briefing .
The Kaiten separated from the host submarine and headed at speed in the direction fed into the gyroscope .
Once within final attack range the Kaiten would surface and the pilot would check his range and bearing via periscope and make any adjustments necessary .
He would then submerge to a suitable depth , arm the warhead and proceed on his final attack run .
If he missed he could make adjustments and try again .
If the mission failed he would detonate his vessel as a last resort . [ 2 ]
Types [ edit ]
Of the six different type classes created , only four were ever significant enough to be noted by the American technical missions to post - war Japan .
Type 1 [ edit ]
Only the Type 1 , a one - man model with a 1,550 kg ( 3,420 lb ) warhead , was used operationally .
Over 300 were built , more than 100 of which were sent on suicide missions . [ 2] [ 18 ]
General arrangement [ edit ]
Schematic of a Kaiten type 1
The Type 93 torpedo formed the majority of this model of Kaiten with the only alterations being the warhead yield being increased from 490 kg ( 1,080 lb ) and the control planes enlarged and altered to allow both gyroscope and pilot control .
Between the torpedo warhead and the engine section is the torpedo compressed air flask , 6 ( or 8 in later models ) steering air bottles and the forward trim tank , followed by the control area and the pilot 's seat .
In later models the 5.5 l ( 9.7 imp pt ) Tetrachloromethane starting air bottle is located in the cockpit and a further smaller trimming tank is supplied for use at initial launch .
The engine section is slotted in above the aft trim tank with the joint protected by a sheet metal cowl .
The pilot 's compartment was entered from below through the lower hatch , which was mated to the host submarine .
There was a small hand - operated periscope with a vertical range of about 70 cm , controls to arm and detonate the weapon if the attack failed and steering , velocity and depth controls .
Batteries to power the 20,000 rpm gyroscope were located under the pilot 's seat .
The air was filtered by sodium peroxide stored in the pilot 's compartment .
The Type 6 Kaiten was a Type 1 with a modified forward air tank .
Performance [ edit ]
After initial trials in water , it was decided to have a maximum surface cruising speed and , for technical reasons , a minimum running speed at any depth of 9.5 km/h ( 5.1 kn ) and a submerged running trim of 1 – 3° nose - down .
During development and use several problems were encountered ; the most pressing were major water leaks into the pilot 's chamber during transport and deep diving , and explosions caused by ingress of water into the torpedo engine .
These were never fully eliminated during the weapon 's active service .

Type 2 [ edit ]
In late 1944 , Type 2 prototypes were tested in dry - dock and in controlled submerged conditions ; however , they never met a standard satisfactory for open water running . [ 2] [ 18 ]
General arrangement [ edit ]
Schematic of a Kaiten type 2
The Type 2 was fueled by diesel fuel oxidized by the product of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine hydrate catalyzed by potassium cuprocyanide ; water was also used as a diluent in the combustion cycle .
The engine was a custom design specifically created to satisfy the requirements of the Kaiten .
It was of a U8 configuration and was in the aft compartment of the vessel .
This compartment was open to the sea , with seawater used as coolant .
The complete operation of the engine had to be simple for a pilot who was already under immense stress , so it was designed to be controlled by a single lever .
The general construction of the Type 2 is substantially different than that of the Type 1 .
In the forward part of the vessel is the warhead , followed by the fuel , trimming and 2 steering air tanks .
The forward part of the midsection is occupied by the 2,600 l ( 570 imp gal ) hydrogen peroxide chamber .
This cylindrical tank required a complicated construction of welding five ribs evenly spaced around the circumference , then coating the inside of the tank with tin , then asphalt and finally with a thick tin plating .
Construction of each tank took on average 2 weeks and the skill required was very high .
Behind the peroxide chamber is the pilot 's compartment .
This is much more complex with more controls than that of the Type 1 .
From fore to aft controls available to the pilot are : depth control gear , trim tank controls , electric switches , gyroscope , rudder control , engine control lever , gauges for various applications , warhead safety gear , engine starter , fuel flow control , and lights with their respective switches .
In the aft quarter of the vessel is found the battery for the gyroscope and other electronics , the aft trim tanks and 2 hydrazine hydrate containers .
These containers are made of steel lined with a rubber bag to prevent sea water ( used to force the hydrazine hydrate to the engine ) and the hydrazine hydrate from coming into contact with each other .
Immediately behind these tanks is an auxiliary water tank , then the engine compartment .
The engine compartment is always completely filled with sea-water , so it only has mechanical components .
Immediately after the midsection is the generator , the engine , the reduction gears , and finally the propeller and control planes .
Performance [ edit ]
The Type 2 had several improvements over the Type 1 .
It could stay relatively reliably on course with no pilot input and could withstand depths twice as deep as those of the Type 1 .
Many problems were encountered in the design and engineering of the Type 2 , mostly relating to the engine .
In initial tests , water pressure caused deformation and seizing of the engine ; although strengthening was added , the problem was never fully resolved .
Once the engine was installed in a prototype Type 2 , it was unable to reach the required power rating and this , along with the complexity of the manufacturing process of the Type 2 itself , led to the abandonment of the project .

Type 4 [ edit ]
[ 2] [ 18 ]
In early 1945 , concerned with the slow pace of development and the unreliability of the supply of hydrogen peroxide , the Japanese admiralty decided to pursue another line of Kaiten development .
Engineers responsible for Kaiten development were opposed to any new work and wished to continue their efforts on development and production of the Type 1 .
In all about fifty Type 4 prototypes were made , however they never went into full - scale production and were ultimately abandoned .
General arrangement [ edit ]
Schematic of a Kaiten type 4
The Type 4 was an attempt to modify the Kaiten Type 2 , to be fueled by the same kerosene and oxygen combination as the Type 93 , Model 3 torpedo .
The dimensions , equipment and engine were all identical to the Type 2 although the arrangement differed in several key areas .
The warhead is identical to the Type 2 , although some later models had an access cover at the aft end of the warhead .
The forward end of the forward section contains the air vessels , there are four in this section , one Type 93 torpedo air vessel flanked either side by 2 small trim tanks on the keel and three smaller vessels directly above it .
The vessels are held in place simply with wood packing .
The smaller air vessels are a proprietary design that took some heavy research to perfect .
They are sealed by the pressure of the gas , as the pressure rises , a slackly threaded cap presses up against a sealing ring which is screwed down with another cap , thus making an airtight seal .
Directly aft of the air vessels is the fuel tank which is ringed by the main forward trim tanks .
The fuel tank is lightly constructed and contains baffles to prevent sloshing .
Just behind this are the 4 steering air bottles .
The pilot 's space is identical to that of the Type 2 ( minus hydrogen peroxide specific circuit controls ) .
Immediately behind the pilot are three more of the smaller oxygen cylinders however in some models these are omitted and chairs are placed for training purposes .
Between the bulkheads joining this section with the engine section are two Type 93 generators , feeding the same Type 6 engine as in the Type 2 Kaiten .
The Type 5 Kaiten was a Type 4 with a modified forward air vessel .
Performance [ edit ]
The first unmanned test runs of the Type 4 at cruising speed were made in early 1945 , and it was noted that oxygen efficiency was very low .
The same problem occurred in the first test run with a pilot , with sensor readings indicating a large percentage of unburned oxygen in the exhaust gasses .
The weapon made little progress in development and never exceeded a speed of 40 km/h in open sea trials ; this combined with untraceable leaks in the engine and the consequent inefficiency of the propulsion system led to this design being filed as a failure and its eventual abandonment .
The fact that by now the Kaiten Type 1 was in mass production was also a factor in the cancellation of the Type 4 .

Type 10 [ edit ]
[ 2] [ 18 ]
The abandonment of the Types 2 , 4 and their intermediaries , development of higher capacity batteries , abundance of Type 92 torpedoes and the ever - increasing urgency to be able to defend the Japanese mainland led to a change of methodology for the Kaiten design teams .
The Type 10 was the result .
It was essentially a Type 92 electric torpedo with a pilot chamber in - between the warhead and drive unit .
Over 500 units were ordered to be produced between August and October 1945 , however , only around 6 ( including prototypes ) were ever completed .
General arrangement [ edit ]
Schematic of a Kaiten type 10
The Type 10 is significantly smaller than the Type 1 and consequently has a much smaller warhead of 300 kg ( 660 lb ) .
The forward section of the weapon contains the warhead and the manual electric fuze , but no contact detonator unlike other kaiten types .
The midsection contains the first set of Type 92 batteries as well as a steering air bottle strapped to the underneath of the weapon .
The pilot 's compartment contains firing , starting and gyroscope starting switches as well as a fixed periscope that could only be rotated but not raised or lowered , the rudder control , trim gauge and a sodium peroxide tin for air purification .
The latter part of the weapon contained the remainder of the batteries and a small external steering air bottle .
The control planes are identical to the Type 92 torpedo's other than having a manually operated rudder fitted .
Unlike all previous Kaitens the Type 10 only had an upper hatch , so it could not be entered from within a host submarine .
This reflects the design and operation purpose of the weapon as a land - launched coastal defense weapon .
Performance [ edit ]
On paper this model had several advantages over the previous types .
Firstly it was very simple to construct and maintain .
Because it had no pilot controls other than to start and steer it was not complicated to train pilots to use it .
It was powered by electricity and consequently had no issue of weight reduction as the fuel was used up , a problem that had caused headaches for test pilots and combat pilots of all previous models .
Unlike other models the engine of the Type 10 could be stopped and even reversed , although this would be of little practical value in a combat situation .
Finally , it was very light and small , so it was easily transported to different bases of operation should the need arise . [ 21 ]
In practice however , the Type 10 proved to be troublesome .
Water leaks into the battery compartments and pilot 's compartment were commonly reported by test pilots .
It was also very cramped and uncomfortable for the pilot .
The war ended before development could really iron out these problems so the type never went into mass production .
Deployment plans [ edit ]
The Type 10 was designed and intended as a coastal defense weapon to counter the expected invasion of the Japanese mainland by Allied troops .
On 16 July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Naval command ordered the construction of over 500 Type 10s to be stationed and readied for launch from several existing and new kaiten bases .
Details available in the Deployment section above . [ 21 ]

Effectiveness [ edit ]
USS Mississinewa , victim of a kaiten attack on 20 November 1944
When compared with the Type 93 torpedo which was surface - vessel–launched , Kaiten had the obvious advantages of having a pilot to guide the weapon , and of being launched from a submerged submarine .
Despite these advantages , however , they were not nearly as effective on a one - for - one basis as the highly successful Type 93 torpedo on which they were based .
United States sources claim that the only sinkings achieved by Kaiten attacks were the fleet oiler USS Mississinewa anchored at Ulithi on 20 November 1944 , with the loss of 63 men ; [ 23 ] a small infantry landing craft ( LCI - 600 ) , with the loss of three men ; [ 24 ] and the destroyer escort USS Underhill while operating northeast of Cape Engaño on 24 July 1945 , with the loss of 113 men . [ 25 ]
Contrary to the above , some Japanese sources give much larger numbers of Kaiten successes .
Reasons given for this discrepancy are the fact that the submarine launching the Kaiten could only estimate success by listening for the detonation of their weapons , also that the size of the explosion after the attack on USS Mississinewa gave the impression of a much larger number of ships sunk .
American losses credited to Kaiten attacks came to a total of 187 officers and men .
The losses of Kaiten crews and support staff were much higher .
In total 106 Kaiten pilots lost their lives ( including 15 killed in training accidents and two suicides after the war ) .
In addition to the pilots , 846 men died when eight Japanese submarines carrying Kaiten were sunk , and 156 maintenance and support personnel were also killed . [ 26 ]
This contrasts markedly with the relative success by kill - ratio of the Kamikaze pilots . [ 27 ]
Deployments [ edit ]
First [ edit ]
The Kikusui group ( 菊水隊 ) of kaitens was launched against hostile vessels near Ulithi on 20 November 1944 .
The group consisted of two submarines , I - 47 and I - 36 , carrying a total of eight Kaiten .
This mission gave the Kaiten their first sinking , USS Mississinewa ( AO - 59 ) , but at the cost of all eight Kaiten pilots .
The first Kaiten launched from I - 47 was piloted by Sekio Nishina , one of the original designers of the weapon .
He carried with him the ashes of the other creator , Hiroshi Kuroki , who died in a training accident very early in the Kaiten 's development . [ 28 ] [ 29 ]
At the same time , submarine I - 37 was sighted and engaged by US ships off of Leyte Island .
The boat , together with her Kaiten , was sunk by hedgehog attack from the destroyers USS Conklin and USS McCoy Reynolds , resulting in the loss of 117 officers and men . [ 26 ]
Second [ edit ]
The Kongō group ( 金剛隊 ) of Kaiten operation was undertaken on 9 January 1945 against the U.S. anchorage at Hollandia , Ulithi , Manus and Kossol Roads .
I - 47 launched a further four Kaiten but only succeeded in damaging the Liberty ship SS Pontus H. Ross . [ 28 ] [ 30 ]
At Ulithi I - 48 was sunk by USS Conklin .
None of the 122 men aboard survived . [ 26 ]
I - 36 engaged US ships with Kaiten at Ulithi on 12 January 1945 .
One was destroyed by depth charges from VPB - 21 but the others succeeded in damaging USS Mazama ( with eight fatalities ) and sinking an infantry landing craft ( USS LCI ( L ) - 600 ) ( with three deaths ) . [ 24 ]
I - 53 succeeded in launching her four Kaitens , but only two traveled any distance and none reached their targets .
I - 58 launched all four Kaiten , of which one exploded immediately after launch .
Sometime after deployment , pillars of smoke were seen in the distance along their general bearing .
I - 56 failed to even reach the launching areas for her Kaitens and returned home without firing a single shot . [ 29 ] [ 31 ]
Third [ edit ]
The Chihaya group ( 千早隊 ) departed on 20 February 1945 for Iwo Jima .
I - 44 was sighted and hunted for over two days underwater ; crew compartment carbon dioxide saturation reached 6 % before she managed to escape .
I -368 was detected and attacked by a Grumman TBF Avenger on approaching Iwo Jima on 26 February and was sunk by Mark 24 Mines with the loss of all 85 hands . [ 26 ]
I -370 was detected and attacked by USS Finnegan on 26 February .
After an initial hedgehog and depth charge run a final depth charge run was commenced and shortly after small explosions and bubbles were observed .
I - 370 was lost with all 84 officers and men aboard as well as all Kaitens and pilots . [ 26 ] [ 29 ]
Fourth [ edit ]
The Shimbu group ( 神武隊 ) was originally intended to supplement the previous attacks on Iwo Jima and launched on 1 March 1945 .
I - 58 and I - 36 were within a day of reaching Iwo Jima when they were recalled for a new operation .
Both returned home safely . [ 29 ]
Fifth [ edit ]
The Tatara group ( 多々良隊 ) consisted of I - 44 , I - 47 , I - 56 and I - 58 and was to attack the US anchorage at Okinawa .
It sailed on 28 March 1945 .
On 29 March I - 47 was attacked by a squadron of Grumman TBF Avengers and forced to dive .
She was pursued for several hours until she had to surface .
On surfacing she was hit by shrapnel which damaged the periscope and fuel tanks .
She was forced to limp home for repairs . [ 28 ]
I - 56 was detected on approaching Okinawa and hunted by the light carrier USS Bataan and destroyers USS Heermann , USS Uhlmann , USS Collett , USS McCord and USS Mertz .
Heavy depth charging by aircraft from the carrier and the latter three destroyers sank her with all 122 hands on board . [ 26 ]
I - 58 was hounded by aircraft and anti-submarine fire and arrived at her destination late .
She returned without engaging the enemy .
I - 44 's location and actions are unknown for the entirety of the mission .
A submarine likely to be I - 44 was attacked in the vicinity of Okinawa on 29 April by an aircraft from USS Tulagi .
The submarine was hit first by a depth charge and finally by a Mark 24 mine .
All 129 hands were lost . [ 29 ]
Sixth [ edit ]
The Tembu group ( 天武隊 ) consisted of I - 47 and I - 36 .
They were to attack cargo and troop ships between Ulithi and Okinawa .
I - 47 sailed on 20 April and I - 36 on 22 April .
On 27 April I - 36 attempted to attack a convoy of 28 US ships with Kaiten , but with no results .
Two of the Kaiten could not be launched .
While cruising east of Okinawa I - 36 sighted a supply vessel sailing unescorted .
The commander attempted to launch Kaiten but failed , and a torpedo attack also failed when the torpedoes detonated prematurely .
On 2 May I - 47 launched two Kaiten against two US ships , and explosions were heard an hour later , after which I - 47 launched one Kaiten at an escort vessel .
Later research indicates none of the Kaiten launched were successful and the explosions heard were probably from Kaiten pilots self - destructing or anti-submarine action . [ 26 ] [ 29 ]
Seventh [ edit ]
The Shimbu group ( 振武隊 ) consisted solely of I - 367 and sailed on 5 May 1945 for north - west Saipan .
She was damaged by a mine on 6 May and was unable to continue her mission until 17 May .
On 27 May I -367 sighted a four - ship logistics support convoy and launched two Kaiten .
At least one was destroyed by gunfire from USS Sioux .
The other Kaiten carried suffered mechanical failures and were unable to be launched .
I - 367 returned to base safely . [ 29 ]
Eighth [ edit ]
The Todoroki group ( 轟隊 ) of Kaiten - equipped submarines sailed on 24 May to patrol east of Guam .
I - 36 sighted a lone oil tanker on 22 June and opened an attack with her Kaiten , which both failed , and four conventional torpedoes , which exploded early damaging USS Endymion , a landing craft repair ship .
On 28 June I - 36 launched a single Kaiten against USS Antares , which the Antares sank with shellfire and called in a nearby destroyer , the USS Sproston .
After the destroyer arrived and began depth charging , the submarine managed to launch one of the faulty Kaiten .
Although the pilot failed to hit the destroyer , his actions helped the host submarine slip away .
Further ships later arrived to hunt I - 36 , but she managed to escape with only a minor leak in the forward torpedo room and a damaged rudder .
She would not see any further action in the war , and surrendered to the Allies after the official surrender was announced . [ 32 ]
On 16 June the US submarine USS Devilfish fired two torpedoes at the I - 165 , both of which missed .
On 27 June , a patrolling Lockheed Ventura sighted I - 165 and dropped three Mark 47 depth charges which sank her with her crew of 106 . [ 26 ]
I -361 was detected by a minesweeper on 26 May , which alerted the aircraft carrier USS Anzio to search for the submarine .
Five days later a patrolling Grumman TBF
Avenger detected her and launched a volley of rocket fire , following up with a Mark 24 mine as the boat dived , the explosion of which was felt by the crew of USS Oliver Mitchell 30 km ( 16 nmi ) away .
The crew of 81 were all lost . [ 26 ]
On 28 May I - 363 sighted several ships but was unable to get close enough to launch Kaiten .
On 15 June a convoy was attacked with conventional torpedoes because Kaiten could not be launched due to heavy weather .
I - 363 returned to base safely . [ 29 ]
Ninth [ edit ]
The Tamon group ( 多聞隊 ) was the last Kaiten - equipped group to go into combat .
It was a large force consisting of I - 47 , I - 53 , I - 58 , I - 363 , I - 366 and I -367 .
They departed on 14 July headed for an area south - east of Okinawa .
I - 363 and I - 367 engaged in no further action before the announcement of unconditional surrender and an end to all hostilities .
The I - 47 launched a Kaiten at a lone merchant on 21 July , but without result .
She saw no further action . [ 29 ]
Sinking of USS Underhill [ edit ]
Underhill ( DE - 682 ) USS ( DE - 682 )
Arguably the most successful attack by Kaiten was that on USS Underhill commenced on 24 July 1945 .
She was a unit of the numerous Buckley class destroyer escort and at the time of sinking was escorting several supply and troop ships .
Subsequent to being spotted by a Japanese naval reconnaissance plane ; submarine I - 53 attached to the Tamon group and carrying six Kaiten was redirected to the expected location of the convoy .
The submarine launched a decoy mine ahead of the convoy 's position causing the convoy to shift bearing to avoid the mine .
This , however , was just diversionary and the mine was a dummy .
USS Underhill after realising this noticed several sonar contacts , which were later revealed to be a Japanese submarine and several Kaiten .
A depth charge run was made which did not succeed in killing the submarine although it is suspected that it did succeed in neutralizing one of the Kaiten .
The depth charge run was followed by a ramming attempt on a submarine at periscope depth .
As the Underhill rammed the surfaced vessel ( later revealed to be a Kaiten ) it was struck by a second Kaiten waiting in ambush .
Both pilots detonated their charges , one of which led to the detonation of the destroyer 's boilers , which led to her being torn in half by the explosions .
The sinking resulted in the loss of almost half of her complement , including most of the officers .
One of the attacking Kaiten also attempted an attack on a cargo vessel , LST - 991 , but for some reason passed under the ship 's keel .
This may have been the same Kaiten which successfully rammed and sank the Underhill . [ 25 ] [ 33 ]
Yutaka Yokota , a Kaiten pilot whose three missions were canceled due to mechanical failure , and who wrote a memoir of his kaiten experiences , [ 34 ] witnessed the attack on the Underhill .
Following the successful attack on the Underhill , I - 53 launched a further Kaiten at an unnamed vessel 6 days later .
The attack was unsuccessful .
On 3 August I - 53 was detected by USS Earl V. Johnson and the destroyer began a series of unsuccessful Hedgehog attacks .
I - 53 launched two Kaitens separated by 30 minutes , explosions were heard , and it was confirmed that the destroyer was damaged in the attack .
She escaped pursuit and returned home .
I - 58 was patrolling the Guam - Leyte route on 28 July when she was forced to dive by an aircraft .
A tanker and a destroyer , USS Lowry were sighted and the commander decided to attack .
Two Kaiten were launched , one of which was sunk by gunfire and the other by ramming , damaging the destroyer slightly in the process .
A day later , I - 58 sighted USS Indianapolis and the commander , Mochitsura Hashimoto ordered two Kaiten prepared for attack .
Once in firing range the commander realised it would be a waste of a Kaiten to attack such an easy target , and instead launched a spread of six Type 95 torpedoes , three of which hit , causing the cruiser to sink rapidly .
On 9 August I - 58 came across a convoy led by USS Salamaua and readied three of her Kaitens to attack , of which only one could be launched .
This was followed by another rapidly prepared , and both made for USS Johnnie Hutchins .
Although one narrowly missed the destroyer , both were destroyed by gunfire and depthcharging .
The convoy searched for other submarines , but I - 58 escaped .
On 12 August a Kaiten was launched against USS Oak Hill and her escort USS Thomas F. Nickel .
The Kaiten passed under the destroyer , then surfaced and self - detonated .
A second object was spotted by the destroyer and depth charges were launched , after which an explosion occurred .
Whether this was a Kaiten is unknown , as all six of I - 58 's weapons were accounted for , but with two failures , perhaps one was repaired and launched later . [ 35 ]
On 11 August I - 366 attacked a convoy north of Palau .
The commander attempted to launch all of the Kaiten , but two failed , and the ones that were launched did n't score a hit or even explode .
Less than a week later , Japan surrendered and all submarines were ordered home , and I - 366 saw no further action .
Tenth [ edit ]
The Shinshū group ( 神州隊 ) consisting solely of I - 159 , sailed on 16 August 1945 to attack Soviet convoys in the Sea of Japan .
The mission was cancelled by headquarters before any action and I - 159 returned with all of her Kaiten on 18 August 1945 .
Kaiten carriers [ edit ]
Japanese naval vessels adapted to carry Kaiten were :
Submarine I - 47 as Kikusui group on 8 November 1944
Submarine I - 56 as Kongō group on 21 December 1944
Submarine I - 47 as Kongō group on 25 December 1944

I was laid off from my job in May of last year .
I was not fired by some anonymous , Ryan Bingham - type .
I was laid off by my boss , a very good man who was being forced to lay me off for the third time .
I worked at a small business .
Sometimes , my boss could afford to bring me on full time .
Sometimes , he had to let me go .
The third time I was fired , I could see in my boss ’ eyes that having to lay off the same people over and over again was beginning to take an emotional toll .
And it was becoming clear to him , and to me , that the process hiring full - time employees was on the verge of becoming extinct in modern America .
For the average business , taking on a new employee full time amounts to a cost of roughly double what that employee is paid in yearly salary .
With payroll taxes and health insurance and overhead and headhunting expenses , there are a lot of costs to hiring people outside of just the wage you pay them .
And those are expenses that many businesses are now choosing , or being forced to choose , to forgo .
I ’ve interviewed plenty since being laid off , and most every place I ’ve interviewed does n’t have an actual job to fill .
These are spec interviews .
If they like you , they maybe bring you on for freelance work down the pike .
That ’s about it , and you have little choice but to go with it .
More and more Americans are being forced to eke out a career this way now : doing contract work in bits and pieces wherever and whenever they can , paying their own self - employment tax and buying health care on their own .
Variety magazine just fired their movie critic of 31 years , Todd McCarthy .
They plan to bring on freelancers instead .
All of the work , none of the overhead .
We are now a freelance economy .
It ’s not terribly easy to cobble together a decent living this way ( and even when you do make decent money freelancing , you still feel like an unemployed person ) , and health care expenses make it all the more difficult .
In fact , it ’s easily the biggest worry I have as a freelancer trying to support a family of four on my own .
The process of just buying health care and filling out the necessary paperwork is enough to make you want to tear your hair out .
As someone with a history of back problems , I ’ve also been rejected by one provider .
If it ’s ever happened to you , you know what an awesome feeling that is .
There is a great deal of debate over how the new health care bill approved by Congress yesterday will affect the cost of health care .
Conservatives will tell you it will go up from its already exorbitant levels .
Liberals will tell you the series of excise taxes , increased client rolls , and new competition will help to lower rates .
I am nowhere near well - versed enough politically to argue either side of that case convincingly .
All I know is this : Yesterday , when this bill passed , I exhaled just ever so slightly .
As one of the millions of Americans working without a net , the idea that A ) Insurers can’t turn my family down , and B ) Insurers can’t drop me if I get cancer or something horrible like that …
Well , that ’s very nice .
I ’m sure we ’ll need to sell various organs to China to pay for it it , but still .
It provides some measure of security to the growing number of people laid off in an America where the simple act of giving someone a real job has proven an unaffordable luxury for most businesses .
Long before the Internet escaped from the lab , connected the planet and redefined what it meant to use a computer there was a brave and pioneering band of computer users who spent their time , money and sanity setting up their home computers and phone lines to welcome anyone who called .
By using a modem , anyone else who knew the phone number of these computers could connect to them , leave messages , send and recieve files .... and millions did .
They called these places " Bulletin Board Systems " , or BBSes .
And their collections of messages , rants , thoughts and dreams became the way that an entire generation learned about being online .
When the Internet grew in popularity in the early 1990s , the world of the BBS faded , changed , and became a part of the present networked world .. but it was n't the same .

I am so glad that I was able to come about this , my fright bought the DVD years ago , and when I visited , we watched as we reminisced about the past and how it shaped us !
Very well done with such a small budget , they let the people tell the story , the way it should , with minimal bias .
RIP to everyone lost , but may we never forget how they helped shape the future that we live in now .

Some of the important points ( IMHO ) : there were a lot of shy and lonely people out there who found a sense of community on the early Unix BBSes ; the best boards were free or funded by donations from their members ; if a board was advertised in the media or was " for pay , " then you knew right away it was probably porn .
babysprite -- September 7 , 2009 not an easy thing to do
There 's only one thing Hollywood loves than a movie based on a toy : remakes .
Dozens of science - fiction classics are slated for do - overs .
But instead of remaking films that were fine the first time , here are 20 books Hollywood should film .
Advertisement
Seriously , after watching The Day The Earth Stood Still , we 're even more convinced than ever that " updating " or otherwise attempting to refresh the classics of the genre just leads to horrible soggy messes .
It 's hard to believe there 's something worse than endless sequels , but remakes of perfectly great films might just be it .
Especially when there are so many great books left unfilmed , many of which are made for a film adaptation .
Instead of remaking Videodrome ...
Universal snapped up the remake rights to this Cronenberg film last year , and Ehren Kruger ( co-writer of Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen and sole writer of Transformers 3 ) will write and co-produce .
The new version will " modernize the concept , infuse it with the possibilities of nano - technology and blow it up into a large - scale sci- fi action thriller , " says Variety .
... Film Jennifer Government by Max Barry instead .
Seriously , if you want to see a huge paranoid thriller set in a dystopian future world , you 're actually crying out for a Jennifer Government movie .
In a dark future , everybody 's last name is the company they work for — and now companies have started engineering murder as a means of marketing their products .
Horror and strangeness blend together with snarky humor — even the Michael Bay version would be interesting .

Instead of remaking Robocop …
If I want to watch the Darren Aronofsky version of Robocop , I 'll just put in the DVD of the Verhoeven version and turn the brightness way down , while occasionally sticking my head into a bucket of Christmas lights .
Actually , I love Aronofsky 's work , for the most part , but Robocop is a film that requires no " reimagining . "
It 's already fully imagined .
Leave Robocop alone !
... Film Mark L. Van Name 's Jon And Lobo novels .
We 've praised these books before , but the story of the only cyborg in a society that believes cyborgs do n't exist is tailor - made for a film .
Jon can talk to machines thanks to nanotech implants , and he forms a close partnership with a sentient tank , which helps him go kick ass across several star systems .

Instead of remaking Escape From New York ...
Apparently the script for this remake by Allan Loeb is really quite clever , and this time around Snake Plissken 's rescuing a female senator ( instead of the president ) from the walled - off Manhattan .
The banter is said to be razor - sharp , and New Line Cinema is putting this on the fast track .
... Film Glasshouse by Charles Stross instead .
Why has none of Stross ' brilliant novels been filmed yet ?
In any case , Glasshouse is one of his best , and it's a brilliant portrayal of a town that 's also a dystopian prison , where the people are tagged .
Another good alternative is Catherine Fischer 's Incarceron , but that 's already becoming a movie .

Instead of remaking Forbidden Planet ...
Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski just wrote his second draft of the screenplay for this remake — after the first draft leaked on the internet — and he hints that it 'll be full of surprises , including stuff that was n't in the first version .
But given that the original was already a remake of Shakespeare 's The Tempest , we 're not convinced that trying for the " surprise " factor is such a great idea .
We love JMS , but this is a perfect example of a film that still holds up .
... Film Lensman instead .
Luckily , JMS ' other big - screen adapation project sounds a lot more promising .
The classic original space opera , E.E. " Doc " Smith 's Lensman series has been begging for a movie adaptation for decades now — as long as JMS can strip the icky eugenics stuff and sexism out of the books , we could be looking at the next Avatar .
( Or the next Green Lantern , really . )

Instead of The Thing prequel ...
Seriously , a prequel to The Thing ?
Featuring backstory about the original doomed Norwegian expedition that we do n't need to know , and characters we do n't need to see die ?
( Including , rumor has it , the brother of Kurt Russell 's character from the original film . )
This just seems wrong .
Even though it's not technically a remake and thus might not fit in this film , we must lodge our formal protest .
Ronald D. Moore was writing the script , but I believe he 's been replaced .
... Film Finch by Jeff VanderMeer instead .
In VanderMeer 's awesome book ( spoiler alert ) the alien spore people can take over humans and control huge parts of our civilization .
It 's got much of the same body horror as The Thing , plus the idea of alien life that can take over humans and transform us into parts of them .
It packs the same sort of " aliens replacing us " punch , and would make a crackerjack movie .

Instead of redoing When Worlds Collide ...
Stephen Sommers ( The Mummy , G.I. Joe ) is on board to direct this remake , with Steven Spielberg collaborating on the script .
He told Cinefantastique magazine ( in the July 2009 issue ) that he 's still on board , but the project 's been delayed slightly to avoid competing with Emmerich 's 2012 .
Instead of a cerebral tale about another world on a collision course with Earth , as scientists ready an ark to take some humans to another habitable planet , expect the Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower to melt .
... Film Spin By Robert Charles Wilson instead .
It 's got the same " global disaster strikes the Earth " thing , but Wilson 's tale of a membrane encompassing the Earth that slows down time on Earth relative to the rest of the solar system is more original , and a darn sight more interesting .
Unknown beings called " the Hypotheticals " have slowed down time on the Earth to such an extent , we 'll be destroyed by the expanding sun within one generation .
The clever premise lets humans found a colony on Mars and develop high technology while relatively little time seems to pass on Earth — and the final reveal about why the aliens have done this is the kind of thing the Day The Earth Stood Still remake was going for , and failed to deliver .
In the hands of a Duncan Jones or Steven Soderbergh , this could be an instant classic .

Instead of remaking The Bride Of Frankenstein ...
As of last summer , Universal was in talks with The Illusionist 's Neil Burger to write and direct a remake of this James Whale classic , and it 's rumored to be set in present - day New York .
( Of course , The Wolfman 's lackluster performance may have soured Universal on monster remakes for a while . )
... film John Kessel 's Pride And Prometheus instead .
You want a smart , witty look at the Frankenstein story ?
Look no further than Kessel 's story , which is also the best of the recent Jane Austen mash - ups .
The Bennet sisters meet Victor Frankenstein , and after the younger sister Kitty dies , her body disapears , and well ... you can guess the rest .
A film of " Pride And Prometheus " could capitalize on two hot trends — but more importantly , it could bring the Frankenstein mythos back to life .

Instead of remaking Creature From The Black Lagoon ...
Another Universal monster movie , this property has gone through a bunch of possible directors , including John Carpenter , Peter Jackson , John Landis , and most recently The Crazies director Breck Eisner .
Now Carl Rinsch is reportedly on board , for a more violent Alien - inspired take .
... Film The Scar by China Mieville instead .
This novel , set in the same world as Perdido Street Station , has a monstrous major character , the " remade " criminal Tanner — but more importantly , it features the Avanc , a sea monster that the Lovers raise and attempt to capture in their desire to reach the Scar , where reality is in flux and anything is possible .
Plus there 's pirates !
War !
And a city made up of floating ships .
This is the watery monster story you want .

Instead of remaking The Brood ...
After Eisner dropped out of Creature , he was in talks to do this Cronenberg remake instead .
But he 's said a few times recently that he 's only had preliminary talks , and he might love the Cronenberg original too much to try and redo it .
... Film Geek Love by Katherine Dunn instead .
If you want people acting out their psychoses through their mutant babies , this is the book you want .
It has the potential to be every bit as grotesque and disturbing — and horrifying — as Cronenberg 's film .
The Binewskis ' circus is faltering , so they decide to try something new :
They breed their own freaks by using drugs and radioactive substances to turn their own unborn progeny into mutants .
Some are lucky , like Miranda , who only has a pig tail and works as a stripper .
But then there 's the twisted Arty , who launches his own cult called Arturism in which his followers compete to mutilate themselves .
Consider this a plea for the long - awaited Geek Love movie .

Instead of remaking Flash Gordon ...
Unlike The Brood , this may actually be Eisner 's next project , assuming The Crazies ' weak opening - weekend box office does n't sap the fuel out of its rockets .
This would be an " origin story " for Flash , fairly true to the comics , and would feature lots of planet - hopping .
... Film The Vorkosigan saga by Lois McMaster Bujold instead .
The three - time Hugo - winning saga of the disabled Miles Vorkosigan and his awesome military career is like Flash Gordon on steroids .
Just the story of the romance between Miles ' parents and the war that brings them together could be a whole movie by itself .
And Ming only wishes he was as merciless as the Barrayarans at their worst .
Instead of remaking Short Circuit ...
After the success of Wall - E , it was pretty much inevitable , no ?
Steve Carr , director of Paul Blart , Mall Cop , is attached to direct this film , from a script by Robot Chicken 's Dan Milano .
Same deal : A military robot gets struck by lightning and develops a conscience , befriending a young boy .
... Film When Harlie Was One by David Gerrold .
Still one of the greatest " cyber- consciousness goes loopy " stories of all time , Gerrold even rewrote this early 1970s novel in the early 1980s , giving you two versions to choose from .
Harlie attains artificial sentience , and then threatens to become virtually godlike , all the while running loops around his human creators .
The bit where Harlie " drops acid " would make for a pretty hilarious film sequence — although Harlie is n't mobile , which could be a dealbreaker .

Instead of remaking Metropolis ...
Okay , seriously ?
The good news is , this remake has n't been mentioned since 2007 , when producers Thomas Schueler and Mario Kassar bought the rights .
At the time , Schueler said , " With the overwhelming role technology plays in our daily lives , the growing gap between rich and poor , including the gradual elimination of the middle class , the story of ' Metropolis ' is a frightening reflection of our society that takes place in an all too possible not too distant future . "
... Film Virtual Girl by Amy Thomson
Thomson 's novel about a man who creates a robot woman who decides to seek her freedom is absolutely crying out for a big - screen version .
With shows like Caprica exploring robot consciousness , it 's the perfect time to explore the perspective of a cyber - mind that views a body as a " peripheral " and risks going insane from the rush of input that the real world offers .

Instead of remaking Let The Right One In ...
This is a case of a remake that it's too late to stop — Cloverfield director Matt Reeves is already filming the American version of this Swedish vampire movie .
And early comments from Reeves and star Chloe Moretz seem to hint that the U.S. version will abandon all of the original 's troubling hints that the vampire , Eli , is just using young Oskar , the way we see Eli using another guy .
Here 's hoping we 're wrong , since that creepiness is an integral part of the story .
... Film Fledgling by Octavia Butler
Butler 's last novel , the first in a series that we 'll never see the rest of now , is actually told from the point of view of a 53 - year - old vampire who happens to look like a 10 - year - old black girl .
Butler brings much of the same creepiness as the Swedish film , with the vampires needing seven or eight human volunteers , called syms ( or symbionts ) to survive — and the syms receive an erotic pleasure from their situation .

Instead of remaking Buffy The Vampire Slayer ...
Buffy ?
Without Joss ?
That 's unpossible .
Seriously , it seems like a weird idea , and I 'm not entirely sure what the point would be .
We have n't heard much about this since last May , but like all Demonic plots from beneath the Earth 's surface , I 'm sure it 's still bubbling away .
... Film The Strange Adventures Of Rangergirl by Tim Pratt instead .
It 's like Buffy mashed up with Promethea — Marzi is an art - school dropout running a quirky Santa Cruz coffeehouse , and it turns out the coffeehouse 's murals are actually a kind of art magic , dedicated to keeping an evil force at bay .
And now it 's escaping .
It 's up to Marzi — and her comic - book fantasy character Rangergirl — to stop the evil force from getting out into the world .

Instead of remaking Total Recall ...
Keep your ass off Mars !
Okay , do n't panic , but Kurt Wimmer , the mind behind Equilibrium and the " what the hell was that " Ultraviolet , has been hired to write a remake of Dan O'Bannon 's classic script , based on Philip K. Dick 's writing .
Okay , go ahead and panic .
... Film Software / Wetware by Rudy Rucker instead .
There are many heirs to Dick 's crown of weirdness , but Rucker makes a bold claim to the Dickian tradition with the first two novels in the " Ware " tetralogy .
You 've got your strange questions about identity ( as Cobb Anderson becomes his own android duplicate ) your weird conspiracies , and your off - Earth settings ( the emancipated robots set up shop on the Moon ) .
I 'd actually be curious to see what Wimmer ( or someone else in Hollywood ) would do with this .

Instead of remaking He - Man And The Masters Of The Universe ...
Joel Silver ( the producer who 's spawned his own universe ) has teamed up with writer Justin Marks ( Street Fighter : The Legend Of Chun - Li ) to put together a new version of this sagahttp://www.variety.com/article/VR1117….
Actually , there have only been vague rumblings lately , but the success of Transformers probably makes this film inevitable .
... Film Titan by John Varley instead .
Captain Cirocco " Rocky " Jones travels to Saturn and encounters centaurs , the Titanides , and bird - like creatures , the Angels .
She discovers a controlling intelligence , called Gaea , and becomes its super - powered agent , or Wizard .
It 's a great blending of space opera and high - fantasy tropes , and the perfect alternative to another He -Man .

Instead of remaking Logan 's Run ...
It 's not clear where this project is — Bryan Singer was on board , with a script by Valkyrie screenwriter Chris McQuarrie , and as recently as a year ago , he was still saying he might do it .
But Silver and Tron director Joseph Kosinski were also announced to be making this film at one point .
So who can say ?
... Film any one of a number of dystopian novels instead .
It 's amazing that there 's still been no real big - screen adaptation of Huxley 's Brave New World , which is in many ways the inspiration for Logan 's Run .
( We 're still hoping Ridley Scott will get around to this one , as he 's hinted he might . )
But there 's also Vonnegut 's Player Piano , Wyndham 's The Chrysalids , Ness ' The Knife Of Never Letting Go , and many others .

Instead of remaking The Fly ...
This might be the one remake that 's worth being excited about .
David Cronenberg is directing the remake of his own film , because he 's excited by the film - making possibilities of today 's technology .
Given how much Cronenberg 's directorial skills have matured in the past few decades , it could be fascinating to see how he approaches the story of a teleportation experiment gone wrong this time around .
But still ...
... Film David Marusek 's Counting Heads instead .
We 'd still rather see Cronenberg do something new .
How many more Cronenberg films are we going to get ?
If we could pick one SF novel for Cronenberg to adapt , it would be David Marusek 's clone - angst novel Counting Heads .
It 's such a Cronenberg story , full of weird doubled characers and nano - plagues .
Or else maybe Kathleen Ann Goonan 's Queen City Jazz , which is packed with weird body horror done in a literary way , as people are transformed horrifically into early 20th century Jazz Age figures by the malfunctioning nanotech city .
Or maybe Margaret Atwood 's Oryx And Crake .
Instead of remaking Highlander ...
Fast And The Furious director Justin Lin is helming this remake , from a script by Iron Man scribes Matt Holloway and Art Marcum that focuses on the backstory of the immortals .
Could be meat , could be cake .
... Film The Steel Remains by Richard K. Morgan .
You want epic sword fights , complicated heroes , sweeping backstories and dire prophecies ?
This novel demands to become a huge , big budget movie .
( Although the copious amounts of gay sex might disturb the Hollywood execs slightly . )

Instead of remaking Fantastic Voyage ...
James Cameron himself is involved in producing this remake , and says that everything we 've learned about medical imaging will make the new film much more realistic than the original .
No director is named yet , but Cameron seems pretty determined to make it happen .
And he 's got a bit of clout these days .
... Film Surface Tension by James Blish .
Humans arrive on a distant waterworld , with seed banks to help colonize it with adapted human - like offspring .
But the ship crashes and the seed banks are ruined — so the ship 's crew reengineers their own descendants to become microscopic sea life , retaining human intelligence but reduced to a primitive civilization .
Instead of just being temporarily microscopic , these offspring of humanity are permanently tiny , struggling to survive and develop civilization anew .
You could also film Isaac Asimov 's quasi sequel , Fantastic Voyage 2 : Destination Brain .

Instead of remaking The Incredible Shrinking Man ...
It 's like all your worst nightmares rolled into one .
A remake of Shrinking Man starring Eddie Murphy — and directed by Brett Ratner .
Could n't we just watch Meet Dave on Nyquil instead ?
... Film Flyboy Action Figure Comes With Gasmask by Jim Munroe .
Actually , we 're not sure we want Eddie Murphy or Brett Ratner anywhere near this amazing novel about a mild - mannered guy who can turn into a fly , and who teams up with a woman who can make things disappear to right social wrongs .
It 's a hilarious , weird , silly book that would make a fantastic movie in the right hands — and actually , it already did make for a great short film .
Other upcoming remakes we do n't particularly want to see , but we ran out of time to suggest alternative books for : Mannequin , All Of Me , The Illustrated Man , They Live , Scanners , Fahrenheit 451 , Weird Science , The Blob , The Man Who Fell To Earth , Altered States , The Entity and Westworld .

Additional reporting by Annalee Newitz .
Thanks for coming up with some great book ideas !
Just like Lyndon Johnson , Obama appears to be dedicated , most of all , to the welfare state at home , but , if for nothing but political reasons , committed to the agenda of escalating war .
Like Johnson , he was elected partly on the implicit basis that he’d be more peaceful than his warmongering Republican opponent , only to quickly disappoint peaceniks nationwide .
Like LBJ , will Obama only serve one full term as a result ?
Already , there are efforts to rejuvenate the legacy of LBJ .
Perhaps this is because the establishment recognizes the current president faces a similar situation :
He is admired by his liberal base for his efforts to expand government at home , but these same voters , at best , only tolerate his foreign policy as a lesser of evils .
But will he prove to be a lesser of evils ?
In announcing the Afghanistan surge , Obama is conscious of the parallels .
For months now , commentators on left and right have warned the president not to be another Johnson and not to let Afghanistan become another Vietnam .
See this great column by rightwinger Tony Blankley , for example .
Aware of the parallels , Obama in his speech attempted to dispel them .
The president says : Vietnam had wide popular opposition to the American presence , the Vietnam war was less internationally popular and Vietnam did n’t attack America , unlike Afghanistan on 9/11 .
The first two points are dubious , and the third is a stretch at best .
October 2001 was a good time to debate whether Afghanistan was really the source of 9/11 .
Eight years later , Obama is simply rewinding back the debate to that time .
But he is wrong in the sense that most of the planning was in the west , al Qaeda is not really in Afghanistan any more , and neither , probably , is Pakistan .
And even if they were , how long a war on the Afghan people would be justified in retaliation for 9/11 ?
If American troops were still occupying Afghanistan 20 years from now , would 9/11 still be the excuse ?
Such factors may play into a most encouraging trend in public opinion .
Isolationist — as in , non-interventionist — sentiment is wider and deeper in America than any time since 1964 , according to a new poll .
As the war continues to escalate , I predict foreign policy will split the left and right .
Some on the left will continue to support Obama , and even come to accept or even endorse his foreign policy , largely on the basis of partisanship and the hope of more socialism at home .
On the right , many will continue to attack Obama for not doing enough , for neglecting Afghanistan — although they rarely made such a critique of Bush — but other rightists will come to an America First point of view , thinking this war has gone too long and without any meaningful purpose in sight .
Already , I ’m hearing rightwing radio split on Afghanistan .
The question that interests me is whether many conservatives will come out in direct support of Obama , as the war rages on , or if there are more conspicuous attacks against American interests , and whether many liberals will come to outright oppose him .
That ’s what we need for the longterm cause of liberty and peace : A realignment , with the more statist , establishment , pro-government and pro-war wings of left and right joining , and the more anti-state wings joining .
Only by destroying the modern political spectrum , which is seemingly designed as a conspiracy against liberty — by splitting up dissent against the state into two factions and thus making it difficult to ever have a large - ranging populist revolution against the government — will the dialectic dynamic between statism and classical liberalism ( libertarianism ) of earlier eras be restored .
Hopefully , Obama ’s LBJ moment will have the silver lining of bringing this about .

All of us are now aware of the Texas man who yesterday flew his private plane into a 7 - story Austin office building .
Apparently , he intentionally crashed his plane into the building to target the IRS offices that were housed inside the facility .
As I am writing this column just hours after the event took place , there has not yet been a lot of time for the major news media talking heads to spin the story .
By the time this column is released on Friday , however , I 'm sure we will all have been inundated with copious references to this man , Joe Stack , as being " off his rocker , " or similar assertions .
Perhaps our friends at DHS will label Stack a " right - wing domestic terrorist . "
However , Mr. Stack apparently left behind a " suicide manifesto " explaining his actions .
After carefully reading Stack 's manifesto , I am quite convinced that he was not crazy , and he was not a " terrorist . "
However , he was angry .
A lot of us are angry -- and for many of the same reasons that Mr. Stack was angry !
While I would certainly take exception to some of the things Stack says in his manifesto , he said things that many of us are feeling .
Stack began his manifesto by saying , " If you 're reading this , you 're no doubt asking yourself , ' Why did this have to happen ? '
The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time . "
He goes on to say , " Sadly , starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that , in return for our dedication and service , our government stands for justice for all .
We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place , and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble [ principles ] represented by its founding fathers .
Remember ?
One of these was ' no taxation without representation ' . . .
These days anyone who really stands up for that [ principle ] is promptly labeled a ' crackpot , ' traitor and worse . "
For the most part , he 's right about that , of course .
It has been a long time since the average hardworking American has been represented in Washington , D.C. By and large , the politicians in DC represent only Big Money interests .
Just try talking with your congressman or senator and see how much personal interest he or she takes in anything you have to say .
As for emails , letters , and faxes , unless they number in the tens of thousands , they are mostly used as kindling for the fireplace .
Obviously , Mr. Stack had long felt the frustration of being ignored by these pimps in Washington that we know as congressmen .
He wrote , " While very few working people would say they have n't had their fair share of taxes ( as can I ) , in my lifetime I can say with a great degree of certainty that there has never been a politician cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind .
Nor , for that matter , are they the least bit interested in me or anything I have to say . "
I suppose that just about every American could say the same thing .
Then , regarding our current tax system , Stack wrote , " Here we have a [ tax ] system that is , by far , too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand .
Yet , it mercilessly ' holds accountable ' its victims , claiming that they 're responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand .
The law ' requires ' a signature on the bottom of a tax filing ; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing ; if that 's not ' duress ' [ then ] what is .
If this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime , nothing is . "
He also wrote , " However , this is where I learned that there are two ' interpretations ' for every law ; one for the very rich , and one for the rest of us . "
However , I think a better way of putting his statement would have been , " There are two interpretations for every law ; one for the GOVERNMENT , and one for the rest of us . "
And only the most naïve among us would not understand that statement .
According to Stack 's manifesto , he earned an engineering degree with the goal of becoming an " independent engineer . "
He said this about working his way through college : " I was living on peanut butter and bread ( or Ritz crackers when I could afford to splurge ) for months at a time . "
I know that feeling !
My wife and I married between my sophomore and junior years of college , and for months we had a grand total of $ 15 a week to spend on groceries .
And believe me : that did not go very far -- not even in 1974 .
How many politicians on Capitol Hill do you think could even remotely relate to Mr. Stack ?
Stack later said , " I decided that I did n't trust big business to take care of me , and that I would take responsibility for my own future and myself . "
Wow !
What a revolutionary idea : taking responsibility for yourself !
Now I know that practically no one on Capitol Hill can relate to Mr. Stack !
After quoting a portion of the tax law relating to Section 1706 ( Treatment of Certain Technical Personnel ) , Stack wrote , " The bottom line is that they may as well have put my name right in the text of section ( d ) .
Moreover , they could only have been more blunt if they would have came out and directly declared me a criminal and non-citizen slave . "
His manifesto clearly reveals bitterness and resentment toward the IRS , the tax system , the banker and Big Business government bailouts , and the emergence of police - state attitudes and actions in the aftermath of 9/11 .
He expressed disdain for " the monsters of organized religion . "
He talked about his move from California to Texas .
He referred to a divorce and the way his savings and retirement had been wiped out after a career of working " 100 - hour workweeks . "
Stack also noted , " The recent presidential puppet GW Bush and his cronies in their eight years certainly reinforced for all of us that this criticism rings equally true for all of the government . "
I can say " Amen " to that .
Stack 's conclusion : " I have had all I can stand . "
In what was obviously a reference to what he was about to do , he wrote , " Nothing changes unless there is a body count . "
Then , later he said , " But I also know that by not adding my body to the count , I insure nothing will change .
I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at ' big brother ' while he strips my carcass , I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me , I choose not to pretend that business as usual wo n't continue ; I have just had enough . "
Stack wrapped up his manifesto by saying , " Well , Mr. Big Brother IRS man , let 's try something different ; take my pound of flesh and sleep well . "
See Joe Stack 's manifesto at :
http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,586627,00.html
My heart goes out to Joe Stack !
The sentiments expressed above are shared by millions of Americans who are also fed up with Big Brother .
We are fed up with our country being turned into a burgeoning police state , under the rubric of " national security . "
We are fed up with the harassments of the IRS .
We know the " war on drugs " is merely the government 's way of cutting out the competition ( this is exactly what more than one retired federal law enforcement agent - - employed in the drug war - - told me ) .
We know the " war on terror " is nothing but an excuse to trample our constitutional liberties .
We are fed up with the voracious vampires known as the Federal Reserve sucking the lifeblood out of the veins of America 's hardworking Middle Class .
We are tired of the CFR , CIA , and America 's State Department manufacturing perpetual wars that cost trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives for the benefit of the global elite .
We are fed up with an arrogant and oppressive federal government that is strangling the life and freedom out of our states .
We all share Joe Stack 's pain !
I really wish Joe Stack had not killed himself , however .
We need each other .
By taking his life , he reduced our strength .
The global elites delight in our demise .
As we grow weaker , they grow stronger .
But the fight is not over ; the battle is not lost !
Rumblings of freedom 's revival can be felt across the length and breadth of this nation .
The clanging of liberty 's resolve can be heard in hamlets and villages from Montana to South Carolina .
There are still millions of us -- from virtually every walk of life -- who will not surrender our liberties without a fight !
And we have not yet begun to fight !
So , to the rest of us Joe Stacks out there : let 's not fly our planes into buildings .
Let 's not end our lives prematurely .
Instead , get mad ; get organized ; get educated ; start equipping your heart , mind , and body for the battle ahead .
Let 's fight ; let 's study ; let 's prepare ; let 's make every would - be tyrant on Capitol Hill and Wall Street know that we are not going to sit back and let them steal our country .
Let 's send a message , in no uncertain terms , that if they want our pound of flesh , they are going to have to come and get it -- and if they do , it 's going to cost them a whole lot more than a pound of theirs !
Oh , Joe !
I wish you had not killed yourself .

Last year , 35 Colorado fugitives out of the 50 most wanted by law enforcement officials were found and arrested .
Saturday marked the beginning of this year ’s effort to find even more .
“ These are not taxpaying citizens working 9 - to - 5 jobs , ” said Denver police Lt. Tony Lopez .
“ The sooner we get them arrested the better . ”
The 15th annual event was hosted by the Denver Police Department and coordinated by the Metro Denver Crime Stoppers and Fugitive Location Apprehension Group , or FLAG , that collaborated with 15 local , state and federal agencies , including sheriff ’s and police departments , the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and the Colorado Department of Corrections .
Beginning at 7 a.m. today , uniformed and plainclothes officers who have volunteered their time will start working to pursue people on the most - wanted list and are encouraging the public to call Crime Stoppers at 720-913-7867 anytime because the hotline is always open .
Tipsters can remain anonymous and can receive up to a $ 2,000 reward , authorities said .
This year ’s No. 1 fugitive is Heber Santiago Godoy , who is wanted in the 2009 death of one security guard and wounding of another at a Denver nightclub .
Authorities are also looking for people who are not on the 50 most - wanted list .
They ’re looking to clear 167,152 misdemeanor warrants and 29,074 felony warrants for crimes that range from drugs to homicide .
By releasing the photos of the most - wanted fugitives , state law enforcement agencies hope people will come forward and report any information , even if it is seemingly small .
“ Any tip , large or small , is welcome , ” Lopez said .
Since its inception in 1981 , the Metro Denver Crime Stoppers , working on anonymous tips received from the public , has led to the arrests of 1,300 fugitives who have committed crimes that include homicide , sex assaults , robbery , fraud , theft , burglary , and parole violations and escape .
During Saturday ’s event , The Denver Post received an award for assisting the annual effort by publishing the 50 most - wanted poster .

KIEV ( Reuters ) - Ukraine ’s Viktor Yanukovich will take the oath of office as president on Thursday in a low - key ceremony reflecting a bitterly - fought and disputed election which has highlighted deep divisions in the country .
The inauguration of Yanukovich , 59 , marks a comeback from humiliation five years ago when mass protests , called the Orange Revolution , overturned an election that had been rigged in his favor .
But Thursday ’s ceremony in Ukraine ’s parliament will still have a hollow ring to it .
Yanukovich beat Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko by 3.5 percentage points in a February 7 run-off , but won the support of only a third of the 37 million - strong electorate and will be the first president of Ukraine to have been supported by less than 50 percent of those who voted .
The voting pattern highlighted a sharp split between Russian - speaking voters in the industrial east and south who backed Yanukovich , and Ukrainian - speakers in the west and center who voted for Tymoshenko .
Tymoshenko , who only last Saturday dropped a legal challenge to Yanukovich ’s election and still maintains his victory was not legitimate , may boycott the ceremony .
She is resisting attempts to oust her as prime minister , signaling continued political tension in the ex-Soviet state of 46 million , at least in the short term .
TILT TO MOSCOW
Yanukovich , a stocky former mechanic who had a deprived childhood in eastern Ukraine and as a young man was convicted twice for petty crime including assault , is expected to tilt the country back toward Moscow after estrangement under the pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko .
He has hinted at possible concessions to Moscow over the future of Russia ’s Black Sea fleet forces in Ukraine ’s Crimean peninsula and has proposed the creation of a consortium including Russia to run the country ’s gas pipelines .
But he says he wants to change a 10 - year - old agreement on supplies of Russian gas to Ukraine which was negotiated by Tymoshenko and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
He will push Yushchenko’s drive for NATO membership onto the back - burner .
But he says he will pursue a balanced foreign policy and has vowed to push for closer ties with the EU .
Though there is little appetite in the EU to take on Ukraine as a member , EU sources said Yanukovich will travel to Brussels on Monday on his first visit abroad .
Yanukovich ’s Regions Party and the Kremlin have said he will visit Moscow in early March .
Ukraine ’s economy was hit hard by the global downturn and is dependent on a $ 16.4 billion International Monetary Fund bail - out program .
IMF lending was suspended late last year and is only likely to resume when stability returns .
Yanukovich ’s immediate task will be to deliver on a promise to make life better for Ukrainians and for that he needs a prime minister with whom he can work .
He has already mooted three candidates to replace Tymoshenko -- businessman and former central bank chief Sergey Tigipko , former foreign minister and parliament speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk and former finance minister Mykola Azarov .
She is seeking to persuade her parliamentary allies to close ranks round her , while his party and its powerful backers , many of them wealthy industrialists , are seeking to draw deputies away from her coalition and forge a new one to get her out .
Forging a coalition requires some tricky horse - trading and could be a lengthy process .
If Yanukovich fails to secure a new coalition , he will reluctantly have to call new parliamentary elections , further prolonging uncertainty .

A British holidaymaker was ordered to cover up his t- shirt by airport security guards at London ’s Gatwick airport , who described the slogan “ Freedom or Death ” as “ threatening ” and “ an incitement to terrorism ” .
38 - year - old father of two , Lloyd Berks , was ordered to obscure the shirt while passing through security gates on his way to a flight to Austria .
The shirt ( pictured ) is a white Levi Strauss design , found in hundreds of high street stores across the country .
It depicts a skeleton , flanked by two revolvers , with the famous phrase emblazoned above in turquoise lettering .
“ First they told me take my shoes off and checked my wallet , which is understandable , ” Berks told the UK Daily Mail .
“ Then they said airlines might be worried by my T - shirt because its “ threatening ” .
I thought they were joking at first .
I was with my family .
I was hardly a terrorist risk . ”
“ It ’s an attack on people ’s civil liberties .
What has happened to common sense ?
Have people forgotten how to use it ? ” Mr Berks added .
We ca n’t be having people such as Mr Berks flouting their freedom in such a manner now can we ?
God forbid .
Others may begin to think they are also free .
Airport officials have since apologised to Mr Berks and admitted the incident was unnecessary .
Far from being an isolated incident , this case is one of a spate of attacks on behalf of a dangerous new global terrorist group identified only as the “ T - shirt wearing terrorists ” .
Previous cases include that of Brad Jayakody , 30 , from London , who was thankfully prevented from passing through security at Heathrow ’s Terminal 5 , and threatened with arrest , after his Transformers T - shirt was deemed “ offensive ” .
Mr Jayakody said that at first the guard started joking with him about the Transformers character depicted on his French Connection T - shirt .
“ Then he explains that since Megatron is holding a gun , I ’m not allowed to fly , ” he said .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t

It appears that Britain is safe from cartoon robot gun attacks , at least .
I for one will no longer be cowering beneath the duvet every night at the thought of Starscream breaking through British air defenses and utilizing his signature weapon , the null ray , which can disrupt the flow of electricity in any circuitry it hits for brief periods , effectively rendering any electronic device or machine temporarily inoperable .
Consider also the case of a student at Bellbrook High School in Ohio .
The unnamed teenager chose to wear a T - shirt with the words “ not my president ” superimposed over a picture of President Bush .
When a crosshair was added to the design , two students came forward and complained to the school administrators .
The Assistant Principal then made the decision to call the FBI because the high school kid could have been a terrorist planning to assassinate Bush .
What ’s even more absurd is that the FBI actually treated the case with the utmost significance and the investigation was eventually turned over to the Secret Service !
In a gut - wrenching climax to the story , the two kids who snitched on the teenage terrorist were praised as heroes .
The Assistant Principal said they had complied with the demand of the government – that citizens stand together with homeland security and keep an eye out for potential terrorist activity , for this , he was proud of them .
Now take the case of a 14 year old from Lancaster , PA who was reprimanded for wearing a t - shirt with the image of a gun , printed on the front and back — a shirt the Penn Manor freshman wore to honor his uncle , a soldier in the U.S. Army fighting in Iraq .
How about the 80 year veteran who was arrested at a mall for wearing an anti-war t- shirt .
The shirt was splotched with red and emblazoned with a simple message about the fatalities of the Iraq war : “ 4,000 troops , 1 million Iraqis dead .
Enough . ”
Take the British tourist who was forced to turn his t- shirt inside out by airport security who told him the two pistols on the front could constitute a security risk and upset passengers .
Consider the t- shirt seller from New Orleans who was investigated by Homeland Security officials for selling anti-FEMA T - shirts , a reflection of his frustration with the federal government ’s response to the storm that left him homeless and unemployed .
Or the Australian man who was barred from a London - Melbourne flight unless he removed a T - shirt depicting George Bush as “ the world ’s number one terrorist ” .
Another potential terrorist was apprehended when a lawyer was arrested and charged with trespassing at a public mall in the state of New York after refusing to take off a T - shirt he had just purchased at the mall bearing the words “ Give Peace A Chance ” .
Two more terrorists were identified as a Texas couple arrested and charged with trespassing in 2004 after they refused to cover up homemade T - shirts with anti-Bush slogans .
The front of the T - shirts bore the international symbol for “ no ” superimposed over the word “ Bush . ”
The back of Nicole Rank ’s T - shirt said “ Love America , Hate Bush . ”
On the back of Jeffery Rank ’s T - shirt was the message “ Regime Change Starts at Home . ”
Back in Britain , a 20 year old gamekeeper was arrested at a Game Fair in 2005 for wearing a t - shirt that read “ Bollocks to Blair ” .
Charlotte Denis , from Gloucestershire , was stopped by police as she left the Countryside Alliance stand because of the “ offensive ” slogan .
These are the real threats to the free world .
Forget wide - open borders and the daily influx of totally undocumented populations into our countries , do n’t bother focusing on the small rag tag groups of known violent radicals , we need to put all our efforts into routing out high school children and old men with political T - shirts , those who wear pictures of guns , and guys sporting transformers merchandise .

In the past two days , two idiots tweeted that President Barack Obama should be assassinated , apparently incensed over the health care reform vote .
@THHEE_JAY , identified as Jay Martin , tweeted just that , and followed up with " If I lived in DC .
I 'd shoot him myself .
Dead f***ing serious . "
A day earlier , one Solly Forell tweeted , " ASSASSINATION !
America , we survived the Assassinations and Lincoln & Kennedy .
We 'll surely get over a bullet to Barrack Obama 's head . "
Incidentally , both people happened to be black , and both self - identify as conservatives .
They 've both been paid visits by their new pals at the Secret Service .
State - controlled Hellenic Post Bank ( TT ) spent nearly 1 billion euros last year to secure its positions against the possible bankruptcy of the Greek government , according to documents seen by Kathimerini .
In August , the bank bought credit default swaps ( CDS ) - a form of insurance on financial instruments - worth 950 million euros when the spread on the Greek five - year bond over the German Bund was at 135 basis points .
CDS products allow investors to purchase protection against the default of debt issued by governments , hedging existing positions .
TT 's management , which changed after the Socialists took power in October , sold the CDS when the spread was at 235 basis points in December , earning a profit of some 35 million euros , the documents show .
The bank 's position in CDS protected the lender from its exposure in Greek bonds but also provided it with an opportunity to play a part in the global CDS market worth some 8 billion dollars last year .
With a position totalling 950 million euros , or 1.2 billion dollars , TT had the ability to shape momentum in the speculative derivatives market which the Greek government wants to be controlled .
Prime Minister George Papandreou is among the global leaders that have been pushing for increased financial market supervision of CDS and a crackdown on market manipulation .
TT 's previous CEO , Angelos Philippidis , had said in his last press conference as head of the bank last year that the swaps were part of the lender 's « social role , » giving it the ability to tackle speculators targetting Greece .
Originally published in the December 2006 issue of Ultimate Grappling
The 10 finger guillotine is a curious technique .
There has probably been more speculation about how to properly apply this guillotine than just about any other technique .
It is the Loch Ness monster of grappling – everyone knows someone who has seen it , but nobody can even agree what it looks like .
You might have seen Chris Brennan fighting in Pride , KOTC , etc , attacking aggressively using the Kimura and armbar .
He ’s a Brazilian jiu - jitsu black belt , a professional fighter and the head instructor at the Next Generation gym .
What you might NOT know is that he is a self - professed “ 10 finger guillotine freak ” .
Chris has developed his own version of the 10 finger guillotine , and he applies it from many different positions .
This article will give you a taste of its power and versatility , and hopefully give you a new tool with which to terrorize your sparring partners .
Choke Mechanics
The ‘ secret ’ , or critical detail , of the 10 finger guillotine is to position your hands so that your thumb knuckles apply pressure against the windpipe .
The hands are first placed into position , and then the choke is applied by cocking the wrist upward .
Chris cups
Norm ’s chin with his left hand .
Norm ’s chin sits in the space between Chris ’s little and ring fingers – this is very important to ensure the correct application of the choke .
Chris now brings his left hand over his own right hand , cradling the chin with both hands
Side view : Chris clamps
Norm ’s head to his ribs with his elbow , as if he was carrying a football .
The grip on the chin stops the head from slipping out .
Chris now turns his wrists up so that the back of both thumbs apply pressure against his opponent ’s windpipe – the submission is almost immediate .
Hand Positioning for the 10 Finger Guillotine
To help you understand the choking action in more detail , Chris demonstrates the choke hand position without an opponent .
Chris left hand cups his opponent ’s chin ( with the tip of his chin coming between the little finger and the ring finger ) .
The right hand cups the left hand ; note how the thumbs of both hands are lying right next to each other .
To apply the choke Chris cocks his hands upwards , as if he wanted to see the back side of his right hand .
This drives the thumbs into the windpipe .
10 Finger Guillotine Vs. a Double Leg Takedown
The 10 finger guillotine can be applied from a variety of positions .
One of most common uses is to counter an attempted takedown
Chris squares off against his opponent Norm shoots in , trying to take Chris down .
Chris sprawls his hips back while cupping the chin with his left hand
He sprawls his hips all the way to the ground and cups the chin with his second hand as well .
Pinning his opponent ’s head to the mat , Chris applies the choke by bending both his wrists upward .
10 Finger Guillotine from the Guard
The 10 finger guillotine can work even if your opponent gets one of his arms in between your own .
Chris sits up from the guard , bringing his left arm over his opponent ’s shoulder
He cups the chin while moving his hips to the right Alternate angle : he brings his right arm over Norm ’s left shoulder … … and inserts his right hand through the armpit , cupping the chin with both hands .
Chris moves his hips out to the side and cocks his wrists upwards to apply the choke .
5 Finger Guillotine From Inside Your Opponent ’s Guard
The 10 finger guillotine even works with one hand ( making it a “ 5 finger guillotine ” ) .
Here Chris turns the tables on an unsuspecting opponent and applies a 5 finger guillotine when he is in his opponent ’s guard .
Chris is in his opponent ’s butterfly guard
His right hand stuffs the head into his left armpit , where his left hand cups the chin Alternate view : note how the little finger comes in front of the chin ; all the other fingers are underneath the chin itself Chris throws himself forward , crossing his ankles under Norm ’s legs to control his movement
He arches backwards , basing on one hand and driving the left thumb into the throat to obtain a submission .

Although nostalgia will never let us fully admit this , many of the classic RPGs that graced that 8 - bit era do n’t hold up very well … there I said it .
Try to play the original Final Fantasy without biting off most of your own digits in pure frustration , I dare you .
It ’s not that the stories were n’t worthy of praise , they simply could n’t sufficiently be done on the technology of the day .
Sure , games like Earthbound and Chrono Trigger during the 16 - bit era still make for amazing gaming , but it was the technology of the console itself that allowed the game creators to tell their story without limitations ; cartridge size allowed for a more complete story to be told , and console processing power allowed for graphics and sound to be more immersive .
These days , the power of our modern consoles has the ability to do amazing things never thought possible even ten years ago .
Mass Effect has an amazing and sophisticated dialogue system where the decisions you make affect everything from the cutscenes to the way other characters interact with you .
Hell , it even affects the gameplay of the sequel .
We ’ve come a long way from text boxes , kids .
Unfortunately , we ’re seeing some of that promise fall short .
The Wii promised innovation and changes to the way we play , and yet , has lead to uninspired gaming .
We should be in yet another golden era of RPG’ing with so much power that can be utilized , but we ’re not , and the problem all boils down to money .
As the 3D era turned into the HD era , many game companies were figuring out they needed a larger budget to finish their creations .
Remember beating an old NES game and the credit list was about six asian names you could n’t pronounce ?
They did n’t even bother scrolling the text as the names could all fit neatly under the “ conglaturation you is win ! ” screen .
Those days are as gone as the Arch Deluxe sandwich .
Video games became harder to self - finance and still make it to mass market in order to compete with all the other hi-def , Dolby digital , god - fearing modern console games .
Publishers like EA took advantage of this and began to buy up smaller gaming houses .
In turn for the financing to make Cabela ’s Game Hunter 33 : Shoot That Bear ! , the publishers had more sway over the product that was being created .
The creative people are n’t in charge anymore , and we should all be worried about this .
Video games have been found to be such a tappable market for moneymaking that EA having a bad fiscal quarter affects the entire Dow Jones .
It ’s not a few guys in a basement anymore , its a CEO and boardroom environment now .
The “ suits ” making the decisions on the games you play are n’t pushing the limitations of anyone ’s imagination , instead they only care about how a game affects an earnings report .
Because of this sad fact , there are too many questionable trends happening in gaming , and this year does n’t forecast to be much different .
Here are some that I ’ve particularly noticed :
Trend # 1 – A “ Safe ” product
With the millions and millions of wing wangs tied up in future gaming real estate , publishers want a product they are reasonably sure to get a return investment on .
In the RPG world , this seems to be culminating lately in the “ me too plus one ” attitude .
Each game seems to be taking the “ If you like Fallout , try Borderlands ! ” philosophy .
Not that both of those games were n’t amazing , but they could have been each others sequels with such similarities to one another .
Action RPGs seem to be replacing all other types of RPGs .
I could n’t name you a recent strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics on a modern console , but I could name nearly a dozen action RPGs that are heavily blended with first person shooters .
These types of games still have some sort of dice - rolling and number crunching under the hood , but the average player could n’t tell .
These games generally control exactly like Halo or Call of Duty and even have options to auto create one ’s character .
“ Do n’t worry about all that scary RPG stuff , kids , you can even level up automatically in case all that customizing gets in the way of the shooty bangy stuff . ”
Most of the end results have been extremely well - realized and the results turn out fantastic , but these games are very safe as entries into the RPG world .
These games are shooters first and RPG ’s second .
The Nintendo DS and the PC seem to be the only places these days one can go for a gaming environment that still has the full gamut of RPGs .
Of course , it comes down to money .
Publishers are more likely to green - light a traditional RPG on a handheld since the development costs are so much lower .
The end result is the public still able to find the hardcore stuff , but these games are n’t getting the same budgets and polish they should be .
Many of the handheld games pay homage to the great RPGs that dropped on the SNES and Playstation era ; in fact , some of them ARE simply remakes of your favorite classic games .
Chrono Trigger was re-released for the DS last year with great success .
Still , there ’s a sadness in the realization that the era of the hardcore RPG on a home console seems to be waning .
Trend # 2 – A “ Safe and Lame ” product
Just as many times , the corporate decision to avoid risks has led to some seriously lame gaming .
I ’m sure some decisions made have ultimately forced a story to be tighter , or a game to work better , but there are just as many examples of this leading to a game nobody wants to play .
Take , for example , the famous behind - the - scenes spat between Will Wright and EA during the creation of Spore .
Will Wright wanted to turn
Spore into as much of a game rewarding creativity in creating a creature as it was a fun multi- layered game .
If a creature had legs in the front of its body , it was supposed to affect the interactions with other Spore inhabitants .
EA , however , wanted this to fill the cuteness gap that was laid down by games such as Pokemon .
They wanted every creature to roar and be colorful and cute .
The science underneath the game was n’t terribly important as long as a 5 year old could have a dumbed down but accessible experience .
The end result ?
Yeah , we all know EA won that argument , and ultimately made a game nobody really liked .
A giant creature was n’t any slower than a little one ; the game simply cared about “ leveling up ” instead of a creature ’s evolution .
No matter how many limbs your character has , it does n’t really walk around any differently : it ’s either “ peaceful ” and tries to woo other creatures with singing ( like Michael Buble ) or “ super pissed off ” and beats the hell out of the rest of the world with clubs ( like Americans … . with clubs ) .
It ’s no wonder Will Wright left EA soon after the crapfest this game was hit stores .
Trend # 3 – RPG elements everywhere !
The flip side of this coin is the introduction of soft RPG elements into all types of games .
Developers are beginning to understand that nearly all games can be enriched by giving the gamer more choices within their play environment .
Now almost every sports game includes an RPG element .
I know many of you have n’t bought a sports game in , well … ever .
However , if you would pick up any sports game published this year , you ’d be surprised at how many RPG elements are included .
For many years the Tiger Woods golf franchise has included the ability to create a golfer to look and play however you ’d like .
These games include a career mode where you take that golfer through the rigors of a tournament schedule .
The better the character does in events , the more you can level up various aspects of their playing .
On top of that , you can buy better golfing equipment in the clubhouse to make your character hit farther and more accurately .
If you think about it , that ’s just as many RPG elements that get wrapped around many Action RPG ’s these days .
In the most recent NHL hockey game from EA Sports , you can create a character to suit the position you want to play .
If you are a goal scorer , you can create a lean and fast skater .
A defenseman , then , can be bulked up to knock the hell out of the oncoming team .
With this character , you can then join up with friends and have an entire team of human - controlled players , and take them online and play them against other human - controlled teams .
On top of that , you can even go a step further and play in entire leagues and seasons of human - controlled teams .
Much like the pen and paper dice - rolling RPGs , these games encourage as much cooperative teamwork as they do competitiveness .
Whatever you thought you knew about sports games , you probably only now know half of the picture .
Trend # 4 – Downloadable content- a- plenty
So , you ’ve spent months in waiting for a game like Fallout 3 to come out .
When you get it , you are wowed by all of the adventuring and customizing you get to do .
Then , after hours and hours of leveling up , you get to the ending and … sucker !
The ending is only the prelude to the downloadable content you ’ve gotta buy to get the real ending .
That $ 60 Fallout 3 disc was only an investment to get the pleasure in buying more Fallout 3 , hooray !
Guess what , most downloadable content is too expensive and sucks !
Gone are the days in which game makers include all of the stuff for a game inside the package you purchase .
Per policy of Microsoft , some expansion packs cannot BE free even if the game creator wants them to be .
Bungie , for example , was required to charge something for the various map packs that came out for Halo 3 .
As started with Half - Life 2 : Episode One , game makers can theoretically get games quicker to the public with smaller episodic gaming .
Telltale Games has made an entire business model of various episodic smaller games which cost the gamer less .
Most of the time this “ extra content ” was obviously created at the same time the game was , and just held back to charge more and contain less .
Are you guys trying to actually fool anyone by this ?
Summing Up
It seems money is at the heart of many of these big trends .
On one hand gamers ’ demand for a better experience has added RPG elements in games that would not normally have them , and has led to positive results in immersing a gamer into a world .
These RPG elements allow one to care about a created character in everything from a dungeon crawler to a golfing game .
You can take a created character online and interact virtually with all sorts of people and have a better experience in the process .
On the other hand , it seems like developers are n’t pushing the boundaries of these new consoles enough .
Sure , we get some games which really push the envelope , but it seems like another company will just turn around and steal that same idea , tweak it a bit , and slap some extra crap in and call it a new game .
Although we are getting a new Final Fantasy soon , most RPGs are made with the intention of appealing to an audience that prefers to go “ pew pew ! ” with guns rather than get immersed into a story .
I loved Borderlands , but did anyone really feel the story was acceptable ?
It was an FPS first tied in with some RPG elements .
We need more games which embraces the “ dice rolling ” element of RPGs , not hides it behind a shotgun with power - ups .
On top of this , it seems most gamers are becoming complacent with non-complete video games which are deceptively short in hopes that they pay for downloadable content .
I realize development costs are through the roof , but $ 60 for a game needs to be the ceiling for whatever we buy .
Oh , and make sure to actually give me a ceiling in the first place , and not try to make me buy it with Microsoft Points .
If you sell me a game , have the decency of giving me a proper ending to it ( I ’m talking to you Fallout 3 ) .
We should be tired of being pandered to and exploited by corporate jerkfaces who assume that they can get away with selling half - assed games for exorbitant amounts .
Until then , I think my Mass Effect 2 is asking for more money .
A man fired from a Texas auto dealership used an internet service to remotely disable ignitions and set off car horns of more than 100 vehicles sold at his old workplace , police said yesterday .
Austin police arrested Omar Ramos - Lopez , 20 , yesterday , charging him with felony breach of computer security .
Ramos - Lopez used a former colleague 's password to deactivate starters and set off car horns , police said .
Several car owners said they had to call tow trucks and were left stranded at work or home .
" He caused these customers , now victims , to miss work , " Austin police spokeswoman Veneza Aguinaga said .
" They did n't get paid .
They had to get tow trucks .
They did n't know what was going on with their vehicles . "
Ramos - Lopez was in the Travis County Jail yesterday with bond set at $ 3,000 .
The Associated Press could not find a working phone number for his family .
The Texas Auto Center dealership in Austin installs GPS devices that can prevent cars from starting .
The system is used to repossess cars when buyers are overdue on payments , said Jeremy Norton , a controller at the dealership where Ramos - Lopez worked .
Car horns can be activated when repo agents go to collect vehicles and believe the owners are hiding them .
" We are taking extra measures to make sure this never happens again , " Norton said .
Starting in mid-February , dealership employees noticed unusual changes to their business records .
Someone was going into the system and changing customers ' names , such as having dead rapper Tupac Shakur buying a 2009 vehicle , Norton said .
Soon , customers began calling saying their cars would n't start , or that their horns were going off incessantly , forcing them to disengage the battery .
Norton said the dealership originally thought the cars had mechanical problems .
Then employees noticed someone had ordered $ 130,000 in parts and equipment from the company that makes the GPS devices .
Police said they were able to trace the sabotage to Ramos - Lopez 's computer , leading to his arrest .
Norton said Ramos - Lopez did n't seem unusually upset about being fired .
I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing me .
Oh , and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill me .
BANGKOK , Thailand —
In the age of growing Chinese influence , there ’s a simple measure of a country ’s willingness to test China ’s wrath .
Will they stamp the Dalai Lama ’s passport ?
Add Thailand to the shrinking list of nations that wo n’t .
China is succeeding in its mission to globally ostracize the Tibetan monk , likely the world ’s best - known Buddhist and the face of Tibet ’s resistance to Chinese rule .
And despite Southeast Asia ’s entrenched Buddhism , China ’s diplomatic shadow has now blacked out the entire region for the Dalai Lama .
President Barack Obama is scheduled to meet the 74 - year - old monk on Feb. 18 at the White House , only after dodging a proposed sit - down last fall .
South Africa , fearing Chinese backlash , banned the Dalai Lama in advance of the 2010 World Cup .
In the few Asian countries that still allow his entry , officials generally dodge photo - ops and sit - downs with the spiritual leader , described by China ’s communist party as a “ jackal in monk ’s robes . ”
The Dalai Lama ’s popularity in America — where he ’s revered among conservative circles , left - leaning lawmakers and the Beastie Boys alike — is nearly matched in Thailand .
However , as in much of the world , the Dalai Lama ’s office says that Thailand has been quietly turning down the celebrity monk ’s visa requests .
Why would the Dalai Lama want to come to Thailand ?
He ’s routinely invited by various Thai institutions , said Tenzin Taklha , joint secretary of the India - based Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama .
An estimated 95 percent of Thais are Buddhist , making Thailand perhaps the world ’s most Buddhist nation .
Though the Dalai Lama practices Tibetan Buddhism — a more mystical branch compared to Thailand ’s conservative Theravada Buddhism — he is still highly regarded among Thais .
Thailand is also the base for one of the Dalai Lama ’s pet causes , democracy in military - dominated Burma and the release of imprisoned Burmese democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi .
Her supporters are rallying support in advance of Burma ’s 2010 elections and her possible release .
“ His Holiness the Dalai Lama last visited Thailand in 1993 when a group of Nobel Peace laureates held a solidarity meeting for fellow Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi , ” Tenzin Taklha said .
“ Since then , His Holiness has not been able to visit Thailand because of the refusal of the necessary visa from the Thai government , for reasons known to them . ”
Why wo n't Thailand allow him to enter ?
A visit would infuriate China , one of Thailand ’s largest trading partners , and likely poison trade and diplomatic relations .
The Dalai Lama is n’t explicitly barred through policy , said Chavanond Intarakomalyasut , secretary to the minister of foreign affairs .
“ Of course , we would consider it case by case , ” he said .
“ But , generally , we do n’t allow anyone to use Thailand as a base country to do any political activities or instigate violence in other countries . ”
The Thai foreign minister , Kasit Piromya , has indirectly acknowledged that a Dalai Lama invite would be an unwarranted insult to China .
Last year , he drew an oddly flattering parallel between the Dalai Lama and the fugitive billionaire and ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who is sought for arrest by the Thai government .
Thaksin is currently hopping the globe while organizing a movement to oust the ruling party .
Other countries should n’t shelter Thaksin , Kasit said , just as Thailand should n’t allow the Dalai Lama to criticize China from Thai soil .
Are there any Asian countries the Dalai Lama can still visit ?
A few .
The Dalai Lama ’s office is based in India , which borders Tibet and openly resents Chinese encroachment into its backyard .
He is sometimes allowed to speak in Japan , though officials typically keep their distance .
He is also occasionally granted access to Taiwan , China ’s bitter enemy , as well as Australia and New Zealand .
But a review of the Dalai Lama ’s travel schedule through the last two decades shows only two Southeast Asia visits : the 1993 Thailand visit and a 1992 trip to Indonesia .
The region is now too beholden to Chinese trade and aid to risk a Dalai Lama invite , said Kevin Hewison , director of the Carolina Asia Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
“ The U.S. being tied up in the Middle East left a void that China has intentionally filled , ” Hewison said .
“ China ’s trade , investment and aid in Southeast Asia has made it the most important player in the region now . ”
These relationships are mostly business - driven and require few diplomatic concessions .
“ But there are some things you ca n’t do , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t support Taiwan .
And you ca n’t push independence for Tibet .
It ’s self - censorship . ”
New Zealand anti-whaling activist Pete Bethune has been arrested after his Japanese captors delivered him to customs officials in Tokyo Harbour this afternoon .
Bethune was the Sea Shepherd skipper of the sunken boat the Ady Gil when he tried to board a Japanese whaling ship last month to arrest its captain for ramming his boat .
Authorities in Japan are now expected to spend the next few days deciding whether to charge Bethune with offences which carry a potential jail term .
The Minister for Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries , Hirotaka Akamatsu , has sent out a clear message to the world about its right to continue whaling in international waters .
" A person who did something bad should be strictly punished following the law , " he said .
The chief cabinet secretary , Hirofumi Hirano , also spoke publicly , even before the arrest had been officially made .
" I do n't think this will deteriorate our relationship with Australia , " he said .
Soon afterwards , Japanese media helicopters caught a glimpse of Bethune with a blue sheet covering his face , back on dry land in Tokyo Harbour .
Coast guard officers escorted him away from the Shonan Maru 2 .
Later in a media conference , the officials said that Bethune nodded and accepted his arrest without protesting .
They also revealed that New Zealand consular officials and his lawyers would be able to visit him in custody soon .
Back in his home town of Hamilton , Bethune 's family was angry and upset .
Mary Russell
Bethune says her stepson has been out of contact for a month .
She says he was in contact with his wife on Valentine 's Day , but that was the last contact the family has had with him .
" You imagine putting yourself in my shoes and seeing how you feel , " she said .
" It 's a terrible , worrying concern and we just hope that Sea Shepherd and the New Zealand and Australian governments are going to be able to step in and be able to do something to help Pete . "
Her husband and Pete Bethune 's father , Don , says his son is prepared to pay a price for his principles .
But Mr Bethune says his son is not easily frightened by discomfort or risk .
" If it was necessary he would [ go to jail ] , there 'd be no squealing from him .
One might say he takes what society decides to give him , " he said .
Japan 's whaling fleet is operated by the Institute of Cetacean research .
Its New Zealand spokesman , Glen Inwood , thinks the Japanese public want the government to take a hard line against Bethune .
" They want these people dealt with because they 're tired of Japanese people being put at risk by the actions of this , " he said .
" Really Japan 's whaling is purely legal which means that anything Sea Shepherd does is purely illegal . "
The opossum is generally about the size of a pet cat
Pennsylvania police have charged a man with public drunkenness after reports that he tried to resuscitate a long - dead opossum on a highway .
State police said several witnesses had seen Donald Wolfe , 55 , tending to the roadkill about 65 miles ( 105 km ) north - east of the city of Pittsburgh .
One reported seeing Mr Wolfe kneeling before the animal and gesturing as though he were conducting a seance .
Another reported seeing him give mouth to mouth resuscitation to the carcass .
State police Trooper Jamie Levier said the animal had been dead a while , the Associated Press news agency reports .
The opossum , colloquially known as a possum , is about the size of a domestic cat .
Such animals are known to feign death when threatened , giving rise to the phrase " playing possum " .

" AI War breaks most of the genre ’s rules .
Which is precisely why it ’s incredible …
This out - of - the - blue one - man passion project is one of this year ’s finest strategy games . "
- Alec Meer , PC Gamer UK , November 2009
It ’s a balancing act , with your own strength on one side , and the AI ’s opinion of you on the other .
Piss it off before you ’re ready to face it , and you ’re going to get squashed .
That moment , when you ’re finally in a position to turn the tables , is about as glorious as gaming gets .
- Phill Cameron , Eurogamer , February 2011
I think I ’ve stumbled across this year ’s Really New Thing .
There ’s a lot of 2009 to go , but I ’ll be surprised if anyone else twists the RTS formula this dramatically and this effectively .
And I ’m hoping it ’ll be the Next Big Thing , because it ’s big , different , entirely unprecedented and an exciting way to play an RTS .
- Tom Chick , Crispy Gamer , August 2009
Having played this title at two distinct points in its life cycle what really stands out is the incredible dedication of Arcen Games in keeping on top of how the game evolves and expands .
Even though a great many features have been added and tweaked and refined , it was possible for me to drop back into AI War after more than a year away and not find it to be a confusing mish - mash of feature overload .
The post - release support is , quite honestly , the best I ’ve seen for any game .
- Peter Parrish , IncGamers , February 2011
AI War is , quite simply , the best experience you could have with co-op or single - player real - time strategy in this or any year .
It combines grand strategy with emergent AI to form an excellent game perfect for parties and multiplayer .
It is easily worth double the price that the developer is selling it at , and anyone with any affinity or taste for strategy games should not miss it .
It may be daunting at first , but an excellent tutorial and amazing gameplay mechanics alleviate this into a game that almost anyone can - and should - play .

The Westboro Baptist Church compound in Topeka , Kansas , looks like the deck of a battleship in distress .
A two - layer gunwale — a hedge outside a wooden fence — protects the property , and three flagpole masts rise from the front yard inside .
The largest pole , closest to the street , flies a tattered Canadian flag above a tattered American one .
Closer to the side of the property where the entrance is , two more poles fly the humble Kansas and Topeka flags .
All four flags are upside - down .
The only thing right side up is the twenty - foot “ www.godhatesamerica.com” sign on the side of the building , arranged like George W. Bush ’s “ Mission Accomplished ” banner on the USS Abraham Lincoln .
Westboro ’s astonishingly long - winded SOS , abbreviated as “ God Hates Fags , ” is the apotheosis of our shrill political rhetoric these days .
You might describe it as a poetic shit - fit .
For decades now , for the Reverend Fred Phelps and his followers , the threat level has been at red if not infrared .
It ’s the purest form of the language of death panels , of the zoo ’s African lion and the White House ’s lyin ’ African , of stem cell research portending the Final Solution .
I do n’t mean to tar the teabaggers with God Hates Fags as a cheap shot because both are pro-life and anti-gay marriage ; liberals use this paranoid , turned - up - to - eleven language too , though perhaps not as successfully .
In 2004 , a Democrat warned me that if Bush was reelected , there “ might not be any more elections . ”
This rhetoric is absurd and empirically lazy ; at the same time it ’s emotionally irresistible , whether you find it appealing or appalling .
I visited Westboro one Sunday morning a couple of years ago , walking up to the side of the property near the Topeka flag ( a faded green , gold , and white banner with a seal for the “ Golden City ” ) .
A preadolescent boy scurried from an emerald minivan to the building and back .
The van ’s sliding door was still open when I reached the padlocked gate .
The boy was in back , and two women sat up front .
Both were plain in a way anachronistic Christians often are — stocky , old world , anti-glamorous .
The younger woman in the passenger seat wore a headscarf that reminded me of Hutterite uniforms in other parts of the Great Plains .
The boy was noticeably uncool for his age .
“ Do you , um , know where the entrance is ? ” I asked , peering into the van .
“ The entrance is usually here , but it ’s locked now , ” the driver replied helpfully .
“ Sorry . ” I backed away , waiting for the church elders to arrive and unlock the door .
I was still ten minutes early for the 11:30 service .
I stood shifting my weight in the half - shade of their trees , little Jacob ’s ladders of light dropping between the leaves .
The day was already over ninety degrees .
I left a reporter ’s notebook sticking out of my back pocket to reveal the fact that I was a writer without actually saying so .
After a moment , the green minivan ’s door slid shut , and inexplicably my hatemonger friends sped away .
I kept waiting in the heat .

With a few dozen members and a fax machine , Reverend Phelps and his church began making headlines in the early 1990s , picketing the funerals of gay AIDS victims with messages like “ AIDS Is God ’s Curse ” and “ Fags Die , God Laughs . ”
In 1994 , a dozen Westboro members lasted about thirty seconds outside the San Francisco funeral of gay journalist Randy Shilts ( author of And the Band Played On ) before being escorted away by police in a hail of eggs and fruit .
In 1998 , the church upped the ante — in a triumph of First Amendment over Sixth Commandment — by celebrating the murder of Matthew Shepard at his funeral in Laramie , Wyoming .
Soon , with the advent of the Internet ’s arms race of outrageousness , in which visitors link and flock to the bizarre , Westboro assembled one of the most fearsome fleets : God Hates Fags , God Hates America , God Hates Canada , God Hates Sweden , Priests Rape Boys , Signs of the Times , and Smell the Brimstone .
Dot com .
In time , the anti-gay protests lost their novelty .
Not content to be a freak show , and facing a protracted drought of gay AIDS funerals , the church changed course , and through a leap of logic comprehensible only in the distorted gravity of publicity - making , began in 2005 a campaign picketing the funerals of soldiers killed in the Iraq War .
They now aimed to disgrace some of the last sacred cows in America , proclaiming “ Thank God for IEDs , ” “ Thank God for Sept. 11 , ” and “ Thank God for Dead Soldiers . ”
The soldiers , they preach , are dying in retribution for our modern Sodom ’s tolerance of gays ( “ They turned America / Over to fags ; / They ’re coming home / In body bags . ” ) , and for its intolerance of God ’s “ anointed ” and His “ prophets ” at Westboro Baptist .
In May 2006 , Congress passed and President Bush signed the “ Respect for America ’s Fallen Heroes Act , ” prohibiting demonstrations within an hour of a funeral at a national cemetery .
At least twenty - two states have passed similar laws .
In October 2007 , a federal jury in Baltimore awarded $ 10.9 million in damages to the father of a Marine whose funeral Phelps and crew had picketed .
A federal judge later limited the damages to $ 5 million , and in September 2009 , the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the case , ruling the demonstrations protected free speech .
More recently Westboro has expanded its targets to include New York synagogues and even Barack Obama ’s daughters — in November , church members picketed outside the Sidwell Friends School because , according to a statement reported by Talking Points Memo , it had allowed “ the most bloody , deceitful , evil , murderous bastard and his shemale sidekick to place their satanic spawn within [ its ] four walls . ”
Their invective , in innumerable press releases , memos , and picket signs , has a radioactive wrath that , sincere as their hatred is , is not unselfconsciously funny .
It reminds me of the Wizard of Oz ’s booming , alliterative insults to scare the Tin Man — “ you clinking , clanking collection of caliginous junk ! ” — and the Scarecrow — “ you billowing bale of bovine fodder ! ”
Westboro ’s endless temper tantrum does nothing good for civic debate .
It ’s the gospel of insignificant egomaniacs who want to be significant .
And directly or indirectly , it ’s the model for other rhetorical stuntmen and - women angling to get on cable television .
“ You ca n’t describe it , your adrenaline ’s going , ” Fred Phelps Jr. once told a reporter .
“ It ’s almost like you could get hooked . ”
How many news cycles have been given over to providing the Phelps clan ( almost all church members are relatives ) with the erotic jolt of staking out the most outrageous position possible ?
We ( ahem ) should deny them any more airtime .
Still , it ’s hard not to be drawn in by their language , both as shocking , stifled - laugh comedy and as fight - picking .
I ca n’t deny the appeal of a line like “ For all eternity , Liz Taylor will be tormented with fire and brimstone , everlasting fire , eternal punishment , shame and everlasting contempt , the resurrection of damnation , tribulation , wrath , indignation , anguish … ”
Or the elegant Calvinist antimetabole of “ God does not hate them because they are homosexuals ; they are homosexuals because God hates them . ”
Fred Phelps is Walt Whitman ’s evil twin , generating an overflowing word count of hate - filled , exclusionary , overwrought , antique , hyperbolic , unedited provocation .
Glenn Beck is a poseur , a Hallmark card , by comparison .
*
American art brut poet Fred Phelps grew up Methodist in Meridian , Mississippi .
He graduated from high school at sixteen and secured a place at West Point , but was n’t yet old enough to attend .
During his year off , he heard the Call at a tent revival .
Within six months , in early 1947 , the honor student , Eagle Scout , and Golden Gloves boxer had traded West Point for Bob Jones University and Methodism for Baptism .
On a mission trip to Vernal , Utah , after his first semester , Phelps was ordained as a Southern Baptist minister and baptized in a mountain stream .
In Vernal , he was trying , at times in physical danger , to convert small - town Mormons to Baptism .
Before long he tasted media publicity as an evangelical tool .
In 1951 , at age twenty - one , Phelps [ described as “ a tall ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) , craggy - faced engineering student ” ] appeared in Time magazine after drawing large crowds — and ultimately the police — outside a college in Pasadena , California , by protesting students ’ “ promiscuous petting ” and “ teachers ’ filthy jokes in classrooms . ”
Phelps , his wife , and the first of their thirteen children moved from Pasadena to Topeka in 1954 and soon set up Westboro as a Primitive Baptist church .
( The Topeka Capital - Journal published the fullest biography of Phelps in a weeklong series in 1994 . )
Ten years later , still preaching every Sunday and on the radio besides , Phelps earned a law degree .
For many years , he seemed content to antagonize local institutions and enemies from his pulpit and often in the courtroom .
His legal career was simultaneously quixotic and petty — dare I say nobly so ?
He had a vicious , intelligent courtroom manner and was inclined to take on cases for poor clients against the government or institutions .
Indeed , he says he went to law school to fight against the kind of racial injustice he saw growing up in Mississippi .
Westboro ’s short monograph on the God Hates Fags site emphasizes how Phelps represented “ longsuffering ” Kansas blacks in civil rights cases in the years just after Topeka ’s famous 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case .
He won a $ 19,500 settlement against the Topeka school board in 1978 for providing an inferior education to a black student and thus failing to honor the Brown ruling .
The next year he represented several victims of a police raid on a black American Legion hall , in which over fifty women were strip - searched for drugs and weapons .
He received civil rights awards into the 1980s , including one from a small - town Kansas chapter of the NAACP that noted his “ steely determination for justice . ”
However disappointingly , Phelps is not above using racist rhetoric in other fights ; a number of subsequent Westboro faxes cited by the Captial - Journal referred to miscellaneous Phelps enemies as “ black trash , ” “ black thug , ” and “ incompetent black whore . ”
In February 2009 , the church wrote in an open letter to Barack Obama , “ You are a Muslim .
Your mother was a promiscuous white female tramp , and your father was a run -of - the - mill , black , deadbeat dad who abandoned you and your mother and fled to more fertile breeding grounds in Africa . ”
In 1983 , Phelps sued the local Washburn University when some of his children were denied admission to the law school there .
First he sued on the grounds that they should be admitted as minorities because the family law firm ( eleven of the thirteen children ultimately became lawyers ) represented black clients in civil rights cases .
When that argument failed , he sued for reverse discrimination , claiming that less qualified black students had been admitted before his white children .
Phelps also sued President Ronald Reagan for breaching the wall between church and state by appointing an ambassador to the Vatican .
( His respect for this wall only goes so far : the church demands that “ All nations must immediately outlaw sodomy , ” and , according to Mosaic law in Leviticus , “ impose the death penalty , ” presumably by stoning . )
In 1973 , two of his teenage sons sought to purchase a $ 184.59 , twelve - inch color TV set on layaway from the local Sears .
When , after two months , they made their final payment , Sears had sold the TV to another customer and ordered another .
Phelps promptly filed a $ 50 million class - action suit against Sears Corporation , claiming to represent a million layaway customers .
After six years of litigation , he ultimately settled for $ 126.34 .
In 1974 , a county court reporter in Topeka failed to deliver a trial transcript to him on time .
Phelps sued the court reporter for $ 22,000 , declared her a hostile witness and grilled her on the witness stand for three days .
As a result of this case , and a pattern of witch - hunt courtroom behavior leading up to it , he was disbarred from Kansas state court in 1979 .
Ten years later he was barred from federal court .
He promptly ran for governor of Kansas in 1990 , receiving 6 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary , and unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 1992 and governor again in 1994 .
Not long after his law career ended , in 1991 , Westboro members first picketed against gays trysting in Topeka ’s Gage Park , and they have n’t let a week go by since without displaying their “ God Hates Fags ” signs there .
How did a civil rights lawyer come to advocate mass executions of a small minority group ?
Poking the eyes of the powers that be in the name of justice was not an unthinkable prelude to Phelps ’s God Hates Fags work .
He embodied and still embodies the fearlessness and righteousness and self - righteousness that characterize many political activists , both right and left wing .
His is an iconoclastic and , as the NAACP award put it , steely Christianity .
Here are celebrated traits in their purest form , distilled beyond practical use to the point of being either ridiculous or poetic , or both .
*
Fred Phelps ’s personal volatility is not what one might expect from the leader of God ’s elect , unless one expects a terribly wrathful God .
When his children were young , Phelps allegedly beat them in Old Testament - like fits of fury , with a belt or with the handle of a mattock grub - axe .
One Christmas , according to two of his sons who later defected from the church , Phelps beat them with the mattock for two or three hours .
“ Mark was about to pass out a couple of times , and my mom would take him over to the bathtub to wipe his face off , ” Nate Phelps told the Capital - Journal in 1994 .
The boys ’ crime had been to unscrew Christmas light bulbs from a neighbor ’s house and toss them to pop on the street .
Beyond the crime of vandalism , the boys had indirectly supported the “ pagan ” holiday of Christmas ( “ never , ever , ever , ever even one time mentioned in the Bible , ” says godhatesfags.com ) .
Nate and Mark Phelps described their father becoming possessed by anger —
“ It was n’t the same human ” — and smashing dishes and jars of ketchup , mustard and mayonnaise across the kitchen , pushing their mother down the stairs , dislocating her arm , or beating her with the mattock stick because he “ was n’t happy about her weight . ”
After the Capital - Journal printed Mark and Nate Phelps ’s accusations , five siblings still loyal to the church publicly refuted the abuse charges , though they acknowledged that they were spanked with a belt and a hairbrush .
In 2006 , an Associated Press journalist described Phelps ’s contradictory nature as one of abrupt changes : “ He laughs , then looks sullen .
Calls a granddaughter ‘ love bug , ’ but is then set off in a brief tirade on Jews . ”
Though God ’s true list of the chosen never changes , Phelps ’s divining of that list may ; in 2005 , according to the AP story , a 52 - year - old man was voted out of the elect and permanently cut off from his wife and children .
After Mark Phelps left the church of his own free will ( so to speak ) , he told the Capital - Journal about a time he ran into his father at the Topeka YMCA .
Fred Phelps said to him , “ I hope God kills you . ”
Westboro ’s theology is essentially sixteenth - century Calvinism with an obsessive homophobic bent and a strain of Branch - Davidian cultism .
Virtually God ’s entire predestined “ elect ” worldwide just happen to be the seventy - five or so members of Westboro Baptist Church , almost all of whom happen to be Phelps family members .
Mainstream members of the Religious Right are “ lukewarm cowards ” and “ Pharisees . ”
The website declares , “ The maudlin , kissy - pooh , feel - good , touchy - feely preachers of today ’s society are damning this nation and this world to hell . ”
*
I waited well past 11:30 , ringing the doorbell a few times and hearing occasional phantom noises inside .
A white quarter - ton pickup truck with a teenage boy at the wheel slowed nearby , and I noticed a stack of colorful signs in the bed .
“ Fags Doom Nations . ” “ God Is Your Enemy . ”
The boy looked toward me and the church , shook his head , and drove on .
Then I saw a couple walking across the far side of the churchyard , having entered through a tiny entrance in the opposite corner of the fence ; a woman and a teenage boy followed a minute later .
“ Excuse me ! ” I called out .
They did n’t turn their heads .
Finally , fully sweaty at 12:15 pm , I gave up and walked back to my car .
Two days later , I called to ask why there was no service .
The woman on the phone , I assumed , was Shirley Phelps - Roper , Fred Phelps ’s daughter , who in her father ’s advanced age has taken the helm as spokesperson for Westboro .
Church was held earlier in the morning , it seemed .
Several church members had traveled that day to Wolf Creek , Montana , to celebrate God ’s retribution against Senator Max Baucus .
( “ Sen .
Baucus voted twice recently to condemn WBC ’s funeral pickets .
‘ Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord . ’
Romans 12:19 , ” said a Westboro press release . )
Marine Corporal Phillip E. Baucus , the senator ’s nephew , had died in combat in Iraq a week earlier , and his funeral in Montana coincided with my visit to Topeka .
“ You need to be there when the service is happening , ” she told me .
“ We ’re not going to go to extraordinary lengths to help someone who is just curious .
That ’s not our job . ”
( Westboro ’s incorporation papers as a tax - exempt organization state that “ all persons whatsoever are wanted , welcome and invited . ” )
As I listen to the MP3 recording of the sermon I missed , I am surprised at Phelps ’s measured speech .
He has the professional tone of an old - time radio newsman , with only a trace of his Mississippi drawl remaining .
But he works himself into a quiet tirade addressing his flock ( “ ye seed of Israel , his servants … ye children of Jacob , his chosen ones ” ) .
He winds the congregation through an encyclopedic recall of scripture and his own nearly biblical language in slow , serpentine sentences :
We ’re not just whistling Dixie when we say to these people that jump on us that they ’re playing with fire , and that they are in fact pouring gasoline on the flaming fires of God ’s wrath that ’s presently being poured out on this evil nation , and is guaranteed to get worse and worse soon and with each passing day .
We have a message for this evil country , and at their peril do they continue to not only ignore it , but to retaliate against us for even daring to preach it .
Sharp declarations punctuate this speech : “ They shall fall .
They ’re going to hell .
They ’re going to reap destruction .
They ’re going to reap nothing but misery . ”
Finally , his voice becomes grandfatherly and gentle , and he says , “ And everybody will know that it ’s for thy sake , it ’s for the sake of Westboro Baptist Church that those guys keep getting slaughtered and sent home in little pieces from Iraq . ”
I imagine myself in a pew , hypnotized by the queered tent - revival clichés ( pouring gasoline on the flaming fires of God ’s wrath , which is itself being poured on America ?
Um , amen to that ) , and at the same time wanting to leap up and start shaking people as hard as I can ( Are you serious ?!
Wake up , you fucking morons ! ) .
This is the Eagle Scout ’s integrity and self - regard , the American bard ’s gluttonous , unedited style , and the firebrand ’s jaw - dropping rhetoric for which we have such an appetite , all taken to the violent frontier of sanity .
I hope Phelps ’s oeuvre can be anthologized someday , or put in a museum , so the timber in his eye can reveal the splinters in our own .

That 's what this RBC / ChangeWave 's surveys says .
Back in April 2007 , fewer people were interested in buying the original iPhone compared to those wanting to buy the iPad on February 2010 .
Does this mean the iPad would be a bigger success ?
Advertisement
Not necessarily .
It may mean that , but we do n't really know for sure .
First , back then the iPhone was completely unknown .
A new , unproven product , with no user base whatsoever .
Today , the iPhone and iPod are well known , so one could even argue that — given their massive popularity — a higher percentage of people would be interested in buying the iPad .
In other words , who knows .
Let 's wait until Apple actually makes the iPad available on their site .
There are other interesting data points .
One is the version people are most interested in :
The lowest end and the highest end win , with 19 % each .
With the 64GB Wi-Fi getting only 8 % and the 16GB Wi-Fi and 3G version getting 9 % of the interest .

Another interesting one : 68 % of the people interested in it want to surf the internet , 44 % for email , 37 % for eBooks , 28 % for the reading magazines and other periodicals , and only 24 % for watching video .

The defenseman showed up late to practice yesterday , so the Canucks told him not to bother showing up for the next few games .
Why was he late ?
We 've got an idea , and it'll come as no surprise to Vancouver fans .
Advertisement
He 's a healthy scratch for tonight , and the team has said he wo n't practice or play with them until Sunday at the earliest .
All this after being a bit tardy to a morning workout , but it 's clearly not an isolated occurence .
Obviously , there is more to this than just yesterday 's incident , " [ head coach Alain ] Vigneault said .
" So we 've got a plan for Shane O'Brien .
He will not be practising or be with the team until Sunday .
His situation then will be re-evaluated . "

Well , where was O'Brien that he could n't make it to GM Place on Monday ?
We 're not sure , but we 've got a pretty good idea as to where he was Sunday night .
Monday night , one Canadian journo hit the bars on Granville Street , the epicenter of Vancouver 's nightlife scene .
He tells us that at the Roxy , he was informed that O'Brien had been there the night before .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Another Roxy patron later confirmed O'Brien 's attendance .
So what 's the Roxy like ?
Picture that bar in your own hometown that tries too hard to be a dive .
It 's the first place college kids go when they hit drinking age .
It 's the place the suburban kids always hit on their Saturday nights in the city .
It 's the one that does St. Patrick 's Day with green beer .
Every city 's got a place like it .
And the Roxy just happens to be one of Shane O'Brien 's favorites .

His love of the place , or at least his frequent attendance there , is so well known that a Canucks message board poster suggested nicknaming him " Roxy . "
Then there 's the Puck Bunny who tells a story of meeting him there one night .
So how about this past Sunday ?
We do n't have any specifics of his night out on the town ( eyewitness reports are encouraged ) , but we do know one thing : Sundays are country music night at the Roxy !

A Greenpeace investigation has identified a little - known , privately owned US oil company as the paymaster of global warming sceptics in the US and Europe .
The environmental campaign group accuses Kansas - based Koch Industries , which owns refineries and operates oil pipelines , of funding 35 conservative and libertarian groups , as well as more than 20 congressmen and senators .
Between them , Greenpeace says , these groups and individuals have spread misinformation about climate science and led a sustained assault on climate scientists and green alternatives to fossil fuels .
Greenpeace says that Koch Industries donated nearly $ 48 m ( £ 31.8 m ) to climate opposition groups between 1997 - 2008 .
From 2005 - 2008 , it donated $ 25 m to groups opposed to climate change , nearly three times as much as higher - profile funders that time such as oil company ExxonMobil .
Koch also spent $ 5.7 m on political campaigns and $ 37 m on direct lobbying to support fossil fuels .
In a hard - hitting report , which appears to confirm environmentalists ' suspicions that there is a well - funded opposition to the science of climate change , Greenpeace accuses the funded groups of " spreading inaccurate and misleading information " about climate science and clean energy companies .
" The company 's network of lobbyists , former executives and organisations has created a forceful stream of misinformation that Koch - funded entities produce and disseminate .
The propaganda is then replicated , repackaged and echoed many times throughout the Koch - funded web of political front groups and thinktanks , " said Greenpeace .
" Koch industries is playing a quiet but dominant role in the global warming debate .
This private , out - of - sight corporation has become a financial kingpin of climate science denial and clean energy opposition .
On repeated occasions organisations funded by Koch foundations have led the assault on climate science and scientists , ' green jobs ' , renewable energy and climate policy progress , " it says .
The groups include many of the best - known conservative thinktanks in the US , like Americans for Prosperity , the Heritage Foundation , the Cato institute , the Manhattan Institute and the Foundation for research on economics and the environment .
All have been involved in " spinning " the " climategate " story or are at the forefront of the anti-global warming debate , says Greenpeace .
Koch Industries is a $ 100 bn - a - year conglomerate dominated by petroleum and chemical interests , with operations in nearly 60 countries and 70,000 employees .
It owns refineries which process more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day in the US , as well as a refinery in Holland .
It has held leases on the heavily polluting tar - sand fields of Alberta , Canada and has interests in coal , oil exploration , chemicals , forestry , and pipelines .
The majority of the group 's assets are owned and controlled by Charles and David Koch , two of the four sons of the company 's founder .
They have been identified by Forbes magazine as the joint ninth richest Americans and the 19th richest men in the world , each worth between $ 14 - 16bn .
Koch has also contributed money to politicians , the report said , listing 17 Republicans and four Democrats whose campaign funds got more than $ 10,000 from the company .
Greenpeace accuses the Koch companies of having a notorious environmental record .
In 2000 the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) fined Koch industries $ 30 m for its role in 300 oil spills that resulted in more than 3 m gallons of crude oil leaking intro ponds , lakes and coastal waters .
" The combination of foundation - funded front groups , big lobbying budgets , political action campaign donations and direct campaign contributions makes Koch Industries and the Koch brothers among the most formidable obstacles to advancing clean energy and climate policy in the US , " Greenpeace said .
A spokeswoman for Koch Industries today defended the group 's track record on environmental issues .
" Koch companies have consistently found innovative and cost - effective ways to ensure sound environmental stewardship and further reduce waste and emissions of greenhouse gases associated with their operations and products , " said a statement sent to AFP by Melissa Cohlmia , director of communication .
She added : " Based on this experience , we support open , science - based dialogue about climate change and the likely effects of proposed energy policies on the global economy . "

A Pennsylvania appellate court upheld a preliminary injunction on Wednesday barring local prosecutors from filing felony child - porn charges against a teenage girl who took a partially nude photo of herself with her cellphone .
The court said prosecutors were using the threat of charges as retaliation against the teen for exercising her constitutional right to refuse a voluntary reeducation program favored by the district attorney .
The court also determined it was likely the girl and her parents will succeed in a civil rights lawsuit they 've filed against the district attorney 's office .
Last year , District Attorney George P. Skumanick , Jr. , threatened to charge three teenage girls with felony child - porn violations over digital photos they took of themselves .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania filed a federal lawsuit against Skumanick on behalf of the girls and their parents accusing Skumanick of violating the girls ' civil rights .
The suit said they had a constitutionally protected right to appear in the pictures and that the threat to prosecute the minors was " unprecedented and stands anti-child - pornography laws on their head . "
The ACLU won a preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania barring the prosecutor from bringing criminal charges against the three girls , which the court granted .
Skumanick appealed .
The case dates back to October 2008 , when officials of the Tunkhannock School District in Wyoming County , Pennsylvania , discovered that male students were trading photos on their phones of female students in various states of undress .
Officials confiscated the phones and turned them over to District Attorney Skumanick .
Skumanick told an assembly of students that possessing inappropriate images of minors could get them prosecuted under state child - porn laws and , if convicted , they would face a possible seven - year sentence and a felony record .
Under a state law , they would also have to register as a sex offender for 10 years and have their name and photo posted on the state -s sex - offender website .
The prosecutor also sent a letter to about 16 students – three boys and 13 girls – who either appeared in the images or were found in possession of them .
In a meeting with the students and their parents , he said he would file felony charges against the students unless they agreed to six months of probation , among other terms .
He gave the parents 48 hours to agree .
The parents of three girls refused to sign .
Skumanick then threatened to charge the girls with producing child pornography unless their parents agreed to the probation and sent the teenagers to a five - week , 10 - hour education program .
The program was designed in part by the district attorney 's office to discuss why what they did was wrong and what it means to be a girl in today ’s society .
The girls would also have to submit to drug testing .
When one parent asked Skumanick how his daughter , who appeared in a picture wearing a bathing suit , could be charged with child porn , Skumanick responded that she was posing " provocatively , " according to court documents .
The parents of three teenaged girls balked at the threats and filed the original suit against Skumanick .
While the decision was on appeal , Skumanick determined that he would not bring criminal charges against two of the teens , so the injunction upheld this week applies only to one girl , identified as " Nancy Doe " in court documents .
The girl had photographed herself outside a shower with a towel wrapped around her waist and her breasts bared .
The state law makes it a felony to possess or distribute images depicting a minor engaged in a sex act or the " lewd " depiction of genitalia or nudity that is meant to arouse or titillate .
" Just depicting nudity could be considered a sex act , " Skumanick told Threat Level last year , adding that the shower photo " is child porn under the statute . "
Skumanick was voted out of office last year , but the lawsuit continues against the current district attorney 's office .
In addition to accusing prosecutors of violating the civil rights of the teens , the suit accuses the DA of violating the parents ' 14th Amendment right to direct their children 's education and upbringing by forcing the students to participate in the DA 's program .
In ruling against the DA 's office , the appellate court stated the prosecutor does not have authority to " coerce parents into permitting him to impose on their children his ideas of morality and gender roles . "
The practice of taking nude or semi-nude self - portraits and distributing them via a cellphone or the internet has come to be called " sexting " and has resulted in teens being arrested in a number of states under child - porn production , distribution and possession charges .

UNEDITED TRANSCRIPT
This all black - feathered king penguin could be ‘ one in a zillion . ’
The video was recorded on the Sub-Antarctic Island of South Georgia by National Geographic Traveler Magazine contributor editor Andrew Evans on his bus2Antarctica expedition .
While many king penguins and other penguins can have feather - coloring mutations , usually , the variations are partial .
Dr. Allan Baker , an ornithologist and head of the Department of Natural History at the Royal Ontario Museum , called the discovery of the ‘ all - black ’ king penguin “ astonishing . ”
He jokingly said ” it ’s a one in a zillion kind of mutation , ” and scientifically calls it ‘ very rare . ’
He explains that typically , melanistic birds will have white spots where melanin pigmentation has failed to color the feathers .
But it ’s extremely rare for there to be melanin deposits over the entire breast of a bird .
Photographer Evans says he almost did n’t get the sighting recorded .
As he got his camera positioned , the penguin started walking away .
Sometimes you can find really great things on the side of the road .
Whether it be furniture that someone has dumped or a great classic car that some poor schlep is selling ( probably because his wife is making him or killing him in a divorce ) , there are deals and steals along the highways and roads you travel .
Check out this great find : Amber Lynn Bach running along in a tight and tiny top , jugs a'jiggling and bouncing .
This is a deal , buddy .
All you have to do is pull over , suddenly take up jogging , bump into her and get her to come up to your place nearby and suck your dick .
That seems pretty simple , right ?
Now we are not saying that this kind of thing happens every day , but sometimes , a little effort goes a long way and you can actually end up with a hot , stacked fox like Amber on your dick .

PAYCHECK PAYCHECK
The typical federal worker is paid 20 % more than a private - sector worker in the same occupation .
Median annual salary : Federal Private Difference $ 66,591 $ 55,500 $ 11,091 Sources : Bureau of Labor statistics , USA TODAY analysis Federal employees earn higher average salaries than private - sector workers in more than eight out of 10 occupations , a USA TODAY analysis of federal data finds .
Accountants , nurses , chemists , surveyors , cooks , clerks and janitors are among the wide range of jobs that get paid more on average in the federal government than in the private sector .
Overall , federal workers earned an average salary of $ 67,691 in 2008 for occupations that exist both in government and the private sector , according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data .
The average pay for the same mix of jobs in the private sector was $ 60,046 in 2008 , the most recent data available .
CHART : Federal salaries compared to private - sector
These salary figures do not include the value of health , pension and other benefits , which averaged $ 40,785 per federal employee in 2008 vs. $ 9,882 per private worker , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis .
Federal pay has become a hot political issue in recent months because of concerns over the federal budget deficit and recession - battered wages in the private sector .
Sen. Scott Brown , R - Mass. , made federal pay an issue in his successful campaign to fill Edward Kennedy 's seat and is fighting for a pay freeze .
The federal government spent about $ 224 billion in 2008 on compensation for about 2 million civilian employees .
" The data flip the conventional wisdom on its head , " says Cato Institute budget analyst Chris Edwards , a critic of federal pay policy .
" Federal workers make substantially more than private workers , not less , in addition to having a large advantage in benefits . "
But National Treasury Employees Union President Colleen Kelley says the comparison is faulty because it " compares apples and oranges . "
Federal accountants , for example , perform work that has more complexity and requires more skill than accounting work in the private sector , she says .
" When you look at the actual duties , you see that very few federal jobs align with those in the private sector , " she says .
She says federal employees are paid an average of 26 % less than non-federal workers doing comparable work .
Office of Personnel Management spokeswoman Sedelta Verble , says higher pay also reflects the longevity and older age of federal workers .
USA TODAY used Bureau of Labor Statistics data to compare salaries in every federal job that had a private - sector equivalent .
For example , the federal government 's 57,000 registered nurses — working for the Veterans Administration and elsewhere — were paid an average of $ 74,460 a year , $ 10,680 more than the average for private - sector nurses .
The BLS reports that 216 occupations covering 1.1 million federal workers exist in both the federal government and the private sector .
An additional 124 federal occupations covering 750,000 employees — air - traffic controllers , tax collectors and others — did not have direct equivalents , according to the BLS .
Federal jobs have more limited salary ranges than private - sector jobs , some of which have million - dollar payouts .
Key findings : • Federal .
The federal pay premium cut across all job categories — white - collar , blue - collar , management , professional , technical and low - skill .
In all , 180 jobs paid better average salaries in the federal government ; 36 paid better in the private sector .
• Private .
The private sector paid more on average in a select group of high - skill occupations , including lawyers , veterinarians and airline pilots .
The government 's 5,200 computer research scientists made an average of $ 95,190 , about $ 10,000 less than the average in the corporate world .
• State and local .
State government employees had an average salary of $ 47,231 in 2008 , about 5 % less than comparable jobs in the private sector .
City and county workers earned an average of $ 43,589 , about 2 % more than private workers in similar jobs .
State and local workers have higher total compensation than private workers when the value of benefits is included .
Job comparison Average federal salaries exceed average private - sector pay in 83 % of comparable occupations .

Nicotine may improve the symptoms of depression in people who do not smoke , Duke University Medical Center scientists have discovered .
The finding does not mean that people with depression should smoke or even start using a nicotine patch , the researchers caution .
They say that smoking remains the No. 1 preventable cause of death and disability in the United States , and that the addictive hazards of tobacco far outweigh the potential benefits of nicotine in depression .
But the finding suggests that it may be possible to manipulate nicotine 's effects to safely reap its potential medical benefits , according to the researchers .
As an example of the drug 's potential , they said , pharmaceutical companies already are developing compounds for treating other brain disorders by mimicking the beneficial properties of nicotine while avoiding its addictive nature .
" The hope is that our research on nicotine will spur the development of new treatments for depression , which is a huge public health problem , " said lead study investigator Joseph McClernon , Ph.D. , an assistant research professor of medical psychiatry and researcher at the Duke Center for Nicotine and Smoking Cessation Research .
" Our study also provides evidence that smokers may indeed smoke , in part , to improve their mood -- a notion that has been quite controversial in the field , " he said .
The team 's findings are scheduled to appear the week of Sept. 11 , 2006 , in the online edition of the journal Psychopharmacology and will be published in print in November .
The research was supported by the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression .
Scientists have established that people prone to depression are twice as likely to be smokers , and are less likely to succeed in quitting smoking after taking up the habit , according to McClernon .
The Duke study explored the theories behind the higher smoking rates among people experiencing depression .
" Smokers may be more prone to depression than nonsmokers , " said Edward Levin , Ph.D. , a professor of biological psychiatry and researcher at the Duke center , who was senior investigator in the current study .
" Or , people with depression may be self - medicating by smoking , albeit in a deadly way . "
In the study , the researchers recruited 11 people who did not smoke but who were experiencing symptoms of depression .
Participants were randomly assigned to wear either a nicotine patch or a placebo patch that did not contain any nicotine .
The researchers used a standardized method , a 20 - item questionnaire called the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale , to measure depression symptoms among the study participants .
" Despite the small number of participants , this is the largest study of its kind , " McClernon said .
The team found that participants who wore the nicotine patch for at least eight days experienced a significant decline in their depression - assessment rating scores .
McClernon said this finding indicates that the drug led to an improvement in depression symptoms .
As a possible explanation for how nicotine exerts its beneficial effect , McClernon said : " The same areas of the brain that are stimulated by nicotine appear to be involved in the regulation of mood . "
Nicotine stimulates the release of specific neurotransmitters , including serotonin , dopamine , and norepinephrine , which carry messages between nerves cells .
Depression has been linked to chemical imbalances of these neurotransmitters , McClernon said .
Looking ahead to possible therapeutic uses of nicotine for treating depression , the researchers say the nicotine molecule can be manipulated to remove its addictive effect while maintaining its ability to increase levels of the various brain chemicals that can alter mood .
Currently , pharmaceutical companies are developing nicotinelike drugs that target chemical imbalances in the brain that are thought to cause anxiety , schizophrenia , attention deficient hyperactivity disorder , Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease .
The study also suggests that people prone to depression may need extra help in order to quit smoking , such as nicotine replacement therapy , the scientists said .
Despite the positive effects of nicotine discovered in their study , the researchers emphasize that it is not currently appropriate for treatment of any medical disorder outside of nicotine dependence .
" I certainly recommend that people do n't smoke , " Levin said .
" If you do smoke , quit . "

The Spirit of Star Trek is a monthly educational series exploring the spiritual , philosophical , moral and ethical implications of Star Trek , held at the First Presbyterian Church , Encino .
The series is co-hosted by Academy Award - winning makeup artist Michael Westmore and Rev. Curtis Webster .
Each month , they screen an episode from one of the five Star Trek series and then discuss the episode with a special guest ( or guests ) associated with the episode .
Guests have included ; Armin Shimerman , Robert Picardo , Chase Masterson , and this months session features Roger Nygard ( director of Trekkies & Trekkies 2 ) and Daryl Frazetti ( Anthropolgy Professor & Trekkies / Trekkies 2 star ) .
Roger and Daryl will be on hand February 28 to screen portions of both documentaries and then to dig into the whys and the wherefores of our collective devotion to the Trek narrative .
When asked about the how attends and the motive behind the Spirit of Star Trek , Rev Webster Says " We have had people as guests from virtually anywhere on the spectrum in terms of faith : atheists , agnostics , Jews , Christians or whatever , My point never is to be pushing anything .
My point is to talk about the spiritual and ethical implications of the episode . "
" When you 're a pastor , you 're supposed to look for that thing you can do that nobody else can do .
It took me awhile , and I 'm sure that there 's somebody else who could do it .
But it 's a unique kind of ministry , it 's a unique way to be relating to the world . "
Webster Adds .

Officials say the stab-vests might draw attention to those wearing them South Africa 's authorities have condemned a London - based company which wants to sell stab-vests to visiting football fans during the World Cup .
The national police says the company was causing " unnecessary fear " .
South Africa 's football boss Kirsten Nematandani has assured visitors that all safety measures were in place .
South Africa has one of the world 's highest rates of violent crimes but the authorities say they will tighten security for the tournament .
Protektorvest , which currently sells its merchandise online , says there is a " high demand " for protective clothing and claim the stab-vests which cost close to $ 70 ( £ 43 ) are the " No 1 personal protection for the World Cup 2010 " .
Fans can add their national flag to the vest , or slogans such as " Free hugs " or " Ole " .
Protektorvest owner Sascha Cutura denied that the company was saying South Africa was unsafe .
" We fulfil a need from security - conscious people , " he told the BBC .
' Out of order ' Mr Nematandani chastised the company 's owners and called for them to be " condemned by their own country 's officials " .
" These people are out of order we 've never heard of such measures being taken before and there surely is no need for it , " he said , South Africa 's Times newspaper reports .
According to their website , the company plans to open offices near South Africa 's OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg for the duration of the World Cup .
Mr Cutura said this is where the company hopes to sell most of its vests .
The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says security officers usually advise foreign travellers to guard against " standing out " .
She says tourists wearing stab-vests at football matches or on sight - seeing trips may attract more attention to themselves - potentially increasing their chances of being attacked .
Mr Cutura pointed out that the vests could also be worn underneath clothes to avoid attracting too much attention .
Fan groups in England have also condemned the vests .

South Dakota State University researchers and their colleagues elsewhere in America and in France have found compelling evidence of a previously undocumented large volcanic eruption that occurred exactly 200 years ago , in 1809 .
The discovery helps explain the record cold decade from 1810 - 1819 .
Researchers made the finding by analyzing chemicals in ice samples from snow - capped Antarctica and Greenland in the Arctic .
The year - by - year accumulation of snow in the polar ice sheets records what is going on in the atmosphere .
" We found large amounts of volcanic sulfuric acid in the snow layers of 1809 and 1810 in both Greenland and Antarctica , " said Professor Jihong Cole - Dai of SDSU 's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , the lead author in an article published Oct. 25 , in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters .
Cole - Dai said climate records show that not only were 1816 -- the so - called " year without a summer " -- and the following years very cold , the entire decade of 1810 - 1819 is probably the coldest for at least the past 500 years .
Scientists have long been aware that the massive and violent eruption in 1815 of an Indonesian volcano called Tambora , which killed more than 88,000 people in Indonesia , had caused the worldwide cold weather in 1816 and after .
Volcanic eruptions have a cooling effect on the planet because they release sulfur gases into the atmosphere that form sulfuric acid aerosols that block sunlight .
But the cold temperatures in the early part of the decade , before that eruption , suggest Tambora alone could not have caused the climatic changes of the decade .
" Our new evidence is that the volcanic sulfuric acid came down at the opposite poles at precisely the same time , and this means that the sulfate is from a single , large eruption of a volcano in 1809 , " Cole - Dai said .
" The Tambora eruption and the undocumented 1809 eruption are together responsible for the unusually cold decade . "
Cole - Dai said the Tambora eruption was immense , sending about 100 million tons of sulfur gas into the atmosphere , but the ice core samples suggest the 1809 eruption was also very large -- perhaps half the size of Tambora -- and would also have cooled the earth for a few years .
The researchers reason that , because the sulfuric acid is found in the ice from both polar regions , the eruption probably occurred in the tropics , as Tambora did , where wind patterns could carry volcanic material to the entire world , including both poles .
Cole - Dai said the research specifically looked for and found a special indicator of sulfuric acid produced from the volcanic sulfur gas in the stratosphere .
The special indicator is an unusual make - up of sulfur isotopes in the volcanic sulfuric acid .
Isotopes are different types of atoms of the same chemical element , each having a different number of neutrons , but the same number of protons .
The unique sulfur isotope composition is like a fingerprint of volcanic material that has reached the stratosphere , said Cole - Dai .
The stratosphere is the second major layer of the Earth 's atmosphere , reaching from about six miles to about 30 miles above the Earth 's surface at moderate latitudes .
To impact global climate , rather than local weather , the sulfur gas of a volcanic eruption has to reach up into the stratosphere and once there , be spread around the globe .
Cole - Dai's co-authors of the article are SDSU post - doctoral researcher David Ferris and graduate student Alyson Lanciki ; Joël Savarino of the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Géophysique de l'Environment in Grenoble , France ; Mélanie Baroni of CEREGE ( Le Centre Européen de Recherche et d'Enseignement des Géosciences de l'Environnement ) at L'Université Paul Cézanne in Aix - en- Provence , France ; and Mark H. Thiemens of the University of California , San Diego .

Just like the Eye - Fi , the SIMFi runs its own integrated software , meaning there should n't be any special setup on your phone .
You pretty much just plug it into a phone and you 're good to connect a laptop , or any other Wi -Fi device , to the internet at 3G speeds .
But whether or not the SIMFi is coming to market under its own branding is unknown .
For the time being , it may just be a proof of concept that 's being shopped around to interested entities like AT&T or T - Mobile .

While you or I might think a wedding like this will look dated in a few years , the happy couple , Josh and Ting Li , allegedly met at an Apple Store , so there ’s that .
And the location holds a bit more significance to Josh , who confirmed the event to Entertainment Weekly .
“ We got to know each other because Ting was looking to buy an iPod … and I managed to strike up a conversation that way . ”
Romance blossomed for the two iLovebirds .
“ I used to joke that the Apple Store is my church because I am not religious , and I loved everything Apple , ” Josh adds .
“ Ting then came up with the idea of having the wedding there . ”
They have n’t decided yet where to have a reception , but I hear Cupertino is lovely this time of year . ”
The ring bearer was reportedly a first - generation iPod .
Sos Cuetara , a Spanish bottler of olive oil , agreed to buy oil brands , including the market leaders Bertolli and Dante , from Unilever for 630 million euros ( $ 1 billion ) .
Sos Cuetara , based in Madrid , gains labels that have about one - third of their sales in the Americas as it tries to reduce dependence on Europe .
Bertolli , founded in Tuscany in 1865 , is the world ’s biggest brand of olive oil , followed by Dante and Sos Cuetara ’s Sasso , according to Unilever , which has headquarters in London and Rotterdam .
The acquired assets generated 380 million euros in sales last year , compared with Sos Cuetara ’s 1.4 billion euros of annual revenue .

Google , Inc v. myTriggers.com , Inc. , 09 CV 14836 ( Franklin County Ct. of Common Pleas , Ohio ) .
Google filed its first amended complaint on January 20 , 2010 .
myTriggers filed an answer with counterclaims on February 2 , 2010 .
See both pleadings here .
About a year ago , Google was sued by an obscure company called TradeComet for various antitrust violations .
TradeComet ’s lawsuit was n’t the first private antitrust claim against Google ; other scrappy claims had arisen over the years .
However , none of them were serious challenges or went anywhere .
The TradeComet complaint looked equally low - merit , so I would have probably ignored it except that TradeComet ’s counsel was the NYC - based Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft — which also does antitrust work for Microsoft .
Those two facts could be completely unrelated , but it ’s possible that they are n’t .
First , I ca n’t imagine Cadwalader would jeopardize a lucrative relationship with a Fortune 50 company to take on a low - merit lawsuit for a no - name company .
Therefore , either Cadwalader viewed the various antitrust issues as so unrelated that no legal or business conflicts were created — a risky judgment given Microsoft ’s sensitivity about both Google and antitrust — or Microsoft approved / acquiesced to Cadwalader ’s representation of TradeComet .
Second , Microsoft has been engaged in a multi-year , multi - front effort to harass Google on antitrust issues , and Cadwalader ’s involvement would be consistent with that campaign .
I checked PACER today , and the TradeComet lawsuit is going nowhere fast .
Google filed a motion to dismiss in March 2009 , prompting an exchange of memos in April , and the last ( non-substantive ) PACER entry was in August .
It appears that everyone is waiting for the judge to rule on Google ’s motion to dismiss from almost a year ago .
Meanwhile , an intriguing and unexpected new antitrust battlefront has opened up .
myTriggers is run by NexTag alums and , IMO , has an even worse brand name than TradeComet .
Do a search for “ mytriggers ” and see if you can avoid juvenile giggles .
myTriggers ’ properties include three shopbots / shopping comparison websites : mytriggers.com , comparisonsearches.com and shopbig.com .
A quick review of these websites revealed no obvious reason why I would choose them over better - known shopbots .
As a result , I could see why these sites might have trouble generating organic traffic .
Therefore , I was n’t surprised to learn that myTriggers was a heavy AdWords advertiser .
myTriggers said that Google had extended it a $ 250,000 line of credit , and it incurred $ 200 k in AdWords charges for December 2007 .
Meanwhile , myTriggers clearly enjoyed its acquired traffic .
It did three multi-million rounds of financing ( the 2005 initial capitalization and rounds in 2006 and 2007 ) and leased a big datacenter in March 2008 .
But just as it was finalizing the lease , the bottom dropped out on myTriggers .
Google implemented a change to myTriggers ’ quality score , which ( according to myTriggers ) boosted its minimum bids 10 - 100X .
It ’s never good for margins when the price on a key input goes up 10X or more , and myTriggers subsequently fired almost all of its employees and effectively exited the market .
This left the pesky matter of Google ’s unpaid bill — to the tune of about $ 335 k , according to Google .
I ’m not sure how many of myTriggers ’ millions have n’t been spent , but clearly Google thought it was worth chasing this money .
It hired a ( presumably cheap ) local Ohio counsel and filed one of the shortest complaints I can recall seeing ( 2 sentences ! ) in myTriggers ’ local state courthouse — even though the AdWords contract appears to say that contract - related litigation * must * be adjudicated in Google ’s home court .
Other than the risk that myTriggers did n’t have the money , Google appears to have treated this as a routine and unexciting collections matter .
This is where the story gets weird .
Rather than plead poverty to Google or mount a generic but low - cost contract defense , myTriggers retained THREE law firms and also brought a counterclaim under Ohio ’s state antitrust law , the Valentine Act .
The three law firms are : ( 1 ) local Columbus counsel , presumably initially retained to handle the collections matter , ( 2 ) a Cincinnati firm that includes Stanley Chesley , Ohio bar # 852 ( ! ) , a litigator of some renown who has enough gravitas to impress most judges ; and ( 3 ) the same four - person DC - based antitrust team from Cadwalader that also represents TradeComet .
I am struggling to make sense of myTriggers ’ litigation choices .
Assuming myTriggers even has the money , writing a $ 335 k check to Google ( and I bet Google would have taken less ! ) is almost assuredly cheaper than paying three law firms to mount an antitrust assault on a $ 20B / year behemoth .
Assuming that myTriggers wants to maximize profits , then either ( 1 ) myTriggers thinks its odds are good enough that it will win AND make enough money to pay the 7 lawyers on the counterclaim ’s signature page plus their teams , or ( 2 ) the law firms struck an unbelievably sweet deal on fees .
Either way , how did Columbus - based myTriggers connect with the DC - based Cadwalader team ?
Did myTriggers independently call up Cadwalader ?
The TradeComet lawsuit got some press , but that was a year ago .
If myTriggers really thought it had a case , it might have preemptively sued Google rather than waiting for Google to sue it .
Did myTriggers get connected to Chesley for some reason , who then recommended bringing in Cadwalader ?
Did Cadwalader reach out to myTriggers ?
If so , I would like to know more how this happened and how this matter pertains to Cadwalader ’s relationship to Microsoft .
I ’m also confused about the relative roles of Chesley and Cadwalader .
It ’s not immediately obvious why myTriggers would need both Chesley and Cadwalader or be willing to fund both .
Whatever the case , I suspect the antitrust claims caught Google flat - footed .
A simple and low - stakes collections matter has blown up into a potentially significant lawsuit in an undesirable forum .
Google chose
Ohio state court for the collections matter despite its AdWords contract , so now it will have a tough time extricating itself from that court .
But I suspect it would rather have an antitrust case in federal court , not state court — often ( but not always ) federal judges are more sophisticated than state judges and less susceptible to hometown bias .
And I ’m sure Google would rather fight antitrust claims on one of the coasts than in the Rust Belt , especially if myTriggers argues that Google ’s evilness cost Ohioans jobs .
Google probably did n’t mean to offer battle in this venue , but someone did a really good job of seizing the opportunity and forcing Google to fight the battle in a suboptimal setting .
Although myTriggers ’ counterclaim is noticeably less well - drafted than the TradeComet complaint , the substance of myTriggers ’ antitrust counterclaim is similar to the TradeComet allegations .
The basic argument is the same : myTriggers argues that it ’s a competitor to Google and that Google raised ad prices on a competitor to squelch it .
As a result , I think this counterclaim is about as meritorious as TradeComet ’s — in other words , not so much .
That said , the counterclaim had a couple of interesting factual allegations .
First , in paragraph 12 of the counterclaim , myTriggers alleges that Google cuts special deals with selected shopbots so that their ads are not subject to the same quality scores as other advertisers .
( Compare paragraph 101 of the TradeComet complaint , which was n’t as clear that Google made these adjustments by agreement ) .
I would love to see one of the Google - shopbot agreements containing such a clause .
Could this just reflect some aspect of Google ’s standard algorithm that automatically preferences shopbots without any agreement ?
Or could the NexTag alums know something we do n’t ?
Second , Paragraphs 14 - 16 allege that Google manually maintains a “ whitelist ” that means that “ neither Google nor its ‘ search partners ’ will eliminate the company from the market , ” and a shopbot not placed on the whitelist “ is forever blacklisted by Google and its ‘ search partners . ’ ”
The TradeComet complaint does n’t have a directly analogous allegation , and I have no idea what this means .
If you have any thoughts or theories , I would welcome them .
These allegations should be subject to the Ohio equivalent to Rule 11 , so myTriggers should have some evidence in its possession to back this up .
I would love to see that evidence .
The GOP war against democracy continues to continue apace ...

[ UPDATED TWICE : Good news !
Morrissey quickly corrected his report after we notified him of the incorrect coverage .
Bad news !
His correction was also incorrect .
SECOND UPDATE : Morrissey has copped to his second error as well , and has finally corrected appropriately .
Details on all , at bottom of this article .
- BF ]
Once again , the accurate reporting of facts , truth , and reality does n't seem to be required when it comes to the Rightwing 's continuing , years - long attempt to villainize the community organization ACORN for having the temerity to help legally register millions of low - and middle - income voters ( who tend to vote Democratic ) to legally vote so that they may legally participate in their own democracy .
Latest example : Yesterday , Ed Morrissey of Hot Air --- a blog created by Rightwinger Michelle Malkin and recently purchased for an undisclosed sum by the far Rightwing Salem Communication outfit --- misreported [ emphasis added ] :
Today , [ Wisconsin ’s Attorney General J. B. ]
Van Hollen announced indictments in five cases — including two felony indictments against ACORN for scheming to have registrants vote multiple times in November 2008 .
Unfortunately , Morrissey and Hot Air are patently --- and apparently knowingly --- incorrect .
The " two felony indictments , " which Morrissey even links to [ PDF ] and quotes from in his inaccurate hit piece , are not " against ACORN , " but against two workers who defrauded ACORN , even as the pair defrauded the voter registration process ...
The indictment linked to by Morrissey even notes that an ACORN supervisor was the first to notice the fraudulent registrations .
( The pair allegedly registered each other multiple times , etc. , in order to meet what they believed were a minimum number of registrations needed to satisfy a level they claim the group required from workers .
The indictment describes no illegal votes that were either cast or counted . )
Charging that the " indictments were against ACORN " is as inaccurate as it would be to claim that Walmart has been charged with two counts of burglary after the company had found that two employees had stolen merchandise off its own shelves .
Look , there are plenty of legitimate concerns about real election fraud in Milwaukee .
The BRAD BLOG has investigated and reported on some of those those very serious concerns ourselves over the years , such as apparent forgery and / or ballot box stuffing by poll workers and the inflation of ballot totals by , perhaps , tens of thousands of votes .
Morrissey , on the other hand , is just making stuff up to continue the shameless Republican assault on verifiable truth and American democracy in order to meet his partisan agenda .
Just as Rightwing propagandists James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles were found by the Brooklyn D.A. 's office to have secretly videotaped ACORN workers there and then " edited the tape to meet their agenda " as part of their now - infamous ACORN " Pimp " Hoax , so has Morrisey 'edited the truth to meet his agenda . '
Morrissey and Hot Air owe their readers , our democracy , their new Salem Communication owners , Michelle Malkin , and the truth , an immediate and transparent correction .
Will they show more intellectual honesty than the New York Times , by issuing such a correction ?
We 'll see .
[ Hat - tip to BRAD BLOG commenter Ravenhairedmaid who , sadly , misreported the story as well after reading it at Hot Air . ]
* * *
UPDATE 1:25 pm PT : Morrissey wrote back to me quickly after I notified him via email of his inaccurate coverage .
To his credit , he wrote :
Brad , you 're right , that was sloppy --- they were indictments against ACORN employees , not the organization .
I 'll correct that and link back to you .
Thanks , and hope you 're doing well .
Cheers !
Ed Morrissey
Hot Air
He went on to change his original text , and added the following transparent update at the bottom of the article :
Update IV : Brad from Brad from Brad's
Blog takes me to task - rightly - for some very sloppy writing in my second paragraph .
The indictments were not filed against ACORN , but against two of their employees .
That 's not the same thing , and I 've corrected the paragraph to make it more specific and accurate .
I apologize for the confusion that caused anyone .
Unfortunately , the way he corrected his original text is still inaccurate .
He now writes [ emphasis added ] :
Today , Van Hollen announced indictments in five cases - including two felony indictments against two ACORN employees [ see update IV below ] for scheming to have registrants vote multiple times in November 2008 .
As I wrote to Morrissey in reply , I find nothing in the indictment about any scheme to to have registrants " vote multiple times " as he now reports .
Unless there is something that I missed , the indictment was about the employees having gotten registrants ( mostly each other ) to sign multiple registrations .
Period .
Clearly in an effort to try to keep their jobs ( as they believed was necessary ) .
There is nothing mentioned anywhere in the indictment about registrants voting multiple times , or the accused scheming to see them do so .
Will update further when I next hear back from Morrissey , as I 'd hope to soon ...
UPDATE 2:15 pm PT : Okay , have heard back from Morrissey again .
He writes :
Yeah , you 're right about that too , will make that reflect registrations , not voting attempts .
Cheers !
Ed Morrissey
Hot Air
After another quick change to the original text , in which he was misleading again ( he says he was trying to multitask while on air , and apologized for that version ) , he finally rewrote the text to adequately reflect the facts of the case , as such :
Today , Van Hollen announced indictments in five cases — including two felony indictments against two ACORN employees [ see update IV below ] for scheming to have people register multiple times in November 2008 .
He also added another update to the the bottom of his story , as follows :
Update V : The crimes related to registrations , not actual voting ; I ’ve amended that paragraph to show that .
We greatly appreciate Morrissey doing the right thing here , no matter how many hiccups along the way .
Wish New York Times , whose most senior editors are still refusing to correct their multiple misreported ACORN " Pimp " Hoax stories , would do the same !
UPDATE 3/10/10 8:10 pm PT
Ed Brayton of Michigan Messenger is far less charitable , and far more helpful ( in describing the details of Morrissey 's original distortion ) than I , over at ScienceBlogs in " Ed Morrissey Lies About ACORN " .

Legislation Would Also Create New System Of Interrogation
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
WASHINGTON – A bill introduced today in the Senate would hand the government the power to indefinitely detain terrorism suspects without charge or trial , dealing a swift blow to due process and the rule of law .
The Enemy Belligerent Interrogation , Detention and Prosecution Act of 2010 , introduced by Senators John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) , would also create an entirely new system of interrogation by requiring intelligence officials to be consulted about how to handle terrorism suspects after their capture .
The bill was precipitated by misguided objections to the Obama administration ’s correct decision to charge accused Christmas Day attacker Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in the criminal court system .
The legislation would have a “ high value detainee ” team , made up of members of different intelligence agencies , interrogate and determine whether alleged terrorist suspects are “ unprivileged enemy belligerents . ”
If so , and if the suspect is then charged , the legislation would mandate the use of the discredited and unconstitutional military commissions .
The American Civil Liberties Union vigorously opposes the Enemy Belligerent Interrogation , Detention and Prosecution Act .
The following can be attributed to Laura W. Murphy , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office :
“ The Enemy Belligerent Interrogation , Detention and Prosecution Act is a direct attack on the Constitution .
“ Indefinite detention flies in the face of American values and violates this country ’s commitment to the rule of law .
Over the last decade , we have seen how disregard for the rule of law has disastrous results for America ’s standing in the world , and it is unfathomable that Senators McCain and Lieberman would forget so recent a lesson .
We must forever put an end to the false and dangerous assumption that sacrificing our principles makes us safe .
We should never conclude that our ideals are not strong enough to withstand these threats .
“ Contrary to what some in Congress may believe , there is no significant class of prisoners who simultaneously cannot be prosecuted or safely released .
If evidence is too unreliable to prosecute someone , it is certainly too flimsy to detain them for the rest of their lives without an opportunity to defend themselves . ”
The following can be attributed to Christopher Anders , ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel :
“ Like indefinite detention , using military commissions is an abandonment of American values .
Our time - tested federal courts have proven themselves capable of handling terrorism cases while upholding due process .
Federal courts have produced over 300 terrorism - related convictions while the discredited military commissions have produced only three .
Using the commissions will result in years of delay due to legal challenges and will yield results mired in doubt .
Americans deserve better .
“ When it comes to terrorism , some lawmakers continue to underestimate the competence of our criminal justice system .
Our criminal justice system has proved repeatedly that it is capable of obtaining reliable intelligence from terrorism suspects , while that has not always been the case when we throw detainees into secret detention and discard all the rules .
Denying due process rights to our enemies defies the values we are fighting to protect .
The Constitution is not optional despite the efforts of these senators to render it so . ”
Video Madre de v�ctima encara a Calder�n .
Además de presentar la estrategia a seguir como parte de la lucha contra el crimen , Felipe Calderón ofreció disculpas a las familias de los jóvenes asesinados en días pasados y escuchó el testimonio de la madre de dos víctimas
[ email protected ] CIUDAD JUÁREZ , Chih . —
El presidente Felipe Calderón sólo la miraba .
Luz María Dávila se plantó ante la mesa que encabezaba el mandatario y le espetó : “ No puede ser que diga que eran pandilleros , si estudiaban y trabajaban ” .
Fue un encuentro inusual .
Doña Luz María le dijo que no podía darle la bienvenida ni saludarlo de mano .
Margarita Zavala , esposa de Calderón , se mostró impactada ante el reclamo .
“ Si usted perdiera un hijo buscaría hasta debajo de las piedras a los responsables , pero como yo no tengo esas posibilidades , no lo puedo hacer .
“ No me diga que sí , ¡haga algo , señor Presidente !
Queremos el Juárez de antes , no el sangriento ” .
Calderón asentía con la cabeza frente a la mujer que después rompería en llanto .
Desde el atril dispuesto en el centro social Cibeles le demandaron .
Pero desde los asientos la gente le hizo sentir su desesperación por la inseguridad , su desconfianza en la autoridad .
Quienes abrieron fuego ante el Presidente fueron doña Luz María y seis mujeres más .
Al comenzar las cuatro horas que duró el diálogo con la sociedad civil , se pararon de espaldas a Calderón en protesta .
Éste ni siquiera volteó a mirarlas en los 10 minutos de su intervención .
Fernando Gómez Mont , secretario de Gobernación , se movía en su asiento y miraba la escena , mientras Zavala nunca de dejó de hacer anotaciones .
Ciudad Juárez amaneció con más seguridad de la usual .
Al menos cinco helicópteros militares sobrevolaron la ciudad .
Soldados con catalejos se apostaron en la torre de control del aeropuerto y otros en las azoteas del centro social Cibeles , ubicado en la zona norte de Juárez , a unos 500 metros de la frontera con Estados Unidos .
Y si hay 10 mil soldados y policías federales cuidando de las calles por el operativo , descalificado horas antes por civiles y el obispo local , Renato Ascensio León , ayer fue más ostentosa esta vigilancia .
Eso mismo llevó al choque entre estudiantes y activistas , algunos con tapaboca , con la policía , a escasos 500 metros de donde Calderón dialogaba con los juarenses .
Los policías de plano los arrastraron cuando se tiraron al piso los manifestantes .
Ahí se quedaron , en el pavimento , casi tres horas , aunque eran un centenar de personas .
Golpe a Gómez Mont Adentro del centro social una mujer gritó : “ ¿A eso vino ( Calderón ) a la ciudad , a reprimir jóvenes ? ”
Ante la insistencia , el Presidente envió al secretario de Gobernación , Fernando Gómez Mont , a negociar con ellos .
Pero fue inútil , los jóvenes y manifestantes lo tacharon de “ asesino ” , “ represor ” , y cuando se retiraba de la multitud salió una mano que le alcanzó a dar un leve golpe en la cabeza .
El general David Rivera Bretón , jefe de la policía local , aseguró que los jóvenes obstruyeron el acceso al lugar , ubicado al norte de la ciudad y a unos 500 metros del río Bravo y por ello se actuó .
Ante el enfrentamiento , el legislador del PRD , Víctor Quintana , y Cipriana Jurado , del Centro de Investigación Popular , salieron para defender a los manifestantes , pero el cerco de seguridad les impidió acercarse .
La tensión adentro también le llovió al presidente municipal de Ciudad Juárez , el priísta José Reyes Ferriz , quien fue increpado y calificado de mentiroso por sus gobernados .
El alcalde se refería al esfuerzo de su administración para enfrentar la inseguridad y la violencia que padece el municipio , le reclamaron que no durmiera en esta ciudad .
“ Mientes , mientes ” , le gritaron al alcalde juarense , ante la mirada impávida de Calderón .
Reyes Ferriz afirmó que él es uno de los que se han quedado a dar la cara ante la problemática que vive Ciudad Juárez , pero fue abucheado por la concurrencia .
“ Bla , bla , bla ” , se burlaron entre los asistentes .
Tras cuatro horas de diálogo , Felipe Calderón dio por terminado el encuentro .

A survey in the area is now required to stand up some of the ideas
Deforestation has revealed what could be a giant impact crater in Central Africa , scientists say .
The 36 - 46 km - wide feature , identified in DR Congo , may be one of the largest such structures discovered in the last decade .
Italian researchers considered other origins for the ring , but say these are unlikely .
They presented their findings at the recent Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Texas , US .
The ring shape is clearly visible in the satellite image by TerraMetrics Inc reproduced on this page .
Only about 25 terrestrial impact craters are of comparable size or larger , according to the web - based Earth Impact Database .
Giovanni Monegato , from the University of Padova , said the feature was revealed only after trees were cleared from the area over the last decade .
The Unia River flows around the ring structure , underlining its round shape .
The central part of the Wembo - Nyama feature is irregular and about 550 m in elevation .
This is about 50 - 60 m higher than the depression where the river flows .
Although this might sound counter - intuitive , experts say that impact craters can sometimes lift up dense rocks .
The surrounding rocks may subsequently erode , leaving a dome .
Confirmation needed
The putative crater lacks a well - defined outer ridge , though the University of Padova team says this could be explained by deep weathering and erosion in the tropical climate .
They add that the drainage pattern in the ring is very similar to those found in large impact craters in humid environments .
LARGEST IMPACT CRATERS
The Chicxulub crater is buried under Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Vredefort : S Africa , 300 km - wide , 2 billion years old Sudbury : Canada , 250 km - wide , 1.8 billion years old Chicxulub : Mexico , 170 km - wide , 65 million years old Popigai : Russia , 100 km - wide , 35.7 million years old Manicouagan : Canada , 100 km - wide , 214 million years old Mr Monegato said the team would now have to travel to the region to carry out field studies .
Researchers would examine rocks from the site for tell - tale signs associated with space impacts .
These might include shocked quartz - a form of the mineral which occurs where rocks have been hit suddenly by a massive force .
It is found only at nuclear explosion sites and at asteroid impact sites .
Finding such evidence will be crucial to confirm an impact origin over other processes which might explain the structure .
The researchers have considered whether volcanism or salt diapirism ( a process where evaporite minerals intrude vertically into surrounding rock , forming dome - like structures on the surface ) could be responsible for the annulus .
But Mr Monegato and his colleagues say the known geology of the region - along with other features of the structure ( for example , no known salt diapirs reach such a great size ) - appear to rule out such explanations .
" I am quite optimistic about an impact crater origin for this ring , " Mr Monegato told BBC News .
If it is an impact structure , the scientists estimate it could have been punched into the crust by a space rock measuring about 2 km across .
Further studies will be required to accurately determine an age for the ring , but it appears to post - date the Jurassic Period .

16 - bit days
There were days when computers had 16 - bit registers and 20 - bit addressable memory .
That is a total of 1MB memory – some claimed that it ought to be enough for anybody .
Memory address space was flat and not protected by anything , now it ’s known as the real mode .
How was it possible to address 20 - bit memory with only 16 - bit registers ?
Well , it was necessary to use two registers .
One pointed to the high bits of physical location – a segment , the other was a relative offset .
Physical memory location was just counted as : segment * 16 + offset .
By the way , it was n’t possible to access more than 64KB data at a time – that ’s the maximum value for the offset .
32 - bit days
Years passed and we got 32 bit processors .
16 bit AX become 32 bit EAX , memory is n’t flat any more ( for simplicity , let ’s skip the 286 ) .
Protected mode with paging and proper access restrictions replaced good old flat real mode .
Using 32 - bit registers you could address up to 4GB RAM – that sounded like more than enough .
Almost no - one cared about segment registers any more .
The funny thing is that they are still there , deep in your CPU , but they are forgotten .
For years they were used only by OS kernel , but recently they started to play a completely new role .
First let me explain how they behave in a protected mode .
As opposed to general purpose registers , segment registers have n’t been extended to 32 bits .
They still hold only 16 - bit value .
In protected mode , instead of pointing to segment memory location directly they store a descriptor number , which points to memory via a Local Descriptors Table data structure .
From our point of view this data structure has two interesting fields : base_addr and limit .
The former stores the address of the beginning of the segment , the latter is setting segment length .
There is a Linux / BSD / MacOSX syscall which allows access to this data structure on a per-process basis – modify_ldt .
It does n’t require any special permissions , every process can freely play with its own LDT descriptors ( this is safe due to paging ) .
Even though segment registers changed their meaning they are still used by the processor , every access to memory is affected by the currently selected descriptor and the LDT data structure it points to .
By default , when the process starts , the segment registers point to a descriptor that sets a flat view of the process memory .
That ’s how unix processes work and what compilers assume .
But it ’s just a default that the memory is viewed as flat , it can be modified on per-process basis via segment machinery .
Boxes of sand
The segmentation mechanism was recently rediscovered to do intra-process sandboxing .
In other words – to run foreign binary code safely inside a trusted process .
Segmentation is a very nice mechanism to restrict memory access without the burden of whole operating system machinery .
To restrict memory access of some code fragment to a certain ‘ ” subspace ” it is enough to modify descriptors via modify_ldt syscall and run the code with segment registers pointing accordingly .
Such modified code fragment cannot , while running , affect any code from its neighborhood inside the same OS process .
Unfortunately the real sandbox implementation is more complicated – apart from LDT it needs to go through machine code and check for some processor commands that can escape from the sandbox .
For example it ’s necessary to disallow modification of segment registers .
This technique leads to a stable machinery which can be used to run arbitrary i386 machine code without noticable performance degradation .
This idea is used by Google Native Client to run foreign binaries natively , despite the fact that they ’re downloaded from an untrusted source .
Apart from this browser - specific project , there ’s also a very nice and lightweight VX32 library .
Damon Dreckmeier 's blood was coming out both ends of him , and it had been coming out for hours .
Vomited blood ran out of his mouth , down his chin and over his neck ; it stained the seat of his pants .
A nauseating , numbing feeling began in his stomach and gradually spread through his body .
He had lost so much blood his fingers became useless and his eyes lost their focus .
Dreckmeier was dying .
It was obvious to Dreckmeier .
And it was obvious to his roommates .
Yet none of them was able to get him medical attention .
That 's because Dreckmeier and his roommates were inmates in a Maricopa County jail , and despite their calls for help over a three - hour period the night of March 2 , detention officers ignored them .
When Dreckmeier was finally taken seriously , he was rushed to the county hospital , where it took four pints of blood to replace what he had lost .
He was sent to jail because he had stolen a presigned check from a business and had cashed it for $ 4,800 using a faked driver 's license .
He pleaded guilty to faking the ID ; the check charge was dropped when he promised to pay back the money .
He had been sentenced to four years ' probation and 111 days in jail .
In another part of the country , he might have served out that time uneventfully .
But Dreckmeier had a double helping of bad luck :
He has a degenerative but controllable digestive disorder , Crohn 's disease , and he was sentenced to do his time in a place that takes pride in being the most inhospitable jail in the country .
Because the county jail 's medical staff was unable -- or unwilling -- to supply Dreckmeier his prescribed medication , which keeps Crohn 's disease symptoms at bay , he was hospitalized four times during his brief incarceration .
On the fourth trip , surgeons opened Dreckmeier up from sternum to pubic bone .
After that operation , he developed an abscess , which had to be excised in a second surgery -- and a fifth hospitalization -- at a private hospital .
Because jail medical personnel could n't come up with pills -- they would have cost less than $ 400 for his entire incarceration -- Maricopa County taxpayers will pay Dreckmeier 's medical bill , estimated at about $ 300,000 .
You may pay even more when Dreckmeier sues the county for his treatment in jail .
For weeks , Sheriff Joe Arpaio has bragged that a new report from the federal Department of Justice will refute the charges that feds made earlier about his jails .
After investigations begun in the fall of 1995 , the Department of Justice found that inmates in the county jails -- two thirds of whom await trial under an assumption of innocence -- were abused by detention officers , that such abuse was covered up , and that inmates were subject to inadequate medical care .
An investigator 's report alleging substandard medical and psychiatric services ran to 57 pages .
Arpaio has maintained that the Department of Justice got its investigation wrong , that the abuse was just inmate fiction .
Meanwhile , the county organization that runs the jail 's medical clinics , Correctional Health Services , claims that a larger budget and new policies have resulted in improvements which have impressed independent auditors .
In other words , everything 's fine in the big house .
Damon Dreckmeier 's recent experience contradicts that claim .
And documents obtained by New Times as well as the assertions of former medical staffers suggest that Dreckmeier 's treatment was consistent with a pattern of shoddy medical work ( see accompanying story ) .
It 's the same pattern the Department of Justice found nearly two years ago : inadequate staffing of physicians ; diagnosis and treatment by nurses unqualified for such work ; unreasonable delays for inmates needing medical attention ; capricious delivery of medications .
It 's a pattern that continues to leave the county open to liability lawsuits .
And it 's a pattern that nearly killed Damon Dreckmeier .
Despite his medical problem , Dreckmeier was a normal , healthy - looking 22 - year - old when he entered the county jail .
As he sits in a hospital bed awaiting yet another surgery , the former warehouse manager looks like a concentration - camp victim : knobby knees and skinny limbs and an emaciated torso crisscrossed with scars .
For days , brownish liquid had seeped from an abscess in his abdomen through a tube attached to his side .
Now that the seeping has stopped , surgeons will cut Dreckmeier open and remove the rest of the brownish goo too thick to ooze out of the tube .
Yet , somehow , Dreckmeier 's in a decent mood .
He 's grateful when a nurse enters to change his IV bag , and she acknowledges his thanks with a smile and promises to check on him again soon .
The source of his good humor ?
He 's at Scottsdale Memorial Hospital - North in a private room , no longer at the mercy of jail nurses and doctors .
In a move even the County Attorney 's Office describes as " very rare , " Dreckmeier 's lawyer , Patti Shelton , convinced a Superior Court judge pro tem to cut Dreckmeier 's sentence short by a month and allow him to be moved to the private hospital .
There was no objection by either the County Attorney 's Office or Dreckmeier 's probation officer .
Everyone apparently agreed that Dreckmeier had been through enough .
After several weeks in the Scottsdale hospital , Dreckmeier has improved greatly , but he 's still not out of danger .
His doctors are confident the abscess will heal properly following surgery , but tell him that further complications could arise .
Dreckmeier worries that he 'll never be as healthy as he was before he went to jail in February .
He complains of several symptoms he 's never had before .
Stomach acids repeatedly find their way to his mouth , causing him to spit throughout the day .
He still is n't eating much , and trips to the bathroom remain an unpleasant adventure .
But none of it -- the five hospitalizations , the surgery , the abscess , the nearly lethal loss of blood -- would have occurred , Dreckmeier says , if jail nurses had simply given him eight pills each day .
Four years ago , Dreckmeier learned that he suffers from Crohn 's disease , a chronic digestive condition .
Its cause is unknown , but Crohn 's most often strikes people in their teens and 20s and is most common in Western Europe , Scandinavia and North America .
It can attack any part of the digestive system , from the mouth to rectum , but most often it eats away at the intestines .
When the disease is acute , it causes severe cramping , bloody diarrhea and anemia .
Eventually , sections of bowel made useless by the disease must be removed by surgery .
Advanced imaging techniques enable doctors to target what portion of intestine needs removal , and can normally do so with minimal scarring .
Dreckmeier had himself already endured an operation to remove part of his bowel and reconnect the healthy tissue .
Over a lifetime , a Crohn 's victim may lose section after section of the 20 feet of small intestines that a person is born with .
Fortunately , with as little as five feet of intestine left over , a person with Crohn 's may still be able to lead a relatively normal life .
Many people with Crohn 's must eventually learn to live with a stoma , what a writer suffering from the disease described as looking like a cherry tomato stuck on one 's stomach , where healthy intestine is brought through the skin to allow waste materials to collect in a plastic bag .
Others are more lucky .
For many sufferers , a closely followed regimen of medication can keep Crohn 's from its active stage , staving off the disease 's worst effects for years .
Until February , that described Damon Dreckmeier .
In 1989 , he had moved to Arizona from Iowa , and after attending Arizona State University and a trade school , landed a job as the warehouse manager of a ceramics store .
He was shocked to learn in 1993 that he would live with Crohn 's for the rest of his life , he says , but he soon learned to adapt .
As long as he took a drug called mesalamine four times a day and did n't drink alcohol , he could eat what he wanted and felt few effects of the disease .
Besides , Crohn 's was nothing compared to the problems he was having with girlfriends .
Dreckmeier had had a child with a woman he met in California in 1992 .
They had split up and had no formal agreement about the child 's status , but Dreckmeier sent money -- regularly , he says -- and intended eventually to get a formal agreement on custody rights .
In 1995 , he met another woman , Melanie Shadowens , who became pregnant with his second child late last year .
Sharing expenses with his girlfriend and sending money to his ex , Dreckmeier says he became stuck .
He was broke , and it made him desperate .
So he committed a crime .
Dreckmeier borrowed a friend 's birth certificate and used it illegally to obtain a driver 's license .
( His own had been suspended when he failed to pay a speeding ticket . )
Then , he stole a check -- already mechanically signed -- from his girlfriend 's place of work , wrote the check in the amount of $ 4,800 to his fake identity and used the bogus driver 's license to cash it .
The crime temporarily solved his money problems , and for months it went unnoticed .
Then on January 28 , the FBI took Dreckmeier into custody and charged him with the check fraud .
Shadowens bonded him out of jail that night .
FBI agents rearrested Dreckmeier on February 3 , charging him with forging the driver 's license .
This time , he remained in jail .
The check charge was dropped with his promise to repay the $ 4,800 , and he pleaded guilty on March 28 to a class 4 felony for forging the fake ID .
On April 18 , he was sentenced to four years ' probation with 111 days of incarceration .
When FBI agents took Dreckmeier to jail on February 3 , they allowed Shadowens to retrieve the prescription bottle for Dreckmeier 's mesalamine .
The agents told Shadowens to empty it out -- no drugs can be brought into jail -- and they promised to deliver the bottle to the jail 's medical staff as evidence that he had the prescription .
The FBI agents followed through on that promise .
Dreckmeier watched them hand the bottle to jail staffers at the intake unit .
He was assured that jail medical staff would get the prescription filled and continue Dreckmeier 's schedule of pills .
They did n't .
Damon Dreckmeier entered Madison Street Jail on a Monday .
He got no more mesalamine that day .
He did n't get any of his daily dosage of eight on Tuesday , either .
None was brought to him on Wednesday .
He also did n't get any on Thursday .
Instead , that day , February 6 , guards came to haul Dreckmeier to a court hearing .
When they arrived , Dreckmeier was doubled over in pain .
His cellmates told the guards that Dreckmeier had been vomiting yellow fluids all day .
Dreckmeier says he sat on the floor in excruciating pain , begging the guards to take him to a doctor .
He says one of them responded , " Get the fuck away from the door . "
" When you 're in jail , " Dreckmeier says , " when you 're behind closed doors , it 's another world .
The only people you can complain to are the guards , but they do n't care .
They do n't give a shit about you . "
Dreckmeier says that all week he had sent written " tank orders " to the jail 's medical staff , asking for his medication .
He pleaded with the guards that transported him to court .
He finally prevailed on one detention officer who admitted that Dreckmeier looked terrible .
A doctor 's appointment was scheduled for him the next morning .
Dreckmeier had to spend another night in his cell , vomiting and doubled over in pain .
Inmates ' medical needs are served by Correctional Health Services , a county agency which has served the jails since 1992 .
With a staff of 160 and a budget of $ 12 million , CHS runs clinics in all seven county jails as well as in juvenile facilities .
When inmates require care that CHS cannot administer in the jails , most are transported to the Maricopa Medical Center , the county 's hospital ( some emergencies require that inmates go to other hospitals ) .
Two years ago , New Times requested access to medical records of inmates served by CHS .
The county 's response : that such records were public but too difficult to retrieve .
Limited records of inmate deaths were released ; during Sheriff Arpaio 's tenure , at least 19 inmates have perished .
After a night of vomiting and pain , Dreckmeier was examined by a doctor .
That doctor sent him on to the county hospital , where he was administered steroids and pain medicine .
Over the next three months , the same pattern would repeat itself : Jail medical staff either failed to supply Dreckmeier his required medicine or gave him an inferior substitute until he had to be rushed , three more times , to Maricopa Medical Center for emergency treatment .
After his initial , weeklong stay at the hospital , Dreckmeier was moved back to jail with instructions from hospital staff that his mesalamine prescription regimen be followed .
But jail medical staff told him the jail did n't stock mesalamine , and nurses began giving him sulfasalazine instead .
Dreckmeier told them he'd tried sulfasalazine and that it had n't worked to keep his Crohn 's disease dormant .
Dreckmeier says doctors at the jail told him about another option :
If he could get a new prescription for mesalamine from an outside doctor , the jail would distribute it for him .
But Dreckmeier 's doctor , gastroenterologist Murray Cohen , had n't seen Dreckmeier in more than a year , and refused to write a prescription unless he could examine him .
" Usually the physician who 's there [ in jail ] would examine the patient and then pass on what he found .
But the only communication I got was that a prescription was needed , and I could n't write one if I had n't seen the patient in such a long time .
That would be bad medicine , " Cohen says .
Nobody from the jail contacted Cohen again .
He backs up Dreckmeier 's statement that sulfasalazine did not work as well for him as mesalamine .
" It makes a difference particularly with the patient .
And if he already has the experience that mesalamine worked well for him , then he 's probably right . "
" When I was on the sulfasalazine , " Dreckmeier says , " my stomach was upset and I could n't eat and I would get diarrhea .
I 'd never suffered from these kinds of symptoms , even when I first found out I had Crohn's .
When I did get mesalamine from the medical - center doctors , I had no problems .
If the jailers had just given me mesalamine , I would have been all right . "
Dreckmeier was stuck with the sulfasalazine .
Doctors at Durango Jail told him several times that sulfasalazine was as good as his mesalamine despite Dreckmeier 's objections .
He also did n't get as much of the sulfasalazine .
Dreckmeier 's regimen of taking medication four times a day did n't match jail patterns , under which inmates were given medication at odd hours and only three times a day .
One medicine call occurred each morning at 3 , when a nurse would appear , say " First and last call for meds , " and then leave before many sleeping inmates could respond .
Only those who managed to set an internal clock , wake up and stand at a counter at that hour ended up with medicine .
Besides the inconsistent and inadequate medicating , Dreckmeier continued to be fed a diet that would aggravate his condition .
Doctors had told him he would get a special diet , but day after day , he was fed with the general - population foods that were precisely the kind of thing that caused him complications : rancid cheeses and spicy foods .
When Dreckmeier complained , he was told what other inmates also heard :
If you do n't like it , do n't eat it .
About 10 on the evening of March 2 , Dreckmeier began throwing up blood .
Blood also began staining his pants as it drained from his rectum .
He and his cellmates began a campaign to get the attention of guards , but Dreckmeier says their cries for help were ignored .
By midnight , Dreckmeier was vomiting alarming amounts of red fluid into the cell 's toilet .
He was losing so much blood he felt his fingers tighten up and freeze as he lost power in them ; he also became unable to focus his vision .
At midnight , Dreckmeier says he and his cellmates were told by guards to pipe down , that if Dreckmeier needed attention , a nurse would be around at 3 a.m. to deliver meds .
A half - hour later , Dreckmeier 's cellmates were yelling angrily at guards -- they knew Dreckmeier was gravely ill .
Dreckmeier remembers the response they got from a guard : " I fucking told you , go back to bed .
The nurse will be here in two hours . "
Dreckmeier was terrified .
He began to lose sensation throughout his body .
Then his jaw froze shut .
His heart raced .
At 1:30 , guards finally came to his door in response to his cellmates ' calls .
When they opened it , Dreckmeier tumbled out on the floor .
Blood covered his chin and stained the seat of his pants , but Dreckmeier says guards were laughing .
One said , " What the fuck is wrong with you ? "
He says his cellmates told them that Dreckmeier had been vomiting blood for hours , and if they would come in and look at the toilet , they would see for themselves .
But guards refused to enter the cell .
Dreckmeier says he could n't believe it -- they still were n't taking him seriously .
That 's when he retched once again , and this time blood shot out of his nostrils and through his clenched teeth onto the floor near the feet of the guards .
Only then , he says , did they decide to get him some medical attention .
Unfortunately , Dreckmeier next had to convince jail nurses that he needed emergency help .
He was taken to the jail 's clinic , where nurses took his blood pressure .
" This ca n't be right , " one of them said .
Dreckmeier says the nurses assumed that something was wrong with their gauge and retrieved another .
Again , he says , they could n't believe the results of the test .
Dreckmeier 's blood pressure was dangerously low , but he says it seemed like an eternity before the nurses realized that they had an emergency on their hands .
Paramedics records show they were n't called by the jail until after 5 a.m. , nearly four hours after Dreckmeier had been taken from his cell .
After calling 911 , the clinic 's nurses decided to get an IV started to replenish Dreckmeier 's lost fluids .
One of them balked , however , saying that she was n't qualified to put in an IV .
The other admitted that she had n't done it in two years but said she 'd do her best .
" I 'm thinking , ' Oh , my God , they 're going to let me die here , ' " Dreckmeier says .
Ten minutes later , saying , " I do n't think he 's going to make it , " the nurses were still jabbing at his arm when Phoenix Fire Department paramedics arrived and started the IV properly .
Dreckmeier was told by paramedics that if they had been called 15 minutes later , he probably would have died .
Two more times Dreckmeier would return to jail with instructions from Maricopa Medical Center doctors that he be given mesalamine and a special diet .
And , still , with the county 's tab for Dreckmeier 's care climbing , jail staff could not or would not follow through on those orders .
Dreckmeier says he was put on the same erratic and inconsistent schedule of sulfasalazine and a poor diet .
" Sorry , we can not get your medication at the pharmacy .
You will take what we give you , " wrote a nurse to Dreckmeier on March 10 .
He was forced to take the ineffective sulfasalazine .
Then , days later , the jail ran out of that , too .
On March 19 , Dreckmeier sent an inmate request to medical staff , writing , " I have n't gotten my meds for 3 days and last time I lost 4 pints of blood because of the wrong meds and not given them to me .
I need the right meds or I 'm going to get real sick again .
Thank you . "
It came back with a nurse 's reply : " We are out of your medicine and ca n't get it till next Monday , if you start to get sick again , please tell the guards right away . "
Not very comforting words after Dreckmeier 's last experience with the guards .
On April 18 , Dreckmeier was sentenced and moved to Tent City .
There , he was ordered to work from 8 to 4 .
That meant that he could n't get medication during that time .
And the work left him exhausted and unable to wake himself up at 3 a .m. to be ready for that meds call .
Dreckmeier was getting an inferior medicine and only half as often as he should .
On May 17 , Dreckmeier had to be taken to the county hospital for a third time , this time for two full weeks .
He spent four more days in the Madison Street Jail 's infirmary , where jail doctors finally began giving Dreckmeier mesalamine four times a day .
He was then sent back to Tent City , where he was told the mesalamine would continue to get to him .
In the next four days , Dreckmeier should have received a special diet and 32 mesalamine pills .
But even after three hospitalizations and mounting costs for the county , the jail 's medical staff was still unable to follow this simple directive .
Dreckmeier says he was fed aggravating foods and received doses of mesalamine a total of six pills in that four days .
On June 4 , Dreckmeier was taken to the county hospital for the fourth time .
He was given Demerol and says he was groggy when surgeons asked him to sign a consent form for surgery .
He remembers signing it .
The next thing he remembers : waking up and seeing a red , oozing scar that stretched from his sternum to his pubic bone .
It looked like Dreckmeier had been cleaned like a fish .
" They had done radical exploratory surgery on me .
And I was asking the doctors , ' Why ? '
Just the week before , they had tested me extensively , and they knew what was wrong with me .
I had active Crohn 's because I was n't getting my medication .
But they cut me up like they did n't know what was wrong with me .
" What happened to me ?
Why did you cut me so far ? "
Dreckmeier says he asked surgeons who came to check on his condition .
" You 're in jail , we do n't have to discuss it with you , " one of the doctors told him , Dreckmeier says .
A doctor at Maricopa Medical Center who asked not to be named confirms that physicians are instructed not to inform inmates of the procedures performed on them -- which is diametrically opposed to how doctors are trained in medical school .
When Dr. Jerome Targovnik was head of endocrinology at Maricopa Medical Center 10 years ago , he says that was n't the case .
" We treated inmates the same as we did other patients . "
He says it surprises him that inmates would not be told about their conditions .
After reviewing Dreckmeier 's medical records , however , Targovnik says that Dreckmeier received excellent care at the hospital .
The surgery was necessary because Dreckmeier had a life - threatening condition - - a perforated bowel - - and if doctors had n't opened him up widely to clean him out , he would have died .
But Dreckmeier , still left in the dark by the medical center , is left to wonder what happened to him .
He says that in a previous surgery for his Crohn's , he had felt much better after only a week .
But this time , after he had been moved to Madison Street Jail 's infirmary , he did not recover well .
He says he complained to doctors often .
His urine was dark brown and his kidneys were sore , Dreckmeier says .
He could n't sleep , could n't eat , and the pain in his gut was intense .
All of that was just a normal reaction to the surgery , he says doctors told him .
Dreckmeier , who had lost 40 pounds since his initial incarceration and could not bring himself to eat anything , began to hope that he would die .
" I did n't want to live ; it hurt so bad , " he says .
" I was praying at night .
Please take the pain away . "
When his breathing became labored and his temperature hit 103 degrees , Dreckmeier knew something was seriously wrong .
But doctors insisted that everything was normal , he says .
On June 19 , a doctor ordered a chest x-ray in response to Dreckmeier 's complaints that he could n't breathe .
The x-ray looked fine , the doctor told him .
The next day , after his attorney , Patti Shelton , won a judge 's approval for him to be moved to Scottsdale Memorial Hospital - North , Dreckmeier was x-rayed again .
Only 24 hours after Madison Street Jail infirmary doctors had told him that he was fine , doctors at Scottsdale Memorial told Dreckmeier there was an abscess in his abdomen and that his x-ray showed pneumonia in one lung and fluid in both .
" I have this nightmare that I 'm back in the county hospital and my belly is opened up and doctors are pulling shit out of me they should n't be taking out , " Dreckmeier says as he recovers in Scottsdale Memorial .
Now that he's no longer an inmate , Dreckmeier is doing all he can to take advantage of his freedom .
Only days after his surgery to remove the abscess in his abdomen , Dreckmeier gingerly walked in his hospital garb from his room to a chapel downstairs .
There , with tubes still attached to various parts of his body , he married his girlfriend Melanie Shadowens .
A week later , she gave birth to Jordan , their son .
In the days since , Dreckmeier has gained strength , although he still appears pale and walks hunched over slightly .
He 's out of the hospital and preparing for his next battle : to make the county pay for what he 's been through .
" I 'm going to sue because these people did n't know what they were doing , " he says .
" I do n't want other people to go through what happened to me . "
His attorney , Patti Shelton , with several colleagues has taken on several cases of inmate abuse and medical neglect , including that of Richard Post , the paraplegic who was put into a restraint chair so roughly jailers broke his neck .
She plans to file a notice of claim with the county in Dreckmeier 's case within days .
" I think we have to look at the broader issue , " she says .
" What happened to Damon was not an isolated issue .
It was one of the more egregious cases , but not isolated .
Damon looked like he had been in a concentration camp . "
She says she 's aware that Sheriff Joe Arpaio has bragged that a new report in the Department of Justice investigation will exonerate the jails and its medical staff .
But she says that does n't mean conditions in the jails have actually improved .
" I blame the U.S. attorney as much as anybody .
The investigation was turned over to them , and as far as we can tell , they 've just let the Sheriff 's Office itself take care of the problems .
And none of them have been taken care of .
I mean , nobody wants to invite the federal government in to take care of things , but maybe it 's time .
You define an enumeration the same way as collections .
namedtuple : with a type name , followed by a sequence of identifiers ( it may be a string separated by commas and / or whitespace ) :
>>> STATE = enum ( ' STATE ' , ' GET_QUIZ , GET_VERSE , TEACH ')
It returns a ( single ) instance of a newly created type .
The enumeration elements are integers , starting at 0 , exposed as attributes .
There is no way to change that : if you need specific values , look elsewhere .
In fact , it is as if the enum were declared as :
# not actual code class STATE ( object ) : __slots__ = () GET_QUIZ , GET_VERSE , TEACH = range ( 3 ) STATE = STATE ( )
The enumeration elements are read - only :
>>> STATE .GET_VERSE 1 >>>
STATE .GET_VERSE = 8 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AttributeError : ' STATE ' object attribute ' GET_VERSE ' is read - only >>> del STATE .GET_VERSE
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AttributeError : ' STATE ' object attribute ' GET_VERSE ' is read - only

Caribou living in the Arctic have switched off the internal biological clock most mammals use to distinguish day from night , biologists have found .
Researchers in the U.K. and Norway say the lack of an internal clock is the caribou 's adaptation to the " land of the midnight sun , " where the sun does n't set for months at a time during the summer and does n't rise during the winter .
" Our findings imply that evolution has come up with a means of switching off the cellular clockwork , " Andrew Loudon of the University of Manchester said in a statement .
" Such daily clocks may be positively a hindrance in environments where there is no reliable light - dark cycle for much of the year . "
The findings appear Thursday in the journal Current Biology .
The researchers examined the expression of clock genes in the skin cells of caribou , also called reindeer , but suspect that similar results would be seen in other animals that live in the Arctic .
In many animals , the daily release of hormones , including melatonin , is mediated by the nervous system and light sensors in the eye .
This daily , cyclical regulation of hormone levels , known as circadian rhythm , influences the animal 's behaviour , especially sleep .
Even if the cycle of light and dark is n't present , such as if the animal is in a cave or exposed to certain lab conditions , hormone levels are kept consistent by means of an internal clock .
" In reindeer , it is this clock element that seems to be missing , " Loudon said .
Arctic animals ' clocks work on seasonal cycle
Scientists in Manchester and the University of Tromso in Norway found that two known clock genes , called Bmal1 and Per2 , are not regulated in the same rhythmic fashion as in other animals .
" We suspect that they have the full range of normal clock genes , but these are regulated in a different way in reindeer , " Loudon said .
Hormone levels in caribou instead rise and fall in response to light and dark without an internal regulating clock , the researchers found .
Melatonin levels in the animals are low during daylight hours and spike when it turns dark .
Caribou do n't appear to require a daily cycle of melatonin to regulate sleep , as many animals , including humans , do .
" Reindeer sleep in a series of naps , often associated with rumination , " Loudon wrote in an e-mail .
" Since rumination cycles occur many times a day , the animal accumulates sleep but in many episodes . "
The findings were surprising , but it is likely other Arctic animals also lack an internal clock , the researchers wrote .
It 's possible the daily cyclical regulation of hormones present in other animals morphed into a year - long seasonal cycle in Arctic animals .
" Synchronization of seasonal cycles in mammals is a prominent feature of physiological adaptation in northern temperate and Arctic species , " the researchers wrote .
" It is attractive to speculate that in reindeer , informative melatonin signals associated with equinoxes directly entrain a ' circannual clock ' that , at least in reindeer , may not involve circadian mechanisms . "

( Newser ) – The FCC will unveil a massive plan for upgrading America ’s broadband infrastructure tomorrow , hoping to bridge the stubborn divide between the digital haves and have - nots .
The plan would aim to bring broadband to 90 % of Americans by 2020 , and increase speeds for those who already have it , the San Jose Mercury News reports .
Currently , nearly a third of the country lacks high - speed internet access .
“ World - class broadband is our generation ’s great infrastructure challenge , ” FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said recently , saying it was “ akin to the advent of electricity . ”
The plan will aim for speeds of 100 megabits per second in 100 million homes , and recommend doubling the amount of the radio spectrum devoted to wireless internet service .
It may also recommend redirecting the $ 8 billion government program subsidizing rural telephone service to subsidize broadband instead .

We have no freedom of choice in America ; it ’s an illusion .
The federal and state governments regulate every single market in this country which means that everything any American thinks he is freely choosing is something that in fact has been u201 Capprovedu201D by the state for American consumption and Americans may only u201Cchooseu201D from that list .
Choosing something not on the u201 Capprovedu201D list is considered criminal and can result in one losing their freedoms altogether .
That ’s not freedom of choice , that ’s state control of people ’s lives .
If the last two sentences were said in the context of a communist regime , no one would hesitate to nod acceptingly , but when uttered in the context of the U.S. government , they are considered to be conspiratorial and paranoid , but are true just the same .
How many people have been arrested and imprisoned for selling goods and services that are not u201 Capprovedu201D by the federal government ?
Our prisons are full of such people who have harmed no one socially , economically or physically but whose freedom has been taken away by the state for giving people real choice .
If one were to see such a scene in a movie about communist Russia , no doubt Americans would cringe and utter something about the abusive nature of communism .
When it happens in the U.S. then Americans assume the person in question must have deserved it otherwise why would he be in prison .
A lot of people do n’t realize that during communism in countries like Romania , they held presidential elections as well every so many years and the people were told that they could u201Cchooseu201D the president .
Thing was : all the candidates belonged to the communist party so there would always be a communist president and communism would persist .
In order for someone from the communist party not to be elected , a second party would somehow have to get on the ballot and in 1990 this finally happened .

The sad , disappointing and frustrating thing is that we have the same situation here in America but the pixy - dust - sniffing majority in this country does n’t realize it .
Last presidential election I voted for the candidate of my choice , Ron Paul , and the state of Georgia threw my vote away because Ron Paul was not an official state - approved candidate .
He had not done what the state decided he would need to do to be on the ballot so therefore he was not considered an u201 Cofficialu201D candidate and was not on the ballot .
If you chose to vote for him as a write - in , then they simply did not count your vote .
How is having only two major parties who are always on the ballot and an election system designed by the state to keep those two parties in power and which makes it almost financially and logistically impossible for other parties to get on the ballot so much different from the communist system of having only one party on the ballot and an election system that makes it financially and logistically impossible for other parties ?
There ’s no freedom of choice in selecting our government .
We as Americans are constantly voting for the lesser of two evils and seem to be content to do so .
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
Well how about in the market place then ?
Surely we must have freedom of choice in the market place .
Look at all the choices we have to choose from .
Unfortunately , this is a big negative as well .
Just because there are a hundred different types of food or drugs , for example , from which to choose , in reality you can only choose from the ones that the state has approved for you .
The FDA is a federal agency with an annual budget in 2010 of $ 3.2 billion and is planning on hiring another 1,200 new employees to help construct the list of state - approved food and drugs ( see , the government can create new jobs ) .
Now I ’ve heard the argument a thousand times : sure the FDA is a government agency and it ’s not perfect but without an agency like the FDA there would be harmful foods and drugs on the market that people would voluntarily choose to purchase and people could be maimed , sickened and even die .
We need the FDA .
Regulating food and drugs is too big a job , only the federal government has the resources to do it .
Thank God for the FDA !
This argument assumes a couple of things .
First , that the FDA has found the gold at the end of rainbow so the government already has the financial resources necessary to pay for their activities and so that money does n’t have to come from the people .
Secondly , that the FDA is in fact not staffed with people from the same social pool that says the federal government already has the necessary resources to regulate food and drugs but rather with wizards that posses special magical powers that the rest of us do n’t and can somehow determine the u201Cgoodnessu201D of foods and drugs for human consumption .
It assumes the FDA does n’t even need humans to determine the human effects of foods and drugs .
They can simply dip a piece of litmus paper into a sample and if it turns red then it is not state approved .
A Nation of Sheep Andrew P. Napolitano Best Price : $ 1.00 Buy New $ 3.99 ( as of 04:45 EST - Details )
Of course this is not the case .
The FDA has only the resources that they take from the private sector in the way of taxes , debt , inflation and manpower .
Furthermore , it conducts clinical trials on humans who volunteer to participate .
Basically , that means that the FDA gets volunteers to try new foods and drugs and then they sit back and watch what happens .
If the volunteers have bad side effects , like their heads turn purple , their hair falls out , they are maimed , sickened or die , then the FDA disseminates this information to the public and the food or drug is not approved for sale in the U.S. and so people have no choice : they can not buy it even if they wanted to .
Compare this to a new food or drug appearing in the market place and people voluntarily choosing to buy it and consume it .
If people have adverse side effects to the new good then this information will be disseminated naturally by the market and people will choose to stop buying it .
A famous example of this was the Tylenol poisoning case of 1982 in which someone went into stores in the Chicago area and laced extra strength Tylenol capsules with potassium - cyanide .
The first death occurred on September 29 , 1982 .
Within 6 days , and completely of its own accord , Johnson & Johnson had recalled all its bottles of extra strength Tylenol with a retail market value of some $ 100 million .
By November of the same year , Johnson & Johnson had already re-engineered its pill bottle packaging — a new triple - sealed package — and within a year Tylenol was once again a major competitor in the market place .
What was the FDA doing during this time ?
Sitting on its hands trying to figure out who to blame and seeing what kind of new packaging Johnson & Johnson came up with so they could copy it and modify their food and drug packaging regulations accordingly and take the credit for keeping Americans safe .
As with any government agency , the FDA did n’t want this crisis to go to waste so they also used it to expand their budget and payroll .
After all , with the new regulations they would need more people and money to enforce them .
In the end the FDA cannot do anymore than the market can do in identifying harmful foods and drugs .
In fact , historical evidence shows that the market does a better , faster and more efficient job of identifying these things than the FDA .
The FDA is always one step behind the markets .
Reacting and taking the credit at a cost of $ 3.2 billion to the tax payer and limiting real freedom of choice in America .
The Best of Don Cooper
A new system of MPs ' expenses has been published that will come into force after the general election .
So , how does it differ from the old , much criticised , system ?
The old rule
The new rule SECOND HOMES All MPs , except those with seats in inner London , could claim £ 24,000 a year towards buying , furnishing and renovating a second home .
They could claim for mortgage interest , furniture , cleaning , gardening and utility bills and keep profits on sales .
Interim rules agreed in April 2009 reduced this to £ 1,250 a month for mortgage , rent , hotel costs and bills only .
MPs will only be allowed to claim up to £ 1,450 a month - the equivalent of a one - bedroom flat - to rent a " second home " .
MPs with constituencies within 20 miles or 60 minutes of Westminster will not be allowed to claim at all .
Claims for gardening and cleaning will not be allowed .
Those who already own taxpayer - funded homes can keep claiming until August 2012 .
LONDON COSTS MPs with seats in London could claim £ 7,500 instead of the larger second homes allowance - it had been just £ 2,916 but went up in April .
Sir Ian accepted a proposal this should be reduced to the level recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body - £ 3,760 .
PROFITS
MPs were previously allowed to keep any profits on homes and did not have to pay capital gains tax , some made profits of tens of thousands of pounds .
The practice was criticised during the expenses scandal .
MPs who keep their seats and already own taxpayer - funded homes can continue to claim until August 2012 but Sir Ian said profits made would be " recouped " .
Exact details of how he will do this have not be outlined .
GRACE AND FAVOUR HOMES Ministers who had the use of ' grace and favour homes ' had been allowed to claim costs for a second home as well .
Anyone with grace and favour homes will not be able to claim any accommodation expenses .
EMPLOYING FAMILY
MPs were allowed to recruit their own staff and employ spouses , children and other relatives - paid for by the taxpayer .
About 250 chose to do so and some employed more than one relative .
Sir Ian rejected a proposal to ban the practice entirely .
Instead MPs will be able to employ a maximum of one blood relative , spouse , co-habitee or financial partner but with strict terms and no bonuses allowed .
CO - HABITING MPS
MPs who shared the same second home could both claim the maximum allowance - about £ 24,000 each .
Interim rules brought in after the expenses scandal reduced this to one allowance between them .
Under new rules
MPs sharing rental accommodation must declare it and between them claim a maximum of one and a third of an MP 's accommodation budget .
TRAVEL MPs were allowed to claim for all travel costs for parliamentary duties between their home , constituency and office , could claim to travel first class .
They could also claim for their families to travel first class .
MPs to pay for their own daily commute , can claim for trips between London and constituencies and up to three return trips to EU institutions .
They can claim for first - class rail travel only if it is cheaper than the price of an open standard ticket .
GOLDEN GOODBYES
MPs who lost their seat or retired , were entitled to a " resettlement grant " of between 50 % and 100 % of their salary - depending on age and how long they 'd been an MP .
For some it would be £ 64,000 - the first £ 30,000 of which was tax - free .
No resettlement grants will be paid out under the new expenses scheme , although if the expenses body gets control of MPs ' salaries it will look at the matter again .
COMMUNICATIONS
A fairly new allowance , MPs were able to claim £ 10,400 a year to " boost public understanding of Parliament " .
It could not be spent on party political material and some MPs had to pay it back after having been found to have broken that rule .
The separate budget will be scrapped but the cost of running a website , advertising constituency meetings and producing contact cards will be recognised a general admin budget of £ 10,394 a year , which also covers office equipment and services RECEIPTS Until recently , MPs did not have to supply receipts for anything costing less than £ 250 , that was reduced to £ 25 in April 2008 but were still able to claim £ 25 a night for food without receipts .
Receipts to be required for all claims - MPs will be allowed up to £ 15 for an evening meal , when the Commons sits past 7.30 pm , but only if they provide a receipt .

Victoria 's Chief Police Commissioner , Simon Overland , caused a security scare at Canberra Airport yesterday .
Federal Police officers were called to a security check point yesterday when bullets were found among Mr Overland 's possessions .
He carries a gun for security , and while he had remembered to remove it from his bag before entering the airport , he forgot about the ammunition .
He voluntarily handed the magazine in for confiscation .
A statement from Victoria Police says Mr Overland has been spoken to by the AFP and he fully acknowledges the breach which was a ' genuine oversight ' .
The statement also says Mr Overland has also contacted the director of the Office of Police Integrity to brief him about the incident .
The AFP is not commenting .
Qantas has launched a full investigation into the matter .
The airline wants to know how the bullets passed unnoticed through security at Melbourne Airport when the Commissioner flew to Canberra .
The investigation will involve the company contracted to handle security at the Qantas terminal , the Federal Police and the Office of Transport and Security .

C++-201x ( or C++ - 0 x as near sighted individuals like to call it ) introduced a new feature called variadic templates , which allows a template class or function to recieve multiple parameters to it of various types as you would normally achieve with " ... " .
You could continue to use stdarg if you wish , but a limitation of it is that you have no way of knowing what type each parameter is to use with va_arg ( ) , unless you just hard code it to only work with a specific type , or pass a type list how the printf ( ) family of functions do it , or something similar .
I always wanted a way to do func ( integer , string , float , whatever ) , and interchange that with func ( float , whatever , char ) , and now you can .
If you try to research this topic online , basically everyone is just writing and talking about how to implement a tuple class , or how to make a type safe printf .
Lets try something a little more interesting and perhaps instructive , yet simple .
Here 's how to compile and what the output looks like :
As can be seen I achieved my desired goals of being able to pass various types , not know the types to be passed in advance , and not need a type list passed anywhere .
All the other examples I 've seen seem to be forgetting these important points .
As for how this works " typename ... P " defines a template type of P which will be many parameters packed into a single variable .
" P ...p " receives all these parameters in a variable named " p " .
However the only things I can really do is see how many parameters are in " p " using " sizeof ... ( p ) " , or split " p " up into all its parameters , to then pass to a function by using " p... " .
It would be nice to be able to simply iterate through the values of " p " , but that 's not possible at the moment .
Using standard recursion techniques , you can pass the split up parameters from " p " to a function which has enough templated parameters as " p " is currently holding , or a lesser amount , and the last parameter can be a variadic parameter to catch all the others which do n't fit into the first few .
Then using those first parameters , you can access the values you need , and so on ad infinitum .
Read up on recursion if you 're confused .
Now if you 're still wondering what this may be useful for , just consider functions which handle data serialization or something similar .
One thing to note , at least with GCC at the moment , you always need to have a separate function as a base case , even if it 's never used .
Take " output ( ' 5 ' , 2 , " cows " , - 1 , 0.5f , 16.3 ) ; " , on the last leg of iteration , when the double is passed to the first parameter to be received by " t " , and " p " is empty , " if ( sizeof ... ( p ) ) { output ( p... ) ; } " which is the line responsible for the recursion seeing an empty " p " wo n't ask for " output ( ) " , but it seems the compiler still wants it to exist : I 'm not sure though if this is required by the standard , or a bug in GCC .
As for C++- 201x support in general , GCC seems to be the furthest ahead , even surpassing Comeau C++. See a comparison of the various compilers ' support of C++- 201x

Batalla contra el diablo en México
Pie de foto , La Iglesia Católica recientemente inauguró el primer recinto dedicado a practicar exorcismos .
Al principio , el diablo empieza a gritar : " ¡Cállate , cállate ! " .
Luego obliga a su víctima a agredir al sacerdote con golpes , patadas , escupitajos .
Algunos hablan en lenguas antiguas .
En casos extremos levitan o sangran .
Para contenerlos son necesarias varias personas , porque los poseídos cobran una fuerza inhumana .
Es un exorcismo .
Un rito cada vez más frecuente en México , reconoce la Iglesia Católica , que recientemente inauguró el primer recinto dedicado exclusivamente a combatir las andanzas de Lucifer en el país .
Se trata de la Capilla de las Benditas Ánimas del Purgatorio , construida en Querétaro , al centro de México .
En ese estado se ha presentado una inusual ola de posesiones e influencias del demonio , señaló Rogelio Cano , rector de la Catedral de Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de Soriano , donde se ubica la capilla .
" Aumentaron los casos porque hay muchos grupos satánicos .
Hemos visto posesiones diabólicas , y por eso la necesidad de contar con un lugar especial para los ritos " , dijo en conversación con BBC Mundo .
Pero no sólo en Querétaro abundan los exorcismos .
Datos de la Conferencia del Episcopado Mexicano ( CEM ) revelan que en el país se realizan hasta cinco ceremonias de este tipo al día .
Cada una de las 86 diócesis en que se divide la Iglesia en México tiene sacerdotes exorcistas .
Legiones demoníacas
Un exorcismo es , básicamente , una jornada de oraciones especiales para expulsar un demonio del cuerpo de la persona a la que ha poseído , o sobre la que mantiene alguna influencia , explicó Salvador Espinoza , vicario general de la Diócesis de Querétaro .
Antes de iniciar el rito los sacerdotes descartan que la víctima tenga trastornos mentales .
" Los enviamos con psiquiatras , y cuando se dan cuenta que las conductas ya no son de su área empezamos a tratarlos " , señaló .
Los exorcismos pueden ser sencillos o muy complicados , según el poder del demonio al que se enfrenten .
De hecho , los sacerdotes exorcistas deben conocer la identidad del espíritu maligno y por eso le preguntan su nombre .
" A veces responden : ‘ somos legión ’ y eso quiere decir que hay muchísimos demonios .
Siempre hay uno muy poderoso que cuesta mucho sacarlo , pero logramos expulsarlo " , explicó .
Generalmente las ceremonias son individuales .
" Cuando tratamos a varias personas los demonios se apoyan entre ellos , y cuesta más trabajo sacarlos " , dijo Espinoza .
" Tiemblan las rodillas "
Pie de foto , La mayoría de los exorcismos se practican a personas " influenciadas por algún espíritu maligno " .
¿ Cómo identifican a un poseído ?
" La persona rechaza a Dios y todo lo sagrado , después comienzan a hablar en idiomas antiguos , tienen fuerza sobre natural .
A veces ni diez personas pueden contenerla " , explicó Rogelio Cano .
" En algunas ocasiones la víctima levita , vuelve el estómago o sangra porque el demonio busca dañar a su víctima " , añadió el vicario Espinoza .
" También nos asustamos , a veces tiemblan las rodillas o el cuerpo entero .
Pero ni modo , tiene uno que sobreponerse " , reconoció .
Estos casos extremos no son comunes , aseguran los sacerdotes .
La CEM dice que habría unos cinco al mes en todo el país .
Y es que la mayoría de los exorcismos se practican a personas influenciadas por algún espíritu maligno , o que están en riesgo de posesión .
El sacerdote Rogelio Cano asegura que el problema ha aumentado por la influencia de algunos medios de comunicación , que promueven conductas poco religiosas .
Mel Gibson checked into rehab yesterday as his rep hinted at the star ’s uphill battle , saying , “ The guy is trying to stay alive . ”
After spewing anti-Semitic comments and cursing a cop when he was arrested for drunken driving last week , the “ Lethal Weapon ” actor has begun “ participating in an ongoing program to deal with this , ” publicist Alan Nierob said .
He declined to detail Gibson ’s treatment or reveal where he was receiving it .
News of Gibson ’s rehab stint came as In Touch Weekly photos surfaced , capturing Gibson ’s passion for booze and blondes just hours before his arrest in Malibu , Calif .
The bleary - eyed star was spotted at celeb - studded Moonshadows restaurant with a babe on each arm and a beer bottle in his right hand late Thursday and into the wee hours Friday .
Revelers said Gibson admitted that he had been downing wine at a dinner party earlier Thursday .
He then readily chatted with fans about everything from his movies to religion to his seven kids – and even called his wife of 26 years , Robyn , “ a saint . ”
“ Mel had bloodshot eyes and looked drunk , ” Todd Hausberger , 29 , of Phoenix told In Touch .
“ He was slurring his words . ”
At one point , Gibson switched to drinking water and put his head in his hands , saying , “ I am drunk , ” recalled Kimberly Lesak , 29 , of Louisville , Ky .
At 2 a.m. , Gibson – who reinvented himself as a producer and director with the controversial mega-hit “ The Passion of the Christ ” – then decided it was time to head home , the mag said .
“ We all offered him rides , and he shrugged it off , ” Lesak said .
Hausberger said he urged the star , who lives a few miles away , not to drive , but that Gibson responded :
“ No , I ’m fine .
I ’ll take care of myself . ”
A Los Angeles Sheriff ’s deputy busted the Road Warrior in his 2006 Lexus going 87 mph in a 45 mph zone , shortly after 2:30 a.m. Friday .
A bottle of tequila was found in his car .
Gibson tested at an 0.12 percent blood - alcohol level , cops said .
California law considers drivers at 0.08 percent to be impaired .
Gibson , 50 , has apologized for making “ despicable ” remarks during his arrest , during which he allegedly said , “ Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world , ” before asking arresting Deputy James Mee , “ Are you a Jew ? ”
A leaked sheriff ’s report showed Gibson was originally cooperative and fearful about his impending arrest , blurting out , “ My life is f- – - ed . ”
But the actor soon turned combative .
He threatened the arresting cop that he’d “ get even with me , ” the deputy said .
“ I ’m going to f- – – you .
You ’re going to regret you ever did this to me , ” the actor allegedly told deputies .
That ’s when Gibson allegedly let loose with a series of anti-Semitic slurs , ripping the “ f- – - ing Jews . ”
Mee yesterday said he hopes Gibson gets the help he needs .
“ I do n’t take pride in hurting Mr. Gibson , ” said Mee , who is Jewish .
“ What I had hoped out of this is that he would think twice before he gets behind the wheel of a car and was drinking .
. . .
I do n’t want to ruin his career .
I do n’t want to defame him in any way or hurt him . ”
As for Gibson ’s anti-Semitic rant , Mee dismissed it as “ booze talking . ”
“ There ’s two things that booze does .
It amplifies your personality . . .
If you are a high - strung person , it ’s going to amplify that , and all the bad things are going to come out . ”
Mee , a 17 - year veteran of the force , said he considers the bust routine .
“ I guess I ’m a little naive , because all the other deputies who came into the station that morning , they were taken by his celebrity , ” he said .
The celebrity news Web site http://www.tmz.com reported that Gibson has been pulled over twice in Malibu over the past three years and was not cited either time .
During a traffic stop three years ago , a deputy suspected Gibson might have been impaired but let him go anyway , the report said .
Sheriff ’s officials denied Gibson ’s received any preferential treatment – but are still conducting an internal review to determine if deputies ever pulled over the actor , or cut him slack .
Gibson once filmed a public service announcement for the L.A. Sheriff ’s Department , dressed in a sheriff ’s uniform .
‘” He has no prior record , ” said Sheriff ’s spokesman Steve Whitmore .
“ We have done our job . ”
Whitmore acknowledged that Gibson ’s name might not be in any police reports , if deputies did n’t arrest him .
“ The hope is not [ that Gibson received any star treatment ] , ” Whitmore said .
“ Our job is to treat everyone equally , regardless of race , class or celebrity . ”
The Oscar winner is free on $ 5,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in a Malibu courtroom Sept. 28 .
