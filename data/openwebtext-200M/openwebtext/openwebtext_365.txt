PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama assailed potential White House opponent John McCain on the economy on Tuesday , accusing the Republican of favoring the wealthy and turning his back on struggling workers and middle - class families .
The Democratic presidential contenders , campaigning in Pennsylvania ahead of their April 22 showdown , took a break from attacking each other to portray the Arizona senator as uncertain and untested on economic issues .
In separate appearances but similar language , they said McCain would take his economic cues from President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
“ John McCain admits he does n’t understand the economy -- and unfortunately he ’s proving it in this campaign , ” Clinton told the Pennsylvania AFL - CIO union group .
“ After seven disastrous years of George Bush and Dick Cheney , the stakes in this election could n’t be higher and the need to change course could n’t be more urgent .
But John McCain is only offering more of the same , ” the New York senator said .
Obama , an Illinois senator , said all McCain offers “ is four more years of the same George W. Bush policies that have gotten us into this pickle . ”
He noted McCain ’s support for extending Bush ’s tax cuts , which Obama said would help the wealthy , and his support for trade agreements that Obama said do not protect U.S. workers .
“ His response to the housing crisis amounts to little more than standing on the sidelines and watching millions of Americans lose their homes , ” Obama said in Wilkes - Barre .
The winner of the Democratic nominating battle between Clinton and Obama will face McCain in November ’s election , and in recent days both candidates have toned down their attacks on each other to focus more directly on McCain .
They have criticized the former Navy fighter pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam for saying he does not know as much about the economy as he does about national security and military issues .
McCain , on a week - long tour highlighting his military service and life story , visited his former high school outside Washington , D.C. , on Tuesday .
He said he will soon offer a plan with specifics to help homeowners who are having trouble paying their mortgages because of adjustable - rate loans .
‘ CHANGE THE FOCUS ’

“ Senator Clinton ’s attacks on John McCain are a desperate attempt to change the focus away from the divisive battle within the Democratic Party , ” said Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant , who challenged her to explain how she will pay for her new spending proposals .
Clinton proposed a plan on Tuesday to create 3 million jobs through increased investments over 10 years in the U.S. infrastructure , and proposed a $ 10 billion emergency fund for critical repairs to bridges and highways .
“ People ask me , “ What are the issues in this campaign ?
I say , ‘ jobs , jobs jobs and jobs , ’ ” Clinton said at a rally in Wilkes - Barre .

Clinton and Obama were in Pennsylvania on Tuesday ahead of the next contest when 158 pledged delegates will be at stake .
Some Democrats are concerned the prolonged campaign will hurt the eventual winner in the match - up with McCain .
But Clinton , who trails Obama in pledged delegates won in state - by - state contests , has rejected calls to step aside .
Neither candidate is likely to have the 2,024 delegates needed to win the nomination after the contests end in early June , leaving the decision up to nearly 800 superdelegates -- elected officials and party insiders who are free to back any candidate .
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the campaign should continue through the end of voting , and repeated her view that superdelegates should not be perceived to overturn the will of the voters .
“ I think the election has to run its course , ” Pelosi said on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America . ”
“ I do think that it is important for us to get behind one candidate a long time before we go to the Democratic National Convention if we hope to win in November , ” she said .
Obama also played down worries the long campaign would hurt the eventual Democratic nominee .
“ I think this contest has been good for the Democratic Party .
We ’ve brought in all kinds of new people into the process .
And I think that bodes well for November , ” he said on NBC ’s “ Today ” show .

Update 2015 - 12-04 :
The official release of Inconsolata is at Google Fonts , and official upstream is on github .
These versions have better Windows hinting and some fixes .
I also have an experimental version ( tentatively titled InconsolataGo ) with straight quotes in the inconsolata directory here .
Inconsolata is my first serious original font release .
It is a monospace font , designed for code listings and the like , in print .
There are a great many " programmer fonts , " designed primarily for use on the screen , but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering .
Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources .
I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc( as ) de Groot 's Consolas , which is his monospaced design for Microsoft 's upcoming Vista release .
This font , similar to his earlier TheSansMono , demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck .
First and foremost , Inconsolata is a humanist sans design .
I strove for the clarity and clean lines of Adrian Frutiger 's Avenir ( the lowercase " a " , in particular , pays homage to this wonderful design ) , but also looked to Morris Fuller Benton 's Franklin Gothic family for guidance on some of my favorite glyphs , such as lowercase " g " and " S " , and , most especially , the numerals .
Designing a monospace font poses unique challenges .
I have carefully studied many other monospaced fonts to see how they solve these problems .
Many of the available monospace fonts are adaptations of existing proportionally - spaced fonts , but some , such as Letter Gothic , draw strength from being their own designs .
I hope Inconsolata upholds that tradition .
Some details will be most apparent in print , such as the subtle curves in lowercase " t " , " v " , " w " , and " y " .
Inconsolata also borrows " micro- serifs " from some Japanese Gothic fonts , which enhance the appearance of crispness and legibility .
[ FontForge source | OpenType file | pfa file | PDF showing ]
I 'm still working on completing this font , refining the base ASCII set and filling out the Latin 1 , 2 , and 9 complements .
It will be released under the new Open Font License of SIL .
Completion of this font is being generously sponsored by the TeX Users Group Development Fund .

These are the dramatic new pictures of a massive explosion in Albania .
The blast at a cold - war ammunition dump a few miles north of the capital Tirana killed five and injured more than 200 .
The other Saturday morning I was flipping channels when I stumbled upon ABC and the Wonderful World of Disney , in particular a show called The Suite Life of Zack and Cody .
These two are white tween twins who live with their mother in a hotel room and carry out a series of I suppose white tween twin exploits .
This being Disney , there 's some lesson learned along the way .
Some lesson .
In this episode , one of the twins is sad because his twin brother is better than him at everything he does ( by which he means sports , dancing etc ) .
So his mom consoles him , " You get better grades " .
He replies , “ Like that matters ... I want to be good at something important ” .
To which the mom says , get this , " Dont worry , you 'll find something , keep trying " .
Before hearing this , in all my wisdom I 'd thought she would , if not give him an earful , make him understand that grades do matter and that 's the lesson he 'll learn at the end .
Just goes to show I underestimate the depths to which Disney can sink .
Here 's what really happens : after trying his hand at various things he fails at ( here we 're supposed to laugh ) , it turns out he 's good at doing magic tricks .
And that 's the lesson : grades dont matter ; you gotta keep trying to be good at something your age group agrees is cool ( and btw , the Disney store has a magic starter kit ) .
But the real Disney phenomenon is Hannah Montana .
This is a show about a tween girl who 's a simple brunette by day ( called Miley Cyrus , which is her real name ) , and a pop singer called Hannah Montana by night .
Only a few people know she 's the same person ( Clark Kent took off his glasses , Miley Cyrus dons a blonde wig ) .
And the sheer marketing genius part ?
There are real tours by Hannah Montana .
This is such a big phenomenon that there are mothers calling talk shows saying scalped tickets are 3000 bucks , should I dip into our savings to send my daughter to the concert , I hate disappointing her .
The real clincher is this : Miley Cyrus can not sing .
She 's not mediocre , she 's terrible .
Forget singing , she cant even talk properly .
She keeps her mouth continuously open while talking so all her words run together and it feels like a continuous barrage of noise which is what it is .
Here 's an actual Miley Cyrus quote about a biography of Einstein : " It 's really random but it was the biggest book in the bookstore and I was like I wanna show how smart I can be so that 's what I got " .
Now say all that without closing your mouth .
It is one of the enduring paradoxes of American racism that those black Americans most likely to exercise their full rights as citizens - to vote , to stand , to speak out - are the most likely to be branded as unpatriotic .
" Of course the fact that a person believes in racial equality does n't prove that he 's a communist , " said the chairman of a loyalty review board , one of the McCarthyite kangaroo courts that sat in judgment of possible communists , in the 50s .
" But it certainly makes you look twice , does n't it ?
You can't get away from the fact that racial equality is part of the communist line . "
Assuming that African - Americans could not possibly work out that white supremacy was not in their interests by themselves , their detractors routinely accused them of acting under influences both foreign and malign .
The FBI wasted millions of dollars and hours trying in vain to prove that Martin Luther King was a communist .
For those who would not know their place and were not assassinated , the punishment was often the revocation of whatever rights of citizenship they had .
Already denied the vote , freedom of movement and association , Paul Robeson was refused a passport in 1950 and confined to the US .
When his lawyers asked why , they were told that " his frequent criticism of the treatment of blacks in the United States should not be aired in foreign countries " .
In 1963 the intellectual and activist WEB Dubois was similarly grounded without passport privileges and so moved to the recently liberated Ghana .
The struggle for racial equality in America has always essentially been a battle for full citizenship .
In a country founded on the principles of the enlightenment and built on the backs of slaves , it has long exposed the tension between the country 's promise and its practice .
The founding fathers held both that all men were equal - and that a slave was worth three - fifths of a man .
Sooner or later , the nation would implode under the weight of these constitutional contradictions .
It took the best part of 200 years for the law to catch up .
In Barack Obama 's candidacy we are now learning how far America 's political culture has come in this regard and how far it still has to go .
Because , for all the misty - eyed liberal talk of him ushering in a post - racial era , the past few weeks have seen Obama fighting not just for the nomination but for his patriotic legitimacy .
Constantly questioning his national loyalty and obfuscating his religious affiliation , both the media and his opponents have sought to cast him not only as anti-American but un-American and at times even non-American .
His bid to transcend race appears to be crashing on the rocks of racism .
" Race is intertwined with a broader notion that he is not one of us , " Andrew Kohut , director of the Pew Research Centre , told the New York Times .
Pew conducted an extensive examination of voter attitudes , particularly among Democrats who have an unfavourable view of Obama .
" They react negatively to people who are seen as different . "
The point here is not whether white people are prepared to vote for him .
First , they clearly are .
Of the 10 whitest states to have voted so far , Obama has won nine .
And there are countless reasons why people do n't back him that have nothing to do with race - not least that they prefer another candidate on their merits .
At issue is the insidious and racist manner in which his candidacy is now being framed as that of a nefarious , foreign interloper whose allegiance to his country is inherently inauthentic and instinctively suspect .
Some of these charges have long emerged from familiar and predictable places .
As early as last year , Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News falsely claimed that he had attended an Islamist madrasa while a young boy in Indonesia .
When rightwing radio hosts refer to him they generally emphasise and repeat his middle name - Hussein - even though Obama rarely uses it .
But soon these attacks shifted from the political margins to the mainstream .
During the recent ABC debate , Obama was grilled about his refusal to wear an American flag tiepin .
One of the moderators asked Obama of his former pastor , Jeremiah Wright : " You do believe he 's as patriotic as you are ? "
Having given up on the African - American vote , the Clintons have clearly decided that it makes more electoral sense to collude with these attacks than it does to raise the tenor of the discussion and challenge them .
During the ABC debate , Hillary applauded the line of questioning .
" You know , these are problems , I think these are issues that are legitimate and should be explored . "
Being foreign , Muslim or unpatriotic should not be treated as slurs .
But in a post 9/11 framework , the Clintons know full well how these allusions will be understood and what the consequences might be .
When asked whether Obama was a Muslim , Hillary said that he was n't : " There is nothing to base that on - as far as I know . "
Three days after Obama made his landmark speech on race , Bill Clinton said of a potential match - up between Hillary Clinton and McCain : " I think it would be a great thing if we had an election year where you had two people who loved this country and were devoted to the interest of this country .
And people could actually ask themselves who is right on these issues , instead of all this other stuff that always seems to intrude itself on our politics . "
The implication was that Obama does n't love his country and all this " racial " stuff is just getting in the way .
All this does have an effect .
By February , 80 % of Americans had heard rumours that Obama was Muslim .
Even after the furore over the Rev Wright , one in 10 Democrats still believed this .
A recent Pew poll showed that the only character trait on which Obama loses to Clinton is patriotism .
Exit polls in Pennsylvania revealed that 18 % of Democrats said that race mattered to them in this contest - and just 63 % of them said that they would support Obama in a general election .
Unable to beat Obama on delegates and still unlikely to beat him in the popular vote , Hillary Clinton has just one strategy left - to persuade superdelegates that Obama is unelectable .
She has tried branding him as inexperienced and slick - tongued , and neither of those have worked .
At this stage she has just one argument left : his race .
For several months now , her aides have been whispering to whoever would listen that America would never elect a black candidate .
In desperation , some are now raising their voices .
But their accusations are not only cynical - by most accounts they also seem to be wrong .
It seems they have underestimated the potential of the American electorate .
Polls show that in the states won with less than a five - point margin in 2004 Obama does far better than Clinton against McCain .
The problem is not that Hillary Clinton is still in the race .
She has every right to be .
It is that she is running the kind of race that she is .
Having failed to convince voters of the viability of her own candidacy , she is now committed to proving the unviability of his .
Hillary once said it takes a village to raise a child .
Now she seems determined to destroy the village in order to save it .

Who Speaks for Islam ?
What a Billion Muslims Really Think
John L. Esposito and Dalia Mogahed
Gallup Press , 2008
230 pp .
A new book by John L. Esposito and Dalia Mogahed ought to have a profound and transforming influence on Americans ’ view of their government ’s confrontation with Islam .
The book , Who Speaks for Islam ?
What a Billion Muslims Really
Think , presents the results of six years of Gallup polling in the Muslim world between 2001 and 2007 .
" With the random sampling method that Gallup used , " the authors explain , " results are statistically valid with a plus or minus 3 - point margin of error .
In totality , we surveyed a sample representing more than 90 % of the world ’s 1.3 billion Muslims , making this the largest , most comprehensive study of contemporary Muslims ever done " ( xi ) .
Based on this data , Esposito and Mogahed have determined that Washington ’s conflict with Islam is " more about policy than principle " ( xi ) .
The pivotal findings of this massive study for U.S. national security pertain to the motivation of the Muslims who oppose the United States and the authors ’ claim that " [ o ] ne of the most important insights provided by Gallup ’s data is that the issues that drive radicals are also issues for moderates " ( 93 ) .
" As we have seen in the [ Gallup ] data , resentment against the West comes from what Muslims perceive as the West ’s hatred and denigration of Islam ; the Western belief that Arabs and Muslim are inferior ; and their [ Muslims ’ ] fear of Western intervention , domination , or occupation " ( 141 ) .
" As our [ Gallup ’s ] data has demonstrated , the primary cause of broad - based anger and anti-Americanism is not a clash of civilizations but the perceived effect of U.S. foreign policy in the Muslim world " ( 156 ) .
" [ The Gallup data shows that ] contrary to what the ‘ They Hate Our Freedom ’ thesis might predict , Muslims do not recommend or insist upon changes to Western culture or social norms as the path to better [ Western - Muslim ] relations .
Rather they call on the West to show greater respect for Islam , and they emphasize policy - related issues [ U.S. interventionism ; unqualified support for Israel ; and protection for authoritarian Arab regimes ] " ( 159 ) .
Over and over again , Esposito and Mogahed show the nearly complete absence among Muslims of a desire to destroy America ’s equality of opportunity , liberties , or democracy .
Indeed , the Gallup data show that these are the aspects of U.S. society that Muslims most admire .
" [ T ] he sentiments of vast majorities of those [ Muslims ] surveyed , " the authors write , " [ show ] they admire the West ’s political freedoms and they value and desire greater self - determination " ( 31 ) .
But , of equal importance , Muslims do not believe that greater democracy and self - determination in the Muslim world require a Western - like separation of church and state .
" Poll data show , " Esposito and Mogahed explain , " that large majorities of respondents in the countries surveyed cite the equal importance of Islam and democracy as essential to the quality of their lives and the future progress of the Muslim world " ( 35 ) .
And , again , these findings are common to those the authors refer to as moderates and radicals , as well as to male and female respondents ( 48 ) .
The Gallup data also show that Muslims make a keen distinction between modernity and Westernization .
The surveys found that Muslims have a profound respect and admiration for the West ’s technology and for its work ethic ; both are regarded as tools of modernity and avenues of social and economic progress for Muslims ( p. 97 ) .
Having presented this finding , however , the authors warn it must not be taken as eagerness for Westernization .
" [ W ] hile acknowledging and admiring many aspects of Western democracy , " the authors write , " those [ Muslims ] surveyed do not favor wholesale adoption of Western models of democracy few respondents associate ‘ adopting Western values ’ with Muslim political and economic progress . "
Perhaps the most counterintuitive result of the Gallup data for Western readers will be findings that the ostensibly degraded cultural status of women in the West is one of the things most despised by Muslims of both genders ( 110 ) ; that " the data simply do not support the persistent popular perception in the West that Muslim women can’t wait to be liberated from their culture and adopt the ways of the West " ( 110 ) ; and that there are no " systemic differences in many [ Muslim ] countries between males and females in their support for Sharia as the only source of legislation " ( 48 ) .
The work of Esposito and Mogahed establishes a solid empirical base for refuting the contentions of U.S. political leaders in both parties that " Muslims hate us for who we are not for what we do . "
But will it do the trick ?
Previously , Robert Pape ’s empirical study Dying to Win : The Logic of Suicide Terrorism demonstrated that U.S. intervention in the Muslim world is a key generator of suicide attacks on U.S. interests , and Marc Sageman ’s quantitative study Understanding Terror Networks politely shredded our leaders ’ claims that poverty , illiteracy , and unemployment cause terrorism  but the they - hate - our - freedoms chorus still chants on .
Indeed , after these books were written , Norman Podhoretz and George Weigel published neoconservative tomes that not only ignored the work of Pape and Sageman , but also scourged their countrymen for being too stupid to see that all U.S. interventions abroad are saintly and only medieval Islamofascists could oppose them .
On no other foreign policy issue since the Cold War ’s end has the truth been so easy to establish on the basis of hard facts but so hard for Americans to see  primarily because their leaders eagerly distort or ignore the truth .
The reality accurately presented by Esposito , Mogahed , Pape , and Sageman  as well as by Dr. Ron Paul  has never eluded Osama bin Laden , however .
Five years before Gallup even started collecting its data , bin Laden knew that U.S. foreign policy effectively united the Muslim world ’s moderates and radicals in anti-U.S. hatred , and that when he defied Washington and attacked U.S. interests because of those policies he both drew and grew support for his jihad against America .
The conclusions of my own books about bin Laden ’s thinking , words , and actions  which are largely corroborated by the findings of Who Speaks for Islam ?
 make it clear beyond a doubt that al - Qaeda ’s chief knows precisely what will sell wildly in the Muslim world and unite his brethren , as well as what will be rejected outright by U.S. leaders , with disastrous consequences for Americans .
Unfortunately , then , it seems unlikely that the fine book Who Speaks for Islam ?
will attract the attention , let alone change the mind , of any senior U.S. political leader .
Under either party , Washington will maintain its now 40 - year - old foreign policy status quo ; it will keep intervening in the Muslim world ; and it will continue telling Americans they are hated for who they are , not for what their government does .
Ultimately , our bipartisan political elite will turn the United States into one enormous Israel , lethally deaf to the realities of our struggle with Islamists ; arrogantly confidant of its pure intent and sure knowledge of God ’s will ; and utterly dependent on inadequate military and intelligence options to fight a rising tide of hatred among 1.3 billion Muslims .
Dave Gaubatz is no stranger to controversy .
The former Air Force Office of Special Investigations agent maintains he found Saddam 's WMD bunkers , but that the U.S. military declined to follow up .
His repeated allegations were picked up by a number of media outlets – and attracted the attention of prominent Congressmen , like then - Sen .
Rick Santorum , then - Rep. Curt Weldon , and Rep. Peter Hoekstra .
There has n't been any confirmation , however .
Lately , Gaubatz has been pushing another eye - opening assertion .
Earlier this month , Gaubatz claimed that the Active Denial System , the military 's allegedly - nonlethal " heat ray , " is really a killer weapon , after all .
It 's an allegation that , if true , would mean the entire public face of the program is a cover up of sorts .
Gaubatz says he saw first hand the military testing the ray gun on ... goats .
DANGER ROOM caught up with Gaubatz recently to quiz him a bit about his claims :
DR : Can you tell me about your involvement in the Active Denial System ?
Gaubatz :
My background in directed energy was from July 2000 till right after the war , September 2003 .
I was involved with active denial .
I was the point of contact [ for security ] at [ Air Force Research
Laboratory ] AFRL at Kirtland where it was tested and evaluated .
Anything they did went through us for security .
We had the Chinese ,
Russians , and many countries trying to steal this technology .
Anything they did , bringing in the animals , or testing , had to go through me .
I signed off on it , whether it could move or not move forward on this particular day .
DR : What sort of animals would they use ?
Gaubatz : Goats , primarily .
DR : Can you describe what took place with the animals ?
* Gaubatz :
They ’d bring the animals in , put them in the pens .
They 'd put curtains down , or a wall , to see if [ the beam ] could go through walls .
And it would .
You can go to different degrees ; you can do nonlethal .
But it was not designed as nonlethal .
* DR : Would the animals die quickly ?
Gaubatz :
It was quick .
DR : I hate to be gruesome , but what did the animals look like after they had been killed ?
Did they have visible burns .
Gaubatz :
No , not visibly , I did n’t get right up to the cages ....
I ’m a big animal lover , it was very hard for me in 2000 to see that .
I know it has its purpose , but it ’s very difficult for me to see the animals suffer like that .
DR : You talk about changing the dial between lethal and nonlethal .
As I understand it , the nonlethal version of Active Denial
System operates at 95 Ghz , which heats up the top layer of skins .
What frequency then does the lethal version operate in ?
* Gaubatz :
We get into the technical [ details ] , I ’m not the one who can give you the technical aspects .
All they had to do was change a dial if you wanted a nonlethal form .
And then it could be pumped up to whatever range you wanted . *
Okay , the lack of technical details leaves me with some doubts , but I do n't doubt his account of using goats .
I mean , the military just loves to test things on goats .
Poor goats .
These days , Gaubatz is involved with another project sure to stoke controversy ( depending on what he finds ) .
The Mapping Sharia project is gathering intelligence on U.S. mosques to determine which ones may pose a threat to U.S. security .
How do they do that ?
Infiltration .
" People go in under the guise of being long - term Muslims , " he says .

Mordehai Milgrom never wanted to be a heretic .
Twenty - five years ago , while poking around for a meaty research problem , he found one that changed the course of his career — and that might yet transform our most fundamental understanding of the universe .
His ideas , long relegated to the fringes of physics , where all but cranks fear to tread , have finally become too intriguing for his mainstream colleagues to ignore .
Milgrom 's heresy ?
He denies the existence of dark matter , the shadowy and thoroughly hypothetical stuff generally held to make up 80 percent or more of all matter in the universe .
Even though dark matter has eluded all attempts at detection , most cosmologists are convinced it must be out there .
Without it , there 's no explanation for much of what they see in the cosmos .
Or at least there had n't been until Milgrom 's break with orthodoxy .
His alternative not only eliminates dark matter , it strikes at the heart of modern physics .
In short , Milgrom thinks that Isaac Newton 's laws of gravity are incomplete .
Unlike many radical alternatives to conventional physics , Milgrom 's brainchild — known as modified Newtonian dynamics , or MOND — has not withered under scrutiny .
Attacked ?
Yes .
Ridiculed ?
Certainly .
Refuted ?
No .
A little more than a year ago , Milgrom , a professor of physics at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot , Israel , gained new support for his ideas when his longtime collaborator , Jacob Bekenstein , published a new , more powerful version of the theory , one fully consistent with Einstein 's general theory of relativity .
With this advance , MOND is poised to go head - to - head with dark - matter theories in describing how galaxies form and evolve .
Should MOND prove successful , thousands of papers in mainstream cosmology will become obsolete overnight .
And that is just half the story .
If Milgrom can claim victory , he will have wrought the most dramatic revision of our understanding of gravity since Einstein 's work of almost a century ago .
Mordehai Milgrom began his career studying objects called ultracompact neutron stars in binary star systems .
In 1979 , sensing the need for a new challenge , he bundled his family and headed on sabbatical to Princeton University , one of the world 's leading centers for the study of galaxies .
Even after half a century of unraveling the structure and evolution of galaxies , astronomers still had much to learn about them .
Milgrom became particularly intrigued by one intractable problem .
" I had heard there was this trouble understanding the so - called galactic rotation curves , which describe the way stars rotate around the centers of galaxies , " he says .
" I thought I would apply myself and try to think about this problem . "
No one knew it at the time , but the problem posed a challenge to a cornerstone of physics , the fundamental relationship between mass and gravity .
Isaac Newton figured out the rules for weighing orbiting bodies close to four centuries ago .
The simplicity and accuracy of Newton 's laws let any undergraduate transform observations of a satellite 's orbit into a direct measurement of the parent body 's mass .
It is Newton 's laws that tell us the sun weighs a thousand trillion trillion tons .
Throughout the 1970s , astronomers applied these laws to galaxies , hoping to extract a measure of their total mass .
The orbital speed of stars circling a galaxy can be teased from an analysis of their combined light .
Repeating this process for a sequence of positions from the center of the galaxy out to its visible edge allowed astronomers to determine rotation speeds at various distances .
Placing these points on a graph produced the galactic rotation curves that Milgrom had heard about .
The data were new and messy , but by the end of the disco decade it was clear that something was terribly wrong .
The skinny black line on a plot of stellar rotation speed versus distance was expected to go down — stars close to the galactic center should orbit faster than stars at the edge because all the mass concentrated at the center of the galaxy pulls most powerfully on the closest stars .
The same thing happens in the solar system :
Mars moves faster than Jupiter because the sun 's gravity pulls harder on it , Jupiter orbits faster than Saturn , and so on , out to Pluto and beyond .
A plot of orbital speeds and distance — a rotation curve of the solar system — does decrease with distance .
The skinny black line falls , just as Newton 's laws say it should .
The rotation curves for spiral galaxies do not .
At a certain distance from the galactic center , the rotation curves for stars in most every spiral galaxy simply do not fall ; instead , at some point they flatten .
All the stars in the middle and outer parts of these galaxies orbit with the same speed , in seeming defiance of Newton 's laws .
Why do n't the outer stars move more slowly than the inner ones ?
When confronting such a paradox , scientists have only a few options : Question the data , question the theory , or invent something new , maybe even something invisible , to explain the effect .
In the late 1970s , astronomers were beginning to line up behind the last alternative .
Faced with flat rotation curves that seemed to flout Newton 's laws , astronomers assumed the existence of a halo of dark matter around every spiral galaxy .
Whatever the stuff was , it did not emit light , but it did exert a gravitational pull .
The dark matter tugged on the stars , cranking up their speeds and creating the flat rotation curves .
The choice was reasonable , but it was still a choice .
" Science does not emerge in some perfect , complete crystalline form , " says Princeton University cosmologist James Peebles .
" Sometimes one must make extended conclusions from limited data .
Why should all matter be in the visible sector ?
Dark matter was a simple solution to the problem . "
It was a solution , however , that Milgrom could not accept .
He took a shot at the second alternative .
Milgrom decided to retrofit Newton .
He set out to modify aspects of Newton 's laws of motion so that they could naturally yield the flat rotation curves for galaxies .
" I was systematic , " he says .
" I knew Newton 's laws worked for the solar system , but they did n't seem to work for galaxies .
So I made a table of solar system properties and galaxies ' properties to see which one might present the best road to modifying the equations . "
Milgrom 's systematic method was critical .
Spiral galaxies can be a hundred million times larger than the solar system .
A naive approach would simply change Newton 's gravitational force law at large distances , but this attack fails to describe accurately other properties of large systems like galaxies .
Milgrom then tried modifying the gravitational force based on the spin of the galaxy .
No dice .
" The last property on my table was acceleration , " Milgrom says , " and that one worked . "
If you took high school physics , you may remember having Newton 's most important equation pounded into your head : F = ma .
With this simple formula , known as Newton 's second law , Newton forever linked forces ( F ) to their action on mass ( m ) in the form of acceleration ( a ) .
We all experience the relation between force and acceleration whenever we 're in a car .
As the car accelerates , we 're forced back in our seats ; when it decelerates , we 're forced forward .
Milgrom found that the best way to resolve the problem of the flat rotation curves was to modify this hallowed equation .
" I assumed that when the accelerations due to gravitational forces became very small , the formula changes to F = ma² / a0 , " Milgrom says .
According to Milgrom , this change holds only when accelerations fall below one 10 - billionth of a meter per second every second .
Not only does this modification work best with the data , he adds , but the new constant , a0 , may be of cosmological significance :
Accelerating at this rate will take you from a resting state to the speed of light in the lifetime of the universe .
Otherwise Newton 's law operates as usual .
So with MOND , stars in the outer reaches of galaxies move faster than expected , not because of the influence of some invisible matter but because Milgrom 's amended version of Newton 's second law increases the force acting on them .
When he used this modified equation to plot the rotation curves , the flatness at the outer distances was predictable , not puzzling .
Nothing else was needed to explain it .
To a layperson , Milgrom 's innovation might seem like a negligible tweak , but to his colleagues , it was bold to the point of foolhardiness .
He was changing a cornerstone of physics .
Opposition was a given .
In 1981 Milgrom began working on papers to publicize his idea .
He was laboring alone — since returning from Princeton , he had told no one of his work but his wife .
He sent drafts of his papers to a few mentors and colleagues .
Their reactions were muted but encouraging .
" None of them reacted violently , " Milgrom says .
" I even got some helpful comments . "
In spite of the suggestions Milgrom had received — all from world - class scientists — getting the papers published became an ordeal .
" I was a little naive , " Milgrom says .
" I thought the papers would be welcomed .
They were rejected by the journals at first .
The reasons varied : ' It was all nonsense ' ; ' It 's too early to consider an alternative to Newton ' ; ' There is no trouble yet ; the flat rotational curves will be resolved in other ways . ' "
Looking back on this period , Milgrom betrays no bitterness .
" I went back and looked at the history of science and saw this happens again and again .
The marketplace can only handle so many heretical ideas at one time .
I think on the whole I have been treated fairly . "
After Milgrom 's dogged persistence , all three of his original papers on modified Newtonian dynamics were published side by side in 1983 in Volume 270 of The Astrophysical Journal , a premier publication in the field .
As is often the case with radical ideas , the community 's reaction was not scorn but silence .
" At first the work was not accepted , not even really looked at , " Milgrom recalls .
By this time he had begun collaborating on MOND with fellow Israeli theorist Jacob Bekenstein .
Bekenstein , who had already won some acclaim for his work on black holes , became a hard - core MONDista .
" In 1986 we were invited to present a talk at a meeting in Princeton , " says Milgrom .
" This made us really happy .
At least we were getting noticed . "
MOND began to make inroads .
Its solution to the galaxy - rotation - curve problem was too elegant to ignore .
For most galaxies it explained observations better than dark matter did .
But why did MOND work ?
What was the justification for changing Newton 's law other than that it made the rotation - curve problem disappear ?
There was no reason , and Milgrom knew it .
His solution was n't a theory ; it was simply a description and did not explain anything from first principles .
Meanwhile , the dark - matter hypothesis had become ever more sophisticated .
So while Milgrom and a handful of true believers continued to work on MOND , dark matter had attracted legions of supporters and became the subject of hundreds of research papers .
Where dark matter once seemed as ad hoc as Milgrom 's proposal , it had over the past decade morphed into a full - blown theory that explained far more than just the peculiar movement of stars in galaxies .
Dark matter had become crucial to understanding the entire large - scale structure of the universe and how galaxies formed in the first place .
One of the most striking astronomical discoveries of the past 20 years is that galaxies are not randomly scattered .
They 're organized in vast sheets hundreds of millions of light - years in extent .
Huge expanses devoid of visible matter separate the sheets .
The only explanation cosmologists can offer for this structure is that the enormous galactic sheets must themselves be embedded in even larger agglomerations of dark matter .
Supporters of dark matter draw their most convincing evidence from the early universe .
For the past few years , a NASA spacecraft called the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe , or WMAP , has been studying the cosmic microwave background radiation , which is a relic of the Big Bang .
The fine details of the radiation hold clues about how matter was distributed when the universe was only a few hundred thousand years old .
Dark - matter models have predicted what WMAP has seen with such stunning accuracy that cosmologists now rely on dark matter to explain the entire evolution of the universe .
" The big difference between now and 20 years ago , " James Peebles says , " is the quality of cosmological data [ from WMAP ] .
I am deeply impressed with the way dark matter has explained cosmological observations . "
To make MOND a serious alternative to dark matter , Milgrom 's inspired guess needed to mature into a true theory , with a firm foundation in modern physics .
And that meant confronting not just Newton but his wild - haired offspring , Einstein .
It was Einstein who divined the interconnections between gravity , space , and time .
For MOND to make headway in the field , someone was going to have to find a way to reconcile it with Einstein 's masterpiece , the theory of general relativity .
" You can compare the first version of MOND to Kepler discovering the shape of planetary orbits , " says Mario Livio , the senior astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore .
In 1605 Kepler figured out that planets have elliptical orbits , but he could not explain why .
It took the genius of Newton , in his 1687 Principia Mathematica , to finish what Kepler started and provide a complete theory , including the nature of the gravitational force .
Milgrom needed to do the same for MOND to expand its explanatory power .
" Of course I knew a relativistic version of MOND was needed , " he says , " but , hey , there is no theory of quantum gravity yet either .
MOND had survived so many other tests over the years that my confidence had grown with time .
There has never been anything drastically wrong found with the MOND framework .
It simply was not equipped to deal with cosmology and galaxy formation . "
Michael Turner , a cosmologist at the University of Chicago , sees the contrast more starkly .
" MOND was a clever idea , but we are pretty far down the path in cosmology now , and the simpler solution is to assume that there are just particles out there that do n't give off light . "
Turner says he will always keep an open mind to interesting new theories , but the successes of dark matter are just too hard to ignore .
" It 's like you 're at a baseball game , and it 's the ninth inning , and dark matter has a 14 - run lead over MOND , which is n't even on base yet .
The game may not be over , but people are heading for the parking lot . "
Turner 's analogy drives home the role that human resources play in developing a theory .
For whatever reason , MOND had remained a wallflower at the astrophysics ball .
It was hard to find dance partners , physicists willing to devote the long hours to figuring out the gritty mathematical details by which the theory would live or die .
String theory , for example , is an exceedingly abstract piece of work , but because of its perceived promise , armies of talented young physicists are drawn to it .
MOND had no such fan base .
To Turner , this makes perfect sense .
" As a theorist you see that with a really good idea , you put a quarter in and you get 10 dollars out , and people should flock to your idea , " he says .
" I just have not seen that with MOND . "
With only a few diehards working on MOND , progress was necessarily slow .
Peebles applauds the existence of MOND as an alternative to dark matter , but he points out its recruitment problems .
" With so much success happening with dark matter and cosmology , if you were a young scientist , would you bet your career on MOND ? "
In the face of such pressure , it was left to the old guard to find a way forward .
On March 25 , 2004 , a paper from Physical Review Letters D appeared on the Los Alamos preprint server , a Web site where physicists post their newest articles .
The paper , titled " Relativistic Gravitation Theory for the MOND Paradigm , " was written by Jacob Bekenstein , Milgrom 's collaborator since the 1980s .
Building on earlier attempts , Bekenstein was finally able to generate a MOND theory that Einstein might have loved .
The new theory was called TeVeS , an acronym for tensor , vector , and scalar — mathematical terms that describe how matter and energy interact with space and time in general relativity .
" TeVeS does everything , " says Mario Livio with enthusiasm .
A self - described agnostic in the MOND debate , but one with an obvious love for the underdog , Livio says that Bekenstein 's work is " a phenomenal paper . "
In TeVeS , he adds , all the right things happen .
Its results mesh with what physicists know about gravity from Einstein , and when gravity is very weak , it reduces to the behavior Milgrom envisioned in his first MOND papers .
" With Bekenstein 's theory we should now be able to explore all aspects of relativistic behavior , " Milgrom says , unable to hide his pride .
" This includes the bending of light by gravity , and in principle , the new theory should be OK for galaxy formation . "
TeVeS may not be the final word on making MOND jibe with relativity , but it is a critical first step .
" Perhaps there are more beautiful and elegant forms of the theory out there , " Livio says .
What matters most is that now the contest between MOND and dark matter can really get started .
" With MOND you could not do cosmology , " he says , " but you can do it with TeVeS . "
TeVeS has already passed a crucial first test , Milgrom says , because it can be used to explain the phenomenon of gravitational lensing , a cosmic optical illusion in which matter bends light .
It 's one of the stranger predictions of general relativity , and astronomers have confirmed it many times over .
When observing a distant galaxy , for example , massive objects between Earth and the galaxy act like a giant lens and bend the galaxy 's light , creating multiple images of the single galaxy .
Dark - matter models have been used to explain the lensing of many distant galaxies .
If Milgrom can convince his colleagues that TeVeS does it just as well , it 's a whole new ball game , and maybe some of the fans will start returning to their seats .
Papers comparing TeVeS and dark matter are just beginning to appear , and it is far too soon to say how the new work will ultimately be judged .
While TeVeS and all the other MOND approaches may fall into the trash bin of scientific history , the same fate may await dark matter .
Expensive and elaborate searches for dark - matter particles have come up empty - handed .
If those ongoing hunts continue to fail , and if the momentum for MOND - inspired theories continues to build , the tide may turn , and the entire elaborate cosmological scaffolding may be rocked from its foundations .
It 's a startling thought that dark matter , now such an integral if mysterious part of the modern picture of the universe , might simply vanish overnight .
That would n't be heresy .
That would be a revolution .
By the Sweat of Their Browser Inga Kiderra | April 23 , 2007 Naked to the waist , lit cigarette dangling from his lips , a young Chinese worker in Zhejiang Province begins a tedious midnight shift at a factory .
For the next 10 to 12 hours , he will grind out goods destined for a developed country .
Only he is not making toys or shoes or plastic kitchen utensils .
He ’s playing a computer game .
In the same shop , there might be half a dozen to 100 other employees .
Across China , perhaps 100,000 more .
Known as “ gold farmers , they slay pixilated monsters for a living .
They gather virtual currency or “ gold ” in massively multiplayer online role - playing games , or MMORPGs , like World of Warcraft , EverQuest and Lineage , to trade for real money .
They are like immigrant workers in the virtual world , says Ge Jin , and they arouse some of the same anxieties .
Jin – despite being nicknamed “ Jingle ” – is not a gold farmer or even a gamer .
A doctoral student in the communication department at UC San Diego , he came across the phenomenon when a friend decided to ditch an engineering major and go back home to Shanghai to open a gold farm .
The friend ’s venture ultimately failed .
But Jin found the subject for his doctoral dissertation and a documentary .
Since the summer of 2005 , Jin has made three research and filming trips to China .
The farmers Jin found are typically male and aged 18 to 25 .
They earn between $ 40 and $ 200 per month , averaging $ 100 – or about what they would make in a blue - collar job .
Though conditions vary , food and housing are usually provided .
Some farms are indistinguishable from sweatshops while others resemble nothing so much as a college dorm , rowdy camaraderie included .
Most farmers – even those that complain of boredom , alienation and hostile in - game encounters with “ amateur ” players – absolutely love what they do .
After hours , they can be found in Internet cafes playing the same games for fun .
The bosses , many of whom are former farmers and are barely older than their employees , sell the virtual assets their group collects – gold , epic weapons , armor , potions and even whole characters with stats that have been “ leveled - up ” – to online brokers abroad .
The brokers , in turn , mark up the goods and pass them on to cash - flush players in the U.S. , Europe and Korea , who prefer paying to spending the time themselves .
With at least 100 million players worldwide logging in to online games each month , all of this translates into big business .
The online game market was valued , by game industry researcher DFC Intelligence , at $ 3.4 billion in 2005 and forecasted to grow to $ 13 billion by 2011 .
Estimates of the shadow “ real - money trade ” market in MMORPG items , meanwhile , begin at $ 200 million and go up to $ 1 billion a year .
The “ real - money trade ” is controversial .
It appears to be tolerated by the Chinese government , but is reviled by the majority of game publishers .
Blizzard Entertainment , creator of the hugely popular World of Warcraft , for example , maintains it is illegal , that all game content is the company ’s property , and so regularly patrols for and shuts down suspicious accounts .
( To avoid detection , Chinese farmers will often use off - shore proxy servers . )
Online auction giant eBay recently decided to steer clear and disallow the sale of game items on its site .
Sony , on the other hand , operates its own exchange for EverQuest and takes a 10 percent cut .
Gamers ’ reactions are mixed .
Clearly , many are buying the booty .
Yet , some form gangs or war parties to hunt down and harm suspected farmers .
Responses to the video clips Jin has posted on YouTube are telling :
They range from ethnic slurs and expletives to “ w00ts ” in praise of enterprise and capitalism .
Obama : McCain better than Bush
Barack Obama seemed to break with the core of the Democratic Party 's strategy against John McCain at a town hall in Reading , telling the audience that McCain would be better than George W. Bush .
" You have a real choice in this election .
Either Democrat would be better than John McCain , " Obama said .
" And all three of us would be better than George Bush . "
Obama himself has described McCain as running for a third Bush term , and the leading Democratic 527 tested an ad earlier this year arguing that the Arizona senator is " McSame as Bush . "
So it 's a strategically puzzling thing to say , one that will likely be used to undermine some of the party 's future ads , though perhaps Obama is just saying what he thinks .
DIGG THIS
Many people are finally saying the R word : Recession .
The fundamentals do n’t look good .
The externals are even scarier : dollar and stocks skidding , gold and other prices ( particularly producer prices ) rising .
But what has tipped the psychological scales is the statistic no one has cared much about in many years : unemployment .
The actual rate is very low by any historical standard : 5 % . What matters here is the direction of change .
It jumped from 4.7 % .
In the old days , unemployment rates of 5 % and 6 % were considered “ full employment ” in the Keynesian models .
If government attempted to push employment below that level ( and it is absurd to think that anyone in Washington can control the economy in that way ) , it would risk setting off inflation , or so it was believed .
If the actual unemployment rate is low , why this wave of pessimism ?
All data in the postwar period of American economic history consistently show that an increase in the rate has coincided with the onset of recession .
The parallel between the two is the most consistent feature of the business cycle .
See the NBER list : 2001 , 1990 — 91 , 1981 — 82 , 1980 , 1973 — 75 , 1970 , 1960 — 61 , 1957 — 58 , 1953 — 54 , and so on .
In each case , unemployment begins to rise at the onset .
Now , keep in mind that the link between rising unemployment and recession is largely true by definition only .
In other words , those charged with defining what is and what is n’t a recession put a huge weight on rising unemployment .
So of course it appears that weak labor markets are what push an economy into recession .
This is sheer fallacy , and a particularly dangerous one .
Rising unemployment is a symptom of a recession , not its cause .
If the critical problem of recession is unemployment , policy makers are tempted to address this one area to the exclusion of everything else .
Already , Bush administration spokesmen are talking about a “ fiscal stimulus ” to counter this trend .
But why is n’t this laughable on its face ?
Perhaps if Bush had been a famed penny pincher , you could see how a stimulus would make some sense on the surface .
But it is hard to imagine a more fiscally profligate regime than the Bush administration .
We can confidently say that more spending is not the answer .
The view that unemployment causes recession was one of the great errors of the New Deal and the Great Depression .
The government looted the private sector and transferred it to visible jobs programs .
It forced business to maintain high wages precisely when the market was attempting to equilibrate them downward .
It increased the costs of hiring just when the costs needed to be lower .
None of it did any good ; in fact , it delayed recovery for many years .
Lionel Robbins , in his classic book The Great Depression , wrote this in 1934 : “ If it had not been for the prevalence of the view that wage rates must at all costs be maintained in order to maintain the purchasing power of the consumer , the violence of the present depression and the magnitude of the unemployment which has accompanied it would have been considerably less … .
A policy which holds wage rates rigid when the equilibrium rate has altered , is a policy which creates unemployment . ”
Writing in 1931 , in his book Causes of the Economic Crisis , Ludwig von Mises explained that there would be no involuntary unemployment in a free market .
There will always be some unemployment in a market in the same way that there are houses that are empty and not selling and resources that are not being used for production .
This is n’t due to market failure but to individuals who have the freedom to lower their asking price , provided they are permitted by policy to do so and businesses are free to negotiate wages freely .
What , then , is the solution to unemployment ?
“ The determination of wage rates must become free once again .
The formation of wage rates should be hampered neither by the clubs of striking pickets nor by government ’s apparatus of force .
Only if the determination of wage rates is free , will they be able to fulfill their function of bringing demand and supply into balance on the labor market . ”
There is an error even more fundamental than seeking an interventionist solution to the problem of unemployment .
It is the attempt to seek a solution to the recession itself , as if it were the critical problem .
Writing all throughout the 1930s , both Mises and F.A. Hayek tried to explain that the recession itself served a market purpose , in the same way a correction to an inflated stock market serves a purpose .
It re-coordinates economic structures that have grown seriously out of balance .
In other words , they urged that we look back before the recession , to the good old days of economic boom , and realize the prosperity of the past was a partial illusion .
The recession is the way that the economy tells the truth about the fundamentals .
The illusion itself is caused by errors in monetary policy .
Interest rates are driven down by the Fed , and this causes widespread errors in the investment sector .
These investments are unsustainable over the long term .
The recession is the time of cleansing out errors and reestablishing economic soundness .
The housing boom and bust is only a symptom of a wider problem .
If the economy has indeed fallen into recession , we can know with certainty that recession is precisely what the economy needs the most .
It is the equivalent of the drunk who needs time on the wagon .
The rap on the Austrian School of the 1930s is that they counseled a do - nothing policy on the depression .
That is not true .
There are many things that government can do but they all amount to doing less , which is a positive action of sorts .
It must not attempt to prop up and raise wages .
It must stop taxing business so heavily and raising the costs of investment .
It must cut regulations that are hampering recovery .
It can cut spending dramatically as a way of returning resources to the private sector where they can do some good .

Wikipedia has temporarily blocked edits from the US Department of Justice after someone inside the government agency tried to erase references to a particularly - controversial Wiki-scandal .
Early last week , the Boston - based Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America ( CAMERA ) was accused of organizing a secret campaign to influence certain articles on the " free encyclopedia anyone can edit " .
Just days later , the DoJ's IP range was used to edit the site 's entry on the Pro -Israel " media - monitoring group , " lifting a new section that detailed the controversy .
The DoJ did not respond to our requests for comment .
But odds are , the edits were made by a single individual acting independently .
Wikipedia 's ban on the department 's IP is due to be lifted today .
On April 21 , the Pro-Palestine site Electronic Intifada published a series of emails in which CAMERA Senior Research Analyst Gilead Ini seems to enlist volunteers to help " keep Israel - related entries on Wikipedia from becoming tainted by anti-Israel editors " .
Ini asks these volunteers to avoid forwarding his emails to the news media and invites them onto a Google Group called " Isra-pedia . "
In an email to The Reg , Ini declined to say if the messages published by Electronic Intifada were genuine , but he acknowledged that CAMERA recently ran an email campaign meant to promote edits that " ensure accuracy " on certain Wikipedia articles .
Electronic Intifada
On the alleged Isra-pedia thread - also published by Electronic Intifada - one longtime Wikipedia editor gives volunteers a primer on how to become a site administrator .
" There is in Wikipedia the ability by an administrator to set significant limits on other editor [ sic ] , " he writes .
" One or more of you who want to take this route should stay away from any Israel realted [ sic ] articles for month [ sic ] until they [ sic ] interact in a positive way with 100 Wikipedia editors who would be used later to vote you as an administrator . "
This Wikipedia editor , known as " Zeq , " and several others involved with the CAMERA emails were subsequently sanctioned .
Some were barred from editing topics involving the Arab - Israeli conflict , and at least one - " Gni , " believed to be Ini - was banned from the site entirely .
In the wake of these sanctions , a paragraph on the scandal was added to Wikipedia 's CAMERA article , and on two separate occasions , someone inside the DoJ tried to remove it .
The user also made a few questionable edits to other articles , and the DoJ 's entire IP was banned for four days .
This ongoing affair brings up all the old questions about the social experiment that is Wikipedia .
On one level , the site is working hard to police its own content .
But on another , you have to wonder if all this back and forth is really necessary .
Longtime contributor Christiano Moreschi , one of the editors that banned the accounts in question , sees the CAMERA crackdown as Wikipedia at its best .
" This was an amateur and quite pathetic attempt to subvert the purpose of Wikipedia , " he told The Reg .
" I have no doubt these chaps were genuine - they were genuinely trying to slant articles towards a pro-Israel point of view , but were massively incompetent at doing so .
" Even if their emails had not been leaked to Electronic Intifada I do n't think we would have had much trouble dealing with them as individuals ...
Once EI had published the emails , the response of the Wikipedia administrative corps was swift , competent , and professional . "
' Capricious '
But Gilead Ini sees things differently .
Declining to say whether he 's behind the Gni account , he argues that Wikipedia is banning contributors without sufficient evidence .
" Wikipedia notes that ' Revealing the names of pseudonymous editors is in all cases against basic policy , ' " he told us .
" Some Wikipedia administrators - editors elected to a position of power in Wikipedia - are capriciously banning Wikipedia accounts based on nothing more than speculation about who owns that account . "
Ini insists that his email campaign adhered to Wikipedia 's rules - which he sees as vague and only intermittently enforced .
Some have accused him of creating " sockpuppets " and " meatpuppets " - extra accounts used to push his own point of view - but he 's adamant this is not the case .
" A meat puppet is described as ' one who edits on behalf of or as proxy for another editor , ' " he said .
" Nobody who participated in [ his email group ] was expected to be a ' proxy ' for me or anybody else .
They were encouraged to learn about , and if they are moved to do so , participate in , Wikipedia . "
You may think Ini is talking rubbish .
But as we 've said before , Wikipedia invites such controversy in giving editors the right to anonymity .
If users were required to identify themselves , puppetry would n't be the problem it is - and the site could suppress a single voice without blocking the DoJ 's entire IP range .
But there 's another question worth asking :
If Wikipedia is right to ban someone who merely attempted to game the site , why has n't it banned others who 've actually succeeded ? ®
Rush Limbaugh Implicated In Vote Fraud Scheme Posted by Pile ( 23399 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
In case you missed it , Rush Limbaugh , the oxycotin - taking conservative talk radio host , was urging Republicans in Texas and Ohio to skip their party 's primary on March 4 and instead cast a vote for Hillary Clinton in order to prolong the fight between her and Barack Obama .
And that Tuesday , as media in both states reported , thousands of Republicans did just what Limbaugh and others had suggested -- they changed parties to vote for Clinton .
One problem .
That 's basically illegal .
And now the board of elections is looking into a criminal investigation of the matter .
As the board of election in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , where Cleveland is located , launches an investigation into illegal crossover voting in the state 's 2008 presidential primary , a big open question remains unanswered :
Will county officials go after the ringleaders of apparently illegal electioneering where thousands of Republican voters swore -- under penalty of law -- allegiance to the Democratic Party in order to vote for Hillary Clinton ?
" I want Hillary to stay in this , Laura , " Limbaugh told Laura Ingraham on Feb. 29 , near the start of his Hillary crusade .
" This is too good a soap opera .
We need Barack Obama bloodied up politically , and it's obvious that the Republicans are not going to do it and do n't have the stomach for it , as you probably know . "
And on Wednesday , the day after the Ohio primary , Fox News asked Clinton if she owed Limbaugh a thank you .
" Be careful what you wish for , Rush , " she replied .
Later that day , Limbaugh played the Fox tape on his show and said , " How do you interpret this , folks ?
She could have said thank you .
She could have said thank you !
In fact , I was expecting in her victory speech last night to be thanked .
" I helped give Mrs. Clinton the biggest and happiest moment and night of the campaign season so far , maybe her life , and she tells me , " Be careful what you wish for , Rush " ?
Why , that sounds like a threat , does it not ?
I 've got a Democrat presidential candidate threatening your host .
Why , I am stunned !
After all I did ... "
While this all makes for great talk radio and sounds like fun , there is one catch : What Limbaugh encouraged Republican voters to do in Ohio was a fifth - degree felony in that state , punishable with a $ 2,500 fine and six to 12 months in jail .
That is because in order to change party affiliation in Ohio , voters have to fill out a form swearing allegiance to that party 's principles " under penalty of election falsification . "
On Thursday , March 20 , the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that the " Cuyahoga County Board of Election has launched an investigation that could lead to criminal charges against voters who maliciously switched parties for the March 4 presidential primary . "
According to the report , " One voter scribbled the following addendum to his pledge as a new Democrat : " For one day only . "
" Such an admission amounts to voter fraud , " the report continued , attributing that conclusion to BOE member Sandy McNair , a Democrat .
The report said the four - member board -- two Democrats and two Republicans -- had yet to vote on whether it would issue subpoenas , although Ohio 's secretary of state , Democrat Jennifer Brunner , is empowered to cast tie - breaking votes when the BOE is deadlocked .

He should be forced to air public service announcements rennouncing election fraud schemes for a year .
It 's defintely against the spirit of a fair electoral process .
Pretty much something someone lacking a high school diploma would come up with .
Guess he figures subvert and sabotage is legal under current leadership .
I can see how Rush appeals to the type of person who would do this sort of thing .
It would make a great college thesis .

It 's quite fitting ( I believe ) that this is occuring in Cuyahoga County .
It is wrong

Limbaugh is trying to subvert and corrupt the Democratic primary process , whose purpose is for the Democrats to elect their representative for President .
It is not meant for vitriolic hate - mongers to enjoy a " bloodbath " .
This guy must be held accountable for his actions .
Thry were after Kucinich too

This was n't just about Hillary and Barack -- it was also about the attempt to derail Dennis Kucinich 's bid for reelection to the House .
He still won his primary , however , thank God !
In any event , this is Ohio 's problem and it's all Ohio 's fault .
They allowed for this , so they have nothing to complain about if they do n't change their process .
Ohio got what it asked for .

Could n't you just say voting for McCain ( or whomever ) in your opinion was in the best interest of the Democrat party ?
Posted by David Chesler on 2008-03-23 20:19:04
Which principles of the Democratic Party do the McCain supporters not support that all bona fide members of the Party do support ?
Plenty of people hold their noses while voting .

Talk about a BS alert .
How about reporting something real ?
And the principles of the Democratic Party are ....??
Posted by lholman on 2008-03 - 24 11:50:24
Just a question - is there a list of Democratic Party principles ?
Hardly anyone - Democrat or Republican backs everything in their party 's platform .
My congressman is a conservative Democrat .
There are very liberal Republican congressmen .
Which one better represents the principles of the Democratic party ?

Gosh , where do you think Rush got the idea from ?
The Democrats have been doing this for years .
Guess they can dish it out but not take it ... figures .

All we need is one person to flip on Rush and he 's done .
When faced with a year in prison , or flip on rush .
Guess what , Rush is toast .
Switched
Posted by Janet H on 2008-03-25 04:21:31
I did switch to become a democrat , not because of Rush Limbaugh , I have no respect for him or what he is trying to do .
I switched because the Republican party seems to be taking this country to hell .
Where 's the proof !?

To Jeff Dewitt who wrote :

This to me is a typical political expression ( mostly from Republicans lately ) ...
Jeff ... show me the PROOF that the " Democrats have been doing this for years " .
Site the case , news article , people involved .. .etc , instead of a intellectually dishonest blanket statement .
Rush Limbaugh is a PROVEN liar ( and I can back that up with published FACTS ) .
TripleT Ohio Secretary of State Official Ruling
Posted by Ohio Republican on 2008-03-26 04:28:56
I am a McCain supporter , and since Rush had been dissing McCain , I had not been listening to Rush on the Radio since November .
So , I was surprised when my conservative friends asked me if I was following Rush ’s suggestion when I suggested to my conservative friends that they vote for Hilary in the Primary and McCain in the General .
I told them that I felt that our choice for the White House was to rank candidates based on Experience .
McCain had the most , Hillary was second , and Barack was third .
So , voting for Hillary would help guarantee that I get one of the top two into the White House .
My preference was McCain , of course , but if Hillary won the primary and I lost my first choice ( McCain ) in the General , then at least we would not have someone with little experience in the White House .
I believe this approach was reasonable approach to protect my interested since the General Elections have been so close .
BTW – I do not believe Hillary has any experience , but I figured Bill does ; and Hillary will just ask Bill what to do when she gets that 3 AM phone call .
To make sure I did not violate the law , I contacted the Ohio State Secretary ’s Office before voting , and they confirmed that what I wanted to do was legal .
So , I say sorry to Dan Abrams and anyone else who wants to judge my vote .
BTW Dan ,
What pledge are you talking about ?
I never had to sign a pledge .
Below is a copy of my email exchange with the Ohio Secretary of State ’s Office :

Thanks .
I think you cleared it up .
I understand you to say …
No matter how I have voted in the past , I can vote in the primary .
And no matter how I vote in the primary , I can choose whoever I want in the General Election .
Do I have that correct ?

No need for confusion .
First , you do n't need to re-register to vote in the primary on Mar. 4th .
Second :
Yes , if you register to vote as a dem or rep in the primary , you can vote for either or none in the general on Nov 4th .
Third : if you vote as an " independent " in the primary you can vote for whomever you choose in the general on Nov 4th .

I am sure that if you took the time to do a google search , you could find several more links .
Here are two from Ohio :
" For example , in Franklin County in 2000 , 4,160 Democrats crossed over to vote in the GOP primary , which pitted George W. Bush against Sen. John McCain .
In the 2006 primary , 4,720 Democrats crossed over to vote in a Republican primary that included a hotly contested race for the nomination for governor . "

" The board 's inquiry turned up about 17,100 Republicans and 3,000 Democrats who crossed over , and on Monday , the four board members - the aforementioned Democrats , and Republicans Jeff Hastings and Rob Frost - are to decide whether to take the next step toward making all of that party - switching a criminal matter : subpoenaing crossover voters to testify to the purity of their motives on March 4 .

Voter Intimidation

" @voter intimidation that applies only to candidates for president , not candidates for candidate for president .
the political parties are organizations which can proscribe any set of rules for determining who they choose as their candidate . "
False .
The discussion here is about Ohio Law , which is NOT governed by " the political parties are organizations " .
The DNC cannot tell an Ohio Voter , not matter what party he supports , that they cannot vote in the Democrat Primary .
To do so , would be a violation of Federal Law .
Thankfully , the Ohio SoS has respect for the US Constitution .

" i would definitely prosecute "
And if you were the prosecutor in the case , it would probably end your career .
" Brunner told The Dispatch on Friday that she believes the board is on sensitive ground because voting is the the form of free speech that enjoys the greatest constitutional protection .
All the more reason why she should communicate this message forcefully to Cuyahoga County officials .
After all , she has not been shy about intervening forcefully with county boards in other matters .
Surely this is an issue as important as any . "

" The people that participated in this type of fraud should not be allowed to vote republican in the General .... "
Voting for the candidate of your choice is not a fraud , it is a constitutional exercise of free speech .
Further , how do you propose to enforce your UNCONSTITUTIONAL plot to VIOLATE the rights of these Ohio voters ?
Are you going to tell them that they will go to jail if they do not vote for a Democrat ??
Do you really think that any court would allow for such voter intimidation tactics to be carried out ?

A reader writes :

I am totally not voting for Reverend Wright anymore .
Landslide victories lead Barack Obama supporters to crown him with sense of inevitability .
Obama takes on new aura of momentum
Who ’s inevitable now ?
With three landslide victories in Tuesday ’s “ Chesapeake Primary ” in Virginia , Maryland , and Washington , D.C. , and a widening lead by any measure of delegates , Senator Barack Obama ’s supporters have begun to suggest a case that , just a few months ago , was coming from Hillary Rodham Clinton :
He ’s a lock .
Advertisement
In a conference call with reporters before polls closed Tuesday , Obama campaign manager David Plouffe cited “ the cold , hard reality of the math . ”
" I do n't think it 's so much about momentum as the reality of the math , " he said , citing the campaign ’s success in building a small but unmistakable lead among pledged delegates .
“ If we continue to do that , mathematical reality sets in and it becomes harder and harder to overcome . "
Plouffe ’s aim was to begin the process of massing uncommitted Democratic leaders behind a front - running Obama , the same end to which Clinton and her aides wielded her high poll numbers last year .
The stress on Obama ’s delegate lead was also the opening of an effort to muscle Clinton – now trailing by almost any count of delegates – from the race .
But on the numbers , Plouffe has a point .
An analysis of the delegate count by Politico indicates that Obama ’s wide margins in contests over the last week mean that Clinton will be forced to answer with not just victories , but landslides of her own , in the big states on which she is staking her hopes – Ohio and Texas , which vote March 4 .
“ We ’re going to sweep across Texas in the next three weeks , bringing our message about what we need in America :
The kind of president that will be required on day one to be commander in chief , to turn the economy around , ” Clinton told a crowd of thousands in El Paso Thursday night .
“ I ’m tested .
I ’m ready .
Let ’s make this happen . "
This exhortation came hours after her campaign announced the departure of her deputy campaign manager , Mike Henry , in the latest reflection of staff turmoil .
Clinton ’s challenge is to keep the count of pledged delegates close , while protecting her lead among the party officials known as “ superdelegates , ” who can vote independently at the Democratic National convention – but who may be reluctant to defy the popular vote .
The Obama campaign now argues that the superdelegates should follow the majority of the pledged delegates .
Clinton , meanwhile , has sought to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the process by which pledged delegates are chosen , arguing that caucuses are n’t true reflections of the will of the people , and that the exclusion of Florida and Michigan voters because of a dispute over the primary calendar taints the official tallies .
But Obama ’s lead in pledged delegates widened Tuesday night to more than 100 , even by conservative estimates , and there ’s no indication that it will narrow before March .
There are 573 delegates up for grabs between March 4 and April 22 .
For Clinton to even things up , she needs to get 345 of those 573 delegates , or 60 percent – the sort of margin she won in her home state of New York .
Obama ’s dramatic victories Tuesday also put him ahead in the count of pledged delegates even if Florida , whose delegates have not been recognized by the Democratic National Committee , was permitted to seat a delegation .
And his victories put him ahead even in counts that include superdelegates .
“ This is the new American majority .
This is what change looks like , ” Obama said in a speech to an audience of thousands in Madison , Wisconsin Tuesday night .
Obama ’s wins were his sixth , seventh , and eighth in a row , and even as Clinton looks forward to March 4 , his campaign is looking with relish on Wisconsin and his home state of Hawaii , which vote a week from today .
His widening coalition is becoming part of his message :
He won a majority of Latino votes – which had been Clinton ’s bulwark elsewhere – in Virginia and Maryland .
He won a majority of white men in both states , and won the support of groups across the economic spectrum , while drawing stunning majorities of support from African - American voters – as high as 90 % of their support in Virginia , according to exit polls .
The wide margins – he won with 64 % of the vote in Virginia , and appeared headed for victory on a similar scale in Maryland– seemed to answer the Clinton campaign ’s arguments that he has not won primaries in large states .
And Obama moved clearly into one traditional frontrunner ’s role Tuesday night , trading blows with the likely Republican nominee , Senator John McCain , in their respective victory speeches .
“ John McCain is an American hero .
We honor his service to our nation .
But his priorities do n’t address the real problems of the American people , because they are bound to the failed policies of the past , ” Obama said in Wisconsin .
“ Senator McCain said the other day that we might be mired for a hundred years in Iraq , which is reason enough to not give him four years in the White House . ”
McCain , for his part , jabbed at Obama ’s lofty rhetoric of hope in his own remarks in Virginia .
“ Hope , my friends , is a powerful thing .
I can attest to that better than many , for I have seen men's hopes tested in hard and cruel ways that few will ever experience , ” he said , continuing , however , that “ to encourage a country with only rhetoric rather than sound and proven ideas that trust in the strength and courage of free people is not a promise of hope .
It is a platitude . ”
And McCain concluded by stealing Obama ’s signature line .
“ My friends , I promise you , I am fired up and ready to go , ” he said .

Mixwit.com takes Muxtape.com over its knees and spanks it .
Similar to Muxtape , Mixwit allows you to create a virtual mixtape of songs but without having to upload your own songs !
Mixwit.com is akin to walking into a record store ( remember those ? ) and snagging all the cds , records , singles , off the shelf recording the singles you like and walking out with your radical ultimate mixtape .
Mixwit leverages a huge resource of music that ’s available on the Internet sitting on any random website .
Although there are google search methods that you can use to look for MP3s , Mixwit has made that search process easier and packaged it in a spiffy web interface .
After registering through the website , Mixwit provides you with a search interface for your song by artist ’s name or song title .
You can listen to the search results and make sure the song is correct and complete .
Once satisfied with the result , drag the song into your playlist .
Rinse and repeat until you have your ultimate compilation !
The playlist can be saved , edited later and ultimately shared out to the Internet .
The success rate of the songs I was searching for was about 95 % , which is pretty good , since most of my songs that were not mainstream music .
My thoughts
This website does seem skim on the grey area of legality , but may be skirting the issue by not actually providing a mechanism to download , but only to stream the songs that are already available on the Internet .
So , ultimately , Mixwit does n’t host any copyrighted information , does n’t allow you to download songs , but provides the listener the capability to stream the audio file from potentially millions of websites on the Internet .
Of course , this music utopia surviving is wishful thinking on my part .
If this website becomes popular , it will catch the ire of record companies ( somehow ) , additionally , the popularity of the website may ultimately doom the technology behind Mixwit .
The streaming songs are dependent on the reliability of the songs hosted out there on a webhost on the Internet .
Enjoy it while you can , mixwit.com is an awesome music lover ’s website , but the good always die young .
By CNN's Jack Cafferty :
Imagine getting in your car in the morning and having it drive you to work while you answer e-mails , send text messages - or nap .
Fortune magazine reports on the so - called driverless revolution ; and how self - driving cars could soon affect ordinary Americans and a wide range of industries .
Google 's fleet of self - driving cars have already traveled 300,000 miles .
There have been no accidents when the cars were controlled by a computer and only one fender bender with a human behind the wheel .
These customized cars use a combination of GPS , radar and a 3D mapping camera on the roof that can see traffic signals , lanes and pedestrians .
Cars that drive themselves are coming - it 's just a question of when .
Most of the big car makers are working on self - driving models .
And three states - California , Nevada and Florida - have already made self - driving vehicles legal - as long as a human is sitting in the driver 's seat in case of an emergency .
Meanwhile these cars could boost worker productivity since the average commuter spends 250 hours a year behind the wheel .
Or they could come in handy after you 've had a few drinks .
Self - driving trucks could also transform the trucking industry .
Just picture long lines of self - driving 18 - wheelers traveling down the highway just a few inches apart : no drivers , no stops for gas or food .
It could boost fuel efficiency by as much as 20 % .
We 'll need to keep driving ourselves for a while longer , though : experts say driverless cars should be more common in another 10 to 15 years when costs come down .
Here ’s my question to you :
How would you feel about riding in a car that drives itself ?
Tune in to the Situation Room at 4 pm to see if Jack reads your answer on air .
And , we love to know where you ’re writing from , so please include your city and state with your comment .
A team of researchers from Case Western Reserve University has found that gravitational radiation — widely expected to provide “ smoking gun ” proof for a theory of the early universe known as “ inflation ” — can be produced by another mechanism .
According to physics scholars , inflation theory proposes that the universe underwent a period of exponential expansion right after the big bang .
A key prediction of inflation theory is the presence of a particular spectrum of “ gravitational radiation ” — ripples in the fabric of space - time that are notoriously difficult to detect but believed to exist nonetheless .
“ If we see a primordial gravitational wave background , we can no longer say for sure it is due to inflation , ” said Lawrence Krauss , the Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Case Western Reserve .
At the same time the researchers find that gravitational waves are a far more sensitive probe of new physics near the highest energy scale of interest to particle physicists than previously envisaged .
Thus their work provides strong motivation for the ongoing quest to detect primordial gravitational radiation .
Krauss , along with Case Western Reserve colleagues Katherine Jones - Smith , a graduate student , and Harsh Mathur , associate professor of physics , present these findings in an article “ Nearly Scale Invariant Spectrum of Gravitational Radiation from Global Phase Transitions ” published in Physical Review Letters this month .
Inflation theory arose in the 1980s as a means to explain some features of the universe that had previously baffled astronomers such as why the universe is so close to being flat and why it is so uniform .
Today , inflation remains the best way to theoretically understand many aspects of the early universe , but most of its predictions are sufficiently malleable that consistency with observation cannot be considered unambiguous confirmation .
Enter gravitational radiation — the key prediction of inflation theory is the presence of a particular spectrum of gravitational radiation .
Detection of this spectrum was regarded among physicists as “ smoking gun ” evidence that inflation did in fact occur , billions of years ago .
In 1992 Krauss , then at Yale , argued that another mechanism besides inflation could give rise to precisely the same spectrum of gravitational radiation as is predicted by inflation .
The argument given by Krauss in 1992 provided a rough estimate of the spectrum .
Last year Krauss teamed up with Case Western Reserve colleagues , Jones - Smith , a graduate student in physics , and Mathur , associate professor of physics , to do a more complete calculation .
They found that the exact calculation predicts the signal to be much stronger than the rough estimate .
Describing their results , Krauss said , “ It is shocking and surprising when you find the answer is 10,000 times bigger than the rough estimate and could possibly produce a signal that mimics the kind produced by inflation . ”
Gravitational radiation is a prediction of Einstein ’s Theory of General Relativity .
According to the theory , whenever large amounts of mass or energy are shifting around , it disrupts the surrounding space - time and ripples emanate from the region where the mass / energy shift .
These space - time ripples , known as gravitational radiation , are imperceptible on the human scale , but highly sensitive experiments ( such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory ( LIGO ) in Livingston , La. ) are designed precisely to look for such radiation and are the only hope for detecting them directly .
However , gravitational radiation from the early universe can also be detected indirectly through its effect on the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) radiation ( relic radiation from the Big Bang which permeates all space ) .
The radiation from the CMB would become polarized in the presence of gravitational radiation .
Detecting such polarized light is the mission of a satellite based experiment ( Planck ) set to launch in 2009 .
The gravitational radiation produced by either inflation or the mechanism proposed by Jones - Smith , Krauss and Mathur would imprint itself on the CMB and be detected as polarization .
Until now it was widely believed that a detection of polarized light from the CMB was a “ smoking gun ” for inflation theory .
But with the publication of their recent paper in Physical Review Letters , Krauss and co-workers have raised the issue of whether that polarized light can be unambiguously tied to inflation .
The mechanism proposed by Krauss and coworkers invokes a phenomenon called “ symmetry breaking ” that is a central part of all theories of fundamental particle physics , including the so - called standard model describing the three non-gravitational forces known to exist .
Here , a “ scalar field ” ( similar to an electric or magnetic field ) becomes aligned as the universe expands .
But as the universe expands each region over which the field is aligned comes into contact with other regions where the field has a different alignment .
When that happens the field relaxes into a state where it is aligned over the entire region and in the process of relaxing it emits gravitational radiation .
Yorke is urging politicians to cut CO2 emissions
Writing in The Sun , lead singer Thom Yorke said the band were trying to do " everything we can to minimise our impact on the environment " .
" What we 're trying to do now is only play in areas that have a public transport infrastructure in place .
" So that rules out Glastonbury for this year , " he said .
" Maybe we can work out a plan for the future .
They 're probably sick of the sight of us anyway . "
Yorke said the band was particularly concerned because people tend drive to big shows and festivals " with one or two people in a car " .
" That 's an ecological disaster , " he added .
His comments may raise a few eyebrows , as Glastonbury has a reputation for tackling environmental issues .
Its Green Fields area uses renewable electricity and solar - heated showers , while festivalgoers are encouraged to catch coaches to the annual music jamboree .
Extra instruments
The Radiohead frontman said he had also taken personal action to reduce his carbon footprint .
" I am trying to build a system under my house that heats it naturally from the ground , " he wrote .
His band has also invested in two sets of instruments to avoid the need to fly their gear around the world .
Yorke was in Brussels on Wednesday urging politicians to introduce sweeping measures to cut carbon emissions by 2020 .
" If we do n't get stuck in now , in 20 years ' time it will be worse and things will be more extreme , " he said .
The rock musician has been part of Friends Of The Earth 's Big Ask campaign - which is calling for tougher measures to tackle climate change - since its UK launch in 2005 .
YouTube has vaporized a popular user account dedicated to criticizing The Church of Scientology .
Last Thursday , the world 's most popular video sharer removed the 10,000 - subscriber - strong " Xenutv1 " channel run by Mark Bunker , a television journalist / well - known Scientology naysayer .
Earlier in the week , Bunker posted a teaser for his three - hour interview with Jason Beghe - a film and television actor who recently defected from the world of Scientology - and the account was yanked just before Bunker was due to broadcast the interview in full .
" I was planning to post the entire thing on Thursday , " Bunker told us .
" But before I could do that - boom - the channel was gone . "
The channel did not contain any copyrighted material .
But Xenutv1 is n't Bunker 's first YouTube account , and two previous accounts were removed for broadcasting copyrighted clips , including a channel known as " Xenutv . "
According to Bunker 's conversations with the video sharer - who would not speak to The Reg about the matter - the fate of his second Xenu channel is tied to his first .
The first incarnation of Xenutv was canceled in early February .
After posting a Scientology - related clip from Comedy Central 's The Colbert Report , Bunker received a DMCA take - down notice from the cable station 's parent company , Viacom .
Yes , the same Viacom that 's suing YouTube for $ 1bn .
Bunker intended to comply with the notice .
But his account was removed before he had the chance to do so .
That very day , much the same thing happened to a private account where Bunker was hosting the infamous video in which Tom Cruise refers to Scientology as " a blast " .
In this case , the account was canceled after a DMCA notice from the Church itself .
" I received these take - down notices within an hour of each other , " Bunker told us .
" So I went to YouTube to delete these clips , and both accounts had been canceled . "
Bunker then created " Xenutv1 , " and this time , he was careful to avoid copyrighted content .
Thanks to some heavy publicity from an internet group known as Anonymous - which declared war on Scientology the Cruise clip vanished form YouTube entirely - the new channel developed a healthy following .
Whereas Xenutv had about 3,000 subscribers when it was vaporized , Xenutv1 reeled in more than 10,000 in a matter of weeks .
When Bunker posted his Beghe teaser , the clip received 595,000 hits in less than four days .
But then YouTube banned him again .
Two days earlier , the site had banned a channel run by Tory Christman , another outspoken Scientology critic and a friend of Mark Bunker's .
Shortly thereafter , a post turned up on alt.religion .
scientology in which someone bragged about silencing Christman and vowed to silence Bunker too .
After an Anonymous protest , Christman 's account - which also steered clear of copyrighted material - was reinstated .
Bunker 's was not .
YouTube tells Bunker that Xenutv1 was erased because of the copyrighted material posted to his earlier account .
" They said that because my first account was canceled , I was never supposed to have a second account , " Bunker explained .
" I was supposed to be banned for life . "
According to Bunker , the site acknowledges that someone tipped them off to his second account , and it says this person did not represent Scientology .
YouTube also told Bunker that his account would be reinstated if Viacom agreed to rescind its take - down notice .
But Viacom refuses to do so .
In the meantime , Bunker has posted his Beghe interview to the YouTube competitor Vimeo and his Wordpress blog .
When it comes to YouTube , Bunker believes that his only chance for reinstatement is the outspoken host of The Colbert Report .
This faux newsman has shown a healthy attitude towards such matters in the past - and a healthy sense of humor .
" Only one man can help me , " Bunker says .
" Stephen Colbert . " ®

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The outlook of U.S. consumers sank to a 17 - year low this month as the job market deteriorated , while costly commodities drove producer price inflation in January to its highest in more than 26 years , according to reports that stoked fears of stagflation .
Pedestrians make their way through a snowfall in New York , February 22 , 2008 .

Adding to Tuesday ’s economic bad news , data showed that the collapse in U.S. home prices accelerated to a record pace in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
Prices plunged 8.9 percent year - over - year , according to the S&P / Case - Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index .
The U.S. Labor Department reported producer prices jumped a monthly 1 percent in January on rising energy costs and saw an annual 7.4 percent increase .
It was the biggest 12 - month gain in more than 26 years , when the United States was emerging from a period of low growth and high inflation known as stagflation .
The Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment fell to 75.0 in February , significantly worse than economists ’ forecasts and its lowest since confidence dropped precipitously at the start of the Iraq war five years ago .
Excluding that sharp fall in February and March 2003 , February ’s reading was the lowest since late 1993 .
The Conference Board ’s expectations index fell to 57.9 -- its lowest in 17 years .
“ It looks like there is no confidence in an economy where inflation is getting out of control , ” said Andrew Brenner , market analyst at MF Global in New York .
“ This is a classic stagflation scenario . ”
In the face of fresh signs of economic weakness , a top Federal Reserve official played down the risks presented by current price growth , saying the danger the U.S. economy will weaken further is a bigger worry than higher inflation .
“ I do not expect the recent elevated inflation rates to persist , ” Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said in a speech at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington .
“ In my view , the adverse dynamics of the financial markets and the economy have presented the greater threat to economic welfare in the United States , ” he said .
The bad news pouring in from the beleaguered housing market appeared to bolster his case on growth .
In a topsy - turvy trading session , U.S. stocks erased early losses and rose after tech giant IBM IBM .N raised its profit outlook .
More consistent with the weakening growth outlook , the dollar eased and government bonds , which usually benefit from weak economic data , rose in price .
BIG DROPS
The deterioration in consumer confidence was pronounced .
It was the biggest monthly drop in the consumer confidence and expectations indexes since September 2005 , following Hurricane Katrina .
The present situation index saw its biggest tumble since October 2001 , during the last U.S. recession .
Sentiment suffered on a worsening view of the job market .
The measure of “ jobs hard to get ” rose to 23.8 in February -- its highest since October 2005 -- from 20.6 in January .
The measure of “ jobs plentiful ” fell to 20.6 -- its lowest since April 2005 -- from 23.8 .
The proportion of respondents identifying jobs as plentiful fell by 3.2 percentage points , the biggest drop in a year and a half .
The jobs hard to get response shot up by the most in nearly five years .
The 8.9 percent year - over - year decline in the S&P / Case - Shiller home price index was the largest in its 20 - year history and came as housing was pressured by a huge supply of homes for sale , rising foreclosures and tighter lending conditions .
By comparison , during the 1990 - 91 housing recession the annual rate bottomed at a 2.8 percent drop .
A separate report added to the gloom in housing , a key source of troubles in the economy and financial markets .
The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said U.S. home prices posted a second consecutive quarterly drop in the fourth quarter , with every state except Maine recording lower prices .
The housing finance company regulator said that , compared with the third quarter of 2007 , house prices fell by 1.3 percent .

I came close to totally ignoring the news that Comcast has teamed with Pando and announced that it wants to create a P2P " Bill of Rights that would create " a set of rules that would clarify how a user can use P2P applications and how an ISP can manage file - sharing programs running on their networks . "
This , of course , is all a part of Comcast 's suddenly very public efforts to deal with the fallout from the company 's rather secretive traffic shaping efforts ( and , it hopes , to avoid the wrath of Kevin Martin and the FCC .
Of course , this process started with the relationship with BitTorrent -- which was woefully short on details .
This " Bill of Rights " plan is , in some ways , even worse .
It 's funny how whenever we see companies suddenly declaring a plan for a " Bill of Rights " ( which should be about addressing consumer rights ) , it 's really always about figuring out a way for ato do the same stuff it had been doing all along without getting in trouble for it .
It 's basically a way for a company to tell the government " hey look , we 're self - regulating ! " even if that self - regulating is letting them do whatever they want .
While it 's nice that Comcast tied this to a relationship with Pando ( the same company that 's trying to help telcos deal with file sharing network issues ) , it does n't change that the fact that this is a lot of talk with little action .
While the usual suspects have decried this plan for the press release vaporware that it is ( while pointing to Comcasts ' questionable activities when its traffic shaping was first discovered ) , a much bigger question is why we should evena " P2P Bill of Rights " in the first place .
One of the very reasons why internet access is so valuable ( and why Comcast got into the business ) is the open nature of the internet that allowed all sorts ofservices to spring forth .
When you start putting rules on it , concerning how an application can run and what a user can do , you 're effectively shutting down that ability .
You 're saying that we have enough innovation , and any new innovation needs to be incremental on top of what we already have and within these well - defined limits .
That 's not a recipe for innovation .
It 's a recipe for keeping the status quo , while other places , that do n't have unnecessary restrictions , continue to innovate and grow .

The Emerging Surveillance State
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
Last month , the House amended the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) to expand the government ’s ability to monitor our private communications .
This measure , if it becomes law , will result in more warrantless government surveillance of innocent American citizens .
Though some opponents claimed that the only controversial part of this legislation was its grant of immunity to telecommunications companies , there is much more to be wary of in the bill .
In the House version , Title II , Section 801 , extends immunity from prosecution of civil legal action to people and companies including any provider of an electronic communication service , any provider of a remote computing service , any other communication service provider who has access to wire or electronic communications ,  any parent , subsidiary , affiliate , successor , or assignee of such company , any officer , employee , or agent of any such company , and any landlord , custodian , or other person who may be authorized or required to furnish assistance .
The Senate version goes even further by granting retroactive immunity to such entities that may have broken the law in the past .
The new FISA bill allows the federal government to compel many more types of companies and individuals to grant the government access to our communications without a warrant .
The provisions in the legislation designed to protect Americans from warrantless surveillance are full of loopholes and ambiguities .
There is no blanket prohibition against listening in on all American citizens without a warrant .
We have been told that this power to listen in on communications is legal and only targets terrorists .
But if what these companies are being compelled to do is legal , why is it necessary to grant them immunity ?
If what they did in the past was legal and proper , why is it necessary to grant them retroactive immunity ?
In communist East Germany , one in every 100 citizens was an informer for the dreaded secret police , the Stasi .
They either volunteered or were compelled by their government to spy on their customers , their neighbors , their families , and their friends .
When we think of the evil of totalitarianism , such networks of state spies are usually what comes to mind .
Yet , with modern technology , what once took tens of thousands of informants can now be achieved by a few companies being coerced by the government to allow it to listen in to our communications .
This surveillance is un-American .
We should remember that former New York governor Eliot Spitzer was brought down by a provision of the PATRIOT
Act that required enhanced bank monitoring of certain types of financial transactions .
Yet we were told that the PATRIOT
Act was needed to catch terrorists , not philanderers .
The extraordinary power the government has granted itself to look into our private lives can be used for many purposes unrelated to fighting terrorism .
We can even see how expanded federal government surveillance power might be used to do away with political rivals .
The Fourth Amendment to our Constitution requires the government to have a warrant when it wishes to look into the private affairs of individuals .
If we are to remain a free society we must defend our rights against any governmental attempt to undermine or bypass the Constitution .

Boy on quest for owner of ring found in bay 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
It looked like a small charcoal briquette , floating on San Francisco Bay , but it was just a little bit too square to be a charcoal briquette .
Twelve - year - old Joe Carter , who was boating with his father Sunday off Crissy Field , figured he might as well reach over the side of their dinghy and pick it up .
It was n't a charcoal briquette after all , Joe realized , because charcoal briquettes do not have hinges on them .
It was a jewelry box .
" What if there 's a diamond ring inside ? "
Joe remembers wondering to himself .
So he opened the small black box .
And inside was something round and golden , with a sparkling stone on it .
" It 's a real diamond ring , " Joe said .
" With a real diamond . "
Joe took the ring out of the box and inspected a small tag , which was still attached to it .
" Romance Princess .
One - quarter carat .
Diamond Wedding Ring. $ 499 , " the tag said .
Joe , being several years shy of the time of life when a diamond ring in a black box comes in handy , huddled up with his father , Matt .
The two of them are honorable , and they figured the thing to do was to call Macy 's department store and find out if anyone had lost a ring .
The small box had " Macy's " printed on the inside .
But the jewelry sales clerk said there was nothing he could do .
Macy 's sells a lot of rings , and they do n't come with serial numbers .
So the Carters , who live in Alameda , posted a " lost and found " ad on an online bulletin board .
" Ring found floating in SF Bay , " the ad said .
" We would love to return it .
Please contact me with a description . "
And for four days , they have sat back and waited for developments .
Perhaps the unfortunate owner would come forward .
Perhaps several different people , all claiming to be the unfortunate owner , would come forward .
Gold and diamonds have a way of making people do things they otherwise would n't .
But , so far , no one at all has come forward .
While the Carters wait , they try to imagine how the diamond ring ended up in San Francisco Bay .
Did a would - be husband fling it into the water after his proposal was rejected ?
Did a would - be bride toss it aside because it weighed only one - quarter carat ?
" I knew a girl in high school who did that when her boyfriend proposed , " said Joe 's mom , Laura , filling in her son on the ways of women and quarter - carat diamond rings .
Did it fall from the promenade deck of a cruise ship ?
Did someone drop it into the water on purpose , as the old lady did at the end of " Titanic ? "
Every hour or so , Joe takes the ring out of the black box and stares at it .
It was a remarkable thing to find , he realizes , but it would have been even better to find something that a 12 - year - old boy can really use .
" Like a flat - screen plasma TV , " Joe said .
Besides , a quarter - carat diamond ring is worth only $ 150 or so , according to experts , despite what the price tag says , and the reward Joe is likely to receive from the owner for finding something worth $ 150 is bound to be a lot less than that .
Might be enough to pay for a video game , he said - a used one .
On the other hand , Joe knows he is doing the right thing , and that 's worth something more than $ 150 .
" I think it would be pretty sad to be someone reaching into your pocket for a diamond ring and find out it 's not there , " Joe said .
" I hope I can find whoever that person is .
That would be great . "
Two high - ranking United Nations officials suggested on Tuesday that the death toll in the five - year conflict in Darfur has risen to 300,000 people .
A 2006 World Health Organization estimate placed the number of people who have perished in the Sudanese region from the combined effects of the conflict — including hunger , disease and violence — at around 200,000 .
But John Holmes , the UN under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs , and Rodolphe Adada , the joint representative for the UN and African Union in Darfur , told the UN Security Council in New York City on Tuesday that the situation is getting worse .
" A study in 2006 suggested that 200,000 had lost their lives from the combined effects of the conflict .
That figure must be much higher now , perhaps half as much again , " Holmes said .
He added the region is still characterized by insecurity , lawlessness and impunity , with widespread human rights abuses .
" These numbers are not deaths from violence , " Holmes said .
" They are all the deaths , all the extra deaths , which come from the existence of a conflict — disease , malnutrition , the reduced lifespan that that brings to people . "
Holmes and Adada also said thousands of additional people have been uprooted from their homes , upping earlier estimates of 2.5 million displaced people .
Abdalmahmoud Abdalhaleem , Sudan 's ambassador to the UN , disputed the estimate .
He said Sudan placed the death toll at only 10,000 people killed .
" In our own calculations , the number does not exceed 10,000 , " Abdalhaleem said .
" Of course , here we are not including those who died because of malnutrition and starvation , because in Darfur there is no epidemics , no starvations , so that is why any additional number would be just very minimal . "
Full deployment could be delayed to 2009
Holmes later told reporters he was not trying to produce an exact figure , but only a " reasonable extrapolation " from the 2006 estimate .
Fighting has raged since 2003 , when black African tribesmen took up arms , complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Arab - dominated Sudanese government in Khartoum .
The government has been accused of unleashing a militia of Arab nomads known as the janjaweed to commit atrocities against Darfur 's black African communities .
A joint African Union - United Nations peacekeeping force was launched in January to try to stem the violence in Darfur .
But the group so far only has about 9,000 troops and police on the ground out of the 26,000 that have been authorized .
On Tuesday , Adada said it was " very unlikely " the force would reach full - operating capability before next year .
" I am obliged to report that the obstacles they surmount and the risks they run have not reduced over the last three months , " he told the Security Council .
Western officials have blamed the Sudanese government for delaying the rollout of the force , an accusation Khartoum denies .
Augusto Cesar Sandino
America invaded Nicaragua in 1912 because its government owed American bankers money that it could n't pay back .
American bankers collected Nicaraguan customs duties , paid creditors and disbursed the remainder to the government .
U.S. interest in Nicaragua included the protection of American investments in the area , the desire to maintain general calm in the larger Panama Canal neighborhood and a commitment to keep other nations from completing a competing transoceanic canal .
During this time the Bryan - Chamorro Treaty was created .
With this treaty ...
the United States was granted a 99 - year lease on two Nicaraguan islands ( Great Corn and Little Corn islands in the Gulf of Fonseca ) as the sites of possible future naval bases .
Of greater importance was the granting of a perpetual option to purchase the Nicaraguan canal site .
Given the internal troubles that preceeded our invasion , our occupation was largely peaceful and tolerated .
Things worked well enough that the Marines were withdrawn in 1925 .
That 's when the real trouble started .
The competing forces in Nicaragua labeled themselves as Liberals and Conservatives .
When the Marines withdrew the Conservatives launched a Coup and seized power .
They took control of the national guard and used it against the Liberals .
The Liberals took up arms and a civil war had begun .
With the Liberals on the verge on retaking the capital , America forced a cease - fire on the combatants .
The Marines returned in 1926 , this time in larger numbers .
The Marines backed Aldolfo Diaz , the pro-American , conservative president .
Back in America , there were concerns .
Democrats in Congress voiced opposition to the heavy - handed American actions and charged President Coolidge with conducting a " private war . "
Without a tinge of remorse , Coolidge responded by asserting that American lives and property needed to be protected and foreign meddlers had to be kept at bay .
Hmmm .
Sounds a little familiar , does n't it ?
After about a year of this both sides managed to sit down and agree to the Treaty of Tipitata ( May 11 , 1927 ) .
The conditions of the treaty were :
a) The warring factions in Nicaragua agreed to lay down their arms and abide by the results of a U.S. - supervised election scheduled for the following year ;
b ) the U.S. government also agreed to conduct training for a Nicaraguan national guard .
Later known as the Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua .
It was supposed to maintain order and replace the Marines as peacekeepers in that troubled nation .
The election was held and both sides agreed to the results .
That is , both sides except for a relatively unknown figure named Augusto Nicolas Calderon Sandino .
Augusto Sandino is a legendary figure in Latin America .
He 's considered a national patriot on the order that George Washington is in America .
His background is very humble .
he was born illegitimately to a peasant worker named Margarita Calderon and her married boss , Gregorio Sandino .
However , when he was about ten years old his mother abandoned him and he went to live with his maternal grandmother .
He was later brought into his father 's household but he was forced to earn his keep by working and was never fully accepted .
In 1921 , what might be interpreted as the climax of his life occurred when he shot , but did not kill , Dagoberto Rivas a son of an important Conservative in the village in retaliation to some comments which Dagoberto had made about his mother .
He then ran away to the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua and from there to various other Central American countries .
He finally landed in Mexico , however , and he spent the next four years working for Standard Oil .
While there , he began to get involved in several diverse radical groups which seemingly influenced his perspective on life and hence his future actions .
Augusto returned to his homeland in 1926 as the Statute of Limitations on his crime ran out .
When the rebellion started in 1926 he took his meager savings and purchased weapons that he used to arm workers at a US - owned mine .
His inexperience showed , but he learned from his mistakes .
He gradually refined his warring techniques into a guerrilla hit and run style of fighting like the Vietnamese employed in the Vietnam War .
When the Treaty of Tipitata was signed , Sandino consider it a sell - out by the Liberal leadership because it left the Americans still in control of Nicaragua .
He organized the Ejército Defensor de la Soberanía Nacional de Nicaragua ( EDSNN - Army in Defense of the National Sovereignty of Nicaragua ) and vowed to keep fighting until the Americans had left .
This decision changed the war for Sandino from a case of Nicaraguans against Nicaraguans to Nicaragua against the world .
Even though Sandino was an idealist with radical political and social ideas such as having communal lands and a unified Central America , Sandino was always a man of action and organized the sentiments of the common peasants into revolt .
These common people provided the manpower to fight and die when needed as well as a constant information network for Sandino 's backwoods fighting .
Sandino believed in the glorification of personal heritage and liberty and once said , " The sovereignty and liberty of a people are not to be discussed , but rather defended with weapons in hand . "
" General Sandino , the bandit chief , is through . "
- Marine General Feland , August 27 , 1927
NY Times headlines , January 1928
The Americans responded to this peasant revolt in much the same way it responded to the revolt in the Phillipines just a few years earlier .
The United States Marines and the Guardia launched a counter insurgency war against the forces of Sandino .
While he unquestionably organized a nationalist resistance force , U.S. policy makers defined Sandino and his soldiers as bandits .
This decision helped define the military tactics that were to be used .
Since the U.S. was not fighting a legitimate military foe , the rules of war ( such as they were ) did not apply .
The Marines and Guardia made little distinctions between the Sandinistas and the civilian population : not only combatants but civilians were targets and subjected to the regular use of excessive force and torture .
[...]
Beatings by the Guardia and Marines were the most common form of torture .
These included the use of fists and feet since a number of prisoners were also kicked or stomped .
A form of water torture , which consisted of forcing water down a prisoner 's throat until the prisoner choked , also occasionally occurred .
Peasant women were raped .
Psychological torture was also used since Nicaraguans were routinely threatened with beatings and executions , including decapitation .
These were more than idle threats .
Ironically ( given the horrified outcries at the beheading of U.S. citizens in Iraq today ) , photos of Marines and Guardia soldiers displaying the severed heads of Sandinistas they had killed were published in Nicaragua and throughout Latin America .
Whoa !
Deja Vu !
Sandino Revolt Believed Crushed

Violent Partisanship And Seething Politics Make True View Of Situation Hard To Get

After some initial mistakes , Sandino quickly mastered the art of guerrilla warfare .
The rebels used the jungle to hide from American forces and were rarely seen outside of quick hit and run attacks .
Sandino had to adopt these methods .
His forces were largely armed with 19th - Century rifles and machetes .
A New York Times correspondent flew over the area in 1928 and described the terrain as " thickly wooded mountains . . . tortured into a patternless wilderness of peaks , ridges , and rock - strewn cliffs ....
Its infrequent trails are almost invisible from the air . "
Bernard Nalty , author of the U.S. Marine Corps historical study on the Nicaraguan campaign , points out that " Sandino 's men were adept at camouflage .
Seldom did they move in large groups , and , if at all possible , they marched at night . "
Sandino 's troops learned the habit patterns of the Marine aerial reconnaissance flights and took advantage of them ; when his forces moved at other times during the day , they used the jungles for concealment .
Sandino kept fighting a guerrilla war against the Marines until Hoover , in one of his last acts as president , withdrew the troops in 1933 .
Sandino 's army was still active and undefeated .
Natives Say Nicaraguan Bandit Chief Is Admitting Defeat
- NY Times headline , March 28 , 1928
Hmmm .
Does n't this NY Times article sound familiar ?
We can't withdraw for years .
There would be anarchy if we left .
Do the same people write for the Times now that did in 1928 ?
Hoover 's decision to withdraw was not made by choice .
The Great Depression was forcing him to redeploy his increasingly meager budget .
The War Hawks in the Republican Party also fought against the withdraw .
Supposedly , the military seized Sandino 's papers where he planned a " campaign of extermination " ( NY Times , August 19 , 1931 ) after the Americans withdrew .
But instead of a campaign of extermination , Sandino emerged from the jungles early in 1933 and embraced peace .
He agreed to disarm almost all of his troops and return to pre-war activities .
Hardly the actions of a " bandit chief " .
130 Marines were killed in action in Nicaragua .
But like most Latin American revolutionaries , Sandino 's story does not have a happy ending .
With his ideal fulfilled , Sandino agreed to lay down his weapons and signed a preliminary agreement with the Sacasa government .
The agreement was that , in exchange for peace , some men who wished to stay with Sandino could do so in a commune in the Rio Coco commune .
These men would be formed into an auxiliary military group under the president 's supervision for one year .
In 1934 , with the review of his " auxiliaries " getting ever closer , Sandino told the President that he might not lay down his weapons because he believed that the National Guard was unconstitutional .
Sacasa called Sandino to Managua to speak with him and when Sandino arrived he publicly announced that he thought that the National Guard was unconstitutional .
Sandino 's talks with the President resulted in an agreement which would , among other things , reduce Somoza 's power through the National Guard significantly .
On February 20 , as Sandino returned from speaking with the President , the National Guardsmen under Somoza 's command , fearing a loss of power , surrounded him and his party and executed them .
The next day the National Guard raided the northern commune , destroyed it , and killed most of Sandino 's men , their wives , and children .
As many of you are probably aware of , the Somoza family went on to be one of the most corrupt and brutal dictatorships in Latin American history .
All the while fully supported by the United States .
In 1979 a rebel group threw the Somoza dictatorship out of the country .
That rebel group was called the Sandanistas .
Yesterday , Allahpundit posted on the Politico ’s story about the Hillary Clinton team not paying their bills .
Today Kenneth Vogel digs a little deeper , and discovers that Team Hillary ’s commitment to universal health care does n’t even extend to her own employees .
Almost $ 300,000 in health - plan premiums went unpaid despite Hillary making universal coverage a centerpiece of her campaign :
Among the debts reported this month by Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s struggling presidential campaign , the $ 292,000 in unpaid health insurance premiums for her campaign staff stands out .
Clinton , who is being pressured to end her campaign against Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination , has made her plan for universal health care a centerpiece of her agenda .
The campaign provides health insurance to all its employees , their spouses , partners and children — and that was n’t interrupted by any lag in payments to insurance providers , said Jay Carson , a Clinton campaign spokesman . …
But the unpaid bills to Aetna were at least two months old , according to FEC filings .
They show the campaign ended last year owing Aetna more than $ 213,000 for “ employee benefits . ”
During the first two months of the year , the campaign did not pay down any of that debt .
In fact , it accrued another $ 16,000 in unpaid bills last month , and it finished the month owing Aetna $ 229,000 .
So now we ’ve gone from single - payor to zero - payor !
Seriously , did no one at Team Hillary consider how this would look when the campaign announced its numbers ?
They want to run Hillary as the compassionate candidate , the one who really cares about the people .
She cares so much and has so many ideas for helping us that , as Hillary admitted , we ca n’t afford all of them , even though she has no problem with taking our money “ for [ our ] own good ” .
Maybe charity should start at home , or at least health - insurance coverage .
If Hillary and her team ca n’t keep up with the Aetna bills now , why should we trust them to do so in the White House ?
Here ’s a look at her health care insurance commercial from a few weeks back .
Ask yourself how she can make these claims while leaving her own employees at risk of health - care denials .

Vice chair of 9/11 panel :
We have no record of Mukasey 's ' warning ' Mike Sheehan
Published : Tuesday April 8 , 2008

The vice chair of the prominent 9/11 Commission is denying Attorney General Michael Mukasey 's claim that the US received a warning before the attacks of Sep. 11 , 2001 , Salon reports .
" I am unfamiliar with the telephone call that Attorney General Mukasey cited in his appearance in San Francisco on March 27 .
The 9/11 Commission did not receive any information pertaining to its occurrence , " said former Rep.
Lee Hamilton in a statement received by Salon 's Glenn Greenwald , who has closely followed the Mukasey revelation .
" Hamilton 's statement is consistent with the statement of 9/11 Commission Executive Director Philip Zelikow , as well as the letter sent to Mukasey by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers and two Subcommittee Chairs , none of whom have any idea what Mukasey was talking about , " writes Greenwald .
Given Hamilton 's statement , Greenwald says " one of two things is true " about Mukasey 's alleged call from an " Afghan safe house " : either the White House concealed it from the 9/11 Commission , or Mukasey fabricated it " to scare and manipulate Americans into believing that FISA and other surveillance safeguards caused the 9/11 attacks ... "
Last week , key House Democrats demanded an explanation from Mukasey for the purported warning .
In response , the Justice Department cited a reference to an untraced call between a 9/11 hijacker and " a known overseas terrorist facility " as well as a February 2008 letter co-signed by Mukasey that blamed the failure to intercept the call on the embattled Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , a law requiring warrants for the government to perform foreign intel surveillance .
Greenwald argued that the US government was " within its mission " to obtain FISA authorization to monitor such a call , yet the Bush administration appeared to be more interested in obtaining greater domestic spying powers .
Greenwald 's latest on the Mukasey revelation is available at this link .
The international community should take formal steps to justify inaction when conditions of genocide exist anywhere in the world .
So says Paul Slovic , a University of Oregon psychology professor , who wants a formal process that requires nations to carefully weigh and publicly justify action or inaction in cases of intentional mass murder .
" If they were required to deliberate , I think it would be much more difficult for nations not to take action , " he says .
" This is something nations are n't required to do and do n't really do now . "
Slovic , who is also the president and founder of Decision Research Inc. , a think tank for risk assessment in Eugene , Ore. , makes the recommendation May 18 at a seminar on the prevention of genocide in Auschwitz , Poland hosted by the Auschwitz Institute for Peace and Reconciliation .
The formal steps proposed by Slovic result from his National Science Foundation ( NSF ) - funded research on psychic numbing , which attempts to understand why people , who emotionally care for and respond to one person in need , tend to become emotionally numb to many people in need .
" Slovic uses scientific methods to help us understand the psychological underpinnings for the consistent failure of the world community to respond to genocides , " says NSF Program Director for Decision , Risk and Management Sciences Bob O'Connor .
" More importantly , his research suggests concrete steps that will help to change this tragic reality . "
Slovic cites a 1948 United Nations convention that calls for the prevention of genocide as evidence of psychic numbing .
The convention has rarely been invoked despite more than 135 signatories and a large number of mass murders since the end of World War II .
Slovic urges a review of the convention .

The problem , according to Slovic , is that moral intuition , guided by feelings and emotions , is not sufficient to motivate action when genocide is happening .
Both moral intuition and moral reasoning , that is , logical argument and calculation , are needed to stimulate action .
" Our basic way of responding through moral intuition is a problem because it breaks down in the face of large scale atrocities , " says Slovic .
" Our compassion , our empathy , our feeling about what we should do gives us a rush of immediate concern , but it does n't sustain us when large numbers of people are involved . "
The solution is to engage moral reasoning , a slower and more logical way of thinking about problems that challenge principles of right conduct , along with moral intuition .
For example , he argues that the U.S. government does n't leave it to the moral intuition of citizens to determine how much money they should pay in taxes for Social Security .
Instead , moral reasoning leads to laws that require individuals to pay specific amounts for this program .
" Moral reasoning says all human lives are equally valuable , " says Slovic .
" Given that , if a large number of lives are at risk , they should be proportionally more valuable than a single life .
But if left to moral intuition , we would feel a certain amount of concern for the large number of lives at risk , but that feeling would not necessarily be enough to lead us to action . "
A 2005 Israeli research study verifies his point that moral intuition , in the absence of moral reasoning , can lead to bad decisions .
In the study , participants were shown photos of children in need .
One photo showed eight children who needed a total of $ 300,000 in life - saving medical care .
A second photo showed only one child who could be helped with $ 300,000 .
Participants were most willing to donate for one child 's medical care , but the level of giving declined dramatically when donating to help the entire group .

Still , Slovic recognizes that in some instances , people act to help large numbers of people as was the case in 2005 , when Hurricane Katrina hit the north - central Gulf Coast of the United States and in 2004 , when devastating tsunamis slammed into 11 countries in South Asia .
" It was easier for people to have empathy in those cases , " he says .
" People could see vivid , descriptive images in the news and feel what it might be like if they themselves were in a similar circumstance . "
But for cases of genocide , descriptive news media coverage does n't always occur or prompt people and governments to intervene .
The Tyndall Report , which monitors American television coverage , shows that NBC news allotted a total of five minutes to the Darfur genocide on its nightly newscasts in 2004 ; CBS had only three minutes , about one minute of coverage for every 100,000 deaths .
Slovic insists that we need to engage both moral intuition and moral reasoning to take effective action to stop genocides .
" We need deliberative thinking to go along with our gut feelings , " he says .
" Our gut feelings will give us the moral intuition that genocide is wrong , but moral reasoning will cause us to lay out reasons to act . "
Scholars as well as government officials representing many nations will attend the seminar in Auschwitz .
The lobby for US - style copyrights in Canada has gone into overdrive , recruiting a powerful Member of Parliament and turning public forums on copyright into one - sided love - fests for restrictive copyright regimes that criminalize everyday Canadians .
Dan McTeague is the Liberal MP from Pickering - Scarborough East , and he 's set to become the successor to Sam Bulte , the MP who lost her job for funding her campaign to get elected and appointed Heritage Minister by lining her pockets with massive donations from the very industries she would have ended up regulating .
Reliable sources tell me that he's the guy who pushed for Canada signing onto the WIPO copyright treaty in the committee 's anti-counterfeiting report last year , and that any time anyone in committee mentions fair dealing and user rights , he has a complete melt - down and shouts them down .
At a recent copyright panel in Toronto , McTeague essentially read out a list of record industry talking points about Canada 's supposed status as a pirate nation , characterizing infringement as theft and refusing to acknowledge user rights ; saying that Canada 's international reputation had been tarnished by its soft copyright laws ( the World Economic Forum says that Canada 's copyright system is more advanced than Japan 's and the US's ) .
and , incredibly , proposed that we should pass a law making it illegal to use the Internet to " threaten " Members of Parliament with negative publicity if we do n't like their political positions .
The supposedly non-partisan Public Policy Forum is holding a major , one - sided IP symposium on Monday .
Invited are the U.S. Ambassador to Canada , former head of the Canadian Motion Picture Industry Association , and other big - stick - swingers for American - style copyright disasters .
But when copyright lobbyists discovered that noted copyright scholar Howard Knopf would appear on just one of the panels , they went berserk and pushed successfully to have Knopf removed , ensuring that dissenting voices would be minimized on the day .
Newswise —
In 2006 , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill researchers published a study that found people with low levels of LDL cholesterol are more likely to have Parkinson 's disease than people with high LDL levels .
But that study could not answer the question of whether low LDL ( low - density lipoprotein ) levels were present in study participants before they were diagnosed with Parkinson's , or if they developed low LDL levels after being diagnosed .
Now a follow - up study led by UNC researchers in collaboration with colleagues in Virginia , Hawaii and Japan has found that low LDL levels were present in a group of men of Japanese ancestry long before these men were diagnosed with Parkinson's .
" This finding gives us one more piece in the puzzle about the role of cholesterol in Parkinson 's disease , " said Dr. Xuemei Huang , the study 's principal investigator .
Huang is also medical director of the Movement Disorder Clinic at UNC Hospitals and an assistant professor of neurology in the UNC School of Medicine .
" What makes these results especially useful is the fact that most of the men in this study were not taking cholesterol - lowering drugs such as statins , " Huang said .
" This suggests that the association between low LDL levels and Parkinson 's exists independently from statin use , which helps answer another important question raised by our earlier study . "
The new study was published online this week by the journal Movement Disorders .
Huang is the lead author .
Her co-authors include Drs. G. Webster Ross and Helen Petrovitch , who are both with the Pacific Health Research Institute , the Veterans Affairs Pacific Islands Health Care System and the University of Hawaii ; Dr. Robert D. Abbott of the University of Virginia and Shiga University in Japan ; and Dr. Richard B. Mailman , a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the UNC School of Medicine .
Low levels of LDL cholesterol are clearly associated with good cardiovascular health .
Huang 's research adds to a growing literature indicating that people with low LDL may be at greater risk for developing Parkinson's .
" Our study again shows an association between low cholesterol and the risk of Parkinson 's disease , but we have not shown cause and effect , " Huang said .
" People taking statins for valid medical reasons should not stop simply to avoid Parkinson's . "
For this prospective study , fasting lipids were measured from 1991 to 1993 in a group of 3,233 men of Japanese ancestry who took part in a long - running study called the Honolulu - Asia Aging Study .
These data were collected before statin therapy for lowering cholesterol was widely available .
When followed for about ten years , the incidence of Parkinson 's disease increased with decreasing levels of LDL cholesterol .
After adjusting their statistical analysis for age , smoking , coffee intake and other factors , the researchers calculated that the relative odds of Parkinson 's for men with lower LDL levels ( 85 milligrams per deciliter ) was about twice that of those with higher LDL levels ( 135 milligrams per deciliter ) .
They concluded that this study supports the hypothesis that low LDL levels are associated with an increased future risk of Parkinson's .
Huang said more research is needed to confirm these findings , with logical next steps including conducting studies with larger sample sizes and that include women and African - Americans .
The paper on the study , titled " Low LDL cholesterol and increased risk of Parkinson 's disease : Prospective results from Honolulu - Asia Aging Study , " can be found at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/77502481/issue .
DURHAM , N.C. — Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign yesterday tried to redefine the delegate math for securing the Democratic presidential nomination , signaling its willingness to wage a divisive battle with front - runner Sen. Barack Obama through the summer .
Mr. Obama , meanwhile , questioned Mrs. Clinton ’s trustworthiness heading into today ’s primaries in Indiana and North Carolina .
Top Clinton aides said the nominee must win based on a tally that includes delegates from Florida and Michigan , which held January primaries that were disqualified by party rules .
The campaign ’s “ Delegate Hub ” Web site identifies 2,208 as the total delegates needed to be nominated , or 183 more than the threshold of 2,025 set by the Democratic National Committee ’s rules .
“ That ’s what we believe is the standard for deciding this — who has the majority of the total delegates including Michigan and Florida to decide the nomination , ” said Clinton strategist Geoff Garin .
The Obama campaign has long accused Team Clinton of “ moving the goal posts ” to avoid facing the reality that it is nearly impossible for her to catch up , and his supporters in the Democratic Party ’s hierarchy reacted angrily yesterday to the idea that the 2,025 - delegate finish line could be changed , especially because Mr. Obama is 273 delegates from reaching that magic number according to his campaign count .
“ When you totally ignore the rules , letting these people change the outcome , that does n’t pass the straight - face test , ” Allan Katz of Tallahassee , Fla. , a member of the DNC ’s executive committee , told The Washington Times .
“ It ’s not just a question of changing the rules , it ’s ignoring the reason the [ DNC ’s ] rules committee is there , to enforce the rules .
You do n’t get relieved of that responsibility if you do n’t like the outcome , ” Mr. Katz said .
Mr. Garin said “ neither candidate ” will have the needed delegates by June 3 when the last votes are counted in South Dakota and Montana .
But Mr. Obama , should he win over a large bloc of superdelegates — elected officials and party activists who help decide the nomination — could get to 2,025 by then .
The delegates from Florida and Michigan were deemed ineligible when the states broke party rules to hold primaries earlier than allowed .
The DNC ’s Convention Rules and Bylaws Committee is scheduled to meet May 31 to discuss the issue .
Until then , the DNC said it wo n’t comment on the delegate problem .
“ Let ’s see what happens on May 31 , ” DNC spokeswoman Karen Finney said yesterday .
If the Rules and Bylaws Committee can’t reach an agreement with the campaigns , the matter will go to the party ’s Credentials Committee , which probably wo n’t meet until July at the earliest .
On the stump yesterday , Mr. Obama told voters that many Americans do not find Mrs. Clinton to be trustworthy , and said his critics are reaching when they attack him for not wearing a flag pin .
“ I think the majority of people do find me trustworthy , more than they do the other candidate , and we ca n’t solve problems if people do n’t think that their leaders are telling them the truth .
If they think their leaders are just saying whatever it is that helps them get to the next election , you can never ask them for sacrifice , because they are thinking , ‘ I do n’t want to be played for a sap , for a patsy , ’ ” he said .
“ There ’s something about our campaign that ’s right , that ’s true , ” he said in responding to an undecided voter in Durham who said electability was her biggest concern and asked why she should choose Mr. Obama .
The candidate said he can beat presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen.
John McCain once Democrats are unified , and said even though he has had a month of negative press , he is still tied with the senator from Arizona in most polls and beats him in large states such as California and New York .
“ Do n’t buy into this electability argument , ” Mr. Obama told the woman .
“ Go with who you think best represents your vision of where America needs to go .
If you do that , I am absolutely confident that that person will win . ”
As the presidential hopefuls went after each over high gas prices , the campaigns already were working to set expectations for today ’s primaries in North Carolina , where Mr. Obama ’s double - digit lead has dwindled , and in Indiana , where they ’re locked in a tight race with Mrs. Clinton ahead in most polls .
“ Every single poll shows this is a dead heat ; we need every single vote , ” Mr. Obama told union members in Evansville , Ind .
Mr. Garin told reporters he thinks the former first lady — trailing in states won and delegates — has made “ substantial progress ” in North Carolina and has cut into Mr. Obama ’s one - time 20 - point lead .
Yesterday , Clinton spokesman Phil Singer said the campaign is waiting for the results of the rules committee meeting at month ’s end .
“ There ’s a process in place , and we ’re awaiting the outcome of those challenges , ” he said .
“ Do they not think that all 50 states should play a role ? ” he said of the Obama campaign .
The Obama campaign has said the delegates from Florida and Michigan ultimately will be recognized at the convention , but argues it is unfair to seat them according to how Michigan voted Jan. 15 and Florida voted Jan. 29 .
Mrs. Clinton won both contests after neither Democrat campaigned in those states .
Mr. Obama had his name removed from the Michigan ballot to honor the DNC rules setting out the order for primaries and caucuses .
Mr. Singer rebuffed those arguments , saying Mr. Obama made a “ political decision ” to take himself off the ballot , and some of his supporters urged Michigan Democrats to vote for “ uncommitted ” instead of Mrs. Clinton .
DNC Chairman Howard Dean has said he is committed to finding a compromise in which Florida and Michigan delegates will be seated .

LogoWatch exclusive
In April last year , London design outfit FHD proudly announced it would be rebranding the UK's Office of Government Commerce ( OGC ) - the HM Treasury tentacle " responsible for improving value for money by driving up standards and capability in procurement " .
FHD 's MD Adrian
Day trumpeted to the sound of whalesong : “ We are seeing growing demand from clients for consultancy support that spans branding , strategic and stakeholder communications , and this brief from OGC and OGCbuying .
solutions is a perfect example of the need for a more integrated , informed approach to branding .
We have worked on a number of successful corporate branding projects in the past few months and this project is an exciting new win for the business . ”
Catherine Hastings , director of communications at the OGC , chipped in with : “ We were impressed with the integrated approach FHD had to offer , which combined expertise in workings of government . ”
So far so good - nothing more exciting than some traditional Strategy Boutique Newspeak .
However , the wheels came off this particular rebrand in spectacular style when the new logo was presented to OGC staff .
According to an inside source , the graphic had allegedly already been inscribed onto mousemats and pens in anticipation of its imminent deployment , but it took OGC foot soldiers around 20 seconds to realise why this particular bit of joss - stick - driven madness was going to end in tears ( of laughter ) :
On dear , oh dear . *
Well , at least it appears that FHD really does have expertise " in workings of government " , as a quick 90 clockwise rotation reveals .
Quite remarkably , our informant suggested that , having spent the cash , OGC intends to roll out the logo anyway .
Well , we contacted the OGC for comment , and a spokesman gamely explained : " The OGC is currently overhauling the design of its corporate materials following a new strategy and forward direction .
As part of this , the OGC has been developing a new visual identity , one aspect of which is a new logo .
" The proposed version , which you have sent over , has been shared with staff , and is now going through final technical stages .
It is true that it caused a few titters among some staff when viewed on its side , but on consideration we concluded that the effect was generic to the particular combination of the letters ' OGC ' - and is not inappropriate to an organisation that 's looking to have a firm grip on government spend ! "
He concluded : " The new identity has been extremely well received , as it presents a very clean , uncluttered and modern identity . "
The mind boggles .
For the record , and in case you 'd like to get your hands on a rebranded OGC mousemat , we gather staff have stripped the building of every example not nailed down , so check eBay later this week for your five - knuckle shuffle collectable . ®
Bootnote
* You 're right - that 's not enough " oh dears " .
Oh dear , oh dear , oh dear , oh dear , oh dear , oh dear ...
Oh yes , we contacted FHD for a comment , but no one had got back to us at time of publication .

Congressional Republicans , specifically Lincoln Diaz - Balart of Florida , just interrupted the memorial service of recently deceased Congressman Tom Lantos .
At 11:05 am this morning , Diaz - Balart offered a motion to adjourn , which , if passed , would have ended the House ’s legislative day .
It appears the intent was to keep the House from debating contempt citations for former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten , which were on the agenda .
According to the Congressional Research Service , “ A motion to adjourn is of the highest privilege , takes precedence over all other motions , is not debatable , and must be put to an immediate vote . ”
That means that the members of the House had to leave the Lantos memorial where they were paying their respects to vote on the House floor , for nothing more important than to keep the day ’s business open .
The memorial service began at 10:00 am in Statuary Hall , which is an old House chamber in the Capitol .
Speakers included Lantos ’ relatives , Bono , and Elie Wiesel .
Diaz - Balart ’s vote was called during Joe Biden ’s tribute to Lantos .
It was purely obstructionist move by Diaz - Balart , made all the more crass and classless because it was used to disrupt the services of a widely admired public servant who was Congress ’s only Holocaust survivor .
Accusations are flying back and forth about the matter .
Incidentally , the motion to adjourn failed and debate of the contempt citations is currently underway .
Video after the jump .
Per entrare nel vivo delle nuove , potentissime meccaniche offerte dalla versione 1.2 del framework MooTools , in questo articolo vi riporto l’intervista che ho realizzato con l’ideatore , nonché team leader , della libreria in questione : Valerio Proietti .
Ringrazio personalmente Valerio per la completa disponibilità e per la ricchezza dei contenuti .
Inoltre consiglio a tutti gli sviluppatori che utilizzano MooTools di non perdersi questa risorsa .
Al suo interno troverete consigli , suggerimenti , codici e tante novità sull ’universo di MooTools , con qualche curiosità sul suo ideatore .
Iniziamo !
Riccardo : Come e quando è nata la tua passione per il Web Design e in particolare per Javascript ?
Valerio : La mia passione è iniziata più o meno sei anni fa .
Allora il mio lavoro ( parecchio noioso ) consisteva nella realizzazione di scripting vari , ma sopratutto nell ’ ottimizzazione di questi ultimi .
Dovevo migliorarli e scriverli più elegantemente .
La passione per Javascript è quindi piu una passione per lo scripting in generale .
Programmare per il web da una grande soddisfazione immediata e facendolo hai il grande vantaggio che il tuo lavoro possa essere visto da tantissime persone in poco tempo .
Riccardo : Sviluppare un framework Javascript completo e “ full - featured ” come MooTools è un’impresa ardua , soprattutto con prodotti come Prototype e jQuery in circolazione già da tempo .
Quali sono stati i motivi che ti hanno fatto intraprendere questa scelta ?
Valerio :
Poco dopo aver iniziato con il web development ho deciso insieme ad un amico di creare un CMS , chiamto MooFlex e basato sull ’accopiata Prototype +
Scriptaculous .
Devo dire che ero davvero impressionato dalla potenza di Prototype , mentre con Scriptaculous non mi trovavo per niente bene .
Ho quindi deciso di scrivermi il mio framework di animazioni : moo.fx ( togli “ le ” da MooFlex ed ottieni moo.fx ) .
Volevo qualcosa che sfruttasse davvero la potenza di Prototype , qualcosa di ottimizzato alla perfezione ed allo stesso tempo utile agli sviluppatori .
Continuando ad ottimizzare e migliorare i miei lavori , lo script diventava sempre più grande , coeso ed “ armonico ” : è da qui che è nato MooTools .
Riccardo : Sfogliando accuratamente il codice della versione 1.2 e paragonandolo a quello delle primissime release , come la 0.90 o la 1.0 , si nota come questo sia diventato molto più robusto ed articolato .
Come si è evoluta la tua metodologia di programmazione e di conseguenza MooTools ?
Valerio : Diciamo che MooTools mi ha insegnato , e continua ad insegnarmi , sia JavaScript , sia HTML , sia CSS , come si comportano i browser e molto altro .
Sviluppando MooTools imparo tantissimo .
All ’inizio impari tantissime cose in poco tempo e il framework cresce rapidamente , poi raggiungi una certa stabilità continuando comunque ad evolvere .
La versione 1.2 rappresenta questa stabilità che stiamo rincorrendo da piu di un anno .
Ma l’evoluzione non sta solamente nel codice in termine stretto , ma riguarda anche il design di API e l’immedesimazione nell ’utente .
Riccardo : Qual è stata la parte più ostica da realizzare / progettare all ’interno del framework ?
Valerio :
In linea generale , sicuramente realizzare la compatibilità con tutti i browser , soprattutto con Opera e Internet Explorer 6 .
È veramente un compito ostico da portare a termine , ma mi compiaccio del fatto che nessun utente che usa MooTools debba fare lo stesso , compreso me .
Riguardo il codice , senza dubbio i selettori CSS3 sono stati parecchio complessi , pur non essendo particolarmente difficili da programmare sotto la componente logica .
Bisognava trovare la giusta via di mezzo tra velocità , eleganza , efficenza ed estensibilità .
A differenza di altri framework che dopo il calcolo principale aumentano la velocità di esecuzione , ho optato per un parser “ logico ” , senza nessun tipo di “ case ” specifico .
Ogni selettore viene “ splittato ” nelle sue parti e trattato nel medesimo modo di tutti gli altri .
I vantaggi si riscontrano nella drastica riduzione della mole di codice , nell ’aumento della sua mantenibilità e ancora nella riduzione del margine d’errore .
Riccardo : MooTools ha acquisito un successo internazionale ed è stato accolto molto positivamente dagli sviluppatori , come dimostra la numerosa community e il gran numero di plugin realizzati da terze parti .
Te lo aspettavi ?
Valerio :
Sì e no .
Dopo un certo periodo di tempo , ovviamente mi aspettavo di vedere realizzati plug - in basati su di esso .
Quello che non mi aspettavo è la grande quantità di siti che usano MooTools come enhancement grafico , come Rockettheme e Joomla , per esempio .
Io ho puntato principalmente ad un’audience di sviluppatori , invece questo dimostra che MooTools è usato tantissimo anche per i suoi effetti , il che mi rende molto felice .
Riccardo : Quali sono i principali cambiamenti tra la versione 1.1 e la versione 1.2 e quali sono i vantaggi fondamentali offerti da quest ’ultima ?
Valerio : Qui ci sono tantissime cose da elencare , quindi ti riporto solo quelle principali .
Per prima cosa i selettori e le API per scrivere pseudo - selettori , che sono le stesse che usiamo internamente .
Ti faccio un esempio pratico :
Selectors.pseudo.invisible = function ( ) { return ( this.get ( ' opacity ' ) == 0 ) ; } ;
Per ottenere tutti gli elementi di tipo “ div ” con un valore di opacity uguale a 0 è poi possibile fare :
$ $ ( ' div:invisible ' )
Il parser di cui parlavo precedentemente supporta tutte le concatenazioni di tutti i tipi , anche 6 classNames se vuoi :D. Inoltre , diversi namespace sono stati modificati per una questione di consistenza .
Anche se questo potrebbe inizialmente creare dei problemi per chi arriva dalla versione 1.1 , penso ne valga parecchio la pena , perché aggiunge davvero molta consistenza .
Un ’altra grande novità sono poi gli shortcuts come i seguenti :
element.fade ( ) ; element.tween ( ) ; element.morph ( ) ;
Questo è stato un dei motivi per cui abbiamo cambiato il nome alle classi , dato che element. style ( ) non avrebbe avuto molto senso .
Mi soffermo un attimo sugli shortcuts , che a mio avviso sono potentissimi .
Sia gli shortcut “ vecchia scuola ” ( come element.effect ( ) ) che le classi ( come new Fx. Qualcosa ) , ritornano un’istanza , che dovresti usare ogni volta che lanci un effetto .
I nuovi shortcut invece , ritornano l’elemento e creano automaticamente un’istanza associata a quell ’elemento , che poi verrà riusata automaticamente .
Ad esempio :
el.fade ( ) ; el.fade ( ) ;
È un’automazione pazzesca , perché permette di creare effetti velocemente , senza preoccuparti delle istanze .
Inoltre permette di non crearle finché non vengono usate , risparmiando memoria e velocità .
Questa nuova metodologia permette la creazione di moltissime nuove cose , ma non deve essere una sostituzione completa alle classi , che consiglio di utilizzare per la creazione di effetti personalizzati .
Gli shortcut sono quindi una “ parte client ” , che all ’interno di un’applicazione , dovrebbero essere utilizzati più dall ’utente che dal suo sviluppatore .
Passiamo ora ad Element .
Questi utilizzano internamente lo Storage , che è a mio avviso una delle novità più rilevanti .
Esso permette di associare un valore ad un elemento , senza che esso sia attaccato fisicamente all ’elemento , e successivamente riprendere questo valore .
Ti faccio un esempio pratico :
inputElement.store ( ' label ' , labelElement ) ; labelElement.store ( ' input ' , inputElement ) ; inputElement.addEvent ( ' focus ' , function ( ) { this .retrieve ( ' label ').setStyle( ' color ' , ' red ' ) ; } ) ; inputElement.addEvent( ' blur ' , function ( ) { this .retrieve ( ' label ').setStyle( ' color ' , ' blue ' ) ; } ) ; labelElement.addEvent( ' click ' , function ( ) { this .retrieve ( ' input ').focus ( ) ; } ) ;
Nei miei lavori non riesco proprio a fare a meno di utilizzare questa metodologia , che trovo molto più utile che riempire il DOM di query ogni volta che abbiamo bisogno di trovare un determinato elemento .
Ovviamente con il metodo store è possibile registrare qualsiasi cosa , come oggetti , istanze e così via :
element.store ( 'fx ' , new Fx.Morph ( element ) ) ; // successivamente element.retrieve ( ' fx ' ) . start ( ) ;
Sempre riguardo ad Element non posso non riportare i nuovi metodi set , get ed erase , che rappresentano una nuova metodologia per scrivere , leggere e cancellare gli attributi da un elemento .
E’ possibile lavorare sia con attributi standard che con attributi custom :
// aggiungo una propriet&agreva ; ' invisible ' per vedere se il mio elemento ha un opacity pari a 0 // e per settarla a questo valore Element .
Properties .invisible = { get : function ( ) { return this .
get ( ' opacity ' ) == 0 ; } , set : function ( ) { this .setStyle('opacity ' , 0 ) ; } }} ; // settiamo a 0 il valore di opacity element .
set ( ' invisible ' ) ; // mentre per gli attributi standard MooTools usa internamente getProperty e setProperty // restituendo il determinato valore element.
get ( ' checked ' ) ; element.get ( 'id ' ) ;
L’ultima novità di rilievo per quanto riguarda la classe Element è rappresentata dal supporto completo per gli iframes , grazie alla classe helper per creare iframes in tutta semplicità e per lavorare con gli elementi in essi contenuti ( iframe.getElement(' someelement '). fade ( ) , ad esempio ) .
Altre novità interessanti sono la nuova classe Hash , cambiata moltissimo rispetto al passato e facente ora parte del “ core ” , e la classe Request che migliora le funzionalità precendenti di Ajax ed offre più organizzazione , nelle sue componenti Request .
HTML , Request .
JSON ed in futuro Request .XML .
Inoltre , un ’altra grande novità è la completa separazione del core dai plug - in : altro Trac , altro SVN .
Riccardo :
Allo sviluppatore che utilizza MooTools 1.1 nelle proprie applicazioni , che consigli dai per integrarsi al meglio con le meccaniche della nuova versione e migrare cosi alla 1.2 ?
Valerio :
utilizzare Firebug , vedere su quali metodi da errore e cercarli nella documentazione ; leggere tanta documentazione , che è immensamente più dettagliata rispetto alla precedente ; nel trunk c’è una cartella chiamata Compatibility ( molto probabilmente varrà rilasciato come file singolo dal nome di compatibility .js ) .
Includendolo si ottiene una buona compatibilità con la versione 1.1 ed i precedenti metodi continueranno a funzionare , anche se consiglio vivamente di utilizzare la 1.2 ed imparare le nuove meccaniche ( ci sono parti dove ovviamente non si può ottenere la piena compatibilità ) ; comprare il libro in lingua inglese che esce tra poco , attualmente in fase di scrittura da parte di Aaron Newton ; seguire il forum ed il blog ufficiali .
Riccardo : Nei forum e nei blog internazionali che includono la trattazione dei framework Javascript tra i propri argomenti , si è parlato di una quasi totale riscrittura della tua libreria rispetto alla precedente versione .
Perché questa scelta ?
Valerio :
In realtà credo sia un esagerazione .
Sicuramente è vero che quasi tutto il codice è stato rivisitato e spesso migliorato , ma una totale riscrittura è decisamente un esagerazione .
In fondo , utilizza gli stessi principi di base , quasi la stessa struttura a moduli : anche se molte cose sono state spostate e riorganizzate , per consistenza o per future proofing , le parti che sono state riscritte da zero le posso contare sulle dita di una mano :) .
Direi più che altro che è stato completamente ottimizzato .
Riccardo : Perché uno sviluppatore dovrebbe scegliere MooTools 1.2 preferendolo ad altri grandi framework come Prototype , jQuery , Ext o Dojo ?
Valerio : Non conosco molto bene questi altri framework in realtà , ma trovo che ognuno di essi sia un ottimo lavoro .
Secondo me è una questione di quello che serve a te , di quali sono le tue esigenze .
Per fare un esempio , io so che Prototype , come MooTools , modifica i prototypes degli oggetti , mentre YUI , Dojo e JQuery non lo fanno .
Questo aspetto dovrebbe avere un impatto enorme nella scelta del framework .
Se hai una pagina della quale non hai il completo controllo o che include altri framework , MooTools darà sicuramente dei problemi dato che modificando i prototypes va in conflitto con gli altri , mentre YUI o JQuery si comporteranno alla perfezione .
Personalmente non potrei fare a meno di avere i metodi sugli Array per esempio , ed è per questo che sceglierei un tipo di libreria come MooTools o Prototype , che modifica i prototypes degli oggetti nativi .
Un altro criterio di scelta potrebbe essere la dimensione , ma in fine tutti i maggiori framework hanno più o meno lo stesso footprint , quindi si devono controllare le features offerte da ognuno di essi .
A differenza di altre librerie , MooTools racchiude in sé sia un’ampia base dedicata alle classi sia moltissimi plug - in “ built -in ” .
Una caratteristica fondamentale di MooTools è che vuol essere rispettoso verso Javascript , rappresentando un’estensione al linguaggio .
I framework namespaced , non presentano quest ’ultima caratteristica , ad esempio .
Riccardo :
A differenza di altre librerie , MooTools utilizza una sintassi molto Object Oriented che , soprattutto per gli oggetti di tipo Class , ricorda molto i modelli di PHP5 e Java .
Che vantaggi possiamo trarre da questa sintassi , oltre all ’infinit‡ ri-usabilità delle variabili ed alla conservazione del loro stato ?
Valerio :
Il vantaggio più eclatante è che questo modello offre una base pazzesca per i plugin , dato che ogni plugin all ’interno di MooTools è rappresentato da una classe .
Un codice “ class - based ” offre quindi una grande estensibilità al framework , come hai giustamente riportato .
Riccardo : Quali progetti hai per il futuro ?
Che sorprese ci riserverà MooTools nelle prossime release ?
Valerio : Decisamente il mio più grande progetto è la creazione di un framework UI ( attualmente in fase di lavorazione ) , che uscirà probabilmente insieme ad una delle point releases della versione 1.2 .
Una delle poche informazioni sicure è che sarà interamente basato sugli elementi canvas in sostituzione delle immagini , e sarà “ modulare ” in pieno stile MooTools .
Esso permetterà la creazione di una “ User Interface ” basata su bottoni , finestre , menu e così via .
Riccardo : Infine , non posso non chiedere al papà di MooTools un giudizio sulla versione 1.3.1 della mia libreria moo.rd .
Che ne pensi ?
Valerio : Devo dire che ho riscontrato un miglioramento enorme .
Mi piacciono molti degli effetti , e la galleria non si puo rompere , il che è una grande cosa .
Ti dico la verità : quando vedo uno script la prima cosa che faccio Ë cercare di “ romperlo ” .
Se non ci riesco questo mi da un ’idea di solidità , e ciÚ dice tantissimo sul codice .
Gli effetti “ shuffle ” sono fighissimi !
Ripeto , un miglioramento esponenziale , complimenti !
Riccardo : Valerio , ti ringrazio ancora per la disponibilità .
A presto !
Valerio : E ’ stato un piacere .
Grazie a te !
Ghastly Beyond Belief
There is a story that Neil Gaimen was paid not to express criticism of Rowling for some of the similarities to his work .
I
" I was surprised to discover from yesterday 's [ Daily ] MIRROR that I 'm meant to have accused J.K. Rowling of ripping off BOOKS OF MAGIC for HARRY POTTER .
Simply is n't true -- and now it's on the public record it 'll follow me around forever .
Back in November I was tracked down by a Scotsman journalist who had noticed the similarities between my Tim Hunter character and Harry Potter , and wanted a story .
And I think I rather disappointed him by explaining that , no , I certainly * did n't * believe that Rowling had ripped off Books of Magic , that I doubted she 'd read it and that it would n't matter if she had : I was n't the first writer to create a young magician with potential , nor was Rowling the first to send one to school .
It 's not the ideas , it 's what you do with them that matters .
Genre fiction , as Terry Pratchett has pointed out , is a stew .
You take stuff out of the pot , you put stuff back .
The stew bubbles on .
( As I said to the Scotsman journalist , the only thing that was a mild bother was that in the BOOKS OF MAGIC movie Warners is planning , Tim Hunter can no longer be a bespectacled , 12 year old English kid .
But given the movie world I 'll just be pleased if he 's not played by a middle - aged large - muscled Austrian . )
Not sure how this has transmuted into " Gaiman has accused Rowling of ripping him off . "
But I suppose it's a better story than the truth .
Posted by puck at 3:00 AM PST | Comments ( 3 ) There 's a rumour going around that Neil is upset about the Harry Potter books being too similar to The Books of Magic .
Neil asked me to post this to clear things up :
Take a standard piece of copier paper ( 80 g /m^2 ) and carefully peel it into two sheets .
Listen out for the way it tears and watch how fast the peel line creeps .
What you ’ll see and hear is a stick - slip phenomenon in which the creep velocity varies over many orders of magnitude , with small movements of the peel line interspersed with huge avalanches .
So say Jari Rosti and pals at the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland , who have meticulously measured the way paper peels and developed statistical models to better understand what ’s going on ( those long winter evenings in Finland must fly by ) .
Why bother ?
It turns out that the physics of peeling paper almost exactly mimics the stick - slip movement of tectonic plates , right down to the statistics of the time between “ quakes ” and the correlations between released energy and aftershock activity .
It ’s tempting to imagine that peeling paper could therefore be used as a simple model in which to study earthquake statistics .
Sadly no .
Rosti and co admit there are some subtle but surprising differences between the two systems which would make that impossible .
But it does raise questions about how such subtle differences arise in systems that are otherwise statistically so similar .
Rosti hopes future work will reveal all .
And with the Finish winter coming all too soon after summer , they should have plenty of time to get peeling .

The prospect of one of the world 's leading political figures boycotting the Beijing Olympic Games over Chinese actions in Tibet was raised and then seriously qualified yesterday in a sign that the invitation to China in August is causing severe differences within Western governments .
The French minister for human rights , Rama Yade , was quoted in Le Monde newspaper as saying that President Nicolas Sarkozy will boycott the opening of the games unless China agreed to two conditions : releasing political prisoners and holding talks with the Dalai Lama , the spiritual leader of Tibet .
But last night , the minister said the paper had misquoted her .
" The word ' condition ' was never used , " she said .
In the past , the President has said he cannot rule out the possibility that he might boycott the opening ceremony if China continues its crackdown in Tibet .

The comments came as Gordon Brown prepared to welcome the Olympic torch to London today on its journey to Beijing and ruled out any boycott of the games , arguing that the Dalai Lama opposed such action .
Today , 80 athletes , celebrities and dignitaries are due to carry the Olympic torch in relay through London , despite calls by campaigners for a boycott .
At least five people have refused to carry the torch , including the comedian Francesca Martinez , pictured left .
The relay route through central London is expected to be met by around 500 demonstrators from organisations including the Free Tibet movement and the Falun Gong spiritual movement which is banned in China .
The Metropolitan Police is expected to deploy 2,000 police along the route .
" Any violence in China is to be condemned and I do urge restraint all round , " Mr Brown said .
" It is important that we recognise that the tensions between those in Tibet and the Chinese authorities can only in the end be solved by dialogue .
The Dalai Lama himself says he does not want to see a boycott of the Olympics and that is why I have said that as the host country for the 2012 Olympics I will attend the [ Beijing ]
Olympics as I know many others will do . "
But the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said it was " wholly inappropriate " for Mr Brown to welcome the torch to No 10 .
The Free Tibet spokesman Matt Whitticase added : " He should be saying , ' Sort out your problems in Tibet and improve your human rights record there ' , instead of receiving this torch , which is undoubtedly tainted by China 's actions inside Tibet . "
Ms Yade is close to the French President , but has a history of straying diplomatically off - side .
In Le Monde , she said that France did not want to " give lessons " to Beijing , but proceeded to lay down a specific agenda for talks between China and the Dalai Lama .
" Such talks must cover a recognition of Tibetan autonomy and the spiritual , religious and cultural identity of Tibetans , " she said .
She also accused China of " assimilation and colonisation " in Tibet and of " marginalising " the population .
Her interview went to press as several overseas groups representing Tibet activists said police fired on hundreds of protesters in a Tibetan area of China , killing eight people .
The reports indicate that the unrest is continuing in China 's Tibetan areas despite a massive security presence since violent anti-government demonstrations broke out in mid-March in Tibet 's capital Lhasa , and nearby provinces .

An Obama - Webb ticket closes a circle .
Much has been said , some of it overblown but enough of it with a kernel of truth to justify the hype and optimism , about how electing Barack Obama would be an act of historic significance , in some way atoning for the original sin of slavery and reconciling the darker elements of American history .
As I say , a good deal of this is trite : a President Obama is not going to magically close the divide between white and black America , but there 's enough to this to make the hope it inspires understandable .
Putting Jim Webb on the ticket completes this process .
like John McCain , Webb can plausibly claim that his ancestors have fought in almost every American war .
Unlike McCain , Webb is a creature of the white working class .
He believes his people - the Scots - Irish of Appalachia - remain misunderstood , under - appreciated and disparaged by America 's elites .
If Obama is a " wine track " candidate , Jim Webb is definitely " beer track " .
He 's quite happy - proud in fact - of his " redneck " stock .
I doubt there 's another member of the United States Senate who has made a speech at the Confederate War Memorial ( correct me , readers , if I 'm wrong ) .
Let alone one who gave a speech such as the one Webb delivered in 1990 :
This is by no means my first visit to this spot .
The Confederate Memorial has had a special place in my life for many years .
During the bitter turbulence of the early and mid1970's I used to come here quite often .
I had recently left the Marine Corps and was struggling to come to grips with my service in Vietnam , and with the misperceptions that seemed rampant about the people with whom I had served and what , exactly we had attempted to accomplish .
And there were many , many times that I found myself drawn to this deeply inspiring memorial , to contemplate the sacrifices of others , several of whom were my ancestors , whose enormous suffering and collective gallantry are to this day still misunderstood by most Americans .
...
I used to walk the perimeter of this monument , itself designed by a man who had fought for the Confederacy and who , despite international fame as a sculptor , decided to be buried beneath it , and I would comprehend that worldwide praise can never substitute for loyalties learned and tested under the tribulations of the battlefield .
I would study the inscription :
NOT FOR FAME OR REWARD , NOT FOR PLACE OR FOR RANK , NOT LURED BY AMBITION OR GOADED BY NECESSITY , BUT IN SIMPLE OBEDIENCE TO DUTY AS THEY UNDERSTOOD IT , THESE MEN SUFFERED ALL , SACRIFICED ALL , DARED ALL , AND DIED -- words written by a Confederate veteran who had later become a minister , and knew that this simple sentence spoke for all soldiers in all wars , men who must always trust their lives to the judgment of their leaders , and whose bond thus goes to individuals rather than to stark ideology , and who , at the end of the day that is their lives , desire more than anything to sleep with the satisfaction that when all the rhetoric was stripped away , they had fulfilled their duty -- as they understood it .
To their community .
To their nation .
To their individual consciences .
To their family .
And to their progeny , who in the end must not only judge their acts , but be judged as their inheritors .
And so I am here , with you today , to remember .
And to honor an army that rose like a sudden wind out of the little towns and scattered farms of a yet unconquered wilderness .
That drew 750,000 soldiers from a population base of only five million - less than the current population of Virginia alone .
That fought with squirrel rifles and cold steel against a much larger and more modern force .
That saw 60 percent of its soldiers become casualties , some 256,000 of them dead .
That gave every ounce of courage and loyalty to a leadership it trusted and respected , and then laid down its arms in an instant when that leadership decided that enough was enough .
That returned to a devastated land and a military occupation .
That endured the bitter humiliation of Reconstruction and an economic alienation from the rest of this nation which continued for fully a century , affecting white and black alike ....
The last twenty five years in this country have shown again and again that , despite the regrettable and well - publicized turmoil of the Civil Rights years , those Americans of African ancestry are the people with whom our history in this country most closely intertwines , whose struggles in an odd but compelling way most resemble our own , and whose rights as full citizens we above all should celebrate and insist upon ....
There are at least two lessons for us to take away from such a day of remembrance .
The first is one our leaders should carry next to their breasts , and contemplate every time they face a crisis , however small , which puts our military at risk .
it should echo in their consciences , from the power of a million graves .
It is simply this : You hold our soldiers ' lives in sacred trust .
When a citizen has sworn to obey you , and follow your judgment , and walk onto a battlefield to defend the interests you define as worthy of his blood , do not abuse that awesome power through careless policy , unclear objectives , or inflexible leadership .
The second lesson regards those who have taken such an oath , and who have honored the judgment of their leaders , often at great cost .
Intellectual analyses of national policy are subject to constant re-evaluation by historians as the decades roll by , but duty is a constant , frozen in the context of the moment it was performed .
Duty is action , taken after listening to one 's leaders , and weighing risk and fear against the powerful draw of obligation to family , community , nation , and the unknown future .
We , the progeny who live in that future , were among the intended beneficiaries of those frightful decisions made so long ago .
As such , we are also the caretakers of the memory , and the reputation , of those who performed their duty -- as they understood it -- under circumstances too difficult for us ever to fully comprehend .

1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men will become a victim of sexual assault .
Recent developments in the 2016 election have rekindled the problem of sexual abuse in a National conversation .
We 've seen the video of Trump bragging about sexually abusing women , and we 've since heard from many of the women he 's sexually abused .
Donald Trump has referred to his sex crimes as " locker room talk . "
Sadly this has added insult to injury to men that were already disgusted by Trump .
Trump has now led women to believe that other men actually talk like this in the " locker room . "
This bothers me and all the good men in America .
I 've been in locker rooms all my life and I 've never heard another man brag about sexually assaulting a woman .
I 've played well over a thousand rounds of golf , and visited the locker room .
I 've played basketball and soccer and have been in the locker room another 100 times with athletes playing those sports , and I 've never heard a man brag about kissing a woman when he sees her , and not waiting for her consent .
I 've been in a health club locker room over 300 times and I 've never heard a man talk about grabbing a woman in a way that would put him in jail if he was recorded doing what he was saying ( grab her by the p***y ) .
To add insult to injury , there was even an article from another man that claimed " many men talk like Donald Trump in private .
And only other men can stop them . "
There is so much wrong with this statement .
Absolutely not !
Many men do n't talk like Trump .
As we 've heard from a great many professional athletes this week , none of them relate to the notion that locker rooms sound like this .
And let 's just get this straight ... locker room is code for " men in private . "
" Many men " do n't brag about sexually abusing women in private , locker room or not .
The author of this piece believes that only other men can stop " it . "
And that 's just not the case , everyone in society plays a role .
In fact , women play just as much of a role if not even more of a role .
I believe the author of the above piece may have unfortunately conflated objectification of women and sexual predation .
Objectification of women is rampant , that is certain .
However objectification of women is nothing like rape .
Both issues should be addressed , but Trump 's actions are criminal and objectification of the opposite sex is n't .
Yes , we should all work to value people for more than just sex , but that 's not anywhere in the realm of using your power to sexually abuse someone else .
And let 's leave objectifying others there for now .
Back to the issue that Donald Trump brings up ( sexual assault and evil towards women ) .
Trump is a misogynist , he calls women names simply because she exposes his disgusting views ( Alicia Machado ) or his moronic thoughts ( Rosie O'Donnell ) .
He thinks he can do whatever he wants to women and get away with it .
Thankfully almost none of you have ever heard a man talk like Donald Trump did on that tape when he admitted to sexual crimes .
But we can all do something about this .
Let 's agree to speak out much like this , let 's agree to make statements against his form of megalomaniac abuse .
Let 's agree that on that first day of your life that you 're unlucky enough to be in the presence of an asshole that admits to sexual abuse , you say something to that jackass and make sure he / she knows just how strongly you feel about how small of a person they are .
How else can you send a message ?
Please donate to help women affected by sexual violence : DONATE TO RAINN .
Now for a moment , let 's go back to objectification of the opposing sex .
Both women and men are guilty of it , and although I do n't have a poll I would assume that men are guilty of it more than women .
The article I referenced above incorrectly posited that only men can do something about it .
It 's important for women to know that while some men play a role in the reduction of objectification , most men learn about the harm of objectifying women from other women .
We often learn from hearing other women speak ( youtube , tv , radio , etc ... ) or we learn from them telling us directly .
We learn from women that it hurts to be objectified and that they feel gross when we treat them like they are simply sex objects .
So women ... keep it up .
Let men know how it makes you feel , were listening and learning .
" You can not be President if you call someone a piggy . " - A 6 year old ( as told to us by Michelle Obama )
Gary Gygax , the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons and father of the role - playing game , passed away yesterday at the age of 69 .
Without Gygax ’s brilliance games like Final Fantasy , Dragonquest and World of Warcraft would have never existed .
Dungeons and Dragons is the true foundation of all modern role - playing games .
So thank you Gary .
Without you our gaming world would have been a lot less fun .
For this comic , I decided to go for true D&D joke .
In fact , a friend of mine who has forgotten more about D&D than I ’ve ever learned was like “ huh … I did n’t know that ” after I explained it .
So why was it ironic that Satan was using the 2nd Edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rulebook ?
Because all mentions of demons and devils were removed from this edition to appease Christian zealots who were attacking D&D for Satan worshiping and such at the time .
And now you know .

To add injury to absurdity , when our bullpen coach came running in from left field to join the fight , he pulled a hamstring halfway to the pile .
The thing about being on national TV is that later no one can tell tall stories about what they did in the fight ; it is on tape .
Supermen can be reduced to mere mortals when the “ play ” button is hit .
So  perhaps for the benefit of the cameras  we puff out our chests , stare one another down and occasionally bear - hug someone to make sure they do n’t escalate things .
But I am confident that only a few players really know how to fight .
I certainly never took any martial - arts classes .
I am even more confident that hardly any of them really want to fight .
After all , our bodies are the instruments with which we make our living and if they become damaged , there goes our livelihood .
There are a lot of unwritten rules in the game of baseball that you tacitly accept when you put on the uniform .
When one of those is broken , there is yet another unwritten rule of retaliation .
If you steal a base when you ’re ahead by a lot of runs late in the game , one of your teammates will get drilled by a pitch in the back .
If you take too much time to enjoy a home run you hit , either you or a teammate will get drilled by a pitch in the back .
If you make too hard a slide into a base and almost hurt your opponent , a teammate may get drilled by a pitch in the back .
If you dare do anything to hurt the opposing team ’s pitcher , with or without intent , you might as well break out the boxing gloves .
And if he is “ the ace ” of their team  Armageddon .
Because the pitcher has the right to act as instigator , enforcer or retaliator , he is the key to how the sentencing is brought down .
Therefore the little , stitched white ball in his hand delivers the verdict on behalf of judge , jury and executioner .
These rules , and others ( they are too numerous to list ) , when broken , eventually result in a brawl .
It may not happen that same day , because the grudge - holding nature of the game has no statute of limitations .
According to my unfinished business archive , I still owe Hideki Irabu for hitting me in the back with the first pitch of the game in Yankee Stadium nine years ago .
Since we are both retired I may have to exact revenge in some Best Buy parking lot .
Seattle Mariners first baseman Richie Sexton , responding recently to a question about why he charged the mound , stated , “ I understood the situation , and there is a right and wrong way to play the game .
He hits me below the shoulders , and I am fine with that .
But when you get up near the face that is when you start talking about careers . ”
Yes , I had forgotten this rule .
The what - body - part - you - can - hit - out - of - frustration rule .
Of course , a 95 - mile - per - hour fastball off your spine below your shoulders is n’t what I would call “ career - extending , ” either .
( Adds Spanish draft statement , background )
BRUSSELS , Feb 18 ( Reuters ) - Spain , grappling with its own separatist movements , said on Monday it would not recognise the secession of the ethnic Albanian territory of Kosovo from Serbia .
" The government of Spain will not recognise the unilateral act proclaimed yesterday by the assembly of Kosovo , " Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos told reporters on arrival for a meeting of European Union foreign ministers .
" We will not recognise because we consider ... this does not respect international law , " he said , adding that to be legal , secession required either an agreement between the parties or a U.N. Security Council resolution .
Basque separatist movement ETA has spent the past four decades fighting for an independent Basque state in northern Spain and southwestern France , killing more than 800 people .
Spain must also contend with separatist pressures within the northeast region of Catalonia , which like the Basque region has some degree of autonomy .
Diplomats said Madrid had unsuccessfully sought to persuade Kosovo Albanian leaders to delay their independence declaration until after a March 9 general election to prevent the secession having any impact on the election campaign .
It was unclear whether Spain 's concerns would prevent EU foreign ministers on Monday agreeing a joint declaration on the 27 - member bloc 's future policy towards Kosovo .
Spain proposed a draft for the text that , if agreed , would reaffirm the EU 's commitment to the principle of territorial integrity of states and stress that Kosovo does not set a precedent for any other separatist causes .
However the draft , according to a copy obtained by Reuters , would note the EU 's decision at the weekend to launch a police and civil administration mission in Kosovo and that the EU was ready to help Balkans states towards the goal of EU entry .

https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/26/us/attica-scott-arrest-breonna-taylor-protest/index.html
Scott says she was arrested at 8:58 p.m. , two minutes before the curfew started , as she and other protesters crossed the street to seek sanctuary at the church .
" How could I have been breaking curfew before curfew even began ? " she asked .
The curfew , enacted by Mayor Greg Fischer on Wednesday ahead of the announcement by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron on a grand jury decision in the Taylor case , does n't apply to those commuting to houses of worship .
" In Breonna 's name , neither I or my teenage daughter who was arrested with me tried to burn down a library that our people need , " Scott said at a press conference earlier Friday morning .
" Those are some ridiculous charges that are levied against us . "
Scott recorded video of herself walking to the First Unitarian Church of Louisville , showing police officers and police vans on street corners as they walked past a library on their way towards the church .
Five minutes into the video , Scott and fellow demonstrators were blocked by a group of police in the street between them and the church .
" Where do you want us to go ? " the video shows Scott yelling out to police , some in riot gear .
Three minutes later an officer approaches Scott .
" Ma'am is your phone recording ? " the officer said .
" Yes , it is , " she replies .
Just days after grainy video footage surfaced online purportedly showing Grammy - nominated songstress Amy Winehouse inhaling smoke from what appeared to be a crack pipe , it seems Winehouse has committed herself to treatment .
A press release from the Outside Organization , which handles publicity for Winehouse in the U.K. , says that " Winehouse 's planned appearance at the NRJ Awards in France on Saturday " has been canceled " as the artist has entered a rehabilitation clinic . "
The release says Winehouse decided to enter the facility on Thursday ( January 24 ) " after talks with her record label , management , family and doctors .
She has come to understand that she requires specialist treatment to continue her ongoing recovery from drug addiction and prepare for her planned appearance at the Grammy Awards . "
Winehouse has been nominated for six Grammys , including Record of the Year and Song of the Year for " Rehab " and Best Album for Back to Black .
Winehouse 's U.S. publicist could not be reached for comment .
According to Outside , " Amy entered the facility by mutual agreement and continues to receive the full support of all concerned .
Amy is the most talented and important musical artist of her generation and has made huge strides on her road to recovery .
Universal Music Group wants nothing more than to see her take the time she needs to come back to full health and fulfill her incredible potential with the label .
" The label has always had the best interests of Amy at heart and has been guided by her family and doctors in the last few months as to the best direction to take , " the release continued .
" All concerned feel that Amy must put her health before all other considerations and will be by her side whenever and wherever they are needed . "
The news is just the most recent development in what 's been a spate of bad publicity for the embattled artist , and it comes on the heels of a breakout year for Winehouse .
Over the course of the last year , Winehouse has become a household name — not only because of Back to Black 's successes , but also due to her brushes with the law .
In October , she was fined after marijuana was found in her hotel room in the Norwegian city of Bergen .
She also called off a series of shows and appearances , which reportedly allowed the singer to seek treatment for drug addiction .
On December 18 , Winehouse was arrested for questioning in connection with a court case in which her husband , Blake Fielder - Civil , was charged with perverting the course of justice following a bar fight .
She voluntarily went to a police station in East London at a prearranged time and was released with no charges .
Fielder - Civil is currently in prison as he awaits the start of his trial .
The House of Representatives has approved the Pro-IP Act , a controversial legislative proposal that aims to impose stricter penalties for copyright infringement .
The bill , which has strong support from the content industry , passed by a vote of 410 to 10 .
MPAA chairman Dan Glickman applauded the House for passing the bill and expresses hope that it will move just as quickly through the Senate .
" We applaud the members of the House of Representatives for passing the PRO - IP Act , H.R. 4279 .
It is a comprehensive , bipartisan measure that will strengthen our nation 's economy and generate more jobs for American workers by bolstering protections for intellectual property , " Glickman said in a statement .
" Given the difficult economic times we face , the PRO - IP
Act is welcome by both the business and labor communities because it can improve our nation 's economic outlook .
I hope the Senate will move quickly to pass similar legislation . "
The Pro-IP
Act would establish a new copyright enforcement division with the Department of Justice and create a new position for a federal copyright enforcement czar .
The bill would also enable law enforcement agents to seize property from copyright infringers .
An earlier version of the bill would have allowed the content industry to collect damages for each track copied from a CD , but that provision was removed after coming under widespread criticism .
House approval of the Pro-IP
Act comes only a week after it received the unanimous blessing of the House Judiciary Committee , which is chaired by Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , the chief sponsor of the bill .
The Senate has yet to take up its version of the bill , which has languished in committee since being introduced last fall .
There is also some doubt as to whether President Bush would sign it in its current form , as the administration has expressed reservations about it .
Is it a good day in America ?
Is it a good time to be in this broke , disgraced , sexually bewildered country when the lumbering and lost state of Texas finally crawls , lurching and sputtering and blinking hard , into the 19th century as it finally , against its will , is forced by the courts to allow sex toys to be sold to adults , thus leaving only Alabama and a bit of Georgia to stare into the void of their own unused genitalia and scream in abject terror ?
Is it , furthermore , a better and brighter day for all Americakind when the lumbering and lost Federal Communications Commission still wants to fine ABC Television $ 1.4 million for showing a glimpse of a naked female butt on an episode of the now - defunct " NYPD Blue " five years ago , even though all the little kids who were ostensibly traumatized by said ass are now about 12 years old and into ultraviolent video games and hooking up on MySpace and choking each other to death , and the FCC 's move is not considered a distressing , dire prediction of oppressive things to come , but rather a forgettable trifle , a shrug , a silly little footnote ?
Is it not , finally , good to know that you now can , when in New York City , stroll into any number of bars or fine urban locales and grab yourself a free , official NYC condom or five , and also a nice packet of lubricant , all on the city 's dime ?
And what 's more , not only are they complimentary and available citywide , and not only is there an impressive accompanying ad campaign for the second year of the groundbreaking program ( TV , print , subway billboards , Web site ) hawking said latex fun-sheaths and encouraging you to " get some , " but the packaging is actually created by a semi- famous industrial designer ( Yves Béhar ) and the campaign itself actually is n't insulting or shy or demeaning as it dares to suggest that young adult Americans might actually enjoy sex and therefore , oh my God , would n't it be fun to get some today ?
The horror .
I am here to say yes , yes indeed , it is all quite good , refreshing , even a little promising , even if you do n't really notice , even if it all seems minor and insignificant , overshadowed by looming recessions and lost wars and the bleak , bleak , bleak BushCo End of Days .
See , there was a time , just a handful of miserable years ago , when it all felt dour and sad and pathetic , when John " anoint my feet in oil " Ashcroft ruled the porn - obsessed Justice Department and worthless abstinence education was being forced down the throat of the educational system and the fundamentalist Christians were stabbing at the culture like unhappy vultures tearing at a carcass .
It was a time when major media was eating its own tail in fear of getting fined for allowing the slightest illicit or sexually suggestive infraction , as Michael Powell 's Bush - controlled FCC went on the warpath , behaving like some sort of gnarled sexually uptight Megatron who hated women and never masturbated , desperate to crack down on the slightest naughty infraction , from Bono saying " f - " at the Golden Globes to Howard Stern talking dirty to porn stars for the benefit of his audience of overweight frat guys and lonely cab drivers .
It was quite a ride .
From Ashcroft covering the nipples of Lady Justice with heavy cloth to the massive , insane outcry against Janet Jackson , it all culminated in 2005 , in the Republican - controlled Congress ramming through the inane Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act , which increased tenfold the penalty the FCC could impose on broadcast media , to $ 325,000 per violation .
But now , oh , now how quaint it all seems , the Bush administration 's dark and sexually repressive cloud actually proving to be nothing but a sticky mist , a passing pink puff of rancid gas , so many of the fundie Christians / congressmen proving to be secretly gay and the nation itself proving very quickly to be rather sick of the entire gaggle of Jesus - terrified henchmen .
What 's more , the FCC 's ominous threats suddenly feel moot and meaningless , especially given the upsurge of shows like " The L - Word " and " Californication " and " Tell Me You Love Me " and who the hell cares if they can show nipples and butts on network TV ?
The landscape is changing , far faster and more powerfully than any hypocritical conservative movement could ever comprehend , much less contain .
The signs are in place .
The tone is shifting .
Despite a misogynistic Supreme Court , despite the Christian right 's desperate attempt to instill Taliban - grade prohibitions and constrictions around sex for the past seven years ( well , more like 2,000 years .
But that 's another column ) , Texans can now buy dildos to go with their Sunday sodomy , condoms and lube are free all over New York City , abstinence education has proven to be a massive failure and the flatulent bout of Christian - led sexual hysteria has , at least for the moment , largely passed .
Oh , there will still be blips and triggers .
There will still be Christian rock and " True Love Waits " and cute little Web sites extolling the virtues of teen virginity , of making nifty little pledges not to have sex until you 're married and / or no longer a Republican or no longer absolutely horrified at the notion of your own vulva .
And yes , broadcast media will remain terribly uptight for a while longer .
There will still be , for example , the producers of this year 's bland - as - death Grammy Awards , who actually asked Amy Winehouse to please cover up the nipples on the bare - breasted pinup girl she has tattooed on her arm because some Americans might be confused and offended .
( In response , Winehouse simply took some black eyeliner and drew a nice " bra " over the nipples , and middle America breathed a huge sigh of relief because oh my God , nipples .
Our great national scourge . )
What 's more , many issues remain volatile .
The gay marriage war , for example , is far from over , though it now seems the most difficult battle has been won .
The hull has been breached .
The rainbow - colored cat is very much out of the bag .
Wail as the fundamentalists might , the feeling now is that gay marriage — like women 's suffrage , like interracial marriage , like the notion of a black or female president — is no longer a matter of if , only when .
This is the feeling .
The straps are loosening .
The legs are parting .
The repressive sexual ideology of the right has , quite naturally , failed .
So please , America , go buy your dildos in Texas and grab your free condoms in NYC , safe in the knowledge that the temperature of the national body , once frigid and clenched , appears to be warming up .
Can you feel it ?
Wo n't you do the right thing , and " get some " yourself ?

The guards force was established after the Islamic revolution in 1979
The new measures target the finances of Iran 's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps and three state - owned banks .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the moves were part of " a comprehensive policy to confront the threatening behaviour of the Iranians " .
But Iran said the latest " hostile policies " were counter to international law , and accused the US of hypocrisy .
The US declared the Revolutionary Guards a " proliferator of weapons of mass destruction " , a reference to ballistic missiles they are allegedly developing , while their elite overseas operations arm , the Quds Force , was singled out as a " supporter of terrorism " .
The US has repeatedly accused Iran of destabilising Iraq and Afghanistan , blaming the Revolutionary Guards for supplying and training insurgents .
' Illicit activities '
Ms Rice accused Iran of a litany of abuses , including pursuing technologies " that can lead to a nuclear weapon " , building ballistic missiles , and spurning peace talks .
She said Iran was supporting militants in Iraq and " terrorists " in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories , and said Iran had threatened to destroy Israel .

US turns heat up on Iran Timeline : US - Iran relations Send us your comments
Under Executive Order 13382 , US authorities will be able to freeze the assets of , and prohibit any US citizen or organisation from doing business with the Revolutionary Guards .
Iran 's ministry of defence , which controls the country 's defence industry , three Iranian banks , and several companies owned by the Guards will also be designated .
The Revolutionary Guards corps has widespread business interests including car factories , newspapers and oil and gas fields .
" These actions will help to protect the international financial system from the illicit activities of the Iranian government , " Ms Rice said .
The British government said it " endorsed " the move , but it was condemned by Iran 's foreign ministry .
" The hostile policies of America against the respectful Iranian nation and our legal organisations are against international regulations and have no value , " the state broadcaster IRIB quoted a spokesman as saying .
" It is incongruent for a country who itself is a producer of weapons of mass destruction to take such a decision .
A country that has created and supported many terrorist groups cannot obstruct the course of development , progress and prosperity for the Iranian nation , " said Mohammad Ali Hosseini .
Ms Rice has reiterated a commitment to finding a diplomatic resolution to the crisis and has offered to meet " my Iranian counterpart any time , anywhere " - words that would be unimaginable coming from the lips of Vice - President Dick Cheney , says the BBC 's Justin Webb in Washington .
Mr Cheney is widely believed to be pressing for a military strike on Iran before the Bush administration 's term is over , our correspondent says .
If these sanctions have no effect , Ms Rice may well have to give way to those in and around the White House who believe the time for diplomacy is over , he says .
Limited designation
Last month the US Senate voted to designate the entire Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organisation , but Thursday 's announcement does not go that far .
The designation of " global terrorist group " is instead reserved for its foreign arm , the Quds Brigade , which has been accused by US officials of supplying powerful roadside bombs and rocket - propelled grenades to Shia militants in Iraq .
Thought to have 15,000 troops , it is responsible for conducting covert missions overseas and for forging relationships with other Shia groups .
" The Quds Force controls the policy for Iraq , " the top US military commander in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus , said earlier this month .
" There should be no confusion about that . "
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Neil Sims is standing on the deck of a 35 - foot feed boat off the coast of Kona , Hawaii , staring at a dorsal fin slicing through the calm morning sea below .
For the past hour we 've been snorkeling around the submersible cages owned by his aquaculture company , Kona Blue Water Farms .
The nets house nearly half a million fish , a species of yellowtail known as Kona Kampachi .
As we dawdled in the 200 - foot - deep water , three bottle - nosed dolphins played around us like schoolchildren at a zoo .
Now we 're watching a crew siphon food pellets into the cages .
But the dorsal fin has everyone distracted .
It does n't belong to a dolphin .
Sims has heard there 's been a hungry tiger shark hanging around at feeding time .
This leaves no doubt .
" Do you fellas have a boat hook ? " he asks in an Australian drawl that still runs thick after 18 years on the Big Island .
A boat hook - it should be defined for the nautically challenged - is little more than a curtain rod with a plastic " J " on the end .
It 's used mainly to grab a small buoy when docking .
There 's no sensible reason for Sims to want such a device now .
We 're half a mile from shore and 400 yards from our own vessel .
He arches an eyebrow in my direction .
" So , " he asks , " you wanna swim for it ? "
If ever there were a man who could stave off a man-eating shark with a curtain rod in a mad 400 - yard swim for safety , Sims would be the one .
It would n't even be the biggest problem he 's trying to single - handedly tackle today .
For example , the plight of the commercial fishing industry .
Let 's back up a bit .
Our oceans are being drained of food .
Doctors tell us to eat more fish ; it 's good for the brain and good for the heart .
We yearn for our weekly sushi fix .
And increasingly so do our friends in China , India , and elsewhere in the developing world .
To meet this growing appetite , commercial fishermen are scooping up everything that 's edible ( and a lot of what 's not ) .
Couple that trend with the effects of global warming , and the situation has become so dire that some scientists think seafood stocks will totally collapse by 2048 .
If that sounds sensationalistic , consider that the once - abundant cod off New England are already gone .
The same is happening on the West Coast .
King salmon off California and Oregon are at the lowest level in history ; there will probably be no fishing season this year .
Equally alarming , many of the tuna , swordfish , and other species high up on the food chain are so laden with mercury ( cast off mainly from coal - fired energy plants ) that eating them is dangerous for children and pregnant women .
Aquaculture would seem the answer , but it has its own problems .
Farmed fish - especially carnivorous finfish like salmon - tend to lack the flavor of their wild counterparts , can be lower in nutrients , and are often dyed to appear edible .
The farms themselves , being monocultures , can be havens for disease , so they are sometimes infused with prophylactic antibiotics .
Those chemicals and the concentration of feces make poorly monitored shoreline farms devastating to the environment .
Ravaged marine life
Sims has a better way .
He wants to satiate our appetites without poisoning us or the environment .
" We would have never been able to sustain our population if we had remained a hunter - gatherer society on land .
And I 'm not sure what makes people think we can remain that way in the ocean , " says the 49 - year - old marine biologist .
A former fisheries researcher in the Cook Islands , Sims was disgusted by how locals ravaged marine life there .
But the scene also inspired his idea for a new ( patents pending ) style of deepwater fish farming .
" We 're finding new ways not just to grow more fish - we 're trying to grow more fish better , " he says .
So just what is Kona Kampachi ?
Think of it as a more versatile cousin of hamachi .
It 's not genetically engineered in any way , just well bred .
It 's sashimi - grade and sustainably farmed without hormones or prophylactic antibiotics .
It 's richer in omega - 3 than just about anything else in the ocean and has no detectable mercury .
It melts on your tongue , holds up on the grill , and is so rich in oils that it 'll fry in a pan without butter .
Pregnant women , nursing moms , young children :
Eat as much as you want of what might just be the best - tasting fish you 've ever had .
Really .
It 's that good .
Kona
Blue calls its designer yellowtail the " fish of the future . "
In truth , it 's more like a fish of the past .
After all , sea life was n't always scarce or poisonous .
But the cultivation does involve scientific and technological advancements .
The most obvious example is the sea station .
Sims helped modify submersible pens to make them flippable and therefore more easily cleaned .
Every few weeks a net is raised , turned over , scrubbed , and dried in the Hawaiian sunshine .
The company also regularly takes water and seabed samples beneath the pens and at various control sites , records the process with webcams , and posts the data and video online .
Whenever I get the email from Amazon telling me that our monthly bill for web service usage is available , I take it as an excuse to spend a little while looking at our usage stats and how our storage needs have grown .
When I started working at 37signals in October of 2006 , we were using less than 1.5TB of disk space for customer data for all of our applications and were starting to get to the point where redundancy and backups were becoming a headache .
Shortly after I started , we decided to give S3 a trial run with Campfire and we became believers pretty quickly .
The fact that S3 is priced so reasonably ( our last bill was $ 2,004.12 ) and the fact that it ’s generally hassle free has enabled us to drastically increase the storage limits for all of our applications .
Not having to worry about managing the file servers and backups is a pretty nice bonus as well .
Here are some stats from last month , and from October 2007 to compare how things have changed over the past 6 months .
DIGG THIS
One hundred and forty - three years ago today , on 9 April , 1865 , Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to Union Commander Ulysses S. Grant , marking the effective end of the South ’s struggle for independence .
It was a fateful day for the South , and in particular for my great grandfather and his four elder brothers , all of whom were fighting for the Confederacy .
On that day , the eldest brother Joshua Lazarus Moses was killed a few hours after Lee , unbeknownst to the troops elsewhere , had surrendered .
Josh was commanding an artillery battalion ( Culpepper ’s Battery or Culpepper ’s Light Artillery ) that was firing the last shots in defense of Mobile , before being overrun by a Union force outnumbering his 13 to one .
In this battle , Fort Blakeley , one of his brothers , Horace , was captured , and another , Perry , was wounded .
Joshua had also been in the thick of the fighting in the War ’s opening battle , when Fort Sumter was attacked in April , 1861 .
Josh was the last Confederate Jew to fall in battle .
His first cousin , Albert Moses Luria , was the first , killed at age 19 at the Battle of Seven Pines ( Fair Oaks ) in Virginia on 31 May , 1862 .
While Lee was surrendering at Appomattox , a 2,500 - man unit attached to Sherman ’s army , known as Potter ’s Raiders , was heading towards my family ’s hometown of Sumter , South Carolina .
Sherman had just burned nearby Columbia , and it was feared that his troops were headed to Sumter to do the same .
My then 16 - year - old great grandfather , Andrew Jackson Moses , rode out to defend his hometown , along with some 157 other teenagers , invalids , old men , and the wounded from the local hospital .
It was a mission as hopeless as it was valiant , but Sumter ’s rag - tag defenders did manage to hold off Potter ’s battle - seasoned veterans for over an hour before being overwhelmed by this vastly superior force , outnumbering theirs by some 15 to one .
Jack got away with a price on his head , and Sumter was not burned after all .
But some buildings were , and there are documented instances of murder , rape , and arson by the Yankees .
The fifth bother , Isaac Harby Moses , having served with distinction in combat in Wade Hampton ’s cavalry , later rode home from North Carolina after the Battle of Bentonville ( North Carolina ) , the War ’s last major battle , where he commanded his company , all of the officers having been killed or wounded .
He never surrendered to anyone , his Mother proudly observed in her memoirs .
Earlier , as a member of a company of Citadel Cadets , he had his horse shot out from under him , and was attacked by a Union soldier wielding a sword .
He was among those who fired the very first shots of the conflict , when his cadet company opened up on the Union ship , Star of the West , which was attempting to resupply the besieged Fort Sumter in January , 1861 , three months before the War officially began .
Over two dozen members of the extended Moses family fought in the War , serving and working closely with such legendary generals as Robert E. Lee , James Longstreet , and Wade Hampton , and firing some of the first and last shots of the War in its opening and closing battles .
They fought on horseback and on ships , in the trenches and in the infantry .
They built fortifications , led their men in charges , and one had responsibility for provisioning an entire army corps of some 50,000 men .
The extended family sacrificed at least nine of its sons for The Cause .
Like their comrades - in - arms , the Moses ’ were fighting for their homeland — not for slavery , as is so often said , but for their families , homes , and country .
Put simply , most Confederate soldiers felt they were fighting because an invading army from the North was trying to kill them , burn their homes , and destroy their cities .
The hard - pressed Confederates were usually heavily outnumbered , outgunned , and out - supplied , but rarely outfought , showing amazing courage , skill , and valor .
The best known of the Moses family Confederates was Major Raphael Moses , General Longstreet ’s chief commissary officer , whose three sons also fought for the South .
Moses ended up attending the last meeting and carrying out the Last Order of the Confederate government .
He was ordered to deliver the last of the Confederate treasury , $ 40,000 in gold and silver bullion , to help feed and supply the defeated Confederate soldiers in nearby hospitals , and straggling home after the War — weary , hungry , often sick , shoeless and in tattered uniforms .
With the help of a small group of determined armed guards , Moses successfully carried out the order from President Jefferson Davis , despite repeated attempts by mobs to forcibly take the bullion .
The anniversary of this fateful day should serve to remind us what the brave and beleaguered Southern soldiers and civilians were up against .
Perhaps it will help people understand why , in this day when the South is so often vilified , native Southerners still revere their ancestors ’ courage , and continue rightfully to take much pride in this heritage .
The Best of Lewis Regenstein
The last time they had the chance to offend anyone was 2,700 years ago when they were wandering around ancient Egypt .
Since then the mummies have led a blameless existence , spending the last 120 years in a museum where countless thousands of visitors have managed to see them without anyone becoming in the least bit upset .
Not any longer , it appears .
BEFORE : Asru , a 2,700 - year - old chantress with Egyptologist Rosalie David
AFTER : Bob Partridge , chairman of the Manchester Ancient Egypt Society , has described the decision to cover up the mummies as ' Incomprehensible '
Complaints have led to the naked remains of Asru , a chantress at the Temple of Amun in Karnak , plus the partially - wrapped male Khary and a child mummy , all being covered in shrouds to protect their modesty .
The decision , which has prompted wholesale derision , came after Manchester Museum said it had received ' feedback ' from the public saying it was ' insensitive to display unwrapped mummies ' .
Having ordered the cover up , managers claim they are following Government policy and are carrying out a public consultation .
Last night the museum , whose Egyptian department has a worldwide reputation , was accused of being ridiculous and told it risked becoming a ' laughing stock ' .
Naked truth : Mummies at Manchester Museum are being covered up after visitors complained about them being displayed ' naked '
Bob Partridge , chairman of the Manchester Ancient Egypt Society , said the cover - up was ' absolutely incomprehensible ' .
' The mummies have always been sensitively displayed and have been educational and informative to generations of visitors .
" We are shocked this has been done in advance of any results from the public . "
Josh Lennon , a museum visitor , said : " This is preposterous .
Surely people realise that if they go to see Egyptian remains some of them may not be dressed in their best bib and tucker .
" The museum response to complaints is pure Monty Python - they have now covered them from head to foot rendering the exhibition a non-exhibition .
It is hilarious . "
Manchester Museum has several mummies - embalmed bodies tightly wrapped in cotton bandages - and is home to one of the most important collections in Britain .
George Mutter , a professor at Harvard medical school in the U.S. said : " For decades the Manchester Museum has been a leader in the scientific study of human mummies .
" The decision to hide the mummies from view is a step backwards . "
He added : " In the interest of inclusiveness , the museum has become a playground for those who do not understand the subject at hand , nor respect the interests of scientists and public alike . "
But the museum 's Nick Merriman said : " We get a stream of feedback saying it is insensitive to display unwrapped mummies .
" We are trying to follow Government guidelines about how they should be displayed with respect and sensitivity . "
< p>If the public wanted the mummies unwrapped , the museum would take that " very seriously ' , " he added .

Described in 1971 , made in 2008 : ' memristors ' promise a computer revolution .
Old school : classical resistors are now joined by nanoscopic counterparts .
PUNCHSTOCK
High - school physics students grappling with the delights of capacitors , inductors and resistors will be groaning into their exercise books .
Electronics experts in California have finally succeeded in proving the existence of a fourth fundamental unit of electronic circuits : the ' memristor ' .
The existence of the memristor , short for ' memory resistor ' , was first suggested in 1971 , but only now have researchers succeeded in creating a real , working example .
They hope that the new components could revolutionize computing , promising an end to frustrating waits for your computer to boot up .
" A memristor is essentially a resistor with memory , " explains Stan Williams of HP Labs in Palo Alto , California , who reports the memristor 's creation in this week 's Nature1 .
" The actual resistance of the memristor changes depending on the amount of voltage and the time for which that voltage has been applied to the device . "
That means that a computer created from memristive circuits can ' remember ' what has happened to it previously , and freeze that memory when the circuit is turned off .
This quality could allow computers to turn off and on again in an instant , as all the components could revert to their last state instantly , rather than having to ' boot up ' .
Size problems
Williams and his colleagues created a memristor while experimenting with very tiny circuits .
They sandwiched a nanoscopic film of a semiconductor ( titanium dioxide ) between two slivers of metal ( platinum ) .
Those are standard materials ; the trick is to make the component just 5 nanometres wide — about 10,000 times thinner than a human hair .
It 's only at the nanoscale that the behaviour of memristors begins to be detectable , Williams says .
Any larger and they behave just like ordinary resistors , where resistance is equal to the voltage divided by the current .
Electronics were originally developed at a scale far too large to see these effects and only recently have researchers been able to work at that scale .
That 's probably one reason why the idea has mouldered on the shelf for 37 years , suggests Leon Chua , the electrical engineer at the University of California , Berkeley , who first postulated the existence of memristors in a 1971 paper2 .
Six years after reading Chua 's 1971 work , Williams and his team managed to make the tiny device .
The scale of the project was not the only challenge .
The mathematics underlying the principle were not simple , says Williams .
" The original prediction and the papers in which the prediction appeared were very heavy mathematically , so it required a very significant investment in order to read those papers , " he says .
Chua , somewhat modestly , disagrees , and thinks the idea may have struggled to find its feet simply because it is so weird .
" It 's not really that difficult — it is more that it is sort of heretical .
Nobody would believe this was the case because it sounds unnatural in some sense . "
Volatile discovery
Chua says that he is pleased that his theory has finally been proved .
" I was very excited — I never thought I would live to see this happen . "
Now that his calculations have been vindicated , he thinks that memristors will be a big deal .
They should be crucial in developing ' non-volatile ' memory — the type that does n't decay when the power is switched off .
Most computers use ' volatile memory ' to perform their running functions , because this offers faster access to data than the non-volatile memory used to store data on hard disks and flash devices such as iPods .
Building computers with memristors might allow a full switch to non-volatile memory , doing away with power - sapping ' running memory ' and allowing devices to consume far less power when operating .
" Someday I imagine that you wo n't have to charge your cellphone or your laptop so often , " says Chua .
But what of the poor high - school students who now have more to learn in their electronics classes ?
" I believe this is going to be in textbooks in the near future , " Chua says .
He says that the rounding out of his theory and creation of an actual memristor should make the concept easier to grasp than it was when he first proposed it .
Struggling students might be more , shall we say , resistant to progress .
Cool Tech of the Week : Solar Water Lilies
May 17th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Aesthetic .
Original .
Functional .
Who knew solar panels could make a statement ?
Apparently Peter Richardson knew when he submitted a winning solar design to the International Design Awards .
His idea is to turn disused water ways into functional space by populating them with solar panels shaped like water lilies .
Aiming to increase quality of life , while generating energy , the lilies so impressed the Glasgow City Council that they expressed interest in developing a pilot project .
The technology itself is easily within reach :
“ They can be moved and dismantled and are simply tethered to the river bed , integrated motors can rotate the discs so their orientation to the sun is maximised throughout the day . ” ( Project Description )
In other words , no new technology required , just some clever design .
My concern would be recreational or commercial river traffic ( how “ disused ” must the waterway be ? ) .
Would waves from wake disrupt the solar lilies ?
What about an impact on wildlife or wildlife ’s impact on the panels ?
What if the river ices over in the winter ?
One hopes a pilot project would figure out the kinks .
What do readers think – would a product like this in your local water way make an impact on your community ?

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
In a way , Dr. Flier noted , the discovery is a sort of back - to - the - future moment .
There was a time a few decades ago , before the current interest in how the brain regulates how much is eaten , when obesity researchers spent all their time studying and discussing fat cells .
Investigators discovered that fat people had more fat cells than thin people and that fat cells shrank with weight loss and bulged with weight gain .
Dr. Jules Hirsch of Rockefeller University in New York , who did many of the initial studies with humans , said he started because he could not understand why people who lost weight regained .
“ They should have been cured , ” Dr. Hirsch said .
After all , he said , if you cut out a fatty tumor , the fat does not grow back .
Why was fat lost from dieting different ?
The result was the fat cell hypothesis , a notion that obsessed researchers .
Fat cells , the hypothesis said , are laid down early in life and after that , they can change only in size , not in number .
When people lose weight and their fat cells shrink , that creates a signal to fill the cells again , making people regain .
“ We did n’t know a lot about obesity , so that was what we talked about , ” Dr. Flier said .
But the discussions stalled .
It was not clear what to do about those discoveries or what they meant to efforts to help people lose weight .
And no one had a method to ask whether fat cells were being created and destroyed during life .
Few even thought to ask that question .
That changed only recently when the new paper ’s first author , Kirsty L. Spalding , a neurobiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , developed a way to ask whether new cells grow in the cortical and cerebellum regions of the human brain .
She found no new cells there since birth .
One day , she was giving a talk on her brain study when a scientist in the audience , Erik Arner , suggested she use the method to look at fat cells .
( Dr. Arner is the second author of Dr. Spalding ’s paper . )
The method for dating human cells takes advantage of an effect caused by above - ground nuclear bomb testing that took place from 1955 to 1963 .
When the bombs were tested , their radioactivity created a spike in the amount of a carbon isotope , C14 , in the atmosphere .
The C14 made its way into plants and animals that ate the plants .
When people ate those plants and meat from the animals , the C14 was incorporated into their human DNA .
After the nuclear test ban , C14 levels started to drop .
The result is that every cell has a C14 level that reflects the level in the atmosphere at the time the cell was born .
“ Each cell is a time capsule of sorts , ” Dr. Spalding said .
First the researchers confirmed that the number of fat cells remained constant in adults .
Obese people who had weight loss surgery had as many fat cells two years after the surgery as before it , even though they were much thinner .

Text description provided by the architects .
After 4 years the Beijing Airport - currently the biggest one in the world - is finished , just in time for the 2008 Olympics .
The airport , designed by Foster +
Partners , turned out to be a very efficient building in terms of in terms of operational efficiency , passenger comfort , sustainability and access to natural light .
As an interpretation of traditional chinese culture the roof of the airport has a dragon - like form .
According to Norman Foster this is a building borne of its context .
It communicates a uniquely Chinese sense of place and will be a true gateway to the nation .
This is expressed in its dragon - like form and the drama of the soaring roof that is a blaze of ‘ traditional ’
Chinese colours – imperial reds merge into golden yellows .
As you proceed along the central axis , view of the red columns stretching ahead into the far distance evokes images of a Chinese temple .
Project description
Located between the existing eastern runway and the future third runway , Terminal 3 and the Ground Transportation Centre ( GTC ) together enclose a floor area of approximately 1.3 million m2 , mostly under one roof .
The first building to break the one million square meter barrier , it will accommodate an estimated 50 million passengers per annum by 2020 .
Although conceived on an unprecedented scale , the building ’s design aims to resolve the complexities of modern air travel , combining spatial clarity with high service standards .
It will be friendly and uplifting for the passenger as well as easy to navigate .
Comprising three connected , light - filled volumes – T3A , B and C – the simple , symmetrical diagram fans out at either end to accommodate the arrivals and departure halls for T3A ( processing terminal and domestic gates ) and T3B ( international gates ) .
The satellite T3C ( domestic gates ) occupies the centre of the diagram .
This arrangement is an efficient means of maximising the perimeter , so increasing the capacity for aircraft stands , while maintaining a highly compact and sustainable footprint .
Although the length from north to south is three and a quarter kilometres , the visual links between the three elements are maintained by strong sight lines as well as visual connections between the lower level and an open mezzanine level above .
All spaces are naturally lit and the generous glazing and skylights maintain a link with the outside and its changing sky .
Views along the central axis are marked by the distinctive red columns , which continue along the external edges of the building into the distance , evocative of traditional Chinese temples .
The embracing curved cantilever of the terminal greets passengers arriving by road or from the GTC in a single welcoming gesture .
Departures and arrivals are on separate levels .
The traditional airport diagram has been inverted at T3B , with arrivals on the upper level , to allow visitors to Beijing to experience the thrill of this dramatic space from the best vantage point .
The single unifying roof canopy is perforated with skylights to aid orientation and bring daylight deep into the building .
The colour palette moves through 16 tones from red at the entrance at T3A through to orange and finally yellow at the far end of T3B .
This establishes a subtle zoning system that breaks down the scale of the building and enables easy wayfinding .
This palette is also applied north to south in the ceiling above the arrivals and departures halls , heightening the sense of curvature in the roof plane .
Connections between T3A and T3B take place on a high speed automated people mover ( APM ) which travels at up to 80 kph , with a journey time of just two minutes .
The APM is easily accessed from the main departure level and set within a landscaped ‘ green ’ cutting , exposed to daylight and views up and through the building , all of which helps to maintain a sense of orientation .
The roof is a steel space frame with triangular roof lights and coloured metal decking .
It curves , rising at the midpoint to create a dramatic central cathedral - like space , and tapering towards the edges of the building to provide more intimate areas as passengers travel towards the gates and the aircraft piers .
The trusses that support the glazing echo the changing colour system in the roof – shifting from red to orange to yellow .
The high transparency of the curtain walling is made possible by extra large mullions , which are generously spaced to allow larger spans of suspended glazing .
The terminal building is one of the world ’s most sustainable , incorporating a range of passive environmental design concepts , such as the south - east orientated skylights , which maximise heat gain from the early morning sun , and an integrated environment - control system that minimises energy consumption .
Rather than the sprawl of many separate buildings , it uses less land by bringing everything closer together for ease of communication in one efficient structure , yet it is still 17 % bigger than the combined floorspace of all of Heathrow ’s terminals 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and the new Terminal 5 .
In construction terms , its design optimised the performance of materials selected on the basis of local availability , functionality , application of local skills , and low cost procurement .

THE TORTURE MEMO … .
The infamous John
Yoo torture memo has finally been released , and it ’s pretty remarkable .
( Part 1 ; Part 2 . )
Basically , it says that criminal law does n’t prohibit torture because it does n’t apply to the military .
Treaties do n’t prohibit torture because they only apply to uniformed enemy soldiers .
Ditto for the War Crimes Act .
And federal statutes prohibiting torture do n’t prohibit torture because they do n’t apply to conduct on military bases .
We already pretty much knew that this was what the memo said .
But Yoo does n’t stop there .
Not only do none of these things apply , but there ’s no way to make them apply even if we wanted to :
Any effort by Congress to regulate the interrogation of enemy combatants would violate the Constitution ’s sole vesting of the Commander - in - Chief authority in the President … .
Congress can no more interfere with the President ’s conduct of the interrogation of enemy combatants than it can dictate strategic or tactical decisions on the battlefield .
And the Convention Against Torture ?
If the president orders someone to be tortured , that automatically suspends CAT :
Any presidential decision to order interrogations methods that are inconsistent with CAT would amount to a suspension or termination of those treaty provisions .
And this :
If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition , he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network .
In that case , we believe that he could argue that the executive branch ’s constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions .
So that ’s that .
Basically , the president can authorize any action at all as commander - in - chief in wartime .
Congress can’t bind him , treaties can’t bind him , and the courts ca n’t bind him .
The scope of power the memos suggest is , almost literally , absolute .
And since this is a war without end , the grant of power is also without end .
As we all know , this memo was eventually rescinded .
So in a sense it ’s moot .
But Marty Lederman asks a good question : now that we know what was in the memo , what justification was there for classifying it in the first place ?
It would n’t have been moot in 2003 , and there was nothing in it that compromised national security either then or now .
The only thing it compromised was the president ’s desire not to have to defend his own policies — policies that led directly to the abuses at Abu Ghraib , among others .

What Inflation Is
No subject is so much discussed today — or so little understood — as inflation .
The politicians in Washington talk of it as if it were some horrible visitation from without , over which they had no control — like a flood , a foreign invasion , or a plague .
It is something they are always promising to " fight " — if Congress or the people will only give them the " weapons " or " a strong law " to do the job .
Yet the plain truth is that our political leaders have brought on inflation by their own money and fiscal policies .
They are promising to fight with their right hand the conditions brought on with their left .
Inflation , always and everywhere , is primarily caused by an increase in the supply of money and credit .
In fact , inflation is the increase in the supply of money and credit .
If you turn to the American College Dictionary , for example , you will find the first definition of inflation given as follows :
Undue expansion or increase of the currency of a country , especially by the issuing of paper money not redeemable in specie .
In recent years , however , the term has come to be used in a radically different sense .
This is recognized in the second definition given by the American College Dictionary :
A substantial rise of prices caused by an undue expansion in paper money or bank credit .
Now obviously a rise of prices caused by an expansion of the money supply is not the same thing as the expansion of the money supply itself .
A cause or condition is clearly not identical with one of its consequences .
The use of the word " inflation " with these two quite different meanings leads to endless confusion .
The word " inflation " originally applied solely to the quantity of money .
It meant that the volume of money was inflated , blown up , overextended .
It is not mere pedantry to insist that the word should be used only in its original meaning .
To use it to mean " a rise in prices " is to deflect attention away from the real cause of inflation and the real cure for it .
Let us see what happens under inflation , and why it happens .
When the supply of money is increased , people have more money to offer for goods .
If the supply of goods does not increase — or does not increase as much as the supply of money — then the prices of goods will go up .
Each individual dollar becomes less valuable because there are more dollars .
Therefore more of them will be offered against , say , a pair of shoes or a hundred bushels of wheat than before .
A " price " is an exchange ratio between a dollar and a unit of goods .
When people have more dollars , they value each dollar less .
Goods then rise in price , not because goods are scarcer than before , but because dollars are more abundant .
In the old days , governments inflated by clipping and debasing the coinage .
Then they found they could inflate cheaper and faster simply by grinding out paper money on a printing press .
This is what happened with the French assignats in 1789 , and with our own currency during the Revolutionary War .
Today the method is a little more indirect .
Our government sells its bonds or other IOUs to the banks .
In payment , the banks create " deposits " on their books against which the government can draw .
A bank in turn may sell its government IOUs to the Federal Reserve Bank , which pays for them either by creating a deposit credit or having more Federal Reserve notes printed and paying them out .
This is how money is manufactured .
The greater part of the " money supply " of this country is represented not by hand - to - hand currency but by bank deposits which are drawn against by checks .
Hence when most economists measure our money supply they add demand deposits ( and now frequently , also , time deposits ) to currency outside of banks to get the total .
The total of money and credit so measured was $ 63.3 billion at the end of December 1939 , and $ 308.8 billion at the end of December 1963 .
This increase of 388 % in the supply of money is overwhelmingly the reason why wholesale prices rose 138 % in the same period .
Some Qualifications
It is often argued that to attribute inflation solely to an increase in the volume of money is " oversimplification . "
This is true .
Many qualifications have to be kept in mind .
For example , the " money supply " must be thought of as including not only the supply of hand - to - hand currency , but the supply of bank credit — especially in the United States , where most payments are made by check .
It is also an oversimplification to say that the value of an individual dollar depends simply on the present supply of dollars outstanding .
It depends also on the expected future supply of dollars .
If most people fear , for example , that the supply of dollars is going to be even greater a year from now than at present , then the present value of the dollar ( as measured by its purchasing power ) will be lower than the present quantity of dollars would otherwise warrant .
The politicians in Washington talk of inflation as if it were some horrible visitation from without , over which they had no control …
Again , the value of any monetary unit , such as the dollar , depends not merely on the quantity of dollars but on their quality .
When a country goes off the gold standard , for example , it means in effect that gold , or the right to get gold , has suddenly turned into mere paper .
The value of the monetary unit therefore usually falls immediately , even if there has not yet been any increase in the quantity of money .
This is because the people have more faith in gold than they have in the promises or judgment of the government 's monetary managers .
There is hardly a case on record , in fact , in which departure from the gold standard has not soon been followed by a further increase in bank credit and in printing - press money .
In short , the value of money varies for basically the same reasons as the value of any commodity .
Just as the value of a bushel of wheat depends not only on the total present supply of wheat but on the expected future supply and on the quality of the wheat , so the value of a dollar depends on a similar variety of considerations .
The value of money , like the value of goods , is not determined by merely mechanical or physical relationships , but primarily by psychological factors which may often be complicated .
In dealing with the causes and cure of inflation , it is one thing to keep in mind real complications ; it is quite another to be confused or misled by needless or nonexistent complications .
For example , it is frequently said that the value of the dollar depends not merely on the quantity of dollars but on their " velocity of circulation . "
Increased " velocity of circulation , " however , is not a cause of a further fall in the value of the dollar ; it is itself one of the consequences of the fear that the value of the dollar is going to fall ( or , to put it the other way round , of the belief that the price of goods is going to rise ) .
It is this belief that makes people more eager to exchange dollars for goods .
The emphasis by some writers on " velocity of circulation " is just another example of the error of substituting dubious mechanical for real psychological reasons .
Another blind alley : in answer to those who point out that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in money and credit , it is contended that the increase in commodity prices often occurs before the increase in the money supply .
This is true .
This is what happened immediately after the outbreak of war in Korea .
Strategic raw materials began to go up in price on the fear that they were going to be scarce .
Speculators and manufacturers began to buy them to hold for profit or protective inventories .
But to do this they had to borrow more money from the banks .
The rise in prices was accompanied by an equally marked rise in bank loans and deposits .
From May 31 , 1950 to May 30 , 1951 , the loans of the country 's banks increased by $ 12 billion .
If these increased loans had not been made , and new money ( some $ 6 billion by the end of January 1951 ) had not been issued against the loans , the rise in prices could not have been sustained .
The price rise was made possible , in short , only by an increased supply of money .
Some Popular Fallacies
One of the most stubborn fallacies about inflation is the assumption that it is caused , not by an increase in the quantity of money , but by a " shortage of goods . "
It is true that a rise in prices ( which , as we have seen , should not be identified with inflation ) can be caused either by an increase in the quantity of money or by a shortage of goods — or partly by both .
Wheat , for example , may rise in price either because there is an increase in the supply of money or a failure of the wheat crop .
But we seldom find , even in conditions of total war , a general rise of prices caused by a general shortage of goods .
Yet so stubborn is the fallacy that inflation is caused by a " shortage of goods , " that even in the Germany of 1923 , after prices had soared hundreds of billions of times , high officials and millions of Germans were blaming the whole thing on a general " shortage of goods " — at the very moment when foreigners were coming in and buying German goods with gold or their own currencies at prices lower than those of equivalent goods at home .
To use the word inflation to mean " a rise in prices " is to deflect attention away from the real cause of inflation and the real cure for it .
The rise of prices in the United States since 1939 is constantly being attributed to a " shortage of goods . "
Yet official statistics show that our rate of industrial production in 1959 was 177 % higher than in 1939 , or nearly three times as great .
Nor is it any better explanation to say that the rise in prices in wartime is caused by a shortage in civilian goods .
Even to the extent that civilian goods were really short in time of war , the shortage would not cause any substantial rise in prices if taxes took away as large a percentage of civilian income as rearmament took away of civilian goods .
This brings us to another source of confusion .
People frequently talk as if a budget deficit were in itself both a necessary and a sufficient cause of inflation .
A budget deficit , however , if fully financed by the sale of government bonds paid for out of real savings , need not cause inflation .
And even a budget surplus , on the other hand , is not an assurance against inflation .
This was shown in the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1951 , when there was substantial inflation in spite of a budget surplus of $ 3.5 billion .
The same thing happened in spite of budget surpluses in the fiscal years 1956 and 1957 .
A budget deficit , in short , is inflationary only to the extent that it causes an increase in the money supply .
And inflation can occur even with a budget surplus if there is an increase in the money supply notwithstanding .
The same chain of causation applies to all the so - called " inflationary pressures " — particularly the so - called " wage price spiral . "
If it were not preceded , accompanied , or quickly followed by an increase in the supply of money , an increase in wages above the " equilibrium level " would not cause inflation ; it would merely cause unemployment .
And an increase in prices without an increase of cash in people 's pockets would merely cause a falling off in sales .
Wage and price rises , in brief , are usually a consequence of inflation .
They can cause it only to the extent that they force an increase in the money supply .
The Cure for Inflation
The cure for inflation , like most cures , consists chiefly in removal of the cause .
The cause of inflation is the increase of money and credit .
The cure is to stop increasing money and credit .
The cure for inflation , in brief , is to stop inflating .
It is as simple as that .
Although simple in principle , this cure often involves complex and disagreeable decisions on detail .
Let us begin with the federal budget .
It is next to impossible to avoid inflation with a continuing heavy deficit .
That deficit is almost certain to be financed by inflationary means — i.e. , by directly or indirectly printing more money .
Huge government expenditures are not in themselves inflationary — provided they are made wholly out of tax receipts , or out of borrowing paid for wholly out of real savings .
But the difficulties in either of these methods of payment , once expenditures have passed a certain point , are so great that there is almost inevitably a resort to the printing press .
Moreover , although huge expenditures wholly met out of huge taxes are not necessarily inflationary , they inevitably reduce and disrupt production , and undermine any free - enterprise system .
The remedy for huge governmental expenditures is therefore not equally huge taxes , but a halt to reckless spending .
On the monetary side , the Treasury and the Federal Reserve System must stop creating artificially cheap money — i.e. , they must stop arbitrarily holding down interest rates .
The Federal Reserve must not return to the former policy of buying at par the government 's own bonds .
When interest rates are held artificially low , they encourage an increase in borrowing .
This leads to an increase in the money and credit supply .
The process works both ways — for it is necessary to increase the money and credit supply in order to keep interest rates artificially low .
That is why a " cheap money " policy and a government - bond - support policy are simply two ways of describing the same thing .
When the Federal Reserve Banks bought the government 's 2½ % bonds , say , at par , they held down the basic long - term interest rate to 2 percent .
And they paid for these bonds , in effect , by printing more money .
This is what is known as " monetizing " the public debt .
Inflation goes on as long as this goes on .
The Federal Reserve System , if it is determined to halt inflation and to live up to its responsibilities , will abstain from efforts to hold down interest rates and to monetize the public debt .
It should return , in fact , to the tradition that the discount rate of the central bank should normally ( and above all in an inflationary period ) be a " penalty " rate — i.e. , a rate higher than the member banks themselves get on their loans .
I should like to state here my conviction that the world will never work itself out of the present inflationary era until it returns to the gold standard .
The gold standard provided a practically automatic check on internal credit expansion .
That is why the bureaucrats abandoned it .
In addition to its being a safeguard against inflation , it is the only system that has ever provided the world with the equivalent of an international currency .
The first question to be asked today is not how can we stop inflation , but do we really want to ?
For one of the effects of inflation is to bring about a redistribution of wealth and income .
In its early stages ( until it reaches the point where it grossly distorts and undermines production itself ) it benefits some groups at the expense of others .
The first groups acquire a vested interest in maintaining inflation .
Too many of us continue under the delusion that we can beat the game — that we can increase our own incomes faster than our living costs .
So there is a great deal of hypocrisy in the outcry against inflation .
Many of us are shouting in effect , " Hold down everybody 's price and income except my own . "
Governments are the worst offenders in this hypocrisy .
At the same time as they profess to be " fighting inflation " they follow a so - called " full employment " policy .
As one advocate of inflation once put it in the London Economist , " Inflation is nine - tenths of any full employment policy . "
What he forgot to add is that inflation must always end in a crisis and a slump , and that worse than the slump itself may be the public delusion that the slump has been caused , not by the previous inflation , but by the inherent defects of " capitalism . "
Inflation , to sum up , is the increase in the volume of money and bank credit in relation to the volume of goods .
It is harmful because it depreciates the value of the monetary unit , raises everybody 's cost of living , imposes what is in effect a tax on the poorest ( without exemptions ) at as high a rate as the tax on the richest , wipes out the value of past savings , discourages future savings , redistributes wealth and income wantonly , encourages and rewards speculation and gambling at the expense of thrift and work , undermines confidence in the justice of a free enterprise system , and corrupts public and private morals .
But it is never " inevitable . "
We can always stop it overnight , if we have the sincere will to do so .

Shane MacGowan traded insults with Kirsty MacColl in the song
The edited version
The words " slut " and " faggot " had been dubbed out from the 20 - year - old festive hit by station executives .
But after a day of criticism from listeners , the band , and the mother of singer Kirsty MacColl , they changed their minds .
Controller Andy Parfitt said the original decision was " wrong " .
The BBC had said that an edited version would be played because " some members of the audience might find it offensive " .
' Creative freedom '
But sister station Radio 2 said it would play the track uncut , and Mr Parfitt subsequently said that after " careful consideration " , the ban on the uncut version of the song would be lifted .
Kirsty MacColl died 13 years after the track 's release
" It is not always easy to get this right , mindful of our responsibility to our young audience .
The unedited version will be played from now on .
" While we would never condone prejudice of any kind , we know our audiences are smart enough to distinguish between maliciousness and creative freedom .
In the context of this song , I do not feel that there is any negative intent behind the use of the words , hence the reversal of the decision . "
He told BBC News 24 the decision to edit the song had been made " some months ago " as part of a review of older records played on the station .
MacColl , who was killed by a speedboat off the coast of Mexico in 2000 , brands Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan " you scumbag , you maggot , you cheap lousy faggot " in the song , which reached number two when it was first released .
She continues : " Happy Christmas your arse , I pray God it 's our last . "
Another line , where MacGowan calls MacColl " an old slut on junk " , was also edited .
' These are characters '
Jean MacColl told BBC Radio 5 Live 's Breakfast : " These are a couple of characters - not in the first flush of youth , I would have thought .
" This is the way they spoke .
Today we have a lot of a gratuitous vulgarity and whatever from people all over which I think is quite unnecessary .
HAVE YOUR SAY No !
It 's a cracking tune about two people having a blazing row at Christmas .
They 're meant to be offending each other !

A spokesman for the Pogues , who first formed in 1982 and reunited in 2001 after a five - year break , said they " found it amusing that a song that has been one of the best - loved Christmas tunes should suddenly have been deemed offensive " .
Radio 1 listeners also criticised the ban on Newsbeat 's website .
However , veteran gay rights activist Peter Tatchell said Radio 1's original actions were right .
" The word faggot is being sung as an insult , alongside scumbag and maggot .
In this abusive context it is unacceptable , " he said .

A fleet of airplanes carrying 364 tons of food for humanitarian help took off on Sunday from Venezuela to Haiti .
President Hugo Chavez said the shipment is to help relieve the crisis in Haiti that has plagued the country for the last nine days .
Since last week , Haiti has been the scene of disturbance due to a sharp hike in food prices .
The situation has also led to many deaths , including a 36 - year old Nigerian soldier from the UN peace - keeping forces attempting to stabilize the situation in Haiti .
The humanitarian aid from Venezuela includes tons of meat , chicken , ham , milk , vegetables , olive oil and lentils , according to President Chavez .
The commander - in - chief of Venezuela assured that the humanitarian gesture would be accompanied by strong security .

I hardly ever post an entire writing from another blog , but this one is so important I ca n’t help it – this is too important .
Please show some love to Villager , publisher of Electronic Village ( and the Black Blog rankings , by visiting one of the links in this sentence .
Or click here to visit the post at his site .
We ’ve discussed Dunbar Village here for months .
That includes participating in the Afrospear ’s Day of Blogging for Justice : Protecting Black Women and their families from rape .
Villager is right on and I support his effort here .
As a member of the NAACP I am deeply disturbed by their response .
Important nubian women in my life , such as my former wife , my mom and my sisters often tell me that I have a ‘ hard head ’ .
Usually , this is a result of me being slow on the uptake for an issue that they see clearly from the start .
The impact of the Dunbar Village gang - rape may be yet another example of me … and perhaps other brothers … having a ‘ hard head ’ .
You see , the issues surrounding the Dunbar Village gang - rape that occurred last year continue to burn hot in our community … especially with Black women .
Many
Black women look at the way that the Dunbar Village situation has been handled as an example of the way Black women are treated in too many situations from Corporate America to our neighborhoods .
Villagers remember the horrific story of ten youths that forced their way into a Black woman ’s home in Dunbar Village housing complex down in Florida .
For several hours , they not only gang - raped her repeatedly and viciously beat her young son , but they forced her to have sex with her own child .
The teenage boys then placed the two of them in a bathtub and poured nail polish remover in her son ’s eyes , blinding him for a period of time .
They attempted to set them on fire , but could n’t find a match .
So instead , they violated them with ammonia and threatened to kill her family if she told anyone .
Only fo ur of the suspects have been apprehended , there are six others on the loose .
There is conclusive DNA evidence on at least one of the boys .
There is no manhunt for the rest of the criminals , they are running around loose as you read this .
In November 2007 , Al Sharpton showed that he had a ‘ hard head ’ about this case as well .
He was called on the carpet by a number of people concerned that he was not supporting the young woman and her son who had been victimized in this case .
In fact , I went so far as to call Al Sharpton a ‘ punk ’ last month on this blog .
Fast forward to today .
It seems that the NAACP and Al Sharpton ’s National Action Network ( NAN ) both refused to help this woman because it was ‘ outside the scope of their mission ‘ … however , both groups found time to send lawyers down to Florida IN SUPPORT OF THE RAPISTS .
The lawyers are claiming that it is ‘ unfair ’ to not offer bail to these four rapists .
Barack Obama spoke on the rage that exists in Black America when it comes to race relations .
That rage burns especially strong when sexual crimes are committed against Black women and children … even if the criminals involved are Black !
I encourage all like - minded villagers to join in collective action against the NAACP and Al Sharpton ’s NAN as a result of their misguided criminal advocacy in the Dunbar Village case .
Perhaps it is time for right - thinking villagers to stop fueling the NAACP and NAN with our money and our volunteer activism until they stop trying to hinder the successful prosecution of this heinous crime down in Dunbar Village .
Perhaps it is time to ensure that the safety of Black women and children are non-neg otiable .
Here are some specific steps you can take :
Share this post with others so they might have their conscience and concern raised as yours as been today .
Demand an explanation from your local NAACP and NAN chapter about the Dunbar Village case .
Cancel your membership to these organizations
Write a letter explaining that you will return when they prioritize the public safety needs of Black women and children .
Stop donating your time or money to these organizations ; instead invest in other organizations that take the lives of Black women and children seriously .
Even if you do not belong to these organizations , call or write them to express your displeasure :
NAACP National Headquarters
4805 Mt. Hope Drive
Baltimore MD 21215
( 410 ) 580-5777 National Action Network
Rev. Al Sharpton
106 W. 145th Street
Harlem , New York 10039
( 212 ) 690-3070
You can obtain more information about the direct action against NAACP and NAN from the Dunbar Village blog ( BBR # 494 ) .
I am interested to hear your take on the Dunbar Village case .
Are you willing to take direct action yourself to protect our Black woman and children ?
While talking about possible VP's on Meet the Press , Lady MacCheney praises her ex-boss by having the audacity to say Dick Cheney is brilliant because he overstepped his authority and turned the VP 's office into a Co - Presidency .
Something that has hurt this country badly and led to the leaking of a CIA agent 's name to the press which got Scooter Libby convicted of multiple felonies .
And then she delves into freeper land with this one :

Is Condi Rice ?
You know Condi Rice , people do n't know about Dr. Rice , is that she weighed in on every domestic issue before the President Russert :
Well would n't that be third term Bush .
Yea ...
You know , people are not , people are sick of this Bush bashing stuff .
It 's good to know that Condi had a hand in the terrible economy Americans are faced with .
No Lady MacCheney , I 'd say at 28 % , people ARE sick of Bush , but not the much deserved criticism he receives .
Americans are sick of the way their lives are going under Bush 's presidency .
They are sick of Iraq , torture , no health care , gas prices , etc ...
According to a recent media report , whoever wants to get a replacement for the fourth generation iPad is now going to receive a more powerful iPad Air 2 instead .
This replacement is available at any Apple Store or other authorized service providers throughout the US .
Why Is This Happening ?
Apple took the decision to do so because they discovered that there is no stock left for the aging fourth generation iPad , as 9to5 Mac reported last Saturday .
Moreover , they also mentioned that this particular device has been discontinued , so their decision makes sense .
Regardless of the reason , fans who were in this situation can only be happy about it .
Besides , the tech giant asked their staff to let the customers know about this new replacement , as well as offer them information about the color and capacity of the new device .
Not long ago they had introduced a gold color option for the iPad Air 2 , plus they offer 32 and 128 GB options .
Meanwhile , the 16 and 64 GB versions were discontinued .
Only Good News for the Users
Because of this situation , users who find themselves in these circumstances will enjoy an upgrade regarding storage when they go for a replacement without paying anything extra !
Moreover , the new device they will receive has newer components and it ’s more powerful than the previous version overall .
A Good Strategy
Though it may seem like a bad idea , since the company may thus lose some money with the upgraded versions , in fact they might even gain some .
The logic here is simple : people are going to appreciate this change and they would be more loyal to the company , if they were n’t until now .
As such , there are high chances that they might consider buying more new products , if they see how good they are .

CALGARY , Alberta ( Reuters ) - A top Canadian official sought to calm an international uproar over hundreds of ducks killed at Canada ’s biggest oil sands plant by promising , at a U.S. oil industry event on Monday , that the incident will not go unpunished .
The deaths of 500 ducks last week on a Syncrude Canada Ltd wastewater pond was unacceptable , Industry Minister Jim Prentice said during an acceptance speech after Canada was named “ Country of the Year ” by Energy Magazine .
“ We anticipate those responsible will face full scrutiny under Canadian law and , insofar as the government of Canada is concerned , there will be full accountability demanded , ” Prentice said , according to notes of the speech delivered in Houston .
The Canadian and Alberta governments have called the incident “ tragic ” and launched investigations .
That ’s done little to calm environmental groups , who say migratory birds are routinely killed in smaller numbers in tailings ponds , where toxic water from oil extraction sits .
Until last week , much of the debate over the impact of oil sands developments , now the target of more than $ 100 billion of investments , was concentrated on carbon dioxide emissions .
Technology is the answer to avoiding more animal deaths and cutting greenhouse gas emissions , Prentice said .
“ Once again , we need a full government and industry press on technological innovation , ” he said .
“ I have every confidence we will be just as successful meeting the environmental challenge as we were the cost of oil sands production . ”
Canada , already the top oil supplier to the United States , aims to nearly triple its oil sands output to three million barrels a day by the middle of the next decade .
Syncrude and other developers normally keep waterfowl away from the ponds with sound - cannons that simulate gunshots .
The company has said a severe spring snowstorm prevented deployment of the system .
Over the weekend , Syncrude took out full - page advertisements in newspapers across the country , apologizing for the deaths , which have dominated headlines in Canada .
“ As we go forward , we will learn from what happened , we will improve our practices , and we will meet your expectations for responsible development , ” Chief Executive Tom Katinas said in the ad .
On Sunday , another oil sands developer , ConocoPhillips , said its workers noticed a growing number of waterfowl on a settling pond at its Surmont project , south of Syncrude , last week .
After trying unsuccessfully to scare them away with air horns , two were captured and taken to a veterinarian in Fort McMurray , Alberta , for examination .
One loon was found dead near the pond , but the company said the cause of death was unclear .
Greenpeace said a second incident in less and a week showed “ massive holes ” in government monitoring and enforcement .
“ It ’s past time we put the brakes on the tar sands , ” Greenpeace campaigner Mike Hudema said in a statement .

IN A SERIES of hearings last week on Capitol Hill , members of Congress shed light on the most significant source of volatile energy prices -- excessive speculation and manipulation on the unregulated energy commodity futures markets .
Seven years ago , Enron lobbyists sought to free their new experiment in electronic trading , " Enron Online , " from oversight by the principle regulator of energy futures and derivatives , the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
They managed to drop a loophole into an appropriations bill that has effectively exempted all electronic over - the - counter energy commodity markets from US regulation .
Before this bill was passed , crude oil was under $ 25 per barrel and motorists enjoyed affordable gasoline .
Since then , energy commodity traders and hedge funds have poured billions of dollars into these " dark markets . "
According to a bipartisan report published by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , excessive speculation may be responsible for as much as $ 20 - $ 25 of a barrel of crude oil .
Between 50 cents to $ 1 per gallon of gasoline may be a direct result of irrational and unethical behavior in the commodity markets .
Enron may be long gone , but its legacy remains .
Few Americans realize the extent to which futures trading on dark markets determines the price they pay for energy .
Daily trading has an immediate impact on the price of gasoline , heating oil , natural gas , and other fuels .
A large majority of futures trading -- as much as 75 percent , according to experts -- is conducted on unregulated dark markets , as opposed to trading on regulated markets , including the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The Federal Trade Commission concluded last year that retail price gouging is not only hard to define but is virtually nonexistent , whereas " price gouging " on the commodity markets is very real .
Insufficient or nonexistent US oversight has given profiteering traders and hedge funds the wiggle room they need to distort prices for personal profit -- at the expense of the American consumer .
A Senate committee investigation into the multi-billion - dollar collapse of hedge fund giant Amaranth Advisors , LLC in September 2006 illustrates the profound effect one company can have on rising energy prices .
That summer , Amaranth controlled 100,000 contracts -- roughly 5 percent of the entire US annual consumption of natural gas .
When the regulated New York Mercantile Exchange platform upon which they held their positions ordered them to liquidate , Amaranth traders simply moved positions to the electronic InterContinental Exchange , which is unregulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
Shortly thereafter , Amaranth 's market holdings collapsed when the market turned against them , and the extraordinarily high natural gas prices -- a direct result of Amaranth 's control of the market -- plummeted .
As Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , the committee 's chairman , said last week , Amaranth " simply wanted to speculate and hopefully make a lot of money . . . they took users and consumers of natural gas along for the ride . "
And it is these consumers who paid the highest price .
The energy commodity markets perform an essential economic function if they are transparent , accountable , and subject to the rule of law .
But as Dr. Michael Greenberger , former CFTC enforcement officer and professor of law at the University of Maryland , said in testimony this month , " failure to regulate these markets properly has distorted and sabotaged free market principles [ and ] cut those markets off from the moorings of economic fundamentals . "
A bill called the " Oil and Gas Traders Oversight Act " would close this loophole and bring accountability to the dark markets .
Congress should pass this bill , put an end to the real " price gouging , " and tell commodity market profiteers to stop playing with their constituents ' wallets .

From the letter ( Thanks to David for the heads up )
Bowing down to corporate pressure , the heads of the movie studio resigned today .
Major layoffs are expected imminently .
New Line will now be folded into Warner Bros .
Here is the email that was just sent out to all staffers :
“ February 28 , 2008
To : New Line Colleagues
From : Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne
Subject : Our Company
This afternoon , Time Warner is announcing that New Line will become a unit of Warner Bros .
This is , of course , a very difficult and emotional time for all of us who have worked at New Line .
While there is not much we can say that can lessen the impact of this announcement , we did want you to know about the decision before you read about it in the press .
New Line will maintain its own identity and will continue to produce , market , and distribute movies .
But New Line will now do so as part of Warner Bros . and will probably be a much smaller operation than in the past .
Time Warner hopes that operating New Line as a unit of Warner Bros. will allow New Line to focus on the creative side of movie - making , while reducing costs and taking advantage of Warner Bros . ’ distribution systems .
The company will be holding group meeting with New Line employees tomorrow in Los Angeles and New York to discuss this announcement , and is committed to letting employees know as soon as possible about how this change affects them individually .
For our part , we will be stepping down as Co-Chairmen and Co-CEOS of New Line .
This was a painful decision , because we love New Line and the people who work here have been like our second families .
But we will be leaving the company with enormous pride in what all of us at New Line have accomplished together .
From its humble beginnings 40 years ago , our studio has created some of the most popular and successful movies of all time .
Those movies are a tribute to the amazing creative energy and entrepreneurial abilities of the talented people at New Line .
They are a legacy that will endure forever .
Although we are stepping out of New Line , we intend to remain actively involved in the industry in an entrepreneurial capacity , and will keep you advised of developments .
We thank all of you who have worked so hard to make New Line such a success .
We are very proud of every one of you .

A Chinese sovereign wealth fund has quietly built up a £ 1bn stake in BP , Britain 's largest company .
Shares in the oil giant jumped this morning following reports that the fund has built up a 1 % stake .
In early trading they were up 11 p at 560 p , a 2 % gain .
A BP spokesman said the firm was " aware of the Chinese shareholding and we welcome all shareholders " .
The identity of the fund has not been confirmed .
Last month China 's State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( Safe ) spent £ 1bn buying a stake in Total , the French oil firm .
The move has sparked speculation of a new wave of investment in western companies by Chinese funds , which are cash rich thanks to the country 's buoyant exports .
Last year China Investment Corp , a $ 200 bn ( £ 101.4 bn ) sovereign wealth fund , spent more than £ 4bn on a shareholding in Blackstone , the US private equity company .
Other sovereign wealth funds have pumped money into investment banks in recent months , following the credit crunch .
Singapore 's GIC bought an $ 11bn stake in UBS last December – since when the Swiss bank has announced more write - downs and a rights issue .
The BP deal is reminiscent of the furore two decades ago when the world 's oldest sovereign wealth fund , the Kuwaiti Investment Authority , snapped up over 20 % of BP after its flotation was disrupted by the stock market crash of 1987 .
KIA was later forced to cut its stake , but is still a major investor .
Sovereign funds have grown in power in recent years , as rising energy prices have left many Middle East countries with piles of cash to invest .
Many are less than fully - transparent , and often will not reveal which shares they own or what their long - term objectives are .
Last year the chancellor , Alistair Darling , warned that these funds would not be allowed to use their power unchecked .
" When a company is not acting in a commercial way or we have reason to believe it is going to make an investment where there is an issue of national security , then we have powers to take action , " he said .
Darling is visiting China this week , and is due to meet with CIC .

Britain and the U.S. led Western recognition of Kosovo yesterday , a day after the province declared independence from Serbia .
But while the four major EU powers - Britain , France , Germany , and Italy - announced they would recognise the new state , Spain and several other countries which have problems with their own separatist groups said they would not do so .

Joy : Kosovars celebrate their independence in Pristina and show off their new flag
Russia warned it would set a dangerous precedent for separatist groups worldwide .
Ninety per cent of Kosovo's two million people are ethnic Albanian - mostly secular Muslims - who saw no reason to be part of Christian Orthodox Serbia .
As word of the recognition spread , cheering ethnic Albanians poured into the streets of Pristina .
But tensions flared in northern Kosovo , home to most of the territory 's minority Serbs .
An explosion damaged a UN vehicle outside the ethnically divided town of Kosovska Mitrovica , where thousands of Serbs demonstrated , chanting " This is Serbia ! "

Thaki wave at cheering crowds
Serbia is preparing to ask the UN Security Council to condemn Kosovo 's declaration of independence as illegal , and last night it recalled its ambassador to the U.S. in protest against Washington 's recognition of the breakaway state .
Spain , like Russia , is grappling with its own separatist movements and believes it would not be in its interest to back the former territory of Yugoslavia .
" The government of Spain will not recognise the unilateral act proclaimed yesterday by the assembly of Kosovo , " Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos told reporters on arrival for a meeting of EU foreign ministers .
He said that to be legal , secession from Serbia required either an agreement between the parties or a UN Security Council resolution .

Outrage : Serbian police clash with protesters outside the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade on Sunday
Britain's Foreign Secretary David Miliband said it was " critical " for the European Union to show leadership on the western Balkans and to maintain peace and stability there .
" I think it 's very important that we recognise that all of the countries in the Western Balkans are European countries , " he said .
" It is critical that Europe shows real leadership in how it ensures that peace and stability are the order of the day in the Western Balkans . "
Aside from Spain , at least five - Cyprus , Greece , Slovakia , Bulgaria and Romania - have indicated they will not recognise Kosovo due to legal misgivings or concern about restive minorities in their own countries .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged restraint after Serbian nationalists stoned Western embassies in Belgrade in anger at the declaration of independence by Kosovo 's Albanians .
" The EU has already decided to send a mission , a mission of stability , a mission of rule of law .
It should contribute to the stability of the Balkans , " Solana told reporters .
The EU agreed on Saturday to send 2,000 police , justice and civil administrators to help build Kosovo 's institutions .
NATO said in a statement its 17,000 - strong KFOR stabilisation force would " respond resolutely to any attempts to disrupt the safety and security of the population of Kosovo " .
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Kosovo was a unique case and would not set a precedent .
He praised Kosovan leaders for promising to respect minority rights in line with a plan drafted by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari .
Russia , Serbia 's closest ally , prevented the UN Security Council from adopting his blueprint for supervised independence last year .
That led Kosovo to declare statehood in coordination with Western powers .
Q and A
Why did Kosovo want independence ?
Some 90 per cent of the population is Albanian .
Demands for independence were ignored amid the wider Balkan wars of the 1990s until an armed rebellion was launched towards the end of the decade .
Serb forces hit back so hard in 1998 that 100,000 Albanians fled to the hills and Nato powers warned Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic they would not tolerate another round of " ethnic cleansing " in the Balkans .
Peace talks in France failed and in March 1999 Nato started bombing Serbia to force it to withdraw its forces from Kosovo .
Some 800,000 Albanians fled or were expelled to Macedonia and Albania before Milosevic gave in 78 days later .
As his forces pulled out , up to 200,000 Serbs and other ethnic minorities left as well .
How has Kosovo been run up to now ?
Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations , with Nato troops as peacekeepers , since 1999 .
Unemployment is more than 50 per cent .
Kosovo 's uncertain future has deterred outside investment .
Spasms of ethnic violence , mostly by Albanians against Serbs , and organised traffic of contraband and people , have tarnished its image .
What will happen next ?
Following Sunday 's declaration of independence by the Kosovo parliament , the procedure is likely to follow a plan drawn up by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari for " supervised independence " which was rejected by Serbia .
Under the plan , a 120 - day transitional period will follow a declaration and full independence would then come into effect .
How will the world react ?
EU foreign ministers met in Brussels yesterday and the majority of member states were in favour of independence .
Cyprus , Romania , Slovakia , Spain and Greece are not , fearing it could set a precedent for separatist groups in their own countries among other reasons .
Russia has firmly rejected the Kosovo move and wants the United Nations to annul the declaration .
Why is Russia so opposed ?
Russia considers Serbia to share a Slavic and Orthodox Christian tradition and parts of the Belgrade government have actively courted Moscow 's support in recent months .
Serbia 's oil monopoly was recently sold to Russia 's Gazprom for what was considered a low price .
Traditionally an ally of Serbia , Russia is concerned by the EU 's expansion into the Balkans and Moscow believes Kosovo would set a precedent .
There is little difference , according to the Kremlin , between the separatism of Kosovo and the ambitions of pro-Russian areas such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia and Trans - Dniester in Moldova .
What will happen to Kosovo 's Serb minority ?
An estimated 120,000 ethnic Serbs live in Kosovo , many in Serb - dominated areas north of the Ibar river , adjoining Serbia proper .
Half of the population lives under Nato protection in scattered enclaves south of the Ibar river .
Under the Ahtisaari plan , the Serb minority would have guaranteed places in local government and parliament , proportionate representation in the police and civil service , and a special status for the Serbian Orthodox Church .
Is there a risk of violence ?
Yes .
Nato forces have stepped up their state of alert , especially in ethnically mixed areas of Kosovo .
Commanders have promised more patrols .
The key question is whether they will be able to control flashpoints such as the main northern town of Mitrovica , where ethnic Serbs live north of the Ibar river and ethnic Albanians to the south .
Could the violence spread ?
The nightmare scenario would involve Kosovo Serbs who live south of the Ibar river being violently driven from their homes , and the expulsion of ethnic Albanians living in enclaves in northern Kosovo , and in the Presevo and Bujanovac regions of southern Serbia .
It could go further than that .
There are large ethnic Albanian communities in Macedonia and Montenegro , some of whom might seek a union with Kosovo .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama suggested Thursday that he does n't see any point in having another debate with Democratic rival Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Wednesday 's debate on ABC may be the final face - off between Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
Clinton has agreed to a debate next week , but Obama has not accepted the invitation .
At an appearance in Raleigh , North Carolina , Obama said he has a lot of campaigning to do in a limited amount of time .
Obama said he had agreed to an earlier debate , but Clinton declined that one .
" I 'll be honest with you , we 've now had 21 , " he said .
" It 's not as if we do n't know how to do these things .
I could deliver Sen. Clinton 's lines ; she could , I 'm sure , deliver mine . "
Obama said he has to look at his schedule , considering the upcoming primaries .
The two Democrats went head - to - head in a debate Wednesday night on ABC .
During the first part of that debate , the candidates largely rehashed the controversies that have marked their past six weeks on the campaign trail .
Much of the fire was leveled at Obama , who once again answered questions about controversial statements by his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , and his own comments that some rural Pennsylvanians are " bitter . "
Obama said it took too long for them to address anything substantial .
" Last night , we set a new record , because it took us 45 minutes before we even started talking -- until we started talking about a single issue that matters to the American people , " he said .
" Now , I do n't blame Washington for this ; that 's just how Washington is .
...
They like stirring up controversy ; they like playing ' gotcha ' games .
... I will say Sen. Clinton looked in her element . "
Watch Obama note how long it took to get to the debate issues »
Clinton has n't commented on the debate .
Meanwhile , all three of the major White House hopefuls sat down for one - on - one meetings Thursday with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown as he visited Washington .
Brown , on his second trip to the United States since replacing Tony Blair last year , held private 45 - minute sessions with each candidate at the British Embassy .
Clinton and the British leader discussed a wide range of issues , including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and global warming , according to Senate aides .
Obama said he and Brown talked about strengthening the U.S. - British alliance , and " common challenges " such as the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , instability in the global economy and support for democracy and prosperity in Africa .
" The prime minister has been a critically important partner for the United States , and I look forward to working with him in the months and years ahead to enhance the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom , " Obama said in a statement .
It was Obama 's first meeting with Brown .
Watch the two have a sitdown at the British Embassy »
The British leader and Sen. John McCain , who met last month in London , were heard talking about the presidential election during a photo op .
McCain said the drawn - out process in U.S. campaigns sometimes made one wish for the much shorter duration of the British system .
Brown laughed , saying his system has its ups and downs , too .
After her stop in Washington , Clinton resumed her campaigning in Pennsylvania .
The senator from New York was scheduled to hold a town hall - style meeting in Haverford and attend a rally in Philadelphia .
She was also expected to appear on Comedy Central 's " The Colbert Report . "
Meanwhile , Obama was looking ahead to the May 6 contest in North Carolina , where early voting began in some counties Thursday .
On Friday , the senator from Illinois will launch a four - day tour through Pennsylvania , leading up to the state 's primary Tuesday .
Pennsylvania , with 158 delegates at stake , marks the first Democratic contest in six weeks .
Obama leads Clinton in the overall delegate count , 1,644 to 1,498 .
Clinton has a slight edge in superdelegates , with 248 backing her compared with 226 for Obama .
Clinton holds a lead of 5 percentage points in Pennsylvania , according to an average of four recent surveys : Zogby ( April 15 - 16 ) , Franklin & Marshall ( April 8 - 13 ) , Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg ( April 10 - 14 ) and Quinnipiac ( April 9 - 13 ) .
Clinton held double - digit leads over Obama until the past two weeks
McCain , who became the presumptive GOP nominee last month , had no public events scheduled Thursday .
The senator from Arizona expanded on his economic proposals in an interview with CNN on Wednesday , a day after he unveiled his plan .
" Americans need some relief , " McCain said of his proposal to suspend the federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel temporarily .
Watch what McCain says about the economy »
" I just think it 's kind of a good thing to do so people can have a little more enjoyable summer during tough times , " he added .
McCain , long an advocate of cutting federal spending , also explained his push for certain measures that probably would delay achieving a balanced budget if he wins the White House .
" The best way to have a balanced budget is to have a recovering economy , " he said .
The 71 - year - old senator also shot down remarks from Rep. John " Jack " Murtha , D - Pennsylvania , that he may be too old for the presidency .
" Speak for yourself , Jack .
I 'm doing fine , thanks , " he said in response to Murtha , who 's 75 .

12 Year Old Boy May Face Charges For Saving His Mother From an Attacker
This is the story of a boy who was trying to protect his mother from an attacker .
The 12 year old boy heard his mother screaming and ran out to see what was the matter .
He found a man on top of his mother trying to strangle her .
“ He threw me into the door so hard it hit my back , and it made my chest start hurting , ” she said .
“ Then he threw me to the floor .
He threw me down and started choking me .
I think that ’s when my son came in .
. . .
He protected me . ”
The boy then tried to yell at the man to let his mother go , to leave her alone .
The attacker ignored the boy .
The boy , who is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 175 pounds , said he acted because he thought he had no choice .
“ He was hitting her with the broom ; then he was choking her , ” the boy said .
“ I told him to stop . ”
The boy then did the only thing that he could think of to save his mother ’s life .
He stabbed him with a kitchen knife .
He grabbed a knife that he said his family had last used to cut turkey at Thanksgiving dinner .
“ I knew I had to kill him so he would stop hurting my mother , ” he said .
Once she was freed , Stamp said she yelled upstairs for someone to call police .
She said her son took her by the arm and led her into their bedroom .
This boy acted on instinct and did the only thing that he could think of to save his mother from being murdered .
So how is he being rewarded ?
Law enforcement officials were reviewing evidence yesterday and had not decided whether to file charges .
There is a possibility that charges are going to be pressed against this boy for stopping a violent crime , and also insuring the criminal will never commit a violent crime against anyone ever again .
It does n’t seem as though charges are likely though .
“ In Maryland , there can be a legitimate defense of third parties in the event of a violent attack , ” State ’s Attorney Glenn F. Ivey said .
“ That is a possibility in this case . ”
A possibility ?
No shit .
Are you trying to tell me that if you witness a violent crime you are supposed to do nothing because there is a chance you could face jail time if you do ?
If jail time is possible for stopping a crime , then what should the punishment be for not doing anything while a violent crime is being committed ?
This is backward logic .
If a person ever broke into my house and was trying to harm my wife or children and I had the chance to stop him , I would not think twice about it .
I would rather spend the rest of my life in jail for having defended my family than live the rest of my life knowing I let something horrible happen to someone in my family and I had the chance to stop it .
I should n’t face jail time for protecting my family .
Neither should this boy .

Oh well ..
My colleague Ken Vogel reports :
BOCA RATON , Fla . - Hillary Clinton compared her effort to seat Florida and Michigan delegates to epic American struggles , including those to free the slaves and win the right to vote for blacks and women .
The current stalemate over the two states ' primary votes threatens to replicate the disputed 2000 presidential election in Florida , she warned an elderly crowd in Palm Beach County - one of the jurisdictions where Democrats allege voters were disenfranchised in 2000 .
The pointed speech marked the kick - off of a last - gasp effort by Clinton to prolong her Democratic presidential campaign by making the states count , which would cut into rival Barack Obama 's leads in popular votes and pledged delegates .
" In Florida , you learned the hard way what happens when your votes are n't counted and the candidate with fewer votes is declared the winner , " she said .
" The lesson of 2000 here in Florida is crystal clear : if any votes are n't count , the will of the people is n't realized and our democracy is diminished . "
Clinton , at times sounding like a modern history professor , praised the abolitionists , suffragettes and civil rights pioneers and talked about her own efforts to fight legislative redistricting and voter identification initiatives that she said dilute minority voting power .
" This work to extend the franchise to all of our citizens is a core mission of the modern Democratic party , " she said .
" From signing the Voting Rights Act and fighting racial discrimination at the ballot box to lowering the voting age so those old enough to fight and die in war would have the right to choose their commander in chief , to fighting for multi-lingual ballots so you can make your voice heard no matter what language you speak . "

She said " there 's a reason why so many have fought so hard and sacrificed so much .
It 's because they knew that to be a citizen of this country is to have the right and responsibility to help shape its future .
Not just to have your voice heard but to have it count .
People have fought hard because they knew their vote was at stake and so was their children 's futures .
Those people , she said “ refused to accept their assigned place as second - class citizens .
Men and women who saw America not as it was , but as it could and should be , and committed themselves to extending the frontiers of our democracy .
The abolitionists and all who fought to end slavery and ensure freedom came with the full right of citizenship .
The tenacious women and a few brave men who gathered at the Seneca Falls convention back in 1848 to demand the right to vote . ”
" Because of those who have come before , Sen . Obama and I have and so many of you have this precious right today .
Because of all that has been done , we are in this historic presidential election .
And I believe that both Sen. Obama and myself have an obligation as potential Democratic nominees - in fact we all have an obligation as Democrats - to carry on this legacy and ensure that in our nominating process , every voice is heard and every single vote is counted . "
She also warned of grave political costs in the November general election against presumptive Republican nominee John McCain if the Democratic National Committee does not seat the Florida and Michigan delegations .
" If we fail to do so , I worry that we will pay not only a moral cost , but a political cost as well , " she said .
" We know the road to a Democratic White House runs right through Florida and Michigan .
If we care about winning those states in November , we need to count your votes now .
If Democrats send a message that we do n't fully value your votes , we know Sen.
McCain and the Republicans will be more than happy to have them .
The Republicans will make a simple and compelling argument : why should Florida and Michigan voters trust the Democratic Party to look out for you when they wo n't even listen to you . "

例えばコメント欄に具体例として「 たとえばJSPでHTMLエスケープして値を出力するのにわざわざ
と書くことに疑問を持っている人はどれだけいるでしょうか。私は見たことありません」とか出ていますよね。
で、例えばその「見たことない」例がここにいるわけですよ。私です。いや文字しか見えないでしょうがw 私はJSPなんて死ねばいいのにと公然といってますし、Railsがrhtmlにスクリプトを直接書いてOKなんなら、もうカスタムタグなんて使わないでJSPに直接Javaのコード書いたらいいじゃん、とか公然と言ってますよ。私が一番押している技術はJSP自体使わないですし。

まあt_yanoさんは問題意識の高い方だから、この方を典型的なJava屋と考えるのは無理がある。どう考えても部分集合、しかも極めて小さい数の部分集合だろう。
典型的 なJava屋 ( もちろん部分集合 ) は JSP に何の疑問も持っていない。JSPに疑問を持つような人たちがJava屋のメインストリームであったら、TapestryもWicketももっと流行っているだろうし、Tapestryライクな技術がJCPで議論されてもいいはず。しかし現実にはTapestryやWicketを知っているのは一部だし、実際に使っている人となるとさらに少ない。これが現実。
ちょっと昔、こんなことがあった。昔といっても21世紀に入ってのことだけど、JSFが登場して1年くらいで、TapestryはあったけどWicketは生まれてなかった
( たぶん)、というぐらいの時期だから、この業界では「昔」となるだろうという程度の昔のこと。たしかMayaaが未踏に採択されたぐらいの時期だったと思う。
JSFを売り出した いSUNが、用賀オフィスでJSFの講習会をするというので行ってみた。用賀オフィスにはOracleも入っているので何度かいったことあるけど、相変わらずきれいなビルだった。当時、JSFのことは『再設計されたStruts』ぐらいの認識しかなくてどんなものか知らなかったし、講習会は無料だったので参加してみたわけだ。
講習で話していたのは、自 称「 JSF エバンジェリスト」という40代ぐらいのおじさんと、その部下かどうか分かんないけど30歳前後ぐらいの技術者。当然、両名ともSUN社員。Javaの仕事をしているSUN社員だから、Java屋のサンプルとしては典型的であり、偏ってないよね?*1 ( 異論は認める )
で、まあJSFの講習会だからJSFの説明があって、カスタムタグは使うけどStrutsとはだいぶ違うなーとか、managed beanってなんかよくわからんとか、「${}」じゃなくて「#{}」を使うけどなんで変えたんやろとか、まあいろいろ思いながら聞いていた。
んで、終わった後に講師の方を捕まえて、デザイナーとの協業をどう考えているかについて、またJSPの存在価値について聞いてみた。せっかくJSFという新しい技術を開発するなら、JSPやカスタムタグというできの悪い技術を使うよりもTapestryのような筋のいい技術を使ったほうがよかったのではないか、そのほうが.NETやASPとの差別化ができるし、JSPとカスタムタグを使うJSFではデザイナーとの協業が難しい、というようなことを話した。
彼らの回答は驚くべきものだった : 『タペストリーって何ですか?』・・・これには驚いた。なんと、自称JSFエバンジェリストはTapestryの名前さえ知らなかったのだ。
確か にTapestryはメインストリームの技術じゃないけど、当時すでにJakartaプロジェクトの一員となっていて、雑誌でも第2特集が組まれる程度の知名度はあった。そのTapestryを知らないというのは驚いた。しかも、それが自称JSFエバンジェリストのおじさんだけでなく、30前後のまだ若い技術者のほうも知らないというのだ。当然ながら、XMLCも知るわけない。おじさんが最新技術に弱い傾向があるのは分かるけども、若い技術者でも知らないというのはどういうことか。
彼らとしばらく話してわかったことは、JSPを使うことに何の疑問も抱いてないこと、カスタムタグのせいでデザイナーと協業できないことをちっとも気にしていないこと
( 逆に.NETやASPの存在は気にしてて「.NETと差別化できるはずですよ」という言葉には敏感に反応すること)、というかデザイナーもIDEやJSF用ツールを使えばいいじゃんと考えていること、であった。
これが典型的 なJava屋の実体ではないだろうか。与えられた仕様を覚えるだけで、JSPやStrutsやJSFに何の疑問も持たない。疑問を持たないから、本来どのような仕様がいいのかなんて考えるわけがない*2。同じことはJSPやJSF以外でも言える。EntityBeanやXMLファイルにも疑問を持たないし、アクセッサやFileReaderでも同様。どんな仕様がいいのかを自分で考えることはしないから、「アクセッサ定義が面倒で見にくい」という意見に対し、「IDEで自動生成すればいい」とか「大規模開発で必要」とか的外れな反論しかできない。なぜIDEで自動生成しなければならないのか、本当に大規模開発で必要なのか、そういうことを自分の頭で考えていない。このことは最近のコメントではっきりした。自分の頭で考えてなかった連中は、『冗長な記述が大規模開発でどう役立つか』と聞かれてもはっきりと答えられず、話をそらそうとしている。
まあ「自称JSFエバンジェリストなSUN社員 」 や「 Javaを仕事にしているSUN社員」が典型的なJava屋といえるかどうかは、もしかしたら議論の余地があるのかもしれない。自分としてはJava屋と呼ぶに十分だと思うけど、みずしま氏はまた違った意見を持っているだろう。というか、みずしま氏からはあれ以来何のコメントももらえてないので、何を基準にして偏ってる・偏ってないを判断するのかはいまだに知らないし、SUN社員がサンプルとしてだめならどんなサンプルなら満足するのかは分からない。しばらく待ってみるけど、あんまり期待できないかな。
ちなみに、先 のSUN社員との会話では、別れ際に若い社員のほうから『JSPよりいい技術があれば教えてください』と真顔で言われてしまった。Jakartaプロジェクトぐらい押さえておこうよと思ったけど、自称エバンジェリストのおじさんはJSFにケチつけられて終止不満そうな顔してたから、そのおじさんよりは若い社員のほうが伸びるだろうなと思った。彼らが今どうなっているかは知らん。
Recently , we had this strange problem with a particular smart client application at work .
It happened when the user clicked the OK button on a specific form .
Like all difficult bugs , it was impossible for us to replicate .
We put a bunch of diagnostic scaffolding into the deployed executable ; this provided a number of clues .
We knew that the submitted data had duplicates , somehow , and this was throwing duplicate record exceptions in the API .
After a week of head scratching and asking ourselves how this could possibly happen , a fellow developer had an simple idea : what if we double - click on the OK button ?
Sure enough , that second click was somehow getting through to the UI and causing the OK button code to execute twice .
The fix is to disable the button and change the text in the OnClick event , as demonstrated in this JavaScript sample :
This problem is a powerful illustration of the way developers do n't think like users .
No developer would ever double - click on a button , because developers have too much GUI knowledge : only a single click is supported on this GUI element , so a double - click does n't make sense here .
Users , on the other hand , are n't burdened by this detailed knowledge of the GUI .
Many users never fully learn the distinction between single - click and double - click .
So they give up and simply .. double - click everything .
I know it sounds crazy ( to a developer ) , but I have observed it many times with real users using real applications , as in this KDE usability study :
Every single new KDE user I have ever casually observed was caught by surprise by KDE 's " active " single - click default policy .
Testing confirmed this observation .
All test participants have task after task made the same mistake of double - clicking when a single - click would have been sufficient .
Unfortunately , I neglected to ask test participants how they felt about this particular point -- I 'm still new at this ! -- but I know from observing them that it did slow them down .
For instance , it made copying and pasting files difficult by creating superfluous windows to close and forcing them to concentrate on a task they were otherwise comfortable with .
In one case , one user nearly saved his files in the Trash because of this .
As he double - clicked the Desktop icon of the " Save As ... " dialog box , the system interpreted his action as a single - click on the Desktop icon followed by a single - click on the Trash icon , the latter occupying the space of the former after a single " active " click .
The user eventually backed out but never realized what he was about to do .
I 'm not sure why KDE makes single - clicking its " active " click .
Historically Macintosh and Windows desktops adopted the same conventions for icon selection and document opening : single - click is for selecting , double - click is for opening or launching .
This is not always the case anymore but I have yet to see a computer user single - clicking on an icon to open a document or launch an application .
The notion that double - clicking " does something " is in fact so entrenched that it is not uncommon to see people double - clicking on hyperlinks when surfing the web .
I do n't blame the user here .
Double - click has always been a bad idea .
It was basically forced on the industry by Apple Computer when they elected to use a single button mouse on the original Mac in 1984 .
Technically , double - click is an optional shortcut for clicking an object and then clicking the File , Open menu ; it 's how you distinguish between selection ( pick this one ) and action ( launch this one ) .
I have some problems with double - click :
How would anyone know , without being told , that double - click is a possible action ?
It 's a completely hidden behavior .
At least a two button mouse physically looks like it has two actions .
The mechanics of double - clicking are unnecessarily demanding .
It requires precise timing and good motor skills .
Click too fast or too slow , or move the mouse too much between clicks , and you might miss the window .
What next ?
Triple click ?
Click and hold ?
Mouse Gestures ?
I seriously question whether such a common action as " Activate " -- arguably far more common than " Select " -- should be tied to such an obscure , hard to perform physical gesture .
Ca n't we just put another damn button on the mouse ?
Is two buttons really that hard to figure out ?
God forbid we put a 100 + key keyboard in front of people ; their heads might explode !
One of the strengths of the web UI model is the way it uses single click exclusively , neatly avoiding the button overloading problem :
In the future , however , double - click must die since it causes novice users great difficulties and since it conflicts with the single - click interaction style of the Web .
The main reason for double - click is to allow two operations to be overloaded onto a single - button mouse .
Designers of more recent multi-button GUIs have faithfully duplicated a weaknesses that was made necessary by limitations of an early single - button GUI : let 's do better in the future .
Content applets should be particularly wary of double - click since people will think of them as single - click Web content .
( Former Apple human evangelist Bruce Tognazzini provides further details about how newer window systems copied acknowledged weaknesses of the Mac : see his book Tog on Software Design . )
Double - click is such a profoundly bad idea that it actually manages to spill over into other applications and poison them with bad learned user behavior , eg , I better double - click on everything if I want anything to happen !
Thanks , Apple .. for nothing !
The Los Angeles Times has apologised for using documents that were apparently fabricated in a story implicating associates of Sean " Diddy " Combs in a 1994 assault on rapper Tupac Shakur .
" The bottom line is that the documents we relied on should not have been used , " editor Russ Stanton said in a story posted last night on the newspaper 's website .
" We apologise both to our readers and to those referenced in the documents ... and in the story . "
Pulitzer - prize winning reporter Chuck Philips , who wrote the story , and his supervisor , deputy managing editor Marc Duvoisin , also apologised .
The apologies followed an investigation launched by Stanton after the Smoking Gun website reported earlier in the day that the paper was conned by a prisoner who doctored the documents .
Combs denied that he had any prior knowledge of , or involvement in , the robbery and shooting of Shakur at a New York recording studio .
He and other subjects of the story claimed that they had been defamed by the newspaper .
The Smoking Gun said the documents seemed phony because they appeared to be written on a typewriter instead of a computer and included blacked - out sections not typically found in such documents , among other problems .
The website claimed the documents were fabricated by a prison inmate with a history of exaggerating his place in the rap music world .
The LA Times said its March 17 story was based on FBI records , interviews with people at the scene of the 1994 shooting , and statements to the FBI by an informant .
None of the sources were named .
Philips said that a former FBI agent examined the documents in question for him and said they appeared to be legitimate .
But Philips said he wished he had done more to investigate their authenticity .
" I now believe the truth here is I got duped , " he said .
Marc Lichtman , an attorney representing rap manager James Rosemond , one of the two men the story linked to the Shakur attack , had earlier demanded an apology .
" I would suggest to Mr Philips and his editors that they immediately print an apology and take out their chequebooks – or brace themselves for an epic lawsuit , " Lichtman said .
The shooting triggered a feud between east and west coast rappers that led to the killings of Shakur and The Notorious BIG .
The story said that associates hoping to curry favour with Combs – who was overseeing BIG 's white - hot career at the time – lured Shakur to the studio because of his disrespect towards them .
The story and related features on latimes.com attracted nearly 1 m hits – more than any other story on latimes.com this year , the newspaper said .
ACLU Calls for Independent Counsel to Investigate Administration 's Approval of Torture and Abuse
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 202 ) 675-2312 , media@dcaclu.org ; ( 917 ) 251-8654 or media@aclu.org
TAKE ACTION
WASHINGTON – In a stunning admission to ABC news Friday night , President Bush declared that he knew his top national security advisers discussed and approved specific details of the CIA 's use of torture .
Bush reportedly told ABC , " I 'm aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . "
Bush also defended the use of waterboarding .
Recent reports indicate that high - level advisers including Dick Cheney , Condoleeza Rice , Donald Rumsfeld , Colin Powell and George Tenet were part of the National Security Council 's " Principals Committee " that met regularly and approved the CIA 's use of " combined " " enhanced " interrogation techniques , even pushing the limits of the now infamous 2002 Justice Department " torture memo . "
These top advisers reportedly signed off on how the CIA would interrogate suspects – whether they would be slapped , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning .
" We have always known that the CIA 's use of torture was approved from the very top levels of the U.S. government , yet the latest revelations about knowledge from the president himself and authorization from his top advisers only confirms our worst fears , " said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
" It is a very sad day when the president of the United States subverts the Constitution , the rule of law , and American values of justice . "
Romero added , " It is more important than ever that the U.S. government , when seeking justice against those it suspects of harming us , adhere to our commitment to due process and the rule of law .
That 's why the ACLU has taken the extraordinary step to offer our assistance to those being prosecuted under the unconstitutional military commissions process .
We unfortunately can't erase or make up for what has already happened , but at least we can attempt to restore some of the values and some semblance of due process that the Bush administration has squandered in the name of national security . "
The American Civil Liberties Union is calling on Congress to demand an independent prosecutor to investigate possible violations by the Bush administration of laws including the War Crimes Act , the federal Anti-Torture Act , and federal assault laws .
" No one in the executive branch of government can be trusted to fairly investigate or prosecute any crimes since the head of every relevant department , along with the president and vice president , either knew or participated in the planning and approval of illegal acts , " said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" Congress cannot look the other way ; it must demand an independent investigation and independent prosecutor . "
Fredrickson added , " Congress is duty - bound by the Constitution not only to hold the president , vice president , and all civil officers to account , but it must also send a message to future presidents that it will use its constitutional powers to prevent illegal , and immoral conduct . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Target Corp's TGT.N outgoing CEO has amassed more than $ 140 million in deferred compensation and pension benefits over his four decades at the discount retailer , a filing with U.S. securities regulators showed on Monday .

Target 's outgoing CEO has amassed more than $ 140 million in deferred compensation and pension benefits over his four decades at the discount retailer , a filing with U.S. securities regulators showed on Monday .
REUTERS / Rick Wilking
Robert Ulrich , who will reach Target ’s mandatory retirement age of 65 this month , is slated to retire as chief executive on May 1 , but remain chairman of the board .
Gregg Steinhafel , who joined Target in 1979 and is now its president , will succeed him as CEO .
In a regulatory filing , Target said Ulrich received much of his compensation in the mid-1980s and into the 1990s through a deferred compensation program designed to retain top talent and reward longevity with the company .
That helped build his $ 140.79 million in accumulated savings , earnings and supplemental pension benefits , it said .
The total represents money held in a combination of two plans .
One of the plans was frozen to new deferrals in 1996 .
A spokeswoman for Target could not be reached immediately for comment .
Ulrich has worked for 41 years at the second - largest U.S. discount retailer , behind Wal - Mart Stores Inc WMT.N .
He started as a merchandising trainee in its store division in 1967 and advanced through various management positions .
Under his tenure as CEO since 1994 , the retailer said it had nearly tripled its locations and increased sales more than four times .
By attracting shoppers with cheap but trendy designer clothes , handbags , shoes and home decor , Target ’s sales had been outpacing Wal - Mart’s .
But its sales began to falter last year as shoppers , worried about the weakening U.S. economy , filled their carts with lower - margin food , laundry detergent and toothpaste instead of higher - margin shoes , clothes and jewelry .
The filing shows Ulrich was awarded compensation valued at $ 19.27 million last year , based on salary , bonus , non-equity incentive pay , other compensation as well as the stock and option grants awarded during the year .
Included in that tally is a 2007 bonus of $ 2.2 million , down from a bonus of $ 3.0 million the prior year .
Steinhafel was awarded compensation valued at $ 9.4 million , and his bonus rose to $ 447,680 from $ 389,411 .
Target said its financial results in 2007 “ fell well short of our goals .
“ Sales growth slowed significantly in the second half of the year , leading to unfavorable earnings performance vs. our expectations , ” the filing stated .
“ As a result , non-equity incentive payouts for executive officers were near the low end of the payout range , and long - term performance share award payouts were negatively impacted . ”
Following on from Ed's " Automatic versioning of CSS , JavaScript and Images " here is a method to version filenames based on modification times to be used in Django as a template tag .
This is really handy technique for when you set expires headers to a long way into the future .
With headers set in this way files need to have their filenames versioned to force the client to download the latest version of a file .
The purpose being that with far futures expires the browser will agressively cache the asset thus minimising the amount of requests for assets .
This template tag for Django uses the same method as Ed's to provide a version string that 's appended to the filename .
The awesome part of this is once configured you can just happily change the file as you need to and the caching is taken care of .
{ % load utils %} < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text / css " href= " { % version '/ static/css/style.css ' %} " >
The code for this is placed in a utils .py in " project/app/templatetags "
from django import template register = template .
Library ( ) import os , re STATIC_PATH= " / path/to/templates / " version_cache = {} rx = re.compile ( r " ^(.*) \.(.*? ) $ " ) def version ( path_string ) : try : if path_string in version_cache : mtime = version_cache [ path_string ] else : mtime = os.path.getmtime ('%s%s ' % ( STATIC_PATH , path_string , ) ) version_cache [ path_string ] = mtime return rx.sub( r " \1.%d.\2 " % mtime , path_string ) except : return path_string register.simple_tag(version )
As Brad has pointed out in the comments below the original query string method used will not be cached by UAs following the http spec .
The output will now look like the following :
/ static/css/style.css?v=1207433992
/static/css/style.1207433992.css
In addition a mod_rewrite rule is required to map the versioned file to the original .
The lip balm shows Christ flanked by two women ( Photo : Blue Q )
The range , named Lookin ' Good for Jesus , was on sale at three Topshop outlets in the Asian city state .
Catholics complained the cosmetics ' marketing was disrespectful , full of sexual innuendo and trivialised Christianity .
About 15 % of Singapore 's 4.4 million population is Christian .
The products included a " Virtuous vanilla " lip balm and a " Get Tight with Christ " hand and body cream , featuring a picture of Christ flanked by two adoring women .
" Why would anyone use religious figures to promote vanity products ?
It 's very disrespectful and distasteful , " the Straits Times newspaper quoted accountant Grace Ong , 24 , as saying .
A spokesman for the Wing Tai company , which runs Topshop 's outlets in Singapore , told the newspaper it did not want to offend its customers , and withdrew the products last month .
It was not clear whether other shops were still selling the range , which is produced by the US - based company , Blue Q .

This article is marked as ' retired ' .
The information here may be out of date and / or incomplete .
A few years ago , researchers at NASA fried up several chunks of vat - grown fish meat in a little olive oil , garlic , lemon and pepper , and remarked on it ’s striking to similarity to real fish ( without going so far as tasting it ) .
These scientists had successfully coaxed a few small chunks of fish muscle to grow inside a vat of nutrient - rich liquid , marking a scientific first .
Their aim was to develop a means for astronauts to produce edible meat for use on long voyages , such as a trip to Mars .
Vat - grown meat offers a good source of protein , and would be a welcome change from the usual freeze - dried fare .
But it is n’t very appetizing , particularly considering that meat developed in this way is essentially a cultured muscle tumor .
More recent efforts at the University of Maryland have led to some new methods which may prove useful on the road to Meatville , with the intent to bring “ in vitro ” meat to the masses .
And they think they may be able to improve on nature ’s recipe while they ’re at it .
From the UniverseToday article :
“ There would be a lot of benefits from cultured meat , ” says Matheny , who studies agricultural economics and public health .
“ For one thing , you could control the nutrients .
For example , most meats are high in the fatty acid Omega 6 , which can cause high cholesterol and other health problems .
With in vitro meat , you could replace that with Omega 3 , which is a healthy fat .
” Cultured meat could also reduce the pollution that results from raising livestock , and you would n’t need the drugs that are used on animals raised for meat . ”
Jason Matheny and his team suggest two viable approaches for the meat - o - matic of the future :
It could be grown on thin , flat membranes and then stacked to achieve thickness ; or it could be cultured on tiny beads , then harvested and made into processed meats like chicken nuggets or ground beef .
Either way , to get the taste and texture right , the meat will need to be stretched and exercised as it goes , just like a real animal muscle would be .
This technology could spell the end of moral vegetarianism , since animals would no longer be part of the meat - producing process .
But it raises some interesting questions …
For instance , would it be acceptable to use one of these machines to produce meat based on human muscle tissue ?
Practically speaking , human meat is extremely nutritious to humans , and such vat - grown man-burgers would not have originated from a human .
There would also be no risk of cannibalism - related diseases .
But on the other hand … there ’s even more meat .
Because the idea of vat meat is n’t particularly appetizing , one has to wonder whether these meat machines will become the source of cheap meat for the massive underclass of the future .
The rich will dine on corn-fed Iowa beef while the poor masses slave away in the underground factories , lunching on cultured meat tumor - chow laced with obedience - enhancing drugs .
It seems almost inevitable .
If the world embraces the technology , all of this might one day be accomplished by an appliance churning away on your kitchen counter … producing whatever meat you desire from a small packet of “ seed ” cells .
Gone would be the concerns of animal welfare , slaughterhouse cleanliness , and livestock - related environmental impact .
In theory , one cell of meat could be cultured enough to provide for the meat demands of the entire world .
Documents Obtained By ACLU Also Uncover " Widespread Use " Of Rescinded Unlawful Interrogation Techniques And Failure Of Medical Personnel To Report Abuses
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT ( 646 ) 785-1894 or ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK —
The American Civil Liberties Union announced today the release of newly unredacted documents from the Defense Department 's internal investigations into charges of detainee abuse .
Uncensored documents from the Church Report , obtained as a result of the ACLU 's Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit , include new details exposing the role of psychologists in military interrogations .
The documents also uncover new information about the failure of military medical personnel to report abuses at Abu Ghraib , the military 's use of unlawful interrogation methods subsequent to a directive that was ostensibly meant to end such practices , and detainee deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq .
" The documents reveal that psychologists and medical personnel played a key role in sustaining prisoner abuse — a clear violation of their ethical and legal obligations , " said Amrit Singh , a staff attorney with the ACLU .
" The documents only underscore the need for an independent investigation into responsibility for the systemic abuse of detainees held in U.S. custody abroad . "
In 2006 , the ACLU received a highly redacted version of the Church Report , which was commissioned by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as a comprehensive review of military interrogation operations in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay based on 187 investigations into detainee abuse that had been closed as of September 30 , 2004 .
The report did not analyze information relating to 130 abuse cases that remained open as of that date , and issues of senior official responsibility for detainee abuse were beyond its mandate .
Written by Vice Admiral Albert T. Church , the report skirts the question of command responsibility for detainee abuse , euphemistically labeling official failure to issue interrogation guidelines for Iraq and Afghanistan as a " missed opportunity . "
The report states that " analogous to the BSCT in Guantanamo Bay , the Army has a number of psychologists in operational positions ( in both Afghanistan and Iraq ) , mostly within Special Operations , where they provide direct support to military operations .
They do not function as mental health providers , and one of their core missions is to support interrogations . "
The documents also uncover new information about the failure of Army medics to report the notorious abuses that took place at Abu Ghraib .
According to the report , " enlisted medics witnessed obvious episodes of detainee abuse apparently without reporting them to superiors . "
One episode involved a detainee whose wounded leg was intentionally hit .
Two others involved detainees handcuffed uncomfortably to beds for prolonged periods , such that one eventually suffered a dislocated shoulder and another experienced excruciating pain when eventually forced to stand .
Another incident involved a medic who witnessed pictures of naked detainees in a pyramid but did not report the episode to superiors .
The unredacted sections of the report provide new evidence confirming the use of abusive interrogation techniques after they were no longer authorized .
According to the report , " the use of some of the techniques … continued even until July 2004 , despite the fact that many were retracted by the October 2003 memorandum , and some were subsequently prohibited by the May 2004 memorandum . "
The report goes on to blame dysfunctional command procedures for the military 's failure to follow the law , stating , " the relatively widespread use of these techniques supports our finding that the policy documents were not always received or thoroughly understood . "
" Four years have passed since the Abu Ghraib photographs were first published , and yet no senior official has been held responsible for the abuse and torture of prisoners , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" Senior officials made torture into official policy .
Accountability is long overdue . "
The documents made public today by the ACLU reveal new information on detainee deaths that were likely the result of abuse .
The ACLU previously obtained autopsy and investigative reports for some of these deaths :
In November 2003 , a detainee at Abu Ghraib in Iraq died with " compromised respiration . "
The Church Report states that " medical personnel may have acted to misrepresent circumstances . "
See : action.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/102405/3212.pdf
In November , 2003 , a detainee at Forward Operating Base Tiger in Iraq died of asphyxia during an interrogation .
The Church Report states that " circumstances should have led " medical personnel " to consider detainee abuse . "
See : action.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/102405/3212.pdf
In June 2003 , a detainee in Al Nasiriyah , Iraq died of strangulation .
His ribs and neck bone were also broken .
According to the Church Report , the " investigation suggests he was beaten and then dragged by the neck by a guard . "
See : action.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/102405/3164.pdf
The House Judiciary Committee will conduct a hearing on May 6 to investigate the issue of accountability for the authorization of torture and abuse by high - level officials .
In October 2003 , the ACLU — along with the Center for Constitutional Rights , Physicians for Human Rights , Veterans for Common Sense , and Veterans for Peace — filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for records concerning the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad .
To date , more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to the ACLU 's FOIA lawsuit .
The newly unredacted documents and the full Church Report are available online at : www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/35110res20080430.html
In addition , many of the FOIA documents are also collected and analyzed in a recently published book by Jaffer and Singh , Administration of Torture .

With any luck , Bob Schieffer 's commentary at the close of Face The Nation will end all further discussion of lapel pins .
Finally , today , I watched the ABC debate the other night when that question came up again about why Senator Obama does n’t wear a flag pin in his lapel .
Since no one asked me , here is my thought on all that .
I think it ’s a nice thing if people want to wear a flag on their lapel .
But I believe it more important to keep the flag behind our lapel in our hearts .
I feel the same way about wearing my religion on my sleeve .
It just fits me better on the inside .
When I go to see our local baseball team , I do wear my Washington Nationals baseball cap .
But am I less a fan if do n’t wear it to work ?
The truth is I have been known to wear a red , white and blue stars and stripes tie on the Fourth of July .
But am I less patriotic when I trade it for my Santa Claus tie at Christmas ?
Patriotism is no more about signs or pins than religion is about reminding others how pious we think we are .
No , the proof in these puddings is not the signs that we wear , but how we act .
Would n’t that also be a better way to judge our presidential candidates than by the jewelry they wear ?

De danske venstrefløj marcherede for sig som rosinen i pølseenden i en demo , der stort set var både køns – og raceopdelt .
Strange bedfellows , indeed .

Danish Pastries
Denmark , long the liberal , open society that welcomed immigrants , has done an about face .
After being the symbolic envy of Universalists , of Socialists , of cultural liberalism , Denmark today has the strictest immigration policy in Europe .
The Muslim population in Denmark , constituting a mere 4 % of the total , refuses to integrate , consumes 40 % of the welfare , and constitutes a majority of the country ’s convicted rapists .
The Danes now acknowledge that their core values of personal liberty , free speech , equality for women and tolerance of other ethnic groups are incompatible with Islam as they know it .
Muslim leaders openly advocate introducing Islamic law in Denmark .
Danes at the forefront of advocating free speech and Western values are subject to fatwas and increasingly violent attacks from the Muslim population . [… ]
Yet little spunky Denmark is showing us and everyone the way .
They opened their borders and their coffers to welcome Muslims , in a show of remarkable generosity and goodwill .
Now , bruised and battered by an unappreciative , increasingly fundamentalist , and sadly uncompromising Muslim community , they are closing their doors and battening down the hatches .

Vælg side , Rønn Hornbech
Af Lene Kattrup , dyrlæge , Stenløse
Det forekommer mig , at Rønn Hornbech føler sig mere og mere presset af den indsigt og viden , hun må have fået som integrationsminister .
Hun ved politisk islam findes og vokser , men hun lader som om , vi kun har at gøre med en religion , som f.eks .
kristendommen .
Når en ubehagelig sandhed går op for én , så er det menneskeligt , at man i første omgang reagerer med vrede .
F.eks .
reagerer mange sådan ved utroskab , at de bliver vrede på budbringeren , der beskyldes for at lyve , eller de lægger skylden på omstændigheder eller andre , der har banet vejen for utroskaben i stedet for at indse , at skylden må hvile på partneren , der har svigtet en tillid og et løfte ..
Senere indser man dette , når man har fået tænk efter og turdet åbne øjnene .
Rønn Hornbech må åbne sine øjne og vælge side , hun kan ikke længere balancere , stolen er ved at brase sammen under hende .
Hun må vide , at det islamiske tørklæde på unge kvinder også her i landet er et symbol på islams lovgrundlag , et symbol den enkelte ikke i dag kan omdefinere , hvad enten hun bærer dette symbol frivilligt eller tvungent .
Hvorfor mon en advokat i Ankara trænger ind i højesteret , dræber en dommer og sårer fire domsmænd på grund af en dom om et tørklæde ?
Hvorfor ser vi overalt i verden , at islamismen breder sig med tørklædet hånd i hånd med sharialoven og kvindeundertrykkelse ?
Premierminister T. Erdogan , der ved , hvad han taler om , siger lige ud at : “ tørklædet er et politisk symbol ” . [..]
Rønn Hornbech står med det politiske ansvar , men tøver overfor den opgave , der ligger foran hende , som består i at vælge mellem islamisk politik og demokratisk politik .
Det ironiske , eller tragiske om man vil , er , at Rønn Hornbech netop hele sit liv har talt om en adskillelse mellem religion og politik ; “ giv kejseren hvad kejserens er og Guds , hvad Guds er ” .
Men nu , da vi står i et afgørende vadested , og hun selv skal aflevere sit svendestykke som minister , svigter hun tilsyneladende .
Vi kan i hvert fald konstatere , at hun nu forsvarer netop den sammenblanding af politik og religion , som hun tidligere har forsaget . [..]
Information , 15 maj
“ Kom og voldtag mig – norske piger har sig selv at takke ”
Når norske jenter går halvnaken på byen er det som å rope « kom og knull meg » , mener de tre afrikanske mennene .
Kjendisadvokat Abid Raja har arbeidsuke som reporter i P4 , og har tatt turen til en café på Grønland i Oslo .
Der treffer han guttegjengen – tre unge menn på 26 , 30 og 35 år fra Somalia og Senegal .
Guttene , som helst ikke vil framstå ved navn , snakker gjerne med P4 om voldtekts - og overfallsbølge som lenge har herjet hovedstaden .
Hør radio - intervjuet til høyre for artikkelen .
min 3:39
– Helt ærlig ?
Nordmenn er helt forferdelige !
– Hva tenker du på ?
– Jeg tenker på alt .
Ikke minst er maten helt for jævlig .
– Hva synes du om de norske damene da ?
– De er noe helt annet !
sier han til latter fra kameratene .
Som Dagbladet .
no skrev mandag ble minst ti kvinner overfalt og antastet av en gjeng gutter av somalisk opprinnelse ved Sofienbergparken i Oslo lørdag kveld .
I fjor ble det anmeldt rekordhøye 161 voldtekter og 35 voldtektsforsøk i Oslo , der gjerningsmannen i over 70 prosent av tilfellene hadde bakgrunn fra et annet land enn Norge .
– Men hør nå , norske jenter klager over at utenlandske gutter gjør ditt og datt , men grunnen til at det skjer mange voldtekter er at norske jenter går nesten helt nakne !
Det er som å si « kom her og knull meg » , skjønner du ?
– Det du sier er at norske jenter ber om å bli voldtatt ?
– Ikke ber akkurat , men når de går ute neste helt nakne og drikker seg drita fulle i Frognerparken eller drar på fest sammen med noen kamerater , og så klager de over å bli voldtatt ?
Det er deres feil .
sier 26 - åringen fra Somalia .
– Men selv om de går lettkledde og drikker seg fulle så ber de jo ikke om å bli voldtatt ?
– Nei , men mange av utlendingene her er ikke vant til dette der hvor de kommer fra .
De er ikke vant til at jenter går kledd som de vil , så kanskje tolker de det litt feil , skjønner du ?
Når det gjelder guttegjengene som i helgen overfalt flere jenter , la dem i bakken og rev av dem klærne ved Sofienbergparken på Grünerløkka , forklarer kafégjengen dette med at guttene var svært unge .
– Var ikke disse guttene unge ?
Sånn i 13 - 14 - årsalderen ?
Jeg tror disse var nysgjerrige på hvordan jenter ser ut .
De var så unge at de visste ikke hva de gjorde , sier den somaliske 35 - åringen til P4 .
30 - åringen kommer fra Senegal , og mener afrikanske menn respekterer kvinner , men at overfallsvoldtektene skjer når mennene drikker .
– Vi som kommer fra Senegal liker ikke å snakke med norske menn , men vi liker norske kvinner .
Dette fordi afrikansk kultur respekterer kvinner , men ikke menn , sier 30 - åringen fra Senegal . ‘
– Men hvorfor angriper unge afrikanske menn norske kvinner ?
– Sånt skjer av og til .
Når vi drikker for mye og blir fulle hender det at vi overfaller dem , men hvis vi ikke drikker , angriper vi ikke kvinner – men respekterer dem , sier senegaleseren på noe gebrokkent engelsk .
Det er 26 - åringen fra Somalia som prater mest .
Han tror sine egne og kameratenes synspunkter representerer holdningene til mange i det somaliske miljøet .
– Tror du ikke mange blir skremt av at dere har slike holdninger hvis P4 sender dette intervjuet på radio ?
– Bare send det , for dette er sant .
Dette er sånn det er – det er fakta .
Jeg lyver ikke .
Jeg har aldri vært sammen med en norsk dame , men jeg har vært borti mange norske jenter – de er ganske hyggelige og veldig flinke i senga , sier 26 - åringen til P4 .
******************************
Reaksjonene strømmet inn til P4 etter radioinnslaget .
Her er et lite utvalg av SMS - reaksjonene fra P4s lyttere :
« Synes det er blitt mer omvendt rasisme .
Vi etniske nordmenn kan ikke si noe før vi er rasister .
Men de [ innvandrere ] kan si hva de vil .
Tror det har blitt fokusert for mye på rasisme den ene veien . »
« 85 % jobber , går på skole og gjør sitt beste for og prøve og leve et bra liv i Norge .
På lik linje med resten av Norges folk .
At “ vi /staten ” ikke har satt oss ned og forklart våre nye landsmenn er vår egen feil .
De siste 15 % er det bare og sende på arbeidsleir på Bjørnøya , sammen med resten av skurkene . »
« Hvis de har det så jævlig blant nordmenn , hvorfor ikke reise hjem ?
Voldtekt er greit når man kler seg billig ?
Fy fader , kom dere HJEM !

« Hvis nordmenn er så fæle , da skjønner jeg ikke hva de gjør i Norge !? »
« Jeg er sjokkert . »
« Det her var bare fleip eller ? »
« Med den type holdninger er det vel ikke rart utviklingen i landet de kommer fra går i retning av degenerering .

« Sier bare “ kapp av ” og send dem hjem . »
« Hadde vi nordmenn gjort noe “ uanstendig ” i et muslimsk land , så ville vi blitt halshogget på flekken .

Snaphanen : S er højreorienterede
Det retoriske kneb ‘ tu quoque ’ bruges i debatter til at give en modstander igen med et ‘ det kan du selv være ’ .
Således har mange – i mangel af argumenter mod hendes viden og personlige erfaringer – kaldt Ayaan Hirsi Ali for “ oplysningsfundamentalist ” eller endog “ højreorienteret ” .
‘ Hun er jo ikke bedre selv ’ , implicerer man , i håbet om at mange glider med på den billige analogi .
På samme måde imødegås Dansk Folkeparti tit og ofte med en påstand om de er ‘ udanske ’ .
Jeg føler mig altid fornærmet og patroniserende behandlet af ophavsfolkene til dette trick .
Som om jeg enfoldigt skulle tænke , ‘ ahaa , det er jo dem selv der er udanske …’
At S regner deres publikum for enfoldige og letpåvirkelige er vel bare noget der ligger i det socialistiske gen .
Dansk Folkeparti siger nu ligeud , at partiet er antimuslimsk .
Det er en melding , der er så kontroversiel , at den er decideret “ udansk ” , mener Socialdemokraterne .
– Nu melder Dansk Folkeparti fuldstændig klart ud , at deres kamp er mod én religion , og det er efter min mening udansk .
Vi bryster os af , at vi har religionsfrihed , men det signal , DF sender , er , at man ekskluderer folk med en bestemt religion , siger Socialdemokraternes integrationsordfører , Henrik Dam Kristensen , til Ritzau . [… ]
S : DF - melding er udansk
Vi kan skrive indlæg , artikler og bøger herfra og til Dommedag om hvordan islam ikke bare er en ‘ religion ’ , men en altomfattende pakke med anvisninger lige fra toiletvaner til – samfundets indretning , alts å politik , men alt vil prelle af på folk som Henrik Dam Kristensen , for hvem forsøg på at score billige points ved at dæmonisere Dansk Folkeparti er vigtigere end alt , selv hans efterkommeres fremtid .
Den bizarre virkelighed , anno 2008 ( LFPC ) .
Birthe Rønn Hornbech – nu med Enhedslisten
Er der to der står sammen i dansk politik , så er det Asmaa Abdol - Hamid og Birthe Rønn Hornbech .
Hvor bevægende .
Jeg ved ikke længere hvad der foregår inde i hovedet på konen , Rønn Hornbech altså , så jeg ved ikke om denne omfavnelse er velkommen , eller om den er halal eller haram .
Politik nu om dage er en tur i rutschebanen eller i det tossede hus , om man vil .
Må vi ikke snart ramme ind i El Inglés ’ “ diskontinuitet ” , så alt dette vanvid kan fordampe som dug for solen , og ‘ rigtigt ’ og ‘ forkert ’ igen kan blive omfattet af konsensus blandt danskerne ?
Dette vanvid er en daglig belastning .
Ikke mindre vanvittigt er , at Asmaa , som aldrig har afsværget sharia og al dens væsen for altid , kan tale om “ vore danske værdier ” , og , tør jeg godt garantere , ikke blive forholdt dette åbenlyse hykleri af nogen i mainstreammedierne .
Hvilken ‘ chutzpah ’ , men hun ved udmærket at i det Danmark hvor kulturelt selvhad er normen kan hun slippe up åtalt fra det ( LFPC ) .
[ …]
Efter massiv kritik fra partifællerne i Venstre får integrationsminister Birthe Rønn Hørnbech støtte fra Asmaa Abdol - Hamid fra Enhedslisten . [… ]
» Det er befriende , at der stadig er politikere , som seriøst arbejder imod , at friheden bliver begrænset « , siger Asmaa Abdol - Hamid . [… ]
» Dansk Folkepartis holdninger er rigtig , rigtig ekstreme .
De er med til at true vore grundlæggende frihedsrammer og danske værdier « , siger hun . [ … ] [ mine fremhævelser , LFPC ] Asmaa bakker op om Birthe Rønn
Lille artige Lene - pige Espersen med de fine , rene hænder forstår slet , slet ikke at alt her i verden ikke skulle være lige godt
Bemærk den implicitte moralske ækvivalens : Afstandstagen fra en totalitær religion / ideologi som står for de fleste politiske voldshandlinger i verden , og som har demokratiets afskaffelse som mål , er det samme som afstandstagen fra et fuldt demokratisk dansk parti .
Jamen , hvad skulle alle de gode , fromme mennesker med utilsmudsede hænder dog gøre , hvis de ikke havde væmmelige Dansk Folkeparti at profilere deres godhed ud fra ?
Påtaget uvidenhed og naivitet fra landets justitsminister ( LFPC ) :
Det er direkte usympatisk , at Dansk Folkeparti erklærer sig antimuslimsk , mener justitsminister Lene Espersen ( K ) . [… ]
– Det er meget , meget underligt som parti at definere sig selv som modstandere af nogle andre .
Jeg synes , at man som parti skal definere sig ud fra sine egne værdier , siger hun til Ritzau .
– Da Ny Alliance under valgkampen startede og definerede sig som modstander af Dansk Folkeparti , da sagde Dansk Folkeparti , at det var besynderligt at definere sig som modstander nogle andre .
Nu gør de præcis det samme , som Ny Alliance gjorde .
Det synes jeg er meget inkonsekvent , siger Lene Espersen .
Lene E. : Usympatisk at være antimuslim
Dansk Folkepartis umulige kamp mod at blive ‘ misforstået ’
Det er på den ene side et spørgsmål om evne til at forstå forskellen mellem ‘ troende ’ og ‘ trossystem ’ ( eller religion ) : Mennesker af kød og blod , for de flestes vedkommende opdraget ind i den muslimske tro , kontra troen selv , som den nu opfattes ud fra ‘ hellige ’ tekster , leveregler , tolkninger og lovskoler , og ritualer .
Det er faktisk ikke noget der kræver særlig intelligens eller abstraktionsevne , de fleste klarer det fint i de fleste andre sammenhænge , men lige præcis for dette mere og mere påtrængende eksempels vedkommende går det erfaringsmæssigt galt .
Den gådefulde og lidet meddelsomme Birthe Rønn Hornbech måtte som bekendt en tur i Københavns Byret fordi hun havde så umanerligt svært ved at forst å
Jesper Langballes hentydning til Hartvig Frischs bog Pest over Europa , om nazismen – ikke om tyskere i almindelighed – i hans ord om islam som en “ pest over Europa ” .
Hornbech viste så forleden i sin kronik i Politiken , at hun stadig intet har forstået .
Imidlertid hænger dette så nok sammen med den anden side af sammenblandingen af islam / muslim , nemlig om viljen til at forstå og acceptere sondringen .
Sammenblanding af ordene er en uhyggeligt effektiv stråmand at pådutte debatmodtagere man ikke kan argumentere imod , og alene af den grund kæmper Dansk Folkeparti en håbløs kamp mod ‘ misforståelsen ’ ( LFPC ) .
[ …] Dansk Folkeparti erklærer sig kun antimuslimsk på “ visse strækninger ” , understreger Kristian Thulesen Dahl , partiets gruppeformand i Folketinget .
Han mener , at blandt andre justitsminister Lene Espersen ( K ) misbruger og kritiserer hans udtalelse onsdag om at være antimuslimsk .
– Det bruges til at give indtryk af , at vi er ude med en ny strategi , en nærmest tilrettelagt kampagne til kamp mod muslimerne , siger Kristian Thulesen Dahl til Ritzau . [… ]
– Når jeg siger på visse strækninger , så understreger jeg , at jeg ikke erklærer DF for at være et antimuslimsk parti , selv om jeg kan se , at det er det , der står tilbage i dag . [… ]
DF : Vi er ikke fuldstændig antimuslimske
Op og ned i paternosteren : Birthe Rønn Hornbechs ukendte transformation
JP i dag har en underholdende historie om en panisk integrationsministers flugt fra pressen via Folketingets paternosterelevator , lammet af sceneskræk eller frygt for nærgående spørgsmål .
Der var engang , hvor blot navnet Birthe Rønn Hornbech kunne få selv granvoksne islamapologeter til at skælve .
Fra en fjern , fjern fortid , før et endnu ikke beskrevet holdningsskift resulterede i det konfuse fruentimmer vi i dag kan opleve fremstamme sit “ ingen kommentarer ” , Birthe Rønn Hornbech 1.0 for fuld udblæsning :
Jeg vil ikke have en personlig sekretær i Folketinget med slør .
Jeg vil slet ikke have en sekretær , der tilhører islam , og jeg vil ikke have en sekretær , der er medlem af Enhedslisten , og jeg har sagt nej til adskillige politisk engagerede ansøgere , der er medlem af Venstres ungdom , for dem vil jeg heller ikke have til et sekretærjob . [… ]
Men det det må så være en menneskeret for en arbejdsgiver , selv at fastsætte de kvalifikationskrav , der er nødvendige for at beklæde en ganske bestemt stilling .
Og det er at gøre vold på denne ret , når arbejdsministeren ved lov vil forsøge at gennemtvinge en såkaldt ligestilling af etniske minoriteter på arbejdsmarkedet , ligesom en sådan lov vil skade de såkaldte etniske minoriteter . [… ]
De toneangivende – fortrinsvis danskere – der i debatten forsøger at slå bekymrede og fædrelandskærlige danskere i hovedet med propaganda om racisme og ligestilling burde stoppe op og spørge sig selv , hvem de egentlig gavner . [… ]
Tværtimod er netop disse toneangivendes arrogance , bedrevidenhed og meningseksercits , samt den alt for ustyrlige udlændingelovgivning medvirkende til , at der desværre kan findes eksempler på at udlejere og arbejdsgivere har forfulgt usaglige formål for at udelukke udlændinge .
[…]
Bare vi dog kunne komme så langt , at det blev naturligt at diskutere på den danske , bramfri måde også med og om udlændinge , uden at de bedrevidende danskere råber diskrimination og forskelsbehandling .[… ] .

THE STUDIES “ Land Clearing and the Carbon Biofuel Debt ” by Joseph Fargione et al. , and “ Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions From Land Use Change ” by Timothy Searchinger et al. , both published in the February 7 , 2008 , issue of Science .
THE QUESTION
Will switching from fossil fuels to biofuels really reduce greenhouse gases ?
We take a close look at two big , controversial studies that examine carbon emissions from the ecosystems torn down to produce biofuels .
THE METHODS
Throughout the Amazonian rain forest and the savanna of Brazil , enormous swaths of land are being converted to farms for growing soybeans and sugarcane — all for use in creating biofuels .
The tropical rain forest and peatland of Indonesia and Malaysia and the grasslands of the United States are also being converted to biofuel crops .
It is a disturbing trend , says Joseph Fargione , regional science director at the Nature Conservancy , who conducted the first of the two studies examined here .
With his colleagues Fargione took a close look at how the areas being transformed into farmland have acted as carbon dioxide storage systems .
Trees , grass , and other flora take in the gas , Fargione says , incorporating the carbon into their structures .
But when the land is converted for agriculture , the plants are cut down , burned , or processed , and the stored carbon is eventually released back into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases .
Using numbers from nearly 50 previous studies , Fargione ’s team calculated the amount of carbon stored in these landscapes and the up - front carbon cost for each acre of land converted to produce biofuels .
In the second study , Timothy Searchinger , a researcher at Princeton University , looked at a future scenario in which the United States substantially increases its production of corn - based ethanol , a move that would decrease domestic crops for food and feedstock .
These feed crops have to be grown somewhere , however , and the worldwide land conversions necessary to make up for lost U.S. crops would release carbon dioxide .
To show the effect of such changes , Searchinger and his colleagues simulated the worldwide land - use changes necessary to offset the production of 56 billion liters of ethanol in the United States ( the amount of ethanol projected to be processed in 2016 , based on current tax credits and conservative estimates of oil prices ) .
Using an economic model created at Iowa State University , the researchers projected how much land farmers around the world would have to convert to feed - crop production , and where they would do it .
From this the researchers were able to estimate the total greenhouse emissions due to land conversion .
THE RESULTS
Both studies found that changes in land use related to biofuel production would be a significant source of greenhouse gases in the future .
Fargione reported that , overall , biofuels would cause higher total emissions for tens to hundreds of years .
Some ecosystems had surprisingly high emissions — grasslands in the United States converted to corn farms would increase carbon dioxide for 93 years .
Searchinger ’s outlook is bleaker :
He estimates that the rise in corn-based ethanol production in the United States would increase greenhouse gases , relative to what our current , fossil - fuel - based economy produces , for 167 years .
THE MEANING
“ Any biofuel that causes clearing of natural ecosystems is likely to increase global warming , ” Fargione says .
But not all bio­fuels are alike .
For one , sugarcane ethanol , produced in Brazil , stands out to both researchers as the most efficient source studied , in terms of emissions .
As long as there is land conversion , though , biofuels do not diminish carbon dioxide emissions .
Biofuels made from sources that do not require land conversion , such as corn stover ( the parts of corn plants left over after the ears are harvested ) , animal waste , damaged trees , algae , and food waste are promising alternatives .
STATS BEHIND THE STUDY • Plants and soils contain almost three times as much carbon as the atmosphere .
•
About 20 percent of total current carbon emissions comes from land - use change .
•
In 2004 , 74 million acres of U.S. land were devoted to corn forlivestock feed as well as food crops .
By 2016 about 43 percent of thatarea will be used to harvest corn for ethanol .
• 27 percent of new palm oil plantations in Indonesia are created onland that began as tropical rain forest ; 1.5 percent of these lands arebeing deforested each year .
•
In 2006 the United States produced 250 million gallons of biodiesel .
Total production capacity is already 1.4 billion gallons a year and isexpected to more than double with new plants and expansion of existingones .
• 2006 ethanol capacity was 4.4 billion gallons , with an expectedincrease of 2.1 billion gallons with current construction and expansionprojects .
• U.S. gasoline consumption is 389 million gallons per day , or about 142 billion gallons per year .
ANOTHER VIEW
Bruce Dale , a biofuels researcher at MichiganState University , says there is a huge amount of uncertainty whenbasing predictions on an inherently complex economic model .
Additionally , he asserts that the United States should not beresponsible for “ anything but its own environmental profile ” and thatto take into account world land changes is unreasonable .
NathanaelGreene of the Natural Resources Defense Council responds that it isappropriate to incorporate economic models into life - cycle emissionsanalyses such as these .
In contrast to Dale , he says that land - usechanges in other nations should not be left out of calculations ofbiofuel impacts , since such indirect effects are commonly incorporatedinto environmental regulations .
POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES
Using agricultural waste rather than actual agriculture to create biofuels removes the need for land conversion — much of the stuff is just lying around — and produces more fuel than corn :
In thecase of corn stover ( the leaves andstalks remaining in the field after corn is harvested ) , 250 million dry tonsare produced each year and are rarely utilized , other than to feed grazingcattle immediately after a harvest .
Scientists believe that some stover shouldremain in the field to prevent soil erosion , but that still leaves about 40 to 50 percent to be used in making biofuels .
An efficient way to break down celluloseinto ethanol is necessary to reduce the cost of processing corn stover on acommercial scale .
Last February , the Department of Energy selected sixcompanies to receive funding towards building ethanol plants — scheduled to beoperational within the next three years — that will utilize new technology forprocessing corn stover as well as other types of agricultural waste .
Incontrast to corn stover , wood wastehas limited potential due to the high cost associated with collection andtransportation ( in the case of wood left over from timber harvesting ) andcompeting uses ( in the case of mill residues , which are currently used formulch , particle board , and to power other facilities ) .
Many farmshave already developed methods of converting the billions of tons of animal waste produced each year intomethane for electrical and heat energy ; beginning in March , 1,200 households inCalifornia will be powered by cow manure .
Still , using animal waste to createbiofuels is not yet feasible on the national level because transporting it isunrealistic .
It 's in areas where there are lots of cattle ( and the large amountsof manure they inevitably give back to the world ) that companies are bestequipped to divert animal waste from contaminating the air ( via methane , CO 2 , and ammonia gases ) and water towards fueling ethanol production .
One example isPanda Ethanol , which is building the largest biomass plant in the United Statesin Hereford , Texas , where it will use the waste of 3.5 milliongrazing cattle to fuel the production of approximately 115 million gallons ofethanol per year .
In the United States , 96 billion pounds of foodis wasted each year and much of it ends up in landfills where it emitsgreenhouse gases .
Through anaerobic digestion — the bacterial breakdown oforganic materials — food waste can be converted into biofuel .
In California , Onsite Power Systems , Inc. has begun commercial production of an anaerobicdigester system that uses a special design to create the optimal environmentfor bacteria and ultimately more efficient and cost - effective conversion offood waste to biogases ( hydrogen and methane ) .
These biogases can be used incars or to heat homes .
Algae may be the most promising biofuel .
Not only does algae use carbon dioxide to grow ( and could potentially use CO2 from power plants to create biofuel ) , but it can grow anywhere and does notrequire a large area to propagate .
Somespecies are made of up to 50 % of their body weight in oil which can beextracted and processed to create biodiesel .
Currently , the National Renewable Energy Laboratory is collaborating withChevron to develop more cost - effective processes for growing and harvestinglarge quantities of the green fuel .
The US currently has about 17,000 troops deployed in Afghanistan The US intends to send a " significant " number of extra troops to aid Nato 's effort in Afghanistan in 2009 , Defence Secretary Robert Gates has said .
The unspecified increase will come regardless of whether US troop levels in Iraq are reduced , Mr Gates said .
US President George Bush made the offer at a Nato summit in Romania , he said .
Although the final decision will rest with the next president , Mr Gates said there was bipartisan backing for " success " in Afghanistan .
The US currently has about 17,000 troops deployed in Afghanistan .
Map of the main troop deployments in Afghanistan " The president indicated that he expected in 2009 that the United States would make a significant additional contribution , " said Mr Gates as he flew from the Bucharest summit to the Gulf state of Oman .
Shortfalls
The defence secretary added that combating Taleban insurgents in Afghanistan would remain a high priority for the next US president , regardless of their political affiliation .
" I believe this is one area where there is very broad bipartisan support in the United States for being successful and I think that no matter who is elected they will want to be successful in Afghanistan , " said Mr Gates .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy had earlier said more French troops would be deployed to Afghanistan , easing fears of a crisis within the Western coalition there .
The US says the French move , expected to involve up to 1,000 extra soldiers , will free up some of its troops to move to southern Afghanistan , where Canada had demanded Nato reinforcements be sent .
Canada 's parliament voted last month to extend its military mission in volatile southern Afghanistan to 2011 - but only if its allies sent reinforcements .
BBC Defence and Security Correspondent Rob Watson says troop shortfalls in Afghanistan have been estimated at between 7,000 and 10,000 soldiers .
Until now at least the conflict in Iraq has restricted the number of troops a decidedly stretched US military has available for Afghanistan , he says .
Separately , Russia and Nato signed a deal allowing the alliance to transport non-lethal freight to Afghanistan through Russian territory .
A Nato spokeswoman said the agreement covered a range of items from food to some military equipment .

I think I know what 's going on here ... These people are n't attacking all non-Christians because they can at least personallywith somebody else 's belief ; regardless of whether or not they agree with it .
They are allies in the same sense that members of two opposing armies can feel a comradery with one other .
Rather , it is theof atheists that bothers them .
These people have faith so thoroughly engrained in their lives that to see somebody without a trace threatens them .
They simply cannot conceive of somebody not believing in a deity ofsort .
The idea is completely foreign to them , and therefore menacing .
It forces them to evaluate their own beliefs .
They become defensive and attack because the things they hold intrinsically and unquestionably sacred are being challenged by the mere philosophical position of another .
Most atheists do not " believe " that god does not exist .
Rather , they dismiss it as a possibility due to a complete lack of evidence .
Otherwise , they'd have to entertain the possibility of believing in anything and everything ... which is the essential problem of agnosticism .
Therefore , it does not take faith to be an atheist .
If the evidence changes , then most would certainly be reasonable enough to revaluate their positions .
Until then , the existence of god is simply a non-issue for them .
Some theists have decried this materialistic position , but without much real avail .
What possibilities are we losing if we only believe in things that leave evidence behind ?
Ghosts , leprechauns , fairies and gods ... everything in the realm of the superstitious , but nothing else .
I can comfortably live with that ; just as a Christian can comfortably live with the idea of worshipping Jehovah but not Shiva .
They accuse atheists of leading selfish , corrupt , and immoral lives without fear of consequences .
They accuse atheists of lacking moral codes .
This is , of course , irrational , fear - mongering nonsense .
Today 's atheist is not a self - indulgent modern Caligula or a Stalin .
Today 's atheist is not a socially maladjusted anarchist who lives their lives without fear of retribution .
According to a 1997 statistic , only 0.209 % of prisoners incarcerated in the United States identify as atheists .
Since atheists currently represent roughly 14 % of the overall U.S. population , this is a significant indicator of the " morality " of the modern atheist .
Today 's atheist tends to be a well - educated , productive member of society who more often than not subscribes to the notions of moral relativism and secular humanism ... which essentially means that we realize we 're all stuck on this big ball together and we must work to set aside our differences and build a better future , because it 's all that there is .
That does n't sound at all like the monstrous picture that 's recently been smeared here by certain self - proclaimed loving Christians .
These rabid believers clash with atheists knowing perfectly well that they are helpless to alter the ideological perceptions of their perceived foe .
Why then , do they choose to partake of this exchange of bad blood ?
Because they 're angry and they 're frightened .
They 're angry because we have the nerve to indirectly challenge their insecurely - held beliefs with our continued existence .
They 're frightened because they fear that they 're losing their foothold on the theocratic monopolization of America ( school prayer , Christian - oriented legislature , etc. ) ... an officially secular country , mind you .
Lashing out , spreading lies and misconceptions , and demonizing the enemy is a natural way to react to opposition ; however contrary to the teachings of their professed lord and savior .
Any anti-atheist backlash you 're witnessing here is simply the result of reactionary mean - spiritedness , and nothing more .
The misinformation is a sign of desperation .
I suppose they believe what they 're saying is true in the same sense that many Muslim fundamentalists believe that America is directly in league with the devil .
Feeling " right " about the subjective tends to breed violent paranoia when challenged .
Mind the danger in that whatever you choose to believe .
I can't say that some atheists are n't guilty of the same indiscretion , but it 's a generalization to categorize all atheists this way just as it's a generalization to categorize all Christians as rabid fundamentalists .
I 've been careful to avoid doing so here , despite the disrespect shown us by some members of the Christian community .
Personally , I 'm a firm believer in live - and - let - live .
I believe Christ was too .
I do n't attack others for their beliefs .
I do n't even ask that others question their beliefs .
Everyone has a right to decide what they hold dear .
I do n't write slanderous , inaccurate or inflammatory material about adherents ofreligion .
But I do defend my positions , because I hold them dear .
I find it completely abhorrent that those who attack mine do so under the protective woolen guise of love and fellowship .
It allows them to appear to hold the upper hand while hitting below the belt .
The atheist in America is already a misunderstood and hated underdog , and people tend to ignore the callous disregard they are often shown by these " gentle lambs of God . "
Were it not for atheists being their current preferred cannon fodder , I 'm certain these unyielding fanatics would be baring their claws and coming for you other non-Christians and moderates next .
Watch your step .
This is part two of the Mental Handicap series , see part one here .
I 'm usually not one to turn my blogs into a gripe station , but this one needs to be aired .
I 'm sure most of you have had this experience in your life in one store or another .
You find yourself sitting at home and realize you really need something , be it toilet paper , cat food , whatever .
This forces you to make a quick run to the store to pick it up .
Even though you use the express lane , you 're there for 45 minutes .
I 'm assuming not all of my readers are from a busy metropolitan city and cant directly relate to this , but hear me out .
I run into Wal - Mart at around 11:30 pm to pick up some lunch meat and some cat litter .
It 's a Sunday night and I need to get back home and get to bed as I need to work the next morning .
I run in , find the items I need and now it 's around 11:45 , I get to the express lane to check out so I can make a quick escape , when all of a sudden this woman slides her cart in front of me and begins to check out .
The bad part about this is that although it 's a 20 items or less lane , this woman has a whole cart full of food and clothes , basically , the works .
As she is piling her stuff onto the little counter usually reserved for people like me who have 2 or 3 things , the cashier is just looking at her dumbfounded because she does n't have one of the black conveyors that are usually used for this transaction , so this woman is piling items on top of items in order to empty her cart .
After about 15 minutes of this , all the items are finally scanned and the woman now has to look for her card .
This is another 10 minute process because " I know it 's here somewhere . "
Meanwhile , back at the ranch , the line has formed to now 7 people , including some annoyed , already drunk frat guys who are wanting to purchase their 2 bottles of Smirnoff and some orange juice , a crackhead homeless guy who just wants to buy a candy bar , and myself .
She , seeing this , turns around to apologize to me , not because she just wasted 20 minutes piling her stuff on the counter , but with a giggle , that she can't find her card .
Finally , I get to buy my stuff and I 'm out the door within 5 minutes from that time .
All this for a loaf of bread , 2 deli meats , and cat litter .
I swear , I could make this blog all about the stupid people I encounter in my every day life , but there 's enough of those out there .
Breve guida all ’utilizzo di Git alla maniera di CVS su piattaforma Windows ( XP Pro in questo caso ) , ovvero la sintesi del peggio .
Scenario
Due sviluppatori decidono di collaborare ad un progetto Java , si tratta di :
Gino – sviluppatore Java , lavora su Windows
Lino – sviluppatore tuttofare , lavora su Mac Os X
Lino possiede una macchina CentOS su cui gira un server SVN a casa propria , il tutto funziona bene ma Lino si annoia e spiana la macchina per effettuare alcuni esperimenti .
Nel frattempo accade nell ’ordine che :
L’esigenza di avere un repository comune per i sorgenti del progetto si fa incalzante
Git diventa famoso GitHub apre i battenti
Il resto è storia …
Step 1 – account su GitHub
E’ la parte più facile , Lino va su http://github.com
e registra un account , per ora si accontenta di quello gratuito , che se da un lato non offre la possibilità di avere repository privati , dall ’altro è completo in termini di funzionalità a meno del servizio SSL ( ma visto che il repository è comunque pubblico… ) .
Step 2 – setup di msysgit su Winbloze
La fama di Git è letteralmente esplosa e il supporto per Windows non ha tenuto il passo .
Fortunatamente dei ragazzi volenterosi hanno messo insieme un pacchetto di installazione a partire da materiale esistente : msysgit .
Una volta installato , Lino ha a disposizione una shell Unixlike con git 1.5.5 già configurato , ssh e chicche varie .
Ci sarebbe anche una GUI Tcl ma Lino non è riuscito a farla funzionare .
Per evitare che i logs relativi ai suoi commit su GitHub siano attribuiti all ’utente unknown , Lino indica a git il suo username ; dalla shell di msysgit , al prompt digita
$ git config -- global user.name " lino " $ git config -- global user.email lino@example.com
Step 3 – setup delle chiavi ssh
Chi come Lino non ha una coppia di chiavi ssh ( !!!) può generarle usando proprio msysgit .
Dal menu Start -> Programmi ->
Git selezionare la voce Git , si apre una finestra contente la shell ; al prompt digitare
ssh -keygen - C “ username@email.com ” -t rsa
Lino fornisce una password ed accetta le opzioni che il programma suggerisce per il nome e la destinazione dei due files contenenti le chiavi , che finiranno in ~/.ssh / che tradotto nel path NTFS diventa C : \Documents and Settings \Lino\.ssh .
Successivamente bisogna fornire la chiave pubblica a GitHub : basta fare login , editare il proprio account ( in alto a destra ) e copiare ed incollare il contenuto della chiave pubblica ( che è stato salvato in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ) nell ’apposito box .
Step 4 – Creazione del repository
Ovviamente se il repository già esiste questo step è superfluo .
Basta avviare la procedura a questo link : http://github.com/repositories/new e digitare i comandi suggeriti nella shell di msysgit .
Step 5 – Clone del repository ( era : cvs checkout )
Per iniziare a lavorare sul repository remoto bisogna effettuare quello che con CVS avremmo chiamato checkout : il clone del repository .
Nel pannello di controllo di GitHub , fra i dettagli del proprio progetto , Lino trova il seguente :
Public Clone URL : git://github.com/lino/progettox.git
Dalla shell di msysgit Lino punta sulla cartella di lavoro che conterrà il progetto e poi esegue il cosiddetto clone :
$ git clone git://github.com/lino/progettox.git ProgettoX
Se tutto va bene ora nella cartella di lavoro dovrebbe esserci una nuova cartella chiamata ProgettoX contenente i sorgenti .
Siamo operativi , Lino può festeggiare e cominciare ad usare Git proprio come faceva con CVS …
Push delle modifiche ( era : cvs commit )
Lino modifica alcuni files nel repository locale clonato da quello su github ; per spedire le modifiche sul repository remoto esegue il cosiddetto push .
Per prima cosa , Lino esegue un commit locale , come farebbe con CVS :
$ git commit - m" messaggio di commit "
In seguito , come per il link del clone , Lino recupera da GitHub il push url .
Poi , dalla cartella ProgettoX :
$ git push git://github.com/lino/progettox.git
Pull delle modifiche ( era : cvs update )
Gino ha già fatto il clone del repository su GitHub , per recuperare le ultime modifiche di Lino al progetto esegue il pull :
$ git pull
Considerazioni
L’utilizzo di Git alla maniera di CVS consente agli sviluppatori di cambiare sistema di SCM con il minor sforzo mentale possibile ma , come ci si può aspettare , utilizzare git in questo modo è un po ’ uno spreco …
Git ha l’enorme vantaggio di essere un sistema distribuito , perciò ogni repository locale è un’entità autonoma rispetto al progetto complessivo , vale a dire che Lino può branchare localmente il repository , effettuare delle modifiche per conto suo , tornare sulla master branch ( la CVS HEAD ) quando collabora col team e ancora ritornare sulla propria branch nel tempo libero .
Quando pronto potrà fare un merge della branch locale sulla master locale , e solo successivamente fare il push sul repository remoto … e questo è solo per fare un esempio , le possibilità sono veramente tante !

DataQuick is reporting Southland home sales log tepid gain ; record price drop .
A total of 12,808 new and resale houses and condos sold in Los Angeles , Riverside , San Diego , Ventura , San Bernardino and Orange counties in March .
That was up 18.8 percent from 10,777 the previous month but down 41.4 percent from 21,856 in March 2007 , according to DataQuick Information Systems .
March was the seventh consecutive month in which sales have fallen to the lowest level on record for that particular month .
On average , March sales have been about twice as high - 25,407 - as last month .
Foreclosure resales - houses sold after being foreclosed on continue to dominate many inland neighborhoods .
More than one out of three Southland homes that resold last month , nearly 38 percent , had been foreclosed on at some point in the prior year .
The sharp and sudden drop of the Southland median price reflects a combination of factors , mainly depreciation , especially in areas hammered by foreclosures , and a big shift in the types of homes selling .
Since last August , when the continuing credit crunch hit , sales have plunged for more expensive homes financed with " jumbo " mortgages , which until recently were defined as loans over $ 417,000 .
NAHB : Nation in " Mild Recession "
“ The worse - than - anticipated housing downturn , combined with systematic weakening of the labor market and rapidly rising energy and food prices , has taken a heavy toll on American consumers , ” said NAHB ’s David Seiders .
“ It ’s now clear that we have entered what we anticipate will be a mild recession , running through the first half of this year , and there are substantial downside risks to this economic scenario . ”
To guard against a longer and deeper downturn , Seiders said that Congress should take immediate steps to stimulate the economy through actions specifically targeted at improving the ailing housing market -- such as a temporary home buyer tax credit , modernization of the Federal Housing Administration and oversight reform for the housing - related government sponsored enterprises .
“ Stimulus bills recently passed in the Senate and the House Ways and Means Committee are welcome steps in the right direction .
This is one instance where prompt and appropriate efforts by the nation ’s lawmakers could make a significant difference in limiting the depth and duration of the economic downturn . ”
The National Association of Home Builders says Nation in " Mild Recession "
To guard against a weakening US dollar , Congress should tell David Seiders and the NAHB where to go .
Neither the NAHB nor the NAR saw these housing declines coming , but somehow they know what the answer is .
The answer is always the same : more handouts to the NAHB and the NAR .
Unfortunately political pandering won the day , as it typically does .
But hold on to your hats because this recession has no chance of staying mild regardless of what Congress does .
See Case for an " L " Shaped Recession for a discussion of how mild this recession is likely to be .
Those thinking of buying a house now , especially in California , may want to rethink their plans .
I see no reason to change the dates I set last October in When Will Housing Bottom ? and Housing - The Worst Is Yet To Come .
Start looking for a bottom , or at least more reasonable prices in 2011 - 2012 .

Porn preview sites are n't known for their usability .
You 're familiar with the template , I 'm sure .
The standard design looks like someone spilled a box of dirty photos across a black laminate floor and then vandalized the result with several colors of primary paint .
In all caps .
With lots of misspellings and exclamation points !!!
It 's bad enough when you can see it .
But what if you have a visual impairment ?
Your screen - reader software would probably spit out a few choice words and crash out of sheer spite .
Porn for the Blind , a nonprofit organization based in Cambridge , Mass. , was established for the sole purpose of making the millions of free porn clips available online accessible to people with visual impairments .
Given the abundance of audio erotica , pornographic podcasts and adult online radio , you might think that Porn for the Blind is at best unnecessary , or at worst , a hoax .
Yet there 's something hot about the absolute amateur quality of the submissions , just like a homemade snapshot capturing real sexual energy can have more impact than a studio photograph of a professional model .
" We imagine that visually impaired people benefit from this service in many of the same ways that non-visually impaired people benefit from the raw hard - core pornography that 's being described , " says the site 's co-founder , who asked to be identified simply as Elmer .
The method ?
Volunteer audiodescribers watch porn preview videos and describe the content as it unfolds , using the site 's recording software to capture the audio and post it to the home page .
At press time , the collection had about 14 descriptions – two of which I recorded myself .
Not a huge showing for a site that launched two years ago .
But sometime around April 1 ( I know , I know ) , bloggers discovered the service .
In three days , the site streamed more than 40 GB of audio descriptions to more than 50,000 visitors , says Elmer .
The website itself is simple .
It has no images , no video and no ads , just text on a white background .
A sighted person accustomed to the visual assault of most websites could easily pass it by .
The homepage presents a welcome message and links to audio descriptions with titles like " Cum Overload . "
A second page contains an embedded audio recorder and directions for contributing a description , along with a list of sites users would like to hear described .
" Porn for the Blind is a distributed , community - generated accessibility project , and it is an interactive experience , " Elmer says .
" Users can request a site to be described or publish their own descriptions . "
It takes more skill than you'd think to record a real - time description of a 20 - second porn clip .
You have to watch your ums and ohs – and if the scene flat - out does it for you , you have to remember to keep talking .
In my first attempt ( .mp3 ) , I spoke too fast and wasted words on useless description .
Would the colors of the pillowcases matter to a blind porn consumer ?
Probably not : Sighted porn users do n't care about pillowcases either .
But the length and texture of the woman's hair , the lean muscles of the male bodies , the shape of breasts and buttocks – those details have meaning for everyone .
For my second clip ( .mp3 ) , I watched the video twice first , making liberal use of the pause button and taking notes .
I then experimented with recording a somewhat longer description than the video , so I could add detail without having to rush .
But that results in audio that 's out of sync with the video – not very useful for partners watching and listening together .
Most surprising was how quickly my contributions appeared on the site .
It took approximately two seconds after I submitted the description for the new MP3 to appear in the list .
How do the site 's operators know whether I followed the script ?
Or that I did n't just talk dirty and leave a 900 number for blind users to call me for phone sex ?
They do n't .
But so far , contributors have not abused the freedom of instant publishing .
" We may implement some Craigslist - style flagging if it becomes a problem , " says Elmer .
" In the end , the site must be community - driven if it 's going to scale . "
Elmer says he has fielded requests from other organizations wanting to license the software behind the site .
Not that they could n't build their own .
" All the technology we use is open source ( Flex , Red5 , FFmpeg ) and not excessively difficult to string together , " he says .
New developments will stem from user feedback , Elmer says .
For example , some have expressed interest in a Firefox plug - in that could automatically play back descriptions of any pornography sample clips on a given web page .
Some Porn for the Blind listeners also wish the descriptions were " sexier or narrated by women , " Elmer says .
" But we 've been extremely impressed with most of the contributions .
People are clearly putting time and effort into their descriptions and we thank them for that . "
The saying " that 's like porn for the blind " is an old joke , but like the toothing hoax of a few years ago , community participation is making Porn for the Blind real .
Now if you 'll excuse me , I have another 20 - second date with straightboysfucking .com .
See you in a fortnight ,

The traditional Christmas story of how the baby Jesus came to be born in a manger after Mary and Joseph found that there was no room at the inn , is traditionally performed by Key Stage One pupils all around the country .
However , staff at Mount Pleasant School were concerned about causing offence to non-Christians by placing too much emphasis on the religious overtones of the story .
‘ With many families from other faiths or none , we do not wish to cause offence at the time of our mid-winter festival , ’ said headteacher Jackie Hunt .
‘ The nativity is a charming traditional tale , but there is no need to present it as a piece of pro-Christian propaganda . ’
Early on in the play , five - year - old Molly Johnson announces ‘ Lo , there is a great star in the sky , which is easily explained by rational and scientific means and certainly does not prove the existence of some sort of supernatural diety . ’
Although the shepherds insist that they did see angels in the sky above Bethlehem , on further questioning they admit that they had been eating magic mushrooms the night before .
‘ Of course there are carols , ’ explained Ms Hunt , ‘ but the new lyrics are less about ‘ glory to the new born king ’ and more about any outstanding moral issues having to be resolved in this world rather than in some mythical afterlife . ’
The Year Two teacher who rewrote the traditional Bible story insists that her version probably bears a closer resemblance to real events .
‘ If they had thought he was the son of God they would n’t have put him in the cowshed would they ?
For a major celeb like that they would have turfed out all the other guests and given them the deluxe honeymoon wing with en-suite bathroom . ’
The play climaxes with Mary coming clean to Joseph about the so - called ‘ virgin birth . ’
‘ Actually Joseph , I was not visited by an Angel nine months ago , ’ confesses six - year - old Sally Harris .
‘ I am not carrying the son of God .
It is the son of your brother Kevin .
To be honest I ca n’t believe you fell for it . ’

A Nation of Sheep , Napolitano , Andrew P. Nashville , Tennessee : Thomas Nelson , 2007 .
240 Pages , Amazon Sale Price $ 17.15 .
As I write this review of Judge Andrew Napolitano ’s A Nation of Sheep , I am about 37,000 feet above the ground in a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 .
That means that I dutifully took off my shoes , belt and whatever else I had on my being that was metallic and went sheep - like through the infamous Transportation Security Administration gauntlet .
On my trip to the airport , I made sure I did not violate speed limits — or at least drive fast enough to be conspicuous on the highway — and at the rest stops , I did not park in the spaces that were reserved for Pennsylvania state troopers .
Once on the plane , I did not violate FAA regulations or do anything that would call unwanted attention to me .
When we land in Las Vegas , I will make sure that I do exactly what the authorities tell me , and when I fly back home in four days , you can bet I will not place my flying " privileges " in jeopardy .
To most Americans , obeying the authorities at all times , especially in the post - 9/11 age , seems like the thing to do .
I recall a conversation with a prominent conservative evangelical who works in Washington , D.C. , barking the following words to me : " Are you telling me that our government is tyrannical ? "
The tone of his voice , and the things he said afterward clearly indicated that the U.S. Government , and especially government under the Republican Party , displays no telltale signs of tyranny .
After all , he reasoned , tyranny is carried out by people with " SS " on their collars , who wear leather boots , goose step , give stiff - armed salutes , and speak in a foreign language .
Tyranny is Hitler , or Stalin , or Pol Pot , or Bill and Hillary Clinton .
Judge Napolitano is not buying any of this sophistry , and in A Nation of Sheep , he explains unequivocally that my Republican operative friend is wrong .
Whatever belief that Americans hold in regard to their rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States , reality is much different .
The USA no longer is the Land of the Free , no matter how many times that line is belted out when people sing the Star - Spangled Banner .
Napolitano wastes no time in laying out the grim picture that is the wreckage of long - held American freedoms :
Picture this :
The Attorney General of the United States testifies under oath that the president is not ordering federal agents to read the mail , listen to the telephone calls , and monitor the computer keystrokes of ordinary Americans , without a warrant to do so from a judge .
That would be criminal .
But six months later , the president admits that he has done so .
Picture this :
The Constitution prohibits Congress from abridging free speech .
But suddenly , Congress made it a crime to talk about receiving self - written warrants from an FBI agent .
Such things , Napolitano notes , are not imaginary , but are the present state of U.S. policy .
These things are done in the name of " protecting the homeland , " but the good judge is not buying that line , nor does he agree with the premise that in order to " preserve freedom , " the state needs to take away " some " of those very freedoms it supposedly protects .
Napolitano asks the simple question : " How can the government possibly preserve freedom by taking it away ? "
After his introduction , in which Napolitano clearly lays out his thesis , he then explains the natural rights origin of freedom , and how many of the founders of the United States held to a natural rights position .
Law , in their view , existed to protect individual liberties from those who would deny them .
Today , the deniers of liberty are those legally entrusted to protect it .
Napolitano quotes Benjamin Franklin , who certainly knew something about a natural rights origin of law : " Those who give up essential Liberty , to purchase a little temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety . "
The judge explains that people who are willing to give up liberty are giving power to a government that will take away the rest of their liberties , and make the people even more unsafe , as a predatory government never brings safety .
In his first chapter , Napolitano takes issue with legal positivists , who seem to dot the political landscape these days .
I remember speaking to a True Believing socialist who held a high place in President Jimmy Carter ’s government , as he told me , " The Constitution is whatever the Supreme Court says it is . "
Certainly , it seems that legal positivism holds sway .
From the writings of Judge Richard Posner to the Federalist Society to the New York Times to the leaders of both major political parties ( or the " Republicrats or Democans " ) , the idea of natural rights and natural liberty seem not only passé , but also downright subversive to Good Government .
Even though politicians will make passing remarks about individual rights and Constitutional government , nonetheless they govern as legal positivists who do what they want whenever they have enough weapons to back up their positions .
In Chapter Two , Napolitano asks the simple question : " Are you a sheep or a wolf ? "
Sheep , he writes , " stay with their herd and follow their shepherd without questioning where he is leading them .
Sheep trust that the shepherd looks out for their safety . "
While most Americans would not like being called sheep , nonetheless the conversation in the TSA lines generally moves along a " it ’s inconvenient , but I am willing to put up with it because it makes us safer " line .
Americans dutifully accept the tickets police officers give them for slight infractions of the speed limit , and if anyone resists in the slightest , Americans will give unqualified support to the police when they tase or even shoot that person who really posed no danger to anyone .
From there the Good Judge goes through a litany of sins committed by the state , from the self - written warrants that federal officers now may write to the destruction of habeas corpus .
Government at all levels is destroying rights and most Americans seem not to care , or will make excuses for the state .
Yet , the first aim that Napolitano takes is not at the authorities , as critical as he is of them .
Rather , he writes that Americans have become sheep , and the state is the Bad Shepherd .
Perhaps the greatest irony comes with the annual July 4 celebrations in which Americans now hold to be a day to give homage and honor to their government .
That July 4 marks the signing of a document that declared the British state to have an illegitimate claim upon the lives of the signers and American colonials is lost completely in the mix of parades and fireworks ( which are set off by state - approved entities — for public safety , of course ) .
That the present U.S. Government makes King George ’s " tyrannical " rule look to be downright benign libertarianism does not seem to faze Americans at all .
If one were to challenge the state ( as opposed to telling a bunch of Democrats , heads nodding all , that George W. Bush is a Really Bad Guy ) , one is seen as challenging freedom .
Indeed , we have gone from a view of the state being an entity that was supposed to protect liberty to an entity that protects us by taking away liberty .
The reasons for this decline are many , and they have been discussed in other articles and papers .
I would like to present a different view , one that has the economist ’s explanation .
It goes back to my dutifully and quietly standing in the TSA line .
Yes , I knew that the TSA is a terrible organization that has no place in a free society .
Heck , I even have written articles to that point .
Yes , I knew that the kind of searches that the TSA does regularly are things that our Founding Fathers would never have tolerated .
But , I just wanted to get on the plane .
Any resistance on my part would mean I would have to pay my university hundreds of dollars for the air fare , lodging , my advance for meals , and the like , since I would not be permitted to fly that day .
Moreover , any resistance on my part would have meant I could be charged with " interfering with the duties of a federal officer , " which carries 20 years in prison .
Resistance would have meant I would be out of work and in prison , and my family would be on the streets .
Resistance would have been something for which I would have had to pay the price — alone .
The TSA would have declared that its officers " carried out their duties as they have been trained " and most Americans would have agreed that whatever punishment I received was deserved .
In economics , we would say simply that the marginal costs I would have incurred for resistance would have outweighed any benefits on the margin that I would have gained from standing up to the TSA .
Not only would my life and the lives of my wife and children be destroyed , but nothing good would come of it .
The TSA would be given even more power , and my life would be over and government would have grown even more .
Robert Higgs has pointed out that governments grow because they promote and exploit fear .
The idea is that people come to believe that unless the state is protecting them , the " bad guys " might hurt or kill them .
However , there is another aspect of the state and fear , and that is the fear that all of us have of the state and the individuals who work for it .
On the local level , there are police , tax collectors , social workers , and others who are given the power to destroy our lives — and not pay a price , themselves .
On the state and federal level , it is even worse .
Resistance really can be dangerous .
The problem is that people — liberals and conservatives — believe that those who resist are the bad guys .
Government cannot be the " bad guys , " no matter what happens .
Yes , in conversations with Democrats where I work , they are all - too - happy to pin the label of " tyrant " on George W. Bush .
But , when I bring up the abuses of the Clinton Administration , from the massacre at Waco to the vicious bombing of Serbia , they suddenly become Defenders of State Supremacy .
It is not that these people are against misuse of government power ; they just want their people to be able to wield the batons and shoot the guns .
Governments grow because the benefits are concentrated and the costs are diffused .
Yet , they also grow because the penalties for resisting injustice are draconian and are felt by that relatively small number of people who resist .
At the same time , there is little sympathy for the resisters , but much sympathy and support for the abusers .
There seems to be an inevitability regarding the nature of the growth of government and the subsequent cowing of the people .
Yes , as the Good Judge says , we truly have become a nation of sheep .
The shame is that we have a heritage of freedom , but have thrown it away with both hands .
However , they still let us get on the planes .
Although I might seem to be pessimistic , in truth , freedom and liberty always have been on the defensive throughout human history .
We are given thousands of excuses for giving up our freedom , or not resisting the authorities when they try to deprive us of our God - given liberties .

Nearly three - quarters of those polled said it was a full - time job
A poll of 4,000 housewives for networking website alljoinon.com suggested that the average mum worked for nearly nine hours a day every day .
The website said a housewife would earn almost £ 30,000 a year if she was employed to do all the same errands .
The average annual UK wage is £ 23,700 , according to official figures .
Some 71 % of those polled agreed that successfully running the family home was a full - time job .
" The survey clearly demonstrates that not only do housewives deserve a wage for their efforts , they also need a break from the daily grind , " said Carolyn Morris , spokeswoman for alljoinon.com .
The chores are yours
An average mum would spend 273 minutes every day looking after the children , according to the poll .
Based on an hourly rate of £ 8 , a nanny would earn £ 36.80 a day for the same job .
The survey claims 71 minutes a day is spent cleaning and tidying
Cleaning and tidying for 71 minutes would net a cleaner £ 7.10 a day .
For more than an hour of cooking a head chef would get £ 17.30 .
Fourteen minutes making the beds is worth £ 1.29 for a chambermaid , and a kitchen assistant would be paid £ 2.57 for a housewife 's typical 28 minutes of washing up .
The poll said the average mum trawled the family finances for 39 minutes , which would cost £ 12.50 if an accountant did it .
A taxi driver would earn £ 2.53 for the 23 minutes of ferrying children around , and a mystery shopper £ 2.10 for the 18 minutes a day of grocery shopping .
Single women ' do less '
HAVE YOUR SAY
Would you really want to put a price on your wife ?
I 'd rather pitch in and do my fair share .
James , Belfast
Labour economist Helene Couprie , of Toulouse University , concluded that on average , an employed woman does 15 hours a week of housework when she lives with her employed partner , up from 10 hours when single .
Men , on the other hand , see the hours they commit to housework decline once they begin living as a couple , she found .
In the year to April 2007 , average earnings of full - time male employees were £ 498 per week , while for women it was £ 394 , according to the Office of National Statistics .

Cold snaps make for unbalanced reptiles .
Snakes make good climbers on narrow branches .
Punchstock
Researchers investigating the agility of arboreal snakes at cold temperatures have started to detail how and when reptiles tumble out of their trees .
Snakes , like all cold - blooded animals , cannot control their body temperature .
Instead , they tend to go along with the conditions of their environment , slowing down their movement as the temperature drops .
In particularly cold conditions , some reptiles become completely immobile , which can cause problems .
A cold snap in Florida this past winter , for example , caused iguanas to fall out of their arboreal homes .
To investigate , biologist Gary Gerald and his colleagues at Miami University in Ohio recorded the velocities , body postures , and balancing abilities of corn snakes ( Elaphe guttata ) on horizontal beams at 10 °C , 20 °C , or 30 °C .
The snakes were exposed to the temperatures for 2 hours before being encouraged to cross the ‘ branches ’ , which had diameters of 3 , 6 , or 10 centimetres , in a climate - controlled laboratory .
Spotters stood below to catch the snakes if they fell , and a safety cushion was placed beneath the artificial tree in case the spotters missed or dropped a falling snake .
Snakes on a limb
The team reports in the Journal of Experimental Zoology1 that at high temperatures snakes moved faster and were more stretched out along branches of all diameters .
At lower temperatures , snakes moved much slower and adopted a looped posture — their bodies meandered along the branch , improving stability .
The snakes were about ten times more likely to fall at the coldest temperature than at the warmest temperature , even though they were still mobile .
The falling and the looped posture hint that temperature might have an effect on balance as well as movement , the team says .
The snakes in colder climes were not particularly cooperative to the experiment .
Perhaps knowing what was in store for them , they would often not even try to cross the branches .
In these cases of insubordination the researchers had to tickle the back of the snakes ' tails to prod them along .
Thin and loopy
Counterintuitively , snakes in colder temperatures tended to fall from thin branches less often than from thick ones , perhaps because they could make more loops along the narrower surface .

Their agility on thin branches give snakes something of an advantage over other tree - dwelling animals , says Gerald .
" People often think of snakes as being at a disadvantage by not having legs , but in trees there is really no question that they have a leg up , " he says .
The study may help to explain some aspects of reptile ecology .
“ That so many of the snakes fell when cold may help to explain why there are so few arboreal snake species outside the tropics , " says biologist and flying snake expert John Socha at the University of Chicago in Illinois .
Among the 25 finance APIs now listed on ProgrammableWeb , there are services from old and new companies , and large and small companies .
For example , the venerable Dun and Bradstreet offers the Dun and Bradstreet Credit Check API , personal finance startup Wesabe offers an API and there 's an API from Prosper , a peer - to - peer lending service .
Overall , most current business and finance APIs fall into one of two categories : APIs from SaaS - based business administration and management services , and APIs that provide financial markets data .
SaaS Business Administration APIs
A variety of new on - demand service providers offer APIs as a means to reach and integrate with their services .
For example , the Blinksale API accesses their online invoicing service .
The REST API provides access to your Blinksale data , letting you create invoices using a Blinksale invoice template or one of your own creation .
The FreshBooksTrack this API API provides online invoicing and time tracking using your Freshbooks account .
The KashFlow and NetAccountsTrack this API APIs offer broader accounting capabilities , geared toward businesses in the UK and Australia , respectively .
Financial Data APIs
Looking for real - time financial market quotes or historical data ?
Fifteen APIs are ready to get you the data you need , when you need it .
Xignite provides financial data APIs ranging from XigniteRealtimeTrack this API and XigniteFundsTrack this API ( real - time U.S. stock market quotes , and U.S. mutual fund data ) to XigniteCurrencies Track this API and XigniteRatesTrack this API ( currency and international interest rate data ) to XigniteEdgarTrack this API and XigniteCalendarTrack this API ( U.S. SEC Edgar filings and global economic calendars ) .
The Xignite APIs feature SOAP and REST protocols , with all data returned in XML format .
Once you 've used one Xignite API , it 's relatively easy to get started with others , since all the APIs incorporate a common design structure .
StrikeIron offers a number of APIs that serve users with U.S. financial data including StrikeIron Stock Quotes BasicTrack this API , StrikeIron Mutual FundsTrack this API , and StrikeIron Historical Stock QuotesTrack this API .
The StrikeIron APIs utilize SOAP protocol and return results in XML format .
Timepost Mashup
Business and Financial APIs provide excellent opportunities for developing mashups .
One example is the Timepost mashup , which applies the Blinksale and FreshBooks business APIs , along with the popular Basecamp APITrack this API ( from 37signals ) and the HarvestTrack this API time - tracking API .
Integration of these APIs results in a rich time tracking and project collaboration solution for small businesses .
Mr Kadish was an engineer at the US army 's Armament Research Centre A military engineer has appeared in court in the US on charges of passing classified information to Israel .
Ben - Ami Kadish is alleged to have given secrets involving information about nuclear weapons , fighter jets and missiles to Israel in the 1980s .
He was charged with four counts of conspiracy , including disclosing documents relating to national defence and acting as an agent of Israel .
He declined to comment on leaving the Manhattan courthouse .
" I 'm not saying anything .
I have no comment , " said Mr Kadish , 84 , who worked at the US army 's Armament Research , Development and Engineering Centre in New Jersey from 1979 to 1985 .
He was released on bail of $ 300,000 and restrictions were placed on his travel .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Kadish is accused of giving the material to an Israeli consular official .
His alleged handler has been named by justice officials as the former consul for science affairs at the Israeli Consulate General in Manhattan , reportedly the same person who dealt with Jonathan Jay Pollard , who is serving life in prison for spying for Israel .
Pollard passed thousands of documents to Israeli agents while working at the US defence department .
He was convicted in 1987 .
The Israeli government publicly admitted in 1998 that Pollard had been their agent and awarded him Israeli citizenship .
' Major weapons system '
According to the complaint filed in Manhattan federal court , Mr Kadish borrowed several classified documents related to national defence from the army 's research centre between 1980 and 1985 and took them to his home in New Jersey .
Mr Kadish would then hand over the documents at his home to the Israeli consular official , who would photograph them in the basement , it added .
Among others , Kadish took documents linked to modified designs for F - 15 jets
The complaint said Mr Kadish appeared to have received small gifts and restaurant meals for his alleged spying - not cash .
One of the documents " contained information concerning nuclear weaponry and was classified as ' Restricted Data ' ... because the document contained atomic - related information " , the complaint said .
Another , classified as " Secret " and " Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals " , contained " information concerning a major weapons system - a modified version of an F - 15 fighter jet that the United States had sold to another country " .
Modified F - 15s have been sold to Israel , Japan , Saudi Arabia , Singapore and South Korea .
Documents relating to the US Patriot missile air defence , classified as " Secret " , were also borrowed by Mr Kadish from the library .
' Do n't say anything '
The court documents also allege that Mr Kadish lied to US law enforcement officials on 21 March 2008 , the day after he was told to do so by his Israeli handler during a telephone conversation .
In that conversation , Mr Kadish 's handler was quoted in the complaint as telling him : " Do n't say anything ...
What happened 25 years ago ?
You do n't remember anything . "
The United States is a close ally of Israel and supplies more than $ 2 billion a year in military aid .
The two countries also co-operate in developing some areas of military technology .
State Department spokesman Tom Casey said Israel would be informed of the case against Mr Kadish .
" Twenty - plus years ago , during the Pollard case , we noted that this was not the kind of behaviour we would expect from friends and allies , and that would remain the case today , " he said .

What are these ?
CAUTION : When purchasing headspace gages make SURE you get the proper gagues for YOUR rifle .
In other words , if your rifle is chambered for .223 Remington , get .223 Remingon gages NOT 5.56 mm gages .
Conversely , if your rifle is chambered for 5.56 mm , get 5.56 mm gages , NOT .223 Remington gages .
There IS a difference .
See 223 vs 5.56 mm
Headspace is that measurement describing the size of the chamber in a barrel .
In the case of rimless rifle cartridges , it is the distance from some arbitrary point on the case neck taper back to the bolt face .
In the more general case ( e.g. pistol , rimfire , rimmed cases , and belted magnums ) , you can imagine headspace as measured from whatever the cartridge rests against on the front of the chamber all the way back to the bolt face .
These numbers are specified for each cartridge by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute ( SAAMI ) and it's important to have this measurement fall within SAAMI specified tolerances .
Too small , and you may not be able to close the bolt on some ammunition that 's on the large side of its tolerance range .
Worse yet , it will close and let you fire .
Firing ammunition in a chamber that 's too tight leads to dangerously high pressures .
Too large a chamber , and there 's lots of room for the cartridge to rattle around in there -- well not really .
What happens is that the brass casing can rupture and 55,000 psi hot gases start rushing out in every direction , including at your precious body parts .
Think of the high pressure gases that force a bullet down the barrel finding other avenues of escape .
This is what some people mean by " the gun blew up on me " .
One sign that this is going to happen soon is that the backs of your brass casings start looking like someone took a sledge hammer to them and flattened out the primers and lettering .
This is because the casing is literally being hammered against the bolt face .
This can also be caused in reloads by packing the cartridges with too hot of a load .
So that 's headspace , and why it 's important .
But what are all these gages about ?
They look like little steel cartridges without the bullets .
You stick them into the chamber and try to close the bolt .
Whether the bolt closes or not -- and whether that 's good or bad -- depends upon which gage you 're trying to use .
Using Headspace Gages
It is important that you use the headspace gages properly .
Used improperly , the gages will give false and possibly dangerous information .
For example , if you place a NO - GO gage in the chamber , pull the charging handle all the way back and let it fly , the bolt may well close on the gage due to the buffer spring pressure .
However , done properly , e.g. closing the bolt by hand and trying to turn the bolt , the bolt will not close without excessive hand pressure .
GO GAGE
This gage is used to determine proper headspace .
Insert the " GO " gage in the chamber , then take the bolt , without the extractor or pin ejector and insert it and turn .
The bolt should turn on the gage with some force .
If the bolt does not turn on this gage , the chamber is not reamed to the correct depth or the bolt is oversized .
There is inadequate headspace .
Thus , if you can close the bolt , it 's a " GO " on the barrel / bolt combination .
NO - GO GAGE
This gage is also used to determine proper headspace .
Insert the " NO - GO " gage into the chamber , then take the bolt , without the extractor or pin ejector , insert it into the extension and turn .
The bolt should not turn on this gage .
Do not force the bolt .
If the bolt turns on this gage , the chamber is too deep or the bolt is undersized .
There is excessive headspace .
Thus , if you can close the bolt , it 's a " NO - GO " on the barrel / bolt combination .
FIELD GAGE
The GO and NO - GO gages are used to check the limits of factory tolerances between the chamber and bolt to ensure that tolerance build - up is neither inadequate nor excessive .
The " FIELD " gage , checks for headspace in excess of the factory tolerances , thus the gage is used to determine excessive headspace .
Insert the " FIELD " gage into the chamber , then take the bolt , without the extractor or pin ejector , insert it into the extension and turn .
The bolt should not turn on this gage under any circumstances .
If the bolt turns on this gage , there is excessive headspace and the WEAPON IS VERY DANGEROUS .
Fortunately , since the wear mechanism for a firearm chamber is to stretch , we only have to worry about the dimension beyond the NO - GO measurement ; which is our " field " gage .
The field gage is sized to be the largest acceptable headspace possible .
If you can close the bolt on the field gage , then the barrel is worn out and it 's time to replace it .
To continue shooting it is dangerous .
In theory , the bolt of a well used rifle will close on a NO - GO gage too .
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD A BOLT CLOSE ON A " FIELD " GAGE .
That 's when you rebarrel the gun .
Headspace is another matter that needs to be considered when reloading ammunition .
In my opinion , it is essential to use a full length resizer die on the cases .
This assures that your reloaded ammunition will work in ANY firearm , not just your rifle .
The cases stretch and conform to the chamber they were last fired in and if they conformed to a chamber different than yours ( and they did ) and you do n't full length resize , you may be developing inordinately high chamber pressures , which may lead to a very bad day .
I also recommend using a factory crimp die in lieu of a standard roll crimp die .
This makes reloading life somewhat easier , since you do n't have to trim all the cases to the same length , but you still have to trim cases that are over the maximum .
Since you 've got a new gun ( with less than 10,000 rounds through it ) , I would suggest you buy both a GO and a NO - GO gage .
Play it conservative , check the headspace every few thousand rounds and do n't go beyond the NO - GO .
As you know , most people do n't even bother with that but I like to play it real safe .
Basic rules ....
For a new gun : a .
Closes on the go gage b. does n't close on the no - go gage
For an old rifle that 's been rode hard and put up wet : a. closes on the go gage b. probably closes on the no - go gage c. definitely does NOT close on the field gage
It 's cheap insurance to have a set around for every rifle you have , especially if you shoot a lot .
If you plan on changing bolts and / or barrels around , you have to check each combination because each setup could vary a few thousandths .
Fortunately you only have to do it when you first introduce them to each other , thereafter , every few thousand rounds if you wish .
NASA Watch quotes from a TV interview with Barack Obama :
" I 've got a strong belief in NASA and the process of space exploration .
I do think that our program has been stuck for a while - that the space shuttle mission did not inspire the imagination of the public - that much of the experimentation that was done could have been conducted not necessarily with manned flights .
I think that broadening our horizons - and looking at a combination of both unmanned satellites of the sort that we saw with the Jupiter launch - but also looking at where we can start planning for potential manned flights .
I think that is something that I 'm excited about and could be part of a broader strategy for science and technology investment ...
The only thing I want to say is that I want to do a thorough review because some of these programs may not be moving in the right direction and I want to make sure that NASA spending is a little more coherent than it has been over the last several years . "
It would be good to have a President who understood the difference in science payoff between manned and unmanned spaceflight .
The former is exciting and inspirational , the latter gets enormously greater results per dollar .
The Bush administration , with their magical ability to screw up everything they touch , has been killing off science at NASA in favor of a misguided Moon / Mars initiative ( despite public apathy ) .
But the situation is not hopeless .
The way we fund science in this country is completely irrational , starting up a ten - year project one year and canceling it ( leaving international partners high and dry ) the next .
The good news is that we can use such capriciousness to our advantage , pulling the plug from expensive boondoggles that were initiated for political reasons rather than scientific ones .
I would rather have a thoughtful system of setting research priorities and a track record of commitment to long - term projects , but you go to war with the army you have .

Warm weather is just around the corner .
Is your car ready ?
Like winter , the summer driving months have their own unique challenges .
While you might not curse a non-working heater , you ’ll surely be just as unhappy about an AC system that does n’t blow cold — or an engine that overheats .
Maybe you ’ll be wearing a T - shirt and shorts instead of a sweater — but you ’ll still be just as stuck .
To dodge the bullet , take time now to think about the following :
Does your car ’s AC system work ?
Now ( when it ’s still cold ) is the time to check it out ; if you wait until you need it , not only will you be sweating , you ’ll be waiting in line along with all the others who are trying to get their car slotted in for service .
Just as you ’re more likely to get a good deal on a 4 ×4 in the middle of summer , you ’re more likely to be able to get a fast turnaround on AC service while it ’s still technically winter ( or at least , still feels like it is ) .
Also , it ’s smart policy to run the AC system during the winter months anyhow .
Doing so circulates lubricant along with refrigerant — and helps keep the system in good working order .
How ’bout them bulbs ?
You might not realize you ’re driving around with a burned out brake light — until Johnny Law reminds you ( possibly , with a piece of “ payin ’ paper ” for defective equipment ) .
During the cold months , most of us try to get into and out of the car — and back to where it ’s warm — as quickly as possible .
So we may not notice burned out lights or other such things .
This is why it ’s smart to do a “ walk around ” of the car on the first nice day you get .
Have someone sit in the driver ’s seat and work the brake pedal and turn signals , emergency flashers and high and low beams .
Fix anything that needs fixing .
Wipe away your cares
Next to keeping track of tire pressure , the candidate for Most Neglected Basic Check has to be failure to give the windshield wiper blades a once over — and almost certainly a mandatory replacement with a fresh set .
Winter is extra hard on windshield wiper blades ; cold hardens the rubber and road salt / debris ruins their “ edge ” — leaving you in Streak City come the next big downpour .
The general rule is blades should be replaced twice yearly , at the beginning / end of each season .
The job is generally very easy ; no tools or special skills required .
But if you ’re leery about doing it yourself , do n’t sweat it .
Auto parts joints that sell replacement wiper blades will usually offer to help install them ( for free ) if you ask .
Keeping your cool
Well , keeping your engine ’s cool , at any rate .
Check your records and makes sure the car ’s cooling system is up to date , service - wise .
Belts and hoses are generally good for about four years from new ; after that , they should be closely checked to see whether they ought to be replaced ( so they do n’t burst / fly apart and leave you stuck ) .
Anti -freeze level and condition should also be checked .
You can easily check the level ( engine cold ! ) by removing the radiator cap or checking the level in the coolant recovery tank — and topping off ( with the right type ) as necessary .
Be sure you use the right type of coolant .
Red / orange “ long life ” coolant and standard “ green ” coolant are n’t supposed to be mixed .
Be aware that even “ long life ” coolant does n’t last forever — and unless you like to pay for expensive radiator / cooling system repairs / replacements , have a shop check the condition of the stuff at least every 2 - 3 years .
General de-gunking
Over the winter , certain areas of your car will accumulate a layer of grime that not only looks nasty , it provides a place for moisture ( and eventually , rust ) to get where you do n’t want it .
For example , the door jambs / rocker sills , the underside of the trunk , around the gasket that seals it when closed , etc .
A good time to deal with this is after you wash the exterior of the car .
Using an old , throw - away towel , just wipe down the door jambs , trunk lid seal and so on .
Usually , the grime comes right up .
Your car will look better , the weather stripping will last longer and you ’ll probably avoid rust for longer .
It ’s also a good idea to pop the hood and check to see whether the drainage / venting area near the cowl ( at the base of the windshield ) is free of old leaves and so on .
Remove / clean that area out as needed .
Inspection detection
Another small item that ’s either put on the “ do it later ” roster or forgotten entirely is making sure all required county / state inspections are up to date .
Many states have both an annual or bi-annual smog check ( emissions ) as well as an annual state safety inspection — plus county decal and license plate registration , etc .
Some of these require taking a couple hours off to go to a designated inspection station and hope you do n’t get stuck behind 15 other cars waiting for the same inspection you need to get .
These things are best dealt with on your terms , when it ’s convenient for you .
Do n’t wait until the day before your sticker expires .
Git ‘er done ahead of the pack .
It ’ll get rid of one more potential hassle before the summer driving season arrives !

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - A Muslim author and critic of Islamic fundamentalism who was baptized a Catholic by Pope Benedict said on Sunday Islam is “ physiologically violent ” and he is now in great danger because of his conversion .
Pope Benedict XVI baptises journalist Magdi Allam ( R ) as he celebrates a Easter Vigil mass in Saint Peter 's Basilica at the Vatican March 22 , 2008 .
Pope Benedict led the world 's Catholics into Easter on Saturday at a Vatican service where he baptised Allam , a Muslim - born convert who is one of Italy 's most famous and controversial journalists .

“ I realize what I am going up against but I will confront my fate with my head high , with my back straight and the interior strength of one who is certain about his faith , ” said Magdi Allam .
In a surprise move on Saturday night , the pope baptized the 55 - year - old , Egyptian - born Allam at an Easter eve service in St Peter ’s Basilica that was broadcast around the world .
The conversion of Allam to Christianity -- he took the name “ Christian ” for his baptism -- was kept secret until the Vatican disclosed it in a statement less than an hour before it began .
Writing in Sunday ’s edition of the leading Corriere della Sera , the newspaper of which he is a deputy director , Allam said : “ ... the root of evil is innate in an Islam that is physiologically violent and historically conflictual ” .
Allam , who is a strong supporter of Israel and who an Israeli newspaper once called a “ Muslim Zionist , ” has lived under police protection following threats against him , particularly after he criticized Iran ’s position on Israel .
He said before converting he had continually asked himself why someone who had struggled for what he called “ moderate Islam ” was then “ condemned to death in the name of Islam and on the basis of a Koranic legitimization ” .
His conversion , which he called “ the happiest day of my life , ” came just two days after al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden accused the pope of being part of a “ new crusade ” against Islam .
The Vatican appeared to be at pains to head off criticism from the Islamic world about the conversion .
“ Conversion is a private matter , a personal thing and we hope that the baptism will not be interpreted negatively by Islam , ” Cardinal Giovanni Re told an Italian newspaper .
Still , Allam ’s highly public baptism by the pope shocked Italy ’s Muslim community , with some leaders openly questioning why the Vatican chose to shine such a big spotlight it .
“ What amazes me is the high profile the Vatican has given this conversion , ” Yaha Sergio Yahe Pallavicini , vice - president of the Italian Islamic Religious Community , told Reuters .
“ Why could he have not done this in his local parish ? ”
ANOTHER DEATH SENTENCE
Allam , the author of numerous books , said he realized that his conversion would likely procure him “ another death sentence for apostasy , ” or the abandoning of one ’s faith .
But he said he was willing to risk it because he had “ finally seen the light , thanks to divine grace ” .
Allam defended the pope in 2006 when the pontiff made a speech in Regensburg , Germany , that many Muslims perceived as depicting Islam as a violent faith .
He said he made his decision to convert after years of deep soul searching and asserted that the Catholic Church has been “ too prudent about conversions of Muslims ” .
At a Sunday morning Easter mass hours after he baptized Allam , the pope , without mentioning him , spoke in a prayer of the continuing “ miracle ” of conversion to Christianity some 2,000 years after Christ ’s resurrection .
The Vatican statement announcing Allam ’s conversion said : “ For the Catholic Church , each person who asks to receive Baptism after a deep personal search , a fully free choice and adequate preparation , has a right to receive it . ”
It said all newcomers to the faith were “ equally important before God ’s love and welcome in the community of the Church ” .
" I just came from voting .
Finally got my vote in at 49 ward , 07 division .... after waiting for ( the only ) 2 voting machines to be repaired .
" I was able to cast my vote for Obama after waiting 1 and 1/2 hours .
During that time at least 100 voters left without voting ..... possibly not to return .
" I immediately called every News channel I could get through to .
Persons who answered at the stations informed me that my ward was not the only one with broken machines and ' Paper ballots ( as an alternative ) without Obama 's name on it .
These provisional ballots did have Hiliary 's name on them . "
BASIC SAFEGUARDS BASIC SAFEGUARDS
To guard against and deal with medical record theft : • Check medical records or statements from your insurer for benefits paid under your name but not received .
• Monitor your credit report for collection notices from medical providers .
• File a police report if your information is stolen .
• Amend your records to correct misinformation .
Source : USA TODAY research Doctors ' offices , clinics and hospitals are a fruitful hunting ground for identity thieves , who are using increasingly sophisticated methods to steal patient information , lawyers and privacy experts say .
Recent disclosures that hospital workers snooped into the medical files of Maria Shriver , Britney Spears and George Clooney highlight the vulnerability of patients to the merely curious and the criminal .
Legal experts say lawbreakers use medical information to get credit card numbers , drain bank accounts or falsely bill Medicare and other insurers .
RECORDS : It 's often hard for patients to get even their own files Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center , says attention on identity theft has focused on how easily criminals can get financial records .
" Now we 're moving into an era where many of those same problems occur with medical records , " he says .
Hospitals and other medical settings often encrypt data and take other steps to protect privacy , but " people are acting with increasing sophistication to steal information , " says Stuart Gerson , a Washington , D.C. - based attorney who represents health care firms .
Those intent on crime " attempt to gain the assistance of insiders " and use new techniques to capture data from files , even those that are encrypted , he says .
Pam Dixon , executive director of the World Privacy Forum , an advocacy group , says " sophisticated crime rings " often can make more money by stealing medical identities than by going after individuals ' bank accounts or credit cards .
" If you steal someone 's medical identity , then multiply that by 100 or 1,000 " other thefts " and do fake billings , you can make hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of dollars , " Dixon says .
In Florida last year , a front - desk coordinator at the Cleveland Clinic was convicted of identity theft , computer fraud and other charges after downloading patient information and selling it to a cousin , who submitted more than $ 2.5 million in phony bills to Medicare .
In April , a former New York - Presbyterian Hospital employee was arrested for participating in an identity theft scheme in which he allegedly accessed nearly 50,000 patient records over two years .
False information from fake billings can end up in patients ' medical files — and creditors might seek payment from the patients .
Until the creditors call , patients might not know their medical information has been accessed .
In a recent survey of 263 health care providers , 13 % said their facility had experienced a data breach .
Of those , 56 % said they notified the patients involved , according to the survey by HIMSS Analytics , a non-profit data analysis firm , and Kroll Fraud Solutions , which offers security - related services .
In January , California began requiring that consumers receive notice when their medical information is improperly accessed .
It is only the second state , besides Arkansas , to do so , Dixon says .
Similar legislation , written by Sens. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , and Arlen Specter , R - Pa. , is being debated in Congress .

A year and a half ago , the excellent Linux music player Amarok added extensive support for Magnatune .
The programmer , Nikolaj Hald Nielsen , did this on his own initiative , simply because he thought it'd be a neat thing for his favorite music player to have , and because he liked Magnatune 's business philosophy .
I really like Amarok , so I volunteered that I 'd be happy to donate 10 % of gross sales at Magnatune caused by Amarok .
I was also so pleased with the quality of Nikolaj 's work , that I hired him , and he now spends 50 % of his time on Magnatune , and I pay for him to spend the other 50 % of his time on Amarok .
I 'm * very * pleased to report that Amarok users buy a very healthy amount of Magnatune music .
They can listen for free from inside Amarok , so that the streaming albums appear in Amarok as if they were local music , and they can easily buy the music in various open formats .
So far , Amarok has caused $ 11,557 in sales of Magnatune music !
This morning , I very happily sent a $ 1155.70 donation to Amarok .
I also made the same offer to Rhythmbox , another great music player for Linux , and will be sending them a donation shortly as well .
Their built - in support for Magnatune is * excellent * , and I 've been personally using it myself to listen to our own Magnatune music .
Rhythmbox is installed by default on the ultra-popular , recently - released Ubuntu 8.04 .
Mark Shuttleworth , the force behind Ubuntu , recently said this :
I am particularly glad that we are supporting Magnatune , which has articulated a really good future for the music industry , " Shuttleworth said .
" The problem with the music industry has not been the musicians ; it has not been the music ; and it has not been downloads .
It has been the record companies .
So to have a record company that says , ' Well , there is a better way to do this ' feels like a good thing for us to support .
So , that 's groovy . "
I 've been talking to the programmer behind the magnatune support in Rhythmbox , and he plans to add a bunch of features to it over the summer .
Cool !
Despite widespread declarations of the death of DRM in music , the Recording Industry Association of America insists that it 's far from dead .
At the Digital Hollywood conference taking place in Los Angeles this week , the organization argued that DRM is still used in the large majority of music distribution methods .
Not only that , but DRM is poised to make a comeback to make up for where it has fallen .
" ( Recently ) I made a list of the 22 ways to sell music and 20 of them still require DRM , " RIAA technology unit head David Hughes said during a panel discussion , according to CNet .
" Any form of subscription service or limited play - per - view or advertising offer still requires DRM .
So DRM is not dead . "
Hughes ' statement comes just four months after the last of the Big Four music labels decided to ditch DRM for some sales .
Sony BMG joined EMI , Universal , and Warner in selling DRM - free MP3 files through Amazon 's MP3 service ( in addition to a rather large handful of independent labels ) , making Amazon the only online destination that sells unprotected music from all of the majors .
Other music stores offer some DRM - free selections too , like the iTunes Store , the Zune Marketplace , eMusic , and Amie Street , to name a few .
Still , it 's true that DRM still exists in the music world .
The majority of songs from the iTunes Store still utilize DRM , many stores continue to sell tracks with Windows - centric DRM , and practically all subscription services still use it .
Other services , such as web - based music service Last.fm , offer free ad - supported streaming , but users are limited to listening over the web and cannot take the files with them offline .
And , of course , subscription - based services use DRM to ensure that the downloaded music expires once users cancel their subscriptions .
Hughes believes that per-track purchases are going the way of the dodo in favor of these other models , and that 's why DRM will have a resurgence .
" I think there is going to be a shift , " he said .
" I think there will be a movement towards subscription services and they will eventually mean the return of DRM . "
Hughes did acknowledge that users would rather live in a world where DRM stayed out of their way by saying that as long as they get to use files how they want , users do n't care about DRM .
The problem with DRM is that users can't use the files how they want , which is why they do care .
And we 're miles away from the kind of magical solution solution envisioned by the Hughes that would create the perfect , unnoticeable DRM scheme .
Others on the panel realize this .
Digimarc Corp. director of business development Rajan Samtani pointed out that there are too many ways for the " kids " to get around DRM and that it 's time to " throw in the towel . "
Aside from incompatibility , there 's another major danger with DRM : having your music licenses disappear on you one day .
This most recently happened with MSN Music , which announced that users will need to either commit to their authorized computers for life or circumvent the DRM by burning the music to a CD and re-ripping .
The industry 's recent willingness to drop DRM and embrace other , nontraditional models led us to believe that the music industry was finally " getting it . "
Given Hughes ' comments , however , perhaps the Big Four labels and RIAA never will .
Preparations are under way in Israel for the biggest holiday on the Hebrew calendar , Passover .
A time for families and friends to join together at a traditional feast known as the Seder , a time to remember the suffering , the humiliations , the bondage of the ancient Hebrews in a foreign land .
The shops are full of frantic shoppers buying special items for the special feast .
Children are already out of school so they too can help in the preparations .
Plans are being made for vacations , day trips , picnics … all the fun things associated with the Festival ….
truly a Festival of Freedom , when all are finally free .
But are they ?
Just meters away there is starvation .
There is illness .
There is death .
As one side of the wall celebrates Freedom , the other side is burying their murdered children
There is irony in this situation … that being the cause of the suffering .
Those very people that are celebrating their Freedom are denying it to others .
Those very same people that are feasting are starving the others .
Those that are enjoying life are taking it from others .
NOTHING is eaten ….
there is not even water to drink .
On the Israeli side the ‘ bread of affliction ’ is eaten for 8 days .
On the Palestinian sideis eaten ….
there is not even water to drink .
As the ancient Hebrews cried out to the Pharaohs , LET MY PEOPLE GO !
So cry out the Palestinians of today … .
The time has come for BOTH sides to celebrate a Festival of Freedom !
The time is NOW !
Despite a 2002 promise from President Bush to put citizenship applications for immigrant members of the military on a fast track , some are finding themselves waiting months , or even years , because of bureaucratic backlogs .
One , Sgt. Kendell K. Frederick of the Army , who had tried three times to file for citizenship , was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq as he returned from submitting fingerprints for his application .
About 7,200 service members or people who have been recently discharged have citizenship applications pending , but neither the Department of Defense nor Citizenship and Immigration Services keeps track of how long they have been waiting .
Immigration lawyers and politicians say they have received a significant number of complaints about delays because of background checks , misplaced paperwork , confusion about deployments and other problems .
“ I ’ve pretty much given up on finding out where my paperwork is , what ’s gone wrong , what happened to it , ” said Abdool Habibullah , 27 , a Guyanese immigrant who first applied for citizenship in 2005 upon returning from a tour in Iraq and was honorably discharged from the Marines as a sergeant .
“ If what I ’ve done for this country is n’t enough for me to be a citizen , then I do n’t know what is . ”
The long waits are part of a broader problem plaguing the immigration service , which was flooded with 2.5 million applications for citizenship and visas last summer  twice as many as the previous year  in the face of 66 percent fee increases that took effect July 30 .
Officials have estimated that it will take an average of 18 months to process citizenship applications from legal immigrants through 2010 , up from seven months last year .
Vista Service Pack 1 is in the can .
It ’s no coincidence that Vista SP1 and Server 2008 are “ here ” at the same time .
They ’re one and the same apart from the differences in “ configuration ” , i.e. Client vs. Server stuff .
Server 2008 is the product that should have been released in a “ Client ” version under the Vista branding , but Microsoft caved to enormous pressure from the market and released it a little over a year too early .
Microsoft undoubtedly knew they could never afford to release a Server version in the state the code was in at Vista release .
Corporations running mission critical things on Server would never adopt anything not rock solid .
So Microsoft took the time they should have put into the “ Client ” version to finish things off properly for Server .
Hindsight 20/20 and all that .
What can be expected of Windows “ 7 ” after this ?
My guess is Microsoft will cave to market pressure again and release something not quite ready for the consumer market .
With Vista , part of the reason for releasing too early was that Windows XP seemed to be getting too old .
For Windows “ 7 ” part of the reason will likely be a perceived need to catch up with Apple ’s OS X .
With Vista , Microsoft was incredibly open about providing early builds to lots of people in order to get the quality right .
And yet it was n’t enough .
It also seems that the biggest “ achievement ” that came from the openness was that people were n’t much impressed when the final product came out .
In my view that ’s a bit of a shame , because there are lots of truly great innovations in Vista ( one of which is WPF ) .
Microsoft will probably be more tight - lipped about Windows “ 7 ” as a result .
They might take a more Apple - like approach and keep things secret until the last minute .
Surprise the world when they release Vista ’s successor .
The problem is that Microsoft does n’t seem to understand what it is about Apple ’s offer that makes it so compelling .
It ’s not OS X .
It ’s not iLife or iWork .
It ’s how it ’s all wrapped up in an end - to - end package .
Beautiful , well performing hardware ; good OS ; good everyday software with features that people find useable and useful , integrated with revenue generating .
Mac Internet services .
And all because Apple has control of the entire chain , from hardware to software and services .
Heck , they even control the retail experience .
Microsoft does n’t have an answer for that .
They play a different game .
They play in many arenas and with many , many different partners .
The ecosystem Microsoft provides the basis for is much , much bigger than Apple ’s .
Microsoft can never be Apple .
And I do n’t think they should even try to be .
I ’m hoping that Microsoft will not cave in to market pressure but chart their own course for Windows “ 7 ” .
Perhaps kick off work for another “ NT ” project ( from the Dave Cutler / NT 3.x days ) and focus on creating an operating system that is focused on the total consumer experience .
Throw away all backwards compatibility in the consumer market , if needed ( ironically , sort of like Apple did for OS X. )
Provide backwards compatibility through virtualization or by keeping a separate line for corporate mission - critical applications .
But mainly chart a course that does n’t look too much at Apple or Linux or anything else , but follows new visions for what can be done with software running on ever more capable hardware .
They have enough smart people to lead the way .
There ’s no need to follow anyone .

Obama releases tax returns , campaign hits Clinton on transparency Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday March 25 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Sen. Barack Obama released seven years worth of his tax returns Tuesday , and his campaign criticized rival Hillary Clinton 's failure to release her tax filings from her and husband Bill Clinton 's post - White House years .
Obama 's returns from 2000 through 2006 were posted online ( .pdf ) Tuesday morning .
Clinton 's campaign has said it would release her tax returns for 2000 through 2007 " on or around " tax day , April 15 , and campaign representatives have promised to do so at least three days before Pennsylvania 's April 22 primary .
That the returns for those years -- the first in nearly two decades that Bill Clinton was not serving in public office -- have not been released demonstrates a lagging commitment to transparency , Obama 's campaign charged .
" All she has to do is send someone down to Kinkos to copy the tax returns and post them on her Web site , " Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs chided during a conference call Tuesday .
Clinton 's campaign pre-butted the Obama campaign call earlier Tuesday , before the returns were posted online .
Clinton spokesman Phil Singer said Obama 's campaign should not " jump up on its soap - box " without releasing returns from all of Obama 's years in public office , dating back to his election to the Illinois State Senate in 1997 .
Singer also criticized Obama for not releasing records from his time in state government .
Although he said he was unsure whether pre-2000 tax returns would be released , Gibbs insisted that Obama 's correspondence with other public officials and agencies when he was a state senator already is public record and beyond that " there 's nothing to release . "
He wondered about " the address of the glass house that Phil is living in , " when asked by RAW STORY about the Clinton spokesman 's comments .
Gibbs said Obama has been more transparent than either Clinton or McCain during this campaign , and he seemed to link Clinton 's failure to release her tax returns to the Bush White House 's reputation for secrecy .
The American people , he said , " have suffered through eight years of a painfully secretive administration , and they want to turn the page on that style of government . "
DEVELOPING ...
This article contains a correction .
The current Texas Monthly features an extensive investigation by Katy Vine into the success of the state ’s sex-education program .
Some of its key findings include the startling revelations that :
Texas gets more than $ 4.5 million a year through Title V , a stream of federal funding for abstinence programs — more than any other state .
The Texas Education Code , written by the state legislature , requires that classrooms give more attention to abstinence than any other approach and that they must present abstinence as the only method that is 100 percent effective at preventing pregnancy , sexually transmitted infections , HIV / AIDS , and the “ emotional trauma associated with adolescent sexual activity . ”
No law mandates that methods of contraception be included in sex ed classes , and condom instruction is not encouraged anywhere in the code .
Only one of the four state - approved high school student health textbooks uses the word “ condom , ” and that book reaches only a small percentage of the Texas market .
“ In the entire state we found two people that were involved in these programs that had degrees in health education , ” Texas A&M researcher , B. E. “ Buzz ” Pruitt said .
“ Two of the curricula did n’t contain a single fact . ”
This lack of sex education is certainly taking a toll :
Texas ranks number one in teenage births , costing taxpayers there over $ 1 billion a year .
And 24 percent of those births are not the girl ’s first delivery .
The rate of teenage births in Texas is decreasing at a slower rate than the nation at large .
Texan teenagers say they are having sex at a higher rate than the national average ( 52.5 percent vs. 47 percent ) .
The Texas story is merely an extreme version of a phenomenon that is taking place all around America .
Under current federal standards , any sex education program receiving federal funds must conform to “ abstinence only ” guidelines , which means mentioning contraception only to discuss its failures and teaching , among other things , that “ sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects . ”
These programs are chosen as if specifically designed not to work .
One long - term evaluation of 10 state abstinence - only programs concluded , “ Abstinence - only programs show little evidence of sustained ( long - term ) impact on attitudes and intentions .
Worse , they show some negative impacts on youth ’s willingness to use contraception , including condoms , to prevent negative sexual health outcomes related to sexual intercourse .
Importantly , only in one state did any program demonstrate short - term success in delaying the initiation of sex ; none of these programs demonstrates evidence of long - term success in delaying sexual initiation among youth exposed to the programs or any evidence of success in reducing other sexual risk - taking behaviors among participants . ”
Of course , these programs are less oriented toward giving teenagers reliable information about sexuality than toward indoctrinating them with conservative Christian views about sex .
A single grant - making program at the Health Resources and Services Administration , federal aid to abstinence education , for instance , has doled out more than $ 50 million in federal grants to such organizations as Care Net Pregnancy Services of DuPage , Illinois , an evangelistic organization that exists to help women who experience unplanned or unwanted pregnancies “ choose life for their unborn babies ” ; Door of Hope Pregnancy Care Center in Madisonville , Kentucky , an organization “ committed to the belief in the sanctity of human life , primarily as it relates to the protection of the unborn ” ; and Bethany Crisis Pregnancy Services in Colorado Springs , Colorado , which warns women considering abortion , “ Your pregnancy ends with death .
You may feel guilt and shame about your choice .
You will remember taking a life . ”
In a larger study by the Centers for Disease Control , researchers found that although teenagers who take “ virginity pledges ” may wait longer to initiate sexual activity , they are more likely to enjoy oral and anal sex , and they are just as likely as other students to be infected with sexually transmitted diseases .
Eighty - eight percent eventually have premarital intercourse .
While abstinence - only programs show little evidence of sustained effect on a student ’s sexual activities , they do reduce the use of contraception , including condoms , when sex does take place .
The large - scale failure of these program is at least partially attributable to the fact that they are purposely , indeed transparently , dishonest .
Of the 13 federally funded programs studied in a minority staff report by the Committee on Government Reform , just two provided students with accurate medical and scientific information , a finding that was consistent with a U.S. Government Accountability Office study released two years later .
In the rest , students learned such “ facts ” as :
Half the gay male teenagers in the United States have tested positive for the AIDS virus .
Touching a person ’s genitals “ can result in pregnancy . ”
A 43 - day - old fetus is a “ thinking person . ”
HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , can be spread via sweat and tears .
Condoms fail to prevent HIV transmission as often as 31 percent of the time in heterosexual intercourse .
( The actual rate is less than 3 percent , according to the Centers for Disease Control . )
Women who experience abortions “ are more prone to suicide , ” and as many as 10 percent of them become sterile .
The right - wingers who continue to promote these programs refuse to accept that their false information is in any way responsible for increased pregnancy and STIs .
According to the conservative Christians in the Family Research Council , however , the relative failure of their lessons merely indicates that even more of the same may be needed .
Upon the announcement that yet another study — this one congressionally mandated and published by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. in the spring of 2007 — had demonstrated the ineffectiveness of such education , the group insisted that these very same failed “ programs must be intensive and long - term , so that the knowledge , attitudes , and skills needed to reject sex before marriage are constantly reinforced — particularly in the pivotal high school years . ”
By way of comparison , Canadian and European young people are about as active sexually as Americans , but teenage American girls are five times as likely to have a baby as French girls , seven times as likely to have an abortion , and 70 times as likely to have gonorrhea as teenage girls in the Netherlands .
In addition , the incidence of HIV / AIDS among American teenagers is five times that of the same age group in Germany .
Is it any wonder , therefore , that 17 * states have so far chosen to forgo federal matching funds rather than submit their children to the dishonest , propagandistic programs of conservative abstinence - only ideologues toward nearly all forms of sexual activity .
As if to demonstrate where its own priorities in this area lay , in November 2006 , the Bush administration nominated Dr. Eric Keroack to the post of deputy assistant secretary for population affairs , overseeing a number of Health and Human Services programs , including the Office of Family Planning and what is called “ Title X , ” a Nixon - era program that distributes contraceptives to poor or uninsured women .
A favorite guest speaker of the National Right to Life Committee , Keroack teaches that there is a physiological cause for relationship failure and sexual promiscuity that he calls “ God ’s Super Glue , ” which results in a hormonal cause and effect that can be short - circuited only by sexual abstinence until marriage .
And though he enjoyed the position of full - time medical director for A Woman ’s Concern , a chain of Boston - area crisis pregnancy centers that regards the distribution of contraceptives as demeaning to women , he was not even a certified obstetrician - gynecologist at the time of his appointment .
( Keroack resigned this post shortly after the Massachusetts Office of Medicaid announced an investigation into his private practice . )
What is perhaps most infuriating about the use and abuse of teenagers as proxies for the right ’s culture war against all forms of non-marital sexuality is the fact that it has little democratic support .
An extensive survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University asked voters whether “ the federal government should fund sex education programs that have ‘ abstaining from sexual activity ’ as their only purpose ” or if “ the money should be used to fund more comprehensive sex education programs that include information on how to obtain and use condoms and other contraceptives . ”
The condom / contraceptive option won the day by a margin of 67 percent to 30 percent .
Unsurprisingly , a similar number ( 65 percent ) said they worried that refusing to provide teens with good information about contraception might lead to unsafe sex , while only 28 percent were more concerned that such information might encourage teens to have sex .
In other words , a tiny , extremist minority in Congress is ensuring that the rate of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases remains unnaturally high because it prefers to cling to its ideological dicta rather than accept the facts that demonstrate the cost of its misinformation .
Sound familiar ?

Economist and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz speaks during an interview with Reuters in New York , September 18 , 2006 .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and the government of President George W. Bush were to blame for the U.S. financial crisis , Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz said in a magazine interview .
“ This man ( Greenspan ) has unfortunately made a lot of mistakes , ” said former World Bank chief economist Stiglitz , according to a preview of the interview to be published on Monday in profil magazine .
“ His first one was to support all the tax cuts which were introduced under Bush -- they did n’t stimulate the economy very much ...
This task was then transferred more towards monetary policy , though then ( Greenspan ) created a flood of credits with low interest rates , ” Stiglitz was quoted as saying .
Earlier in April , Greenspan said in an interview with CNBC television that the U.S. economy was in recession and defended his chairmanship of the U.S. central bank against charges that his policy missteps had laid the groundwork for the crisis .
He said decisions during his charge had been rationally constructed based on evidence at the time .
Stiglitz said Bush ’s government was also to blame .
“ I reproach them , that the economy was not as resilient as it could have been due to the ongoing tax cuts and the huge costs incurred by the war in Iraq , ” he was quoted as saying .
He said it was a myth that Europe could decouple itself from the United States .
“ Especially the weak dollar will continue to hit the European economy hard , because it will make it much harder to export , ” he said .
Washboard Abs on a High - Fat Diet , No Ab Workouts and No Cardio ?
Apologies in advance for the self - serving nature of this post , but I felt that it was time to answer more specifically many of your questions about my own program and to use myself as an example of how the Primal Blueprint works if you integrate all the elements .
As many of you know , I am coming off a three month rehab from knee surgery .
I ’m about 95 % healed now and can even do my “ Indigenous Peoples Stretch ” ( a full unloaded squat ) – a sure sign that all is well .
Throughout this time , I have maintained my usual diet and have done whatever upper - body lifting I could manage that did n’t also require substantial leg involvement ( pushups , pull - ups , dips , cable - work , etc ) .
Despite my ( or should I say “ because of my ” ) high - fat diet and doing pretty much zero cardio over the past four months ( including a fair amount of down time before the knee surgery ) my weight , my lean mass and my body fat have all remained steady .
I went on FitDay.com a few days ago ( great site to reveal the truth about what you eat ) and entered what was a typical full day of eating for me .
The results were pretty much as I expected : 2,458 calories , 58 % of which was from fat ; 165 grams of protein ( 1 gram per pound of body weight ) and 114 grams of carbs .
Now some might say that eating less than 2500 calories is too low for a moderately active man , but there are two points to make here .
First , I am never really hungry .
On this Primal Blueprint eating style , I eat when I want to and stop when I no longer feel hungry .
Pretty simple .
If I skip meals , I do n’t get light - headed or famished .
I do n’t ever feel like I need more calories or that I am missing out on anything or “ sacrificing ” some guilty pleasure .
I get plenty of protein to spare muscle and add to protein turnover .
I get plenty of fat for fuel – sometimes 65 % of daily calories .
Second – and this goes to the heart of the Primal concept – when you eat fewer carbs , your body readily accesses dietary and stored fat for fuel .
Even at 8 % body fat , I still have 46,000 calories of stored fat , at least 25,000 of which is available to use as fuel at any time .
Theoretically , you could walk 250 miles on that .
It ’s a beautiful thing when you direct gene expression to “ want ” to burn fat instead of always storing it .
You certainly do n’t need cardio to produce the full effect ( you can if you want , within guidelines ) .
As we often say here “ 80 % of your results come from how you eat . ”
Conversely , eating more carbs drives up insulin , drives carbs towards fat storage , decreases fat - burning by prompting fat cells to hold on to stored fat and makes you hungrier for more carbs .
I could burn some or most of all that off again by doing tons of cardio , but that only makes me hungrier for more carbs and perpetuates the cycle .
It ’s like digging a hole to put the ladder in to wash the basement windows .
The other point I want to make is that I do n’t do abs .
By that I mean I do n’t specifically do an ab routine or ab classes as any part of my workouts .
On the other hand , I pretty much work my abs all day long without specifically focusing on them .
And that ’s an important distinction .
Grok probably had a wicked set of abs .
He had to .
Abs are the center of the human movement universe .
They are part of today ’s “ core ” , the fulcrum , the key in Chi .
But you do n’t necessarily need to do endless crunches , sit-ups , roman chairs , leg raises or other isolation moves to strengthen them .
Sure , you can if you want , but I think the best way to work your abs is involve them in almost every other movement you do .
Every time you do it .
When you do pushups , you should tighten your abs hard , likewise when you do pull - ups , squats , lunges , curls – you name it .
And working your abs does n’t stop in the gym .
When you sit at your desk , you should take that opportunity to tighten your abs ( and by abs , we mean the whole complex : rectis and transverse abdominus , internal and external obliques , and pyrimidalis ) .
Tighten that belly as if you are going to be punched in the gut while blowing out the candles on your birthday cake .
Hold it for 10 , 20 or more seconds a few times every hour .
Now do it while slightly tilted to one side .
Now the other .
For even better results and a stronger core , you would simultaneously contract your buttock muscles like you are trying to hold in the bean dinner you had at Barry ’s last night .
Do these short exercise bursts while you are driving to pick up the kids or when stuck in traffic .
Hell , I do some of my best ab work bent over doing sprint work on the stationary bike .
It ’s really all about squeezing , tightening and trying to shorten the distance between your sternum and you pubic bone .
This is all considered isometric work , but the abs respond extremely well to it .
Eat right and those well - worked abs will show !
High - fat diet , no cardio , no ab workouts .
Talk about thumbing your nose at Conventional Wisdom !

Just two cents of every 2015 income tax dollar went to preventing war — and more than 37 cents went to current and pasts wars .
Emily Sajewski / FCNL
Businesses provide jobs , and employers and employees working together generate wealth .
At the same time , businesses need functioning schools , health care , research capacities , transportation , and communication systems to prosper and support their customer base .
These basic services and structures cannot be provided by individuals , no matter how wealthy .
Through taxes and other revenues , Congress and the president administer trillions of dollars of federal spending .
A country ’s budget is a black - and - white reflection of its priorities .
The United States ’ budget reflects a misalignment between our nation ’s needs and our government ’s spending priorities .
The U.S. should do more to support and protect people , and it should spend less money on war and violence .
2015 Budget Breakdown
37.5 % Current & past wars :
This includes the Pentagon ( Department of Defense ) budget and related military programs , such as nuclear weapons production in the Department of Energy , the military portion of the Overseas Contingency Operations fund ( OCO ) , and foreign military assistance ( 25 % ) ; the share of interest on the public debt that is due to past war spending ( 6 % ) ; and veterans ’ benefits and other costs of past wars ( 6 % ) .
28 % Health care :
This includes health care for children , elders and families through the Medicaid program , Indian Health , public health services and other programs .
It also includes some spending for the Medicare program , although the majority of that program is supported by a separate payroll tax and by premiums paid by participants .
( Veterans ’ health benefits and medical care for troops and other employees of the Department of Defense are included in the costs of war and past wars . )
14 % Income assistance :
This includes spending on programs available to eligible people based on income guidelines .
These programs provide food assistance , housing subsidies , unemployment insurance , temporary income supports and energy assistance in order to mitigate some of the enormous income gap between the richest and poorest in our country .
12 % General government :
This includes spending on the legislative and judicial branches and agencies that serve an all - government purpose , such as the Departments of the Treasury and Justice and the General Services Administration ( 3 % ) .
This also includes the interest on the public debt not due to spending on past wars ( 9 % ) .
5 % Social programs & supports for the economy :
This includes spending on programs that make commerce possible , including investments in rural and urban development , transportation and agriculture , along with employment , education , child care assistance and community programs .
2.5 % Energy , science & the environment :
This includes funding for the Environmental Protection Agency , National Science Foundation , National Aeronautic and Space Administration , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the non-nuclear part of the Department of Energy , most of the Department of the Interior , the Forest Service and the Natural Resource Conservation Service .
2 % Preventing war :
This includes the entire State Department ( including the diplomatic corps and the U.S. Agency for International Development ) , support for the United Nations and other international institutions and non-military aid to other countries .

The Sean Bell verdict — assuring that New York City ’s police can kill with impunity
By Bill Van Auken
26 April 2008
The decision handed down Friday morning by a New York judge in the police slaying of Sean Bell was as shocking as it was predictable .
A 23 - year - old , unarmed man was cut down in a hail of 50 bullets on the morning of what was to be his wedding , and no one is held accountable .
The not - guilty verdicts for the three New York City detectives in the November 2006 shooting follow a long pattern of court decisions and prosecutorial abstention that have served to exonerate the city ’s police force in the killings of unarmed civilians , the vast majority of them carried out in New York ’s poorer black and Hispanic neighborhoods .
For the friends and family of Bell — who is survived by his fiancée , Nicole Paultre , and two daughters , ages five and one — as well as for far wider layers of people in the Jamaica , Queens neighborhood and across the city ’s working - class communities , the verdict nonetheless provoked disbelief and outrage .
At the Queens courthouse , Supreme Court Judge Arthur Cooperman ’s verdict was met with cries of “ Shame ! ” and “ No ! ” while many were left in tears of rage .
People in the crowd outside shouted “ murderers ” as cops and police union officials left the courthouse .
Over 1,000 police ringed the area , significantly outnumbering the crowd that had come to hear the verdict and support Sean Bell ’s family .
Police helicopters hovered overhead .
In finding the three detectives — Michael Oliver , Marc Cooper , and Gescard Isnora — not guilty , Judge Cooperman claimed that the testimony of several key prosecution witnesses “ just did n’t make sense . ”
Cooperman added in his verdict that among the factors he had taken into account was that some of the prosecution witnesses , including the two who were shot and seriously wounded on the same morning Bell was killed , had criminal records .
This was something that was obviously unknown by the cops who unleashed a barrage of gunfire that ended Bell ’s life .
Testimony by the non-police witnesses in the trial indicated that Bell and his friends had no knowledge that the men that confronted them with guns and then shot them were police officers .
The judge dismissed not only the charges of manslaughter , but also misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment in a shooting that saw bullets tear through the surrounding neighborhood , in one case smashing into a busy transportation hub a football field ’s length away .
One of the cops — Oliver — fired 31 times , reloading his pistol in order to keep pouring bullets into the unarmed men .
The cops had been sent to the Club Kalua in Jamaica Queens , where Bell and his friends were celebrating a bachelor ’s party on the eve of his wedding .
They were there undercover , in plainclothes , investigating allegations of prostitution and drug sales at the location .
Failing to make any arrests in connection with their assigned mission , they got into a confrontation with Mr. Bell and his friends , allegedly because they suspected they had a gun .
No gun was ever found .
Why the cops — who were supposedly undercover and therefore not supposed to reveal their identities — chose to initiate such a confrontation has yet to be clarified .
Bell ’s friends — one of whom , Joseph Guzman , barely survived 19 bullet wounds — testified that they never heard the cops shout “ Police ! ” and had no idea that the man approaching their car waving his gun — Isnora — was a police detective .
Their understandable reaction was to try to drive away and save their own lives .
The cops responded with the fatal fusillade , claiming afterwards that they thought they saw the car ’s passenger — Guzman — reach for a gun .
The incident recalled nothing so much as the 1999 police killing of African immigrant Amadou Diallo in the Bronx .
He was gunned down in a hail of 41 bullets as he stood on his own doorstep , reaching for his wallet , which the cops in that incident also said they suspected was a gun .
In that infamous case , the four accused cops managed to secure a change of venue on the grounds that press coverage of the brutal killing made it impossible to get a fair trial in New York City .
Their trial was moved to Albany , and they received acquittals .
The three detectives in the Bell killing also had good reason to believe that a jury of 12 average New Yorkers would convict them , and opted to have the case heard by a judge .
There have been attempts by the police and some sections of the media to draw a distinction between the two cases on the grounds that , while the four cops in the Diallo case were all white , two of the three detectives on trial in the Bell killing were , like the victim himself , black .
Whatever the background of the individual cops who pulled the triggers , however , the social and political realities that give rise to such police killings remain the same .
Michael Bloomberg , New York City ’s billionaire Republican mayor , issued a statement on the verdict feigning sympathy with the Bell family , noting that “ an innocent man lost his life , a bride lost her groom , two daughters lost their father , and a mother and father lost their son . ”
He added , “ No verdict could ever end the grief that those who knew and loved Sean Bell suffer . ”
The statement — which essentially dismissed the injustice of the verdict itself — stood in stark contrast to that of Bloomberg ’s predecessor , Rudy Giuliani , whose standard reaction in similar police shootings was to vilify the victim .
Nonetheless , the bottom line was the same .
Bloomberg demanded acceptance of the abortion of justice handed down in the Queens courthouse , while warning that any form of violent protest would be swiftly suppressed by the city ’s police force .
This message was backed up by Police Commissioner Ray Kelly , who told the media , “ We have prepared , we have done some drills and some practice with appropriate units and personnel if there is any violence . ”
The same sentiments were echoed by the front - runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , Senator Barack Obama .
Campaigning in Indiana , Obama declared , “ We ’re a nation of laws , so we respect the verdict that came down . ”
The real significance of the verdict , however , is that the so - called “ nation of laws ” keeps double books .
There is one set for average working people , and quite another for the police and the privileged social layers whose interests they defend .
New York City ’s 35,000 - member police force has as its principal task that of policing the social divide — one of the deepest in the world — that cuts through the city 's 8 million people .
According to an analysis of tax data released earlier this month , the city ’s top 1 percent — some 82,000 people — account for fully 37 percent of the city ’s total income .
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis , while the average annual salary in New York City stands at $ 40,899 , the top fifth of Manhattan residents pull in an average of $ 351,333 .
Manhattan is an island shared by hedge fund manager John Paulson , who recorded $ 3.3 billion last year , with the bottom 20 percent — over 300,000 people — somehow surviving on an average household income of $ 8,855 a year .
It is a city where former Citigroup chairman Sanford Weill can spend more than $ 42 million for an apartment on Central Park West , while a record 9,300 families sleep in the city ’s homeless shelters each night .
Boasting the most expensive restaurants in the country , it is also a city where 1.3 million residents — including over 400,000 children — periodically go hungry for lack of sufficient money to buy food .
Protecting the interests of the haves against the have - nots under conditions of such stark social polarization requires a police force that knows it can kill with impunity .
Judge Cooperman ’s verdict has reaffirmed this fundamental bulwark of a grossly unequal society .
LAST SUMMER , AS Americans focused on the surge in Iraq , most ignored a military exercise with a potentially more far - reaching impact .
In a remote location in the Ural Mountains , Russia , China , and several Central Asian nations gathered for a massive war game , ironically dubbed " Peace Mission 2007 . "
Thousands of troops , armored vehicles , fighter - bombers , and attack helicopters stormed a town in a mock battle that was supposed to simulate fighting a terrorist takeover .
Beneath its antiterror veneer , Peace Mission 2007 was a classic display of military readiness :
When it was over , the troops paraded before their assembled defense chiefs , and the whole event laid the groundwork for a closer military alliance among the participating nations .
That such an exercise was held at all might seem shocking .
Despite the global war on terrorism , and a steady drumbeat of civil conflicts , no war involving a major power like Russia has occurred in decades , and no external enemy threatens any of the Central Asian nations .
But the exercise highlighted an alarming new reality .
With much less fanfare than the early days of the Cold War , the world is entering a new arms race , and with it , a dangerous new web of military relationships .
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , which tracks international armed forces spending , between 1997 and 2006 global military expenditures jumped by nearly 40 percent .
Driven mainly by anxiety over oil and natural resources , countries are building their arsenals of conventional weapons at a rate not seen in decades , beefing up their armies and navies , and forging potential new alliances that could divide up the world in unpredictable ways .
Much of this new arms spending is concentrated among the world 's biggest consumers of resources , which are trying to protect their access to energy , and the biggest producers of resources , which are taking advantage of their new wealth to build up their defenses at a rate that would have been unthinkable for a developing country until recently .
This power shift comes with enormous implications for the United States and its Western allies .
With more military power in the hands of authoritarian and sometimes unstable states , the arms race creates a growing possibility for real state - to - state conflict - a prospect that would dwarf even a major terror attack in its power to disrupt the world 's stability .
It also will force the West to change , to make its own plans to shore up resources , and to get used to a world arsenal it can no longer dominate .
For much of the past six decades , the world hung in a kind of armed equilibrium , with major powers unchallenged in their military and economic preeminence .
During the Cold War , it was ideology that occupied the foreground for strategic thinkers ; and even more recently , the idea of a power struggle driven by resources seemed remote .
But this situation has changed dramatically in just the past decade .
As easily accessible global stocks of oil dwindle , the world supply of oil and gas has been concentrated in a smaller and smaller number of hands over just the past decade .
Some 80 percent of all reserves now are concentrated in fewer than 10 nations .
The biggest consumers desperately want to protect their secure flows of oil and gas from this handful of key suppliers , while simultaneously preventing their rivals from inking deals with resource - rich nations .
The result , in some cases , is alliances between consumers and producers ; in others , it is new and unexpected links .
Middle East specialist Flynt Leverett calls some of these new relationships the emerging " Axis of Oil , " an informal alliance between oil producers like Venezuela , Kazakhstan , Iran , and Russia , which are increasing state control over their petroleum , and powerful authoritarian developing nations desperately short of resources .
The biggest of these nations is China , which will surpass the United States in its petroleum use within the next two decades .
And , fittingly , it is China that is driving a great deal of the current arms race .
It has been increasing its defense budget by roughly 20 percent annually , and begun transforming the People 's Liberation Army , historically an overpoliticized , undertrained force , into a leaner , truly modern fighting machine .
" The pace and scope of China 's military expansion are startling , " says John Tkacik , a China analyst at the Heritage Foundation , a think tank in Washington .
Meanwhile , China has also been inking big military deals with new allies across the globe .
In 2004 , China signed a deal with Iran in which it will spend as much as $ 100 billion on future supplies of Iranian petroleum , and Iran has become one of China 's biggest arms clients .
To keep strong links with Sudan , which sends roughly half of all its oil to China , Beijing has provided weapons to the Khartoum regime , despite international pressure in the wake of the Darfur genocide .
Over the past decade , China has been building other types of alliances as well - training other countries ' army officers , for instance , with the kind of education programs once dominated by the Pentagon .
In the Philippines , where the military historically had deep ties to America and where China has inked a joint offshore oil exploration deal , one top defense official says many of his leading officers now head to China for short courses .
" This is now considered relatively prestigious , to go to China , " agrees Philippine defense analyst Rommel Banlaoi .
" That would n't have been true a few years ago . "
In oil - rich Venezuela , China has been training defense satellite technicians , elite forces , and other military personnel .
China has also helped Hugo Chavez revamp his oil infrastructure , and Venezuela 's president has vowed to roughly triple his shipments to Beijing in the coming years .
In Central Asia , Chinese oil companies , aided by large loan and aid packages from Chinese state - linked banks , have helped leading petroleum producers in that region orient new pipelines toward China .
And with Central Asian nations that themselves possess aging , post - Soviet armed forces , China has become a major military player .
China is only one of the drivers in the new global arms race .
Playing off its role as both energy supplier and , in some cases , consumer , Russia has increased its arms sales to border nations in the Caspian region in order to further its energy links .
In Central Asia , the Kremlin has stepped up training for local militaries , and in Indonesia , one of the world 's largest gas producers , then - Russian President Vladimir Putin last summer signed a deal to sell some $ 6 billion in new weapons .
Under Putin , the Kremlin also vowed to rebuild its navy .
" It 's clear that a new arms race is unfolding in the world , " Putin declared just before leaving office .
India has been building its arsenal , too , launching a massive ballistic missile program .
Singapore has vastly upgraded its forces , and in the Middle East , Saudi Arabia recently bought billions of dollars ' worth of new fighter jets from Europe , new spending nearly matched by some of the other Gulf states .
In part to counter the efforts of Russia and China , Washington and other leading industrialized powers are building their own military links - and again , these have little to do with ideological agreement .
With Australia , Singapore , Japan , and India - three democracies and one essentially authoritarian state - Washington has started holding joint military exercises , including a vast war game last summer at virtually the same time as Peace Mission 2007 .
On a recent visit to India by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , another top defense official told reporters that the Pentagon was building ties to India " as a hedge " against China .
In the Caspian region , the United States is building its own military - energy ties .
Over the past decade , it has boosted defense links to nations like Azerbaijan and Georgia critical to petroleum pipelines serving America , while simultaneously offering public White House meetings to Caspian leaders - even to Azeri President Ilham Aliyev , accused of massive fraud in the past election .
Across oil - rich Central Asia , the Pentagon has negotiated deals to allow US forces to operate out of bases in many Central Asian states , and is now cultivating Turkmenistan - a major gas producer where , since the death of its long - ruling autocratic leader , the nation has taken some tentative steps to re-engage with the West .
In the Middle East , the United States is also building a new alliance to contain Iran 's influence .
Over the past year , the Bush administration aggressively pressured Congress to allow Washington to sell some $ 20 billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia in order to build up a bulwark against Iran .
In many ways , these new deals echo the old " Great Game , " the competition among Western powers for influence in Central Asia .
But today the situation is far more complex :
With so much money in the hands of resource - rich countries , the line is now much fuzzier between major powers and the developing nations whose resources they are sparring over .

May 7 , 2008 -- Karl Marx , born on 5 May , 1818 , nearly two centuries ago , had in 1867 laid bare the ``intimate connection between the pangs of hunger of the most industrious layers of the working class , and the extravagant consumption , coarse or refined , of the rich , for which capitalist accumulation is the basis '' ( Capital Vol. 1 , Ch. 25 ) .
In May 2008 , nearly a century and a half later , as we hear Emperor Bush hold forth on global hunger , we are reminded that capitalism and global wealth remains just as intimately wedded to hunger .

The global policeman Bush , in the time - honoured traditions of the backyard bully , has long harboured the habit of dictating to nations who their friends and enemies should be .
Now , he has taken to telling nations how much they should eat , and of wagging a disapproving finger at poor nations whose middle class has made some improvements in its diet .
Bush 's sentiments ( and those of his lieutenant Condoleezza Rice ) reek of callous contempt for the world 's poor .
They lay bare the fact that the only perspective Bush and US imperialism is capable of is that of the US corporations .
In Bush 's words , the growing purchasing power of the middle class in the developing world is ``good '' because ``y ' know , it 's hard to sell products into countries that are n't prosperous ' ' ( see http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/3006775.cms), he said on May 3 .
But , lamented Bush , ``you start getting wealth , you start demanding better nutrition and better food ' ' .
In other words , India 's growing appetite was pushing food prices up and causing the rest of the world to go hungry .
Unfortunately , the world 's people have n't mastered the art of being markets , not mouths : of tightening the belt over their bellies while loosening their purse strings ...
Bush is the head of the nation whose successive governments used its military to ruthlessly batter a long list of Latin American and African countries into being pliant suppliers of cash crops for the US corporations ; and in the process devastating the food security of these nations .
Major General Smedley Butler has described how , as a US marine , he had been ``a high class muscle - man for Big Business ... a gangster for capitalism '' who had helped to make Honduras , Mexico , Haiti , various Central American republics , Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic ``safe ' ' for plunder by US fruit , oil , and sugar corporations and banks in the early twentieth century .
Washington 's latest exploit has been to ``make Iraq safe '' for US oil corporations , in the process devastating its economy , its infrastructure , and its thriving health and education structures .
Now , Bush has the gall to offer in charity what his nation has plundered by military muscle and economic arm - twisting .
Like a rapacious wolf dressed up as a kindly and nurturing mother , he describes the US as an ``unbelievably compassionate and generous nation ' ' and offers to help the poor countries out by ``buying food directly from farmers as opposed to giving people food ' ' .
So , the deepest desire of the US corporations –- to have the farmers of developing countries as captive and direct producers for them alone -– is projected by Bush as generosity !
The US today along with a small and exclusive club of ``developed '' countries guzzles a disproportionate share of the world 's scarce resources including fuel , paper and food .
It is also responsible for a disproportionately high share of global pollution .
Although constituting only 5 per cent of the global population , the US emits more carbon dioxide , consumes more paper and other forest products , and produces more municipal waste than any other country .
Yet Bush refused to curb carbon emissions in the US , saying ``the American way of life is not negotiable '' , and peddling the absurd theory that cows were more responsible for such emissions than cars , and so countries like China and India ought therefore to bear a greater burden of curbing emissions !

Annual per capita foodgrains consumption in the US is over five times that of India , and three times that of China , according to figures released by the US Department of Agriculture for 2007 .
On average , a US citizen consumes 1046 kg of grain , and around 20 times more meat and fish and 60 times more paper , gasoline and diesel than the average Indian .
But in India , since the entry of globalisation , the average per capita consumption of food grain has actually gone down from 177 kg per person to 155 kg per person : which is the same as the hunger levels seen during famine in times of the British Raj .
And in India , foodgrains absorption is rising fast for the ( mainly urban ) middle class , which boosts the national average .
A large section of the rural poor are actually reduced to as low as 136 kg per capita per year –- which is the same as that of starvation - hit sub -Saharan Africa .
Bush grudges the 350 million - strong Indian middle class its improved diet : he is blithely silent about more than 350 million rural Indians who are below the average food energy intake of sub-Saharan African countries !
Studies have shown a long - term tendency towards declining per capita calorie consumption , especially in rural India -– that is , Indians are growing hungrier year after year .
Deaths by hunger are an all - too common phenomenon which Indian rulers are united in denying .
And these millions owe their hunger directly to the rural job losses , income decline , land grab , slashed government expenditure on rural development , slashed PDS and increased grain exports -– all of which are policies aggressively promoted by the US - backed IMF - World Bank , and faithfully forced on Indian people by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his predecessors .
Of course , the actual food consumption of the poor Americans is less than the national average .
Hunger and homelessness are a growing phenomenon in the US , the world 's richest country .
According to the US Department of Agriculture , in 2006 more 35 million people lived in food - insecure households , including 13 million children .
Adults living in over 12 million households could not eat balanced meals and in more than 7 million families someone had smaller portions or skipped meals .
In close to 5 million families , children did not get enough to eat at some point during the year .
This hunger at home is all the more horrific when one knows that more than sufficient food grains are grown in the US –- but is fed to cars as ``bio - fuel ' ' rather than to hungry people !
Bush 's bratty and bullying arrogance is really nothing new : we expect nothing better .
The real question is why Manmohan Singh , our prime minister , describes a man with such contempt for India and for the poor of the world , as ``India 's best friend ' ' ?
Why insist on continuing with US - dictated policies which favour imperialism and force millions of Indians to live in misery and hunger ?

Book : McCain temper boiled over in ' 92 tirade , called wife a ' cunt ' Nick Juliano

John McCain 's temper is well documented .
He 's called opponents and colleagues " shitheads , " " assholes " and in at least one case " a fucking jerk . "
But a new book on the presumptive Republican nominee will air perhaps the most shocking angry exchange to date .
The Real McCain by Cliff Schecter , which will arrive in bookstores next month , reports an angry exchange between McCain and his wife that happened in full view of aides and reporters during a 1992 campaign stop .
An advance copy of the book was obtained by RAW STORY .
Three reporters from Arizona , on the condition of anonymity , also let me in on another incident involving McCain 's intemperateness .
In his 1992 Senate bid , McCain was joined on the campaign trail by his wife , Cindy , as well as campaign aide Doug Cole and consultant Wes Gullett .
At one point , Cindy playfully twirled McCain 's hair and said , " You 're getting a little thin up there . "
McCain 's face reddened , and he responded , " At least I do n't plaster on the makeup like a trollop , you cunt . "
McCain 's excuse was that it had been a long day .
If elected president of the United States , McCain would have many long days .
The man who was known as " McNasty " in high school has erupted in foul - languaged tirades at political foes and congressional colleagues more - or - less throughout his career , and his quickness to anger has been an issue on the presidential campaign trail as evidence of his fury has surfaced .
As Schecter notes , McCain 's rage is not limited to the political spectrum , and even his family cannot be spared the brute force of his anger .
Schecter , who also blogs at The Agonist , said in an interview the anecdote is " an early example of his uncontrollable temper . "
In the book he outlines several other examples of McCain losing his cool and raises the question of how that would affect a McCain presidency .
What should voters make of this pattern ?
In February 2008 Tim Russert succinctly described McCain on MSNBC 's Morning Joe .
A devilish grin spread from ear to ear as Russert , no McCain hater , leaned forward and spoke in a whisper , " He likes to fight . "
Russert got it right .
But the big question is n't whether McCain likes to fight : it 's who , when , and how .
The exchange between McCain and his wife was not reported anywhere when it happened , Schecter said ( a LexisNexis database search confirms this ) .
In 1992 , McCain 's mention in the national media revolved mostly around his involvement in the Keating Five scandal , and only local reporters closely followed his re-election bid .
McCain is well known for his rapport with the national media covering his presidential bid ( he 's jokingly referred to the press as " my base " ) , but Schecter said this incident was buried not out of fealty to the Arizona senator .
Rather , it was uneasiness about how to get such a coarse exchange into a family newspaper , and he did n't fault the local press for not covering the incident .
" Members of the media are squeamish covering stuff like this so they let it go , " Schecter told RAW STORY in an interview Monday .
" Back in ' 92 , when people use naughty words , [ reporters ] do n't know as much what to do with it . "
Much has changed since then .
President Bush 's reference to a New York Times reporter as a " major league asshole " was reported in at least 47 newspapers during the 2000 campaign , when the off - color remark was overheard , according to a database search .
And more than a dozen newspapers have reported Dick Cheney 's recommendation that Sen. Patrick Leahy " fuck yourself . "
McCain and his aides have brushed off suggestions that his temper could impede his ability to perform the sometimes - delicate tasks asked of a president .
The candidate was asked about his legendary temper last week on " Fox News Sunday , " where he cited his ability to work " across the aisle " while in the Senate .
" You can't scare people or intimidate them if you 're going to reach agreement with your colleagues and your contemporaries
And I 've worked hard at that , and that 's what the American people want , " McCain said . "
The second thing is if I lose my capacity for anger , then I should n't be president of the United States .
...
When I see the waste and corruption in Washington , I get angry . "
McCain 's campaign did not return a call from RAW STORY seeking comment Monday morning .
Schecter says McCain 's anger is much more than a passion for the issues .
One can only imagine what would happen if McCain were to try to squeeze that temper into the tight confines of diplomacy .
" The public certainly has to know what this guy might do as president , " Schecter says .
Examples like the ones in his book " should worry people , quite frankly . "
EA just wo n't take no for an answer !
The Wall Street Journal reckon ( ie they know ahead of an announcement ) that since EA 's last hostile takeover deadline passed , they 're going to go right ahead and ... set another deadline .
Stop me if I 'm wrong here , but if you set more than one deadline , it 's not really a deadline , is it ?
It 's more a " date you 'd really like to have things sorted by , but if its not , that 's cool " .

EA May Extend Deadline for Take - Two Offer [ Wall Street Journal ]
I thought I ’d take some time to talk about licensing .
Licensing is something that F / OSS programmers talk about a lot .
There ’s two major categories of licenses :
The GPL , aka Copyleft .
You must distribute source with your application , and users get full rights to the source code , including any additions you may make .
, aka Copyleft .
You must distribute source with your application , and users get full rights to the source code , including any additions you may make .
Permissive licenses , X/ MIT , BSD , etc .
These let you do pretty much everything .
There ’s also the LGPL , which vaguely applies GPL - like terms to the original code , but is not “ viral ” .
LGPL originally meant “ Library GPL ” but was renamed to “ Lesser GPL ” because people automatically used it for libraries without considering what the license actually enforced .
How much do these licenses matter ?
How should a person choose between these options ?
First , the LGPL .
It has specific phrasing that makes some sense for C code , to distinguish between extending the library itself and using the library .
It does n’t make much sense for other runtime environments .
Some people have tried to clarify its meaning in other environments , but I ’m not sure if a clarification like that means much .
The ambiguity seems like the worst of all worlds .
People who are afraid of the GPL wo n’t use the software anyway .
People who act in bad faith can satisfy the terms of the license through trickery .
You do n’t get any practical protection over a permissive license , and you get most of the stigma of the GPL .
The GPL has some success stories , places where source was actually released due to the terms of the license .
I do n’t know of any similar success stories for the LGPL .
If you do n’t want to use the GPL , just use a permissive license .
Then the question : GPL or permissive licensing ?
For some time I ’ve chosen a permissive license for my code .
But I ’m not really advocating that , and every so often I throw out a little GPL code .
Underneath this is something of a disinterest in licensing .
I do n’t think it means much .
If specifics of your license matters then something has gone wrong .
People are leeching code , and / or the community is n’t providing enough benefit to encourage participation .
I do n’t believe that software has much intrinsic worth , and treating it like property does n’t make that much sense to me .
Licensing treats software as property , which is why I see the relevance of licensing as a kind of disfunction .
But there is the outside chance that it ’s really just a big project , or that the project is being participated in by rivals .
But nothing I work with is like this , and it ’s pretty uncommon generally , and anyway those projects all have their licensing pretty much figured out .
The GPL does seem to serve a constructive purpose when rivals have to cooperate in some fashion .
It makes a kind of demilitarized zone where everyone has to work for the collective good .
But even this is a sign that you ca n’t trust the participants .
This is somewhat reasonable , because you can’t actually trust large corporations with faceless programmers working on the code .
But even that ’s a kind of disfunction , because you can at least kind of trust large corporations with programmer employees who have a public face .
The individual programmers are going to be very uncomfortable participating in any kind of Machiavellian conspiracy .
Good open source projects are a coming together of individuals .
Institutions are not effective participants .
There are however scaling issues with individual participation : particularly that only a minority of developers are actually inclined to participate in this way .
An institution can pay someone to work on something they do n’t care very deeply about , and that person can still do useful work .
But they wo n’t be part of the community .
Outside of this mediation of rivalries I ’m not really sure what the GPL provides .
It protects users , because the terms of the GPL ensure that users get code .
It does n’t actually ensure that code is made public , though it does give developer employees leverage to make their work public .
There ’s some urban legends about the viral aspect of the GPL , but that ’s really just bullshit .
Code does n’t magically get relicensed just because there ’s a little GPL in the mix .
The GPL police wo n’t show up at your door and confiscate your computers .
The only people who make those claims are GPL - haters like Microsoft .
Who should you trust : the FSF or Microsoft ?
If you answered “ Microsoft ” then you need to get your head screwed on straight .
Unfortunately there is a stigma about the GPL , and there are competent developers that avoid all GPL software .
I find this frustrating , especially since I do n’t actually care about licensing , and so this adds a point of contention that I do n’t really care to pay attention to .
Some people in this situation then become GPL haters , because they feel like it ’s all GPL ’s fault .
But the GPL did n’t create the licensing situation — proprietary software started this .
Direct your hate where it belongs .
The GPL ai n’t it .
If my libraries were GPL I doubt I could leverage that to make other people open source their code .
But I know I would alienate some people , and as a result I choose a permissive license because it ’s just strategically advantageous .
Applications I think are different strategically .
You do n’t just swap an application in and out like you might a library .
If you choose to use an application , then often the licensing is a secondary choice .
The licensing ultimately only really applies to extensions .
Libraries also have a different pattern of acceptance .
Stubborn GPL haters can in effect veto a library in many projects ( this is because stubborn GPL haters are viral ) .
But in an application their influence is much smaller .
Developers concerns like architecture and choice of libraries are not what drives an application .
An application is driven by its functionality .
If you have a useful application then licensing tends to be a secondary concern .
The licensing tends to define the community in some sense as well , and as a result there ’s a kind of opt - in consensus .
And I think the GPL in these cases really does create an environment of collaboration around extensions .
It has a real benefit .
This seems to be true empirically as well .
GPL ’d libraries do n’t tend to get very popular .
People will do crazy - big projects just because of licensing issues .
GPL ’d Applications seem to do quite well , with examples like WordPress , Plone , The Gimp , and even the Linux kernel , which is closer in structure to an application than a library .
I have n’t studied the GPL v3 very closely , but it seems useful to me .
Software - as - a - service has the potential to make the GPL irrelevant ( especially for the kind of code I write ) , and could put the GPL in the same category as the LGPL where it retains its stigma without offering any practical advantages .
Version 3 makes the permission / GPL choice seem useful , but so far I ’ve never made any truly conscious choice between version 2 and 3 .
If you are thinking about choosing a license , or thinking about choosing software based on the licensing , maybe these thoughts will be helpful in your own thinking .
And please do n’t GPL - hate in the comments , I ’m not interested and if you feel the need then go write your own post .
Update : I wrote a second article to expand on some thoughts :
The GPL and Principles
My children do n't watch nearly as much TV as I did at their age .
I asked my daughter if she knew any famous ducks .
She could only think of The Ugly Duckling !
But our pop culture landscape bears the tracks of an entire flock of famous ducks .
Count Duckula
Count Duckula began as a villainous character on the British TV show Danger Mouse .
He was spun off into his own show in 1988 and imported to the US ( as well as many other countries ) , where he was sometimes mistaken for a version of Daffy Duck .
Count Duckula was a vegetarian vampire duck who could teleport to any part of the world .
The show ran until 1993 .
You Bet Your Life Duck
You Bet Your Life was a game show hosted by Groucho Marx that aired on NBC from 1950 to 1960 .
If the contestant said the secret word ( which the TV audience knew ) , a duck would fall from above and the contestant won $ 100 .
Why a duck ?
It was a reminder of the famous line from the 1929 Marx Brothers movie The Cocoanuts .
Groucho :
And here is the viaduct leading over to the mainland .
Chico :
Why a duck ?
Why a no chicken ?
The Ugly Duckling
The title character of The Ugly Duckling was n't even a duck !
The story was first published by Hans Christian Anderson in 1843 , about a baby bird who is ostracized because he does n't look nice like the other ducklings in his family .
When he matures , he finds that he is really a beautiful swan .
See the Disney cartoon from 1939 on video .
The 1931 version inexplicably has the swan hatched from the nest of a chicken .
AFLAC Duck
The AFLAC duck , featuring the voice of Gilbert Gottfried , has been hinting for us to buy a certain brand of insurance since 1999 .
He inspired a generation of toddlers to say " AFLAC "  instead of " quack "  when asked what a duck sounds like .
AFLAC has a video gallery of the ads .
Ping
The Story About Ping is a children 's book written by Marjorie Flack and Kurt Wiese in 1933 about a duck who lives on a boat on the Yangtze River in China .
He falls behind , misses the boat , and has to find his own way home .
It 's a charming story for preschoolers and early readers .
Rubber Duckie
The Sesame Street Muppet Ernie loves his Rubber Duckie .
The song was sung by Jim Henson in 1970 , and reached number 16 on Billboard 's pop music chart in September of that year .
Howard the Duck
The 1986 George Lucas film Howard the Duck was such a spectacular flop that the title became a metaphor for " awful movie "  .
The jokes were n't funny and the duck character looked only real enough to make his romantic interest in Lea Thompson overly creepy .
Ferdinand
Ferdinand was the duck in the 1995 movie Babe .
He spent his time desperately scheming to make himself so useful that the farm family would never think of eating him .
He crowed like a rooster every morning , until Mrs. Hoggett acquired an alarm clock .
Donald Duck
The Disney character Donald Duck made his debut in The Wise Little Hen in 1934 .
His distinctive voice , which sounds thoroughly ducky but barely intelligible , made him famous .
Donald is best known for losing his temper , allowing him to show off the voice without saying much of anything .
He looks dapper in his sailor suit , but never wears pants , except when swimming .
Donald has girlfriend ( Daisy ) , three nephews ( Hewey , Dewey , and Lewey ) , a rich uncle ( Scrooge McDuck ) , and various other Disney relatives .
Daffy Duck
The Warner Brothers character Daffy Duck is possibly the most popular duck of all .
He first appeared in 1937 in the cartoon Porky 's Duck Hunt .
The classic Daffy was voiced by Mel Blanc , but interpreted as slightly different by each animator who drew him .
He can be manic or neurotic , smart or stupid , but his understandable responses to a world that seems to be lined up against him makes him easy for audiences to relate to .
See Daffy in action in the classic Chuck Jones cartoon Duck Amuck .
This is by no means an exhaustive list .
I could 've added Baby Huey , Disco Duck , and quite a few others .
Who 's your favorite duck ?

House Republican plans to tack telecom immunity onto war funding bill
Amid maneuvering by House Democrats to add domestic spending to a planned war appropriations bill , Republican House Rep. Jerry Lewis ( CA - 41 ) plans to do them one better :
Lewis , ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee , seeks to tack on retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies who spied on Americans for President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , The Hill reports .
" It s time for the Democratic leaders to put our national security ahead of the desires of trial lawyers and pass the FISA bill that was passed by the Senate , " Lewis said .
" This Congress should make this legislation one of its top priorities until the intelligence gap is closed . "
KELSEYVILLE ( AP ) – Authorities say a dentist was defending himself Friday when he shot and wounded his estranged wife who had attacked him with a pickax .
The Lake County Sheriff ’s Department says dentist Don Johnson shot his wife , Margaret Johnson , once in the neck after she broke into their home with a pickax .
She was taken to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital and listed in stable but critical condition .
The couple was not living together , and Margaret Johnson had been served with a restraining order the day of the shooting .
Don Johnson said his wife broke through a window after he had gone to bed Friday and that she entered the house armed with a pickax .
Authorities say Johnson fired one shot , then called the sheriff ’s department .
Charges against Margaret Johnson are pending further investigation .

The domain name was registered in 1994
A US man has sold the domain name pizza.com for $ 2.6 m ( £ 1.3 m ) - after maintaining the site for just $ 20 a year since 1994 .
Chris Clark , 43 , accepted the offer from an anonymous bidder after a week - long online auction .
" It 's crazy , it 's just crazy , " Mr Clark , who lives in North Potomac , Maryland , was quoted as saying by the Baltimore Sun newspaper .
" It will make a significant difference in my life , for sure , " he added .
Regret
Mr Clark registered the domain name in 1994 , when the world wide web was just starting .
He had hoped that pizza.com would help to get a contract with a pizza firm for his consulting company .
He sold his business in 2000 , but kept paying the $ 20 annual fees for maintaining the domain , which he also used to sell advertisements .
In January , Mr Clark decided to sell it after hearing that another domain - Vodka.com - was sold for $ 3 m in 2006 .
" I thought , ' Why do n't I just try to see what the level of interest is ? ' "
Mr Clark said .
" If someone 's willing to pay that much for Vodka.com , maybe there 's more interest in pizza.com . "
The online auction was launched on 27 March .
The first bid was $ 100 , jumping to $ 2.6 m a week later .
Having accepted the latter offer , Mr Clark hopes to get his windfall in a few days ' time when the transaction is completed .
He said he now regretted not buying more domain names in the 1990s .
A no -no for the budget conscious : grocery shopping when hungry .
Now scientists say shopping when sad can bust your budget , too .
The study , scheduled for publication in the June issue of the journal Psychological Science , explains one way a person 's mood impacts consumer spending .
" It is important to increase understanding of how emotion and economic decisions interact , " said lead researcher Cynthia Cryder , a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pa .
" The relatively new field of behavioral decision research is increasingly moving in that direction . "
With funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health , Cryder and her colleagues conducted a study of 33 people aged 18 to 30 .
Participants who had watched a sad video clip offered more than three times as much for a water bottle than those who viewed a neutral clip from a documentary .
Results also showed that participants who were feeling blue and also had a high level of self - focus were the biggest spenders .
Cryder 's team determined self - focus levels by counting the number of times participants mentioned " I , me , my and myself " in essays they wrote about themselves .
Past studies have suggested down - and - out feelings trigger a person to become self - focused .
So the sadder a person , the more self - focused they might become .
This combination , sad and high self - focus , likely causes individuals to devalue themselves and their current possessions , the researchers suggest .
The result , they say , is an increased willingness to dole out more for material goods , presumably to enhance the sense of self .
The self - prescribed depression Rx might not be in vain .
Past research has shown that spending money , whether for a selfish buy or a goodwill gift , can boost a person 's self - esteem and mood , at least temporarily .
The sad - splurging effect could apply to other areas of a person 's life , the researchers speculate , including stock investing and relationship shopping .
LONDON - Good advice ?
Maybe .
Oddest book title of 2007 - that 's official .
" If You Want Closure in Your Relationship , Start With Your Legs " has won the Diagram Prize for the oddest title of the year , The Bookseller magazine announced Friday .
Big Boom , the apparently pseudonymous author , calls it a " self - help book , written by a man for the benefit of women . "
It 's a book , he writes , that is " raw , honest and about you , " distilling " the sweat off my back , the wrinkles in my forehead from anger and thinking all the time . "
The title triumphed in a public vote over runner - up " I Was Tortured by the Pygmy Love Queen " and the third - place finisher , " Cheese Problems Solved . "
The deputy editor of The Bookseller Joel Rickett says the title of the book is so effective that " you do n't even need to read the book itself . "

It 's all about the company you keep ( h/t KL ) :
When Sen. John McCain addressed the nation 's burgeoning mortgage mess last week , he insisted it was time for a little " straight talk . "
" I will not play election - year politics with the housing crisis , " the GOP presidential hopeful insisted while unveiling his plan , which many have since described as friendlier to the mortgage industry than the Democrats ' proposals .
What McCain did not say - which some believe smacks of politics - is that two of his top advisers were recently lobbyists for a notorious lender in the mortgage meltdown .
John Green , the senator 's chief liaison to Congress , and Wayne Berman , his national finance co-chairman , billed more than $ 720,000 in lobbying fees from 2005 through last year to Ameriquest Mortgage through their lobbying firm , disclosure forms reviewed by the Daily News show .
Ameriquest , which since has been bought out , was forced to settle suits with 49 states for $ 325 million .
More than 13,680 New York homeowners got taken for a ride by the company , records show .
" They would be defined as the most blatant and aggressive predatory lenders out of everybody , " said Bruce Marks , head of the nonprofit Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America .
High gas prices can prompt political hysteria in the best of times , but when they soar during an election year , the fumes rising from candidate stump speeches can make a person sick .
Of the three candidates and the president they ’re out to replace , only one is telling the truth about oil -- and he may suffer for his political courage .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) unveiled his nonsensical solution to $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline two weeks ago when he proposed suspending the federal excise tax on gas during the peak - travel summer months .
Not to be outdone on the pandering front -- and no doubt after seeing poll results showing that high gas prices have topped Iraq among Americans ’ biggest concerns -- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) seconded McCain ’s motion and spiced it up with a proposal to tax windfall profits of oil companies to make up for the lost gas - tax revenues .
McCain ’s gas - tax gimmick is about what one would expect from a Republican candidate , given that his party ’s shortsighted energy policies are partly to blame for the fix we ’re in today .
Rather than supporting conservation measures , such as tougher vehicle fuel standards , the Republicans wasted years fighting a pointless battle to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling .
President Bush continued to hammer on this tired theme Tuesday , as if unaware that it would take about a decade to extract a drop of oil from the refuge and that doing so would have a negligible effect on prices .
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) is refusing to play along with what he has called a gas - tax “ scheme , ” perhaps because he has learned from experience .
When he was an Illinois state senator in 2000 , he voted in favor of a six - month suspension of the state ’s sales tax on gasoline .
A study later showed that the state lost $ 175 million in revenue , and consumers barely benefited -- gas prices simply rose to make up for the tax cut .
Any economist could have predicted this :
If you lower the price of gas without increasing the supply , it will only raise demand and thus boost prices .
Advertisement
A summer moratorium on the 18.4 - cent federal gas tax would cost an estimated $ 9 billion , money that is desperately needed to shore up the country ’s transportation infrastructure .
McCain ’s assurance that he would divert tax revenue from other sources to make up the difference is not reassuring amid a ballooning federal deficit , and Clinton ’s plan to tax oil companies has been tried without success by congressional Democrats for years .
Clinton is now running commercials in Indiana , site of the next Democratic primary on Tuesday , attacking Obama for his policy on gasoline prices .
Never mind that there is almost no chance of getting her proposal through Congress before Memorial Day , even if it made sense .
Here ’s hoping the people of Indiana can see through this ploy .
Pansy ?
Standing next to Clinton , her top surrogate in North Carolina actually used the word “ pansy ” this morning .
After touring a bio- manufacturing training center , Gov. Easley , First Lady of North Carolina Mary Easley and Clinton held a ceremony at NC State University .
The Governor formally expressed his support saying that there was “ nothing I love more than a strong powerful woman . ”
Easley concluded his remarks saying Clinton — “ makes Rocky Balboa look like a pansy ” .
In case anyone has been living under a rock , pansy is slang for “ fag . ”
pan·sy
a . Used as a disparaging term for a man or boy who is considered effeminate .
b. Used as a disparaging term for a homosexual man .
So , Hillary is n’t gay ?
Or Hillary is n’t a weak gay ?
And of course , gays are something bad that need to be avoided .
Now why would Hillary embrace gay - bashing to help her campaign ?
Well , putting aside the Clintons ’ history of embracing gay - bashing when it suited them , take a look at what Ben Smith wrote this morning :
Easley is a meaningful ally in the culture war she ’s waging against Senator Barack Obama , as she seeks to cast him as a hopelessly unelectable liberal elitist …
Oh , so Hillary has launched a “ culture war ” against Obama .
And what are the three elements of the culture wars ?
God , guns , and gays .
Hillary already pulled the God and gun card on Obama in Pennsylvania , where she could n’t even say when she last went to church , and then claimed she was a hunter after a lifetime as one of America ’s top gun control advocates .
And now she ’s gay - bashing .
And actually , she started subtly gay - bashing a while back .
Remember all of her “ San Francisco ” references ?
Then there was her top aides calling Obama supporters “ latte sippers who only care about “ feelings ” ( i.e. , they ’re a bit effeminate and effete ) .
( Then again , look who ’s advising her . )
It ’s ironic .
Hillary is afraid to use the word “ gay , ” and gets visibly uncomfortable when answering questions about gay issues .
But using slurs for “ fag ” ” does n’t bother her in the least .
Hillary and her people will say anything to get elected .
And if that means gay - bashing to win the bubba vote , then so be it .
And her people wonder why so many have turned on Hillary in the past few months .
When buying a name from BrandDo
1 . You become the new owner of the domain name and it remains listed in your own registrar account with full control on it , as long as the yearly registration is maintained through the registrar .
2 . You get the logo and all graphics we designed for this brand name in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop format .
If you do n't want to use this logo design it 's up to you .
This will not affect the domain sales price .
An American hacker who is at the core of a piracy trial against a Rupert Murdoch subsidiary , testified this week that he created pirating software for the company but did not use it to sabotage the company 's rivals .
Earlier this week I laid out the case against NDS Group , a UK - Israeli firm and a majority - owned subsidiary of Murdoch 's News Corporation .
The company is accused of reverse - engineering access cards created by competitor NagraStar in order to provide pirates with counterfeit cards .
EchoStar 's Dish Net used the NagraStar cards , and the counterfeit cards allegedly allowed pirates to access Dish Network pay - TV content for free .
Christopher Tarnovsky , who acknowledged receiving cash payments of more than $ 20,000 concealed in CD and DVD players , said he regularly received payments from the HarperCollins publishing company for ten years .
HarperCollins is also owned by Murdoch 's News Corporation .
But he says he was paid to develop a pirating program to make DirecTV more secure , not to sabotage rival systems .
DirecTV used access cards made by NDS Group .
Its cards had been hacked and pirated since 1997 .
EchoStar and NagraStar contend that after NDS 's cards were cracked , the company reverse - engineered NagraStar 's card , then hired hackers and pirates to create cards that circumvented the access controls in EchoStar 's pay - TV system .
The company claims it lost $ 900 million as a result of the pirating .
NDS has acknowledged that it reverse - engineered NagraStar 's cards but denies it released any information or cards to pirates .
Tarnovsky acknowledged in his testimony that he created a " stinger " program for NDS that could communicate with any smartcard but said it was not used to reprogram NagraStar 's cards .
According to allegations in the court documents , the stinger program was set up to program a set number of cards at a time .
Tarnovsky is accused of providing the program to distributors who would create a specified number of cards , but then would have to come back to Tarnovsky to have him make adjustments to allow it to produce more cards – presumably after the distributors paid him a percentage of the sales from the first batch of cards sold .
Tarnovsky maintains that he did nothing wrong and is being set up .
The trial is continuing in Santa Ana , California .

First published in the September 1990 issue of The Rothbard - Rockwell Report .
The libertarian movement was once a mighty movement , hardcore but not kooky , part of the mainstream of American ideological and political life .
In the 18th and 19th centuries ( for example , in the Jeffersonian and Jacksonian movements ) , libertarians were even the dominant political force in the country .
America was , indeed , conceived in liberty .
But right now , I 'm not going back that far : I 'm talking about the origins of the modern 20th century movement .
For various reasons , the Progressive movement had wiped out 19th century intellectual and political libertarianism , and , by the 1920s , it was reduced to a few vibrant but lone intellectuals such as H.L. Mencken and his friend , Albert Jay Nock .
But then something happened to shock libertarianism back to life  the cataclysmic Great Leap Forward into collectivism hailed as the New Deal .
It 's a process of historical reaction : a sudden social change will often give rise to a fierce opposition .
Opposition to the New Deal was , necessarily , a coalition politics united on a negative : hatred of the socialism of the New Deal .
Increasingly gathering into that coalition were the few libertarian or individualist intellectuals , the heritage and the remnants of the old Jeffersonian Democracy left from the days of Grover Cleveland  men such as Senator James A. Reed of Missouri and Governor Albert Ritchie of Maryland , and Republicans , including formerly stalwart statists and Progressives such as Herbert Hoover , who condemned FDR for going much too far .
As the New Deal intensified and was championed by the Democrats , the opposition inevitably coalesced around the Republican Party .
It was a strange transformation , since , from its inception in the 1850s , the Republican Party had always been the party of statism and centralized Big Government .
Well , life is strange some times , and this shift was no stranger than what had happened to the Democrats , during the 19th century the party of minimal government and laissez - faire .
When Roosevelt dragged America into World War II , the growing opposition , which I have called the " Old Right , " shifted its moorings and changed some of its alliances .
Some economic free - marketeers , such as Lewis W. Douglas , became ardent pro-war New Dealers ; while former progressives , mainly Republican , who opposed the war , began to see the deep connection between interventionism and Big Government in domestic as well as foreign policy .
As a result , by the end of World War II , the Old Right , largely Republican but still including Jeffersonian Democrats ( such as Rep. Samuel Pettingill of Indiana ) , was consistently libertarian , opposing statism at home and war and intervention abroad .
The Old Right was a strong and vibrant movement , dominant in the Republican Party in Congress ( especially in the House of Representatives ) and constituting roughly the Taft wing of the party .
The Old Right was firmly opposed to conscription as well as war or foreign aid , favored free markets and the gold standard , and upheld the rights of private property as opposed to any sort of invasion , including coerced integration .
The Old Right was socially conservative , middle class , welcoming people who worked for a living or met a payroll , and was the salt of the earth .
What the Old Right lacked was not a political mass , but rather an intellectual cadre , and the small but increasing number of hard - core libertarians influenced by Mises and Rand and Nock after World War II provided a growing intellectual foundation for that movement .
What we have to realize , and we almost have to shake ourselves to believe , is that hard - core libertarians were not considered kooks and crazies ; we were treated only as extreme variants of a creed that almost everyone on the Old Right believed : peace , individual liberty , free markets , private property , even the gold standard .
And since we were simply consistent upholders of a creed which the entire Old Right believed , we were able , though small in number , to influence and permeate the views of the broad mass of Old Right Americans .
It was a happy symbiosis .
That 's why , politically , all libertarians , whether minarchists or anarcho - capitalists , were happy to consider ourselves " extreme right - wing Republicans . "
[ The general term for the broader movement was " individualist " or " true liberal " or " rightist "  the word " conservative " was not at all in use before the publication of Russell Kirk 's Conservative Mind in 1953 ] .
It was a great time for a libertarian to be politically active .
Neither did the Old Right collapse with the onset of the Cold War .
On the contrary , the Old Right reached a peak in its last days : for it was virtually the only opposition to the Korean War .
[ Only the Communist Party and I.F. Stone opposed U.S. entry into the Korean War ; the entire rest of the Left , including Henry Wallace , supported it in the name of the old interventionist slogan : " collective security against aggression . " ]
Major opponents of the Korean War were such libertarian and Old Right publicists as Garet Garrett and John T. Flynn , F.A. Harper and Leonard E. Read ; influential newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune ; and major political opponents such as Senators Bridges and Wherry and the libertarian Congressman Howard H. Buffett of Omaha .
It was after the Korean War that the Old Right collapsed .
The catalyst was the literal theft of the Republican presidential nomination in 1952 from Senator Taft by the Wall Street elite behind Eisenhower ; the deaths of Taft and Colonel McCormick , owner of the Chicago Tribune ; and the capture of the political reins of the Republican Party by the " conservative " New Dealers constituting the Eisenhower movement .
Whereas the right - wing Republicans aimed to repeal and abolish the New Deal , the Eisenhower forces aimed at consolidating the New Deal and fastening it permanently upon American life , and in this they succeeded all too well .
But probably the most important reason for the collapse of the Old Right was not external blows , but the loss of its own soul and principles .
As the older intellectual and political leaders died or retired , a powerful new force arose in 1955 to fill that vacuum .
This new force  people grouped around National Review  set out to transform the nature of the American Right , and they succeeded brilliantly .
Headed by a brace of shrewd ex-Communists , steeped in Marxist - Leninist cadre organizing tactics , allied to youthful Eastern seaboard Catholics , the New Right determined to crush isolationism , and to remold the right - wing into a crusade to crush Communism all over the world , and particularly in the Soviet Union .
At first , NR had a patina of individualism , in order to capture the considerable amount of Old Right libertarian sentiment and wed it to a policy of global war .
The Buckley machine founded Young Americans for Freedom as its youthful political arm .
The Intercollegiate Society of Individualists for libertarian - minded student intellectuals , and headed by NR publisher Bill Rusher , moved to capture the College Young Republicans , then the YRs nationally , and finally moved to dominate the Republican Party with the Goldwater movement .
Early in this process , moreover , National Review , in the late 1950s and early 1960s , moved quickly to read out of the New Right , or " conservative " movement , all " extremists " who would prove an embarrassment in its march to power .
And so , in a series of purges , the Birch Society , the Randians , and the libertarians ( those who remained isolationists ) were ousted from the right wing .
NR and the New Right were ready to achieve power , which they eventually would attain with the Reagan administration .
But the point is that the ideological transformation  into a warmongering and vaguely theocratic movement  was achieved by the early 1960s .
The Old Right was dead , and those libertarians who still remembered and cleaved to their principles , were out in the cold .
Murray N. Rothbard ( 19261995 ) was the author of Man , Economy , and State , Conceived in Liberty , What Has Government Done to Our Money , For a New Liberty , The Case Against the Fed , and many other books and articles .
He was also the editor  with Lew Rockwell  of The Rothbard - Rockwell Report .

The Best of Murray N. Rothbard
From Equality - Based Restrictions on Campaign Advertising to Equality - Based Restrictions on Other Kinds of Speech ?
1 . One problem with the " equalization " argument for campaign finance restrictions — especially those applied to independent spending by individuals or organizations — is that their logic reaches considerably beyond campaigns .
If fairness concerns justify barring expensive speech aimed at backing or defeating a candidate or ballot measure , why not speech aimed at supporting or opposing broader ideological views ( whether abortion rights , gun rights , health care reform , or whatever else ) ?
After all , changes in public attitudes about issues may quickly affect candidates and ballot measures .
More broadly , if broader " constitutional values , " such as democratic self - government , justify restraining the spending of some to " level the playing field , " one would think that these values would have the same effect in all aspects of democratic self - government — and First Amendment law has of course recognized that rights of " democratic self - government " extend to opinion formation generally and not just to election campaigns .
We see the same when we look at some of the rhetoric of those who would support broad campaign finance speech restrictions .
For instance , Justice Stevens justifies his position in favor upholding such restrictions on the grounds that " money is property ; it is not speech , " and
Speech has the power to inspire volunteers to perform a multitude of tasks on a campaign trail , on a battleground , or even on a football field .
Money , meanwhile , has the power to pay hired laborers to perform the same tasks .
It does not follow , however , that the First Amendment provides the same measure of protection to the use of money to accomplish such goals as it provides to the use of ideas to achieve the same results .
Exactly the same argument would apply to political debate generally , and not just election campaigns .
( Justice Stevens does try to limit his argument by suggesting that spending might be protected by broader property rights " unrelated to the First Amendment , " and by suggesting that his argument would n't apply when " the prohibition entirely forecloses a channel of communication " ; yet constitutional property rights , especially outside the right to compensation for physical takings , are notoriously weak compared to the First Amendment , and many restrictions could dramatically affect public debate without entirely foreclosing some medium . )
Arguments focused on the risk of corrupting politicians through implicit quid pro quo would not apply quite as sharply , but Justice Stevens is obviously going beyond that .
Likewise , Justice Breyer 's and Ginsburg 's argument for " balanc[ing ] interests " where " constitutionally protected interests lie on both sides of the legal equation " — which Justice Breyer applies to election campaign speech — would apply to pre-campaign speech about public issues as well .
If " by limiting the size of the largest contributions , [ campaign - related ] restrictions aim to democratize the influence that money itself may bring to bear upon the electoral process , " then by limiting expensive speech on broader public issues , these broader restrictions would aim to democratize the influence that money itself may bring to bear upon the opinion - forming process , and thus indirectly the electoral process .
( More on this here . )
And of course many of the past and present arguments in favor of the Fairness Doctrine have explicitly urged equality and fairness as justification in favor of coercive regulations related to public debate broadly ( regulations that imposed expensive obligations on stations that carried controversial speech , in order to ensure supposedly fair treatment for rival speech ) .
2 . The reason I mention all this now is I just read a remarkable implementation of this very sort of broad speech - restrictive approach , in last month 's House of Lords Decision in R v. Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport .
English law , it turns out , bans all paid " religious or political " advertising on television and radio — and the House of Lords upheld this ban , precisely on the sorts of equality grounds I described above .
And this ban is not at all limited to political campaigns ; the loser in the court decision was a pro-animal - rights group that wanted to run a " My Mate 's a Primate " campaign aimed at " directing public attention towards the use of primates by humans and the threat presented by such use to the survival of primates . "
( I take it " mate " was used in the British / Commonwealth sense of " friend . " )
What was the rationale ?
The same sort of equality argument that we see commonly made about election - related speech in America :
[ I]t is highly desirable that the playing field of debate should be so far as practicable level .
This is achieved where , in public discussion , differing views are expressed , contradicted , answered and debated ....
It is not achieved if political parties can , in proportion to their resources , buy unlimited opportunities to advertise in the most effective media , so that elections become little more than an auction .
Nor is it achieved if well - endowed interests which are not political parties are able to use the power of the purse to give enhanced prominence to views which may be true or false , attractive to progressive minds or unattractive , beneficial or injurious .
The risk is that objects which are essentially political may come to be accepted by the public not because they are shown in public debate to be right but because , by dint of constant repetition , the public has been conditioned to accept them .
The rights of others which a restriction on the exercise of the right to free expression may properly be designed to protect must , in my judgment , include a right to be protected against the potential mischief of partial political advertising .
Now of course the court assures us that there are still " other media ... open to the appellant : newspapers and magazines , direct mailshots , billboards , public meetings and marches . "
But the court also says ( as a justification for the selective ban on radio and television advertising ) that " there is a pressing social need for a blanket prohibition of political advertising on television and radio " because of " the greater immediacy and impact of television and radio advertising . "
So people are free to use other media , but precisely because those media are less effective .
Likewise , the court assures us that " It is the duty of broadcasters to achieve [ the ] object [ of providing for expression of differing views ] by presenting balanced programmes in which all lawful views may be ventilated . "
But that of course just means that public debate is within the power of the media elites that run broadcasters , and that run the government agencies that can pressure broadcasters .
Outsider organizations are locked out , unable to broadcast their views the way they choose to express them .
Interestingly , the House of Lords here departs from a 2001 European Court of Human Rights decision that held that bans on political broadcast advertising were indeed unconstitutional .
3 . Moreover , one of the judges specifically tied the argument to her rejection of the American free speech model , as exemplified in Buckley v. Valeo :
There was an elephant in the committee room , always there but never mentioned , when we heard this case .
It was the dominance of advertising , not only in elections but also in the formation of political opinion , in the United States of America .
Enormous sums are spent , and therefore have to be raised , at election times : it is estimated that the disputed 2000 elections for President and Congress cost as much as US $ 3 billion .
Attempts to regulate campaign spending are struck down in the name of the First Amendment : “ Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press " : see particularly Buckley v [ Valeo ] , 424 US 1 ( 1976 ) .
A fortiori there is no limit to the amount that pressure groups can spend on getting their message across in the most powerful and pervasive media available .
In the United Kingdom , and elsewhere in Europe , we do not want our government or its policies to be decided by the highest spenders .
Our democracy is based upon more than one person one vote .
It is based on the view that each person has equal value .
“ Within the sphere of democratic politics , we confront each other as moral equals ” ( Ackerman and Ayres , Voting with Dollars , 2003 , p 12 ) .
We want everyone to be able to make up their own minds on the important issues of the day .
For this we need the free exchange of information and ideas .
We have to accept that some people have greater resources than others with which to put their views across .
But we want to avoid the grosser distortions which unrestricted access to the broadcast media will bring .
So this case is not just about permissible restrictions on freedom of expression .
It is about striking the right balance between the two most important components of a democracy : freedom of expression and voter equality ....
So the English judge — and I expect her colleagues as well — saw the connection between the equality rationale for restricting expensive campaign - related speech and the equality rationale for restricting expensive speech more broadly .
She flatly rejected Buckley 's approach to campaign - related speech .
( " There are aspects of the ban on broadcasting political advertisements which no - one disputes : in particular , advertising by candidates for election , or by political parties , whether or not at election times . " )
And she went from there to rejecting free speech protection for payments for issue - oriented speech more broadly .
So if you 're skeptical that the progression I outlined in item 1 would indeed take place in America , keep in mind what has happened in England .
Robert H Brooks was in little doubt over the secret behind the success of his global chain of Hooters restaurants : " Beautiful women , cold beer and food that will never go out of fashion . "
It was a business strategy that was to pay handsome dividends for the introverted Christian family man who built a $ 1 bn - a - year empire of 435 eateries across 23 countries and 46 US states .
When they laid the 69 - year - old driving force behind the " Breastarant " to rest just two years ago at the Trinity Episcopal Church close to his home in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , more than 1,000 mourners paid their respects .
Those who could n't cram into the white chapel building watched the ceremony on television from the air - conditioned comfort of an overspill room while a shuttle service ferried friends , family and admirers from the local car park .
Among those joining the congregation was the local mayor and a former senator who listened amid the gentle sound of sobs as the late entrepreneur 's eldest son , Coby , bid his father an emotional farewell .
" Godspeed , Sir , I love you , " he said , his voice cracking with emotion .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Such lachrymose tributes must have proved hard to swallow for Brooks ' detractors of whom there are many thousands worldwide .
Nearly everywhere that the Hooters brand has reared its head there have been rumblings of discontent from opponents furious over the role of the company 's famously nubile waiting staff .
These protests are now echoing in the corridors of power in Britain where Hooters is engaged in an aggressive roll - out , planning to add a further 41 sites to its single outlet which has been serving chicken wings and beer in Nottingham for the best part of the last decade .
Five are to open their doors this year , in London , Manchester , Sheffield , Newcastle and Bristol .
Further outlets from Aberdeen to Plymouth will be up and running by 2012 , says the company charged with masterminding the UK expansion , Wings Over England Ltd .
The argument is raging most vociferously in Scotland where Cathy Jamieson , deputy leader of the Scottish Labour Party , has led the opposition , criticising the scantily clad waitresses upon which Brooks built his fortune as a " degrading spectacle " .
She said : " Scotland does not want these so - called restaurants coming to our cities .
Violence against women is a big problem in Scotland and these types of establishments do nothing to promote equality of women in the workplace . "
At Southend - on - Sea , Essex , a postgraduate student , Sophia Deboick , has orchestrated a well - publicised campaign to persuade the local council to reject plans for a restaurant in the seaside town .
" The uniforms the girls are made to wear are extremely brief and they have bikini competitions where waitresses parade around in string bikinis , " she said .
" It is similar to a strip club , and it is exploitative . "
The radical feminist vegetarian academic Carol J Adams has combined both her pet themes to savage the chain in her controversial book The Sexual Politics of Meat .
Describing what it is that appeals to men about tucking in to a plate of grilled poultry parts served up by attractive young waitress , she concluded : " It is a way that men can bond publicly around misogyny whether they know it or not .
It makes the degradation of women appear playful and harmless : ' just ' a joke ...
Thus everyone can enjoy the degradation of women without being honest . "
Not everybody sees it that way .
Scotland has had a smattering of " Hands Off Our Hooters " headlines , and in Southend and Sheffield online petitions have sprung up with more than 160 signatures demanding that Hooters gets the go - ahead .
One anonymous contributor wrote : " If they want to have fun , let them .
No hairy , screaming , humourless harridan should be allowed to dictate how people have fun .
It 's a restaurant , with hooters , that 's all .
It 's not like Sodom and Gomorrah is being re-enacted ! "
So is Hooters really that bad ?
For those seeking culinary excellence , Brooks ' perennially fashionable menu of buffalo wings , chilli dogs and shrimp platter is unlikely to win its kitchen assemblers a Michelin star any time soon .
And even at the Beijing branch which opened last September , the fourth in China , no one really believes the word " Hooters " really relates to the company 's owl logo , which compulsorily adorns the chests of the 17,000 staff around the globe .
Hooters has been on the receiving end of a bevy of discrimination lawsuits by men challenging its female - only front - of - house policy .
But the company is having none of it , citing the findings of the District Court of North Illinois which upheld its " gender eligibility requirements " .
Furthermore , it insists that : " Hooters Girls have the same right to use their natural sex appeal to earn a living as do supermodels Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell . "
Yet a glance through the company 's exhaustive dress code reveals a surprisingly demure , if not old - fashioned , admittedly sexist , view of the world .
To capture the " All - American cheerleader , surfer , girl next door look " staff are warned ( in block capitals ) that the regulation Hooters - issue tangerine orange shorts must " NOT BE SO TIGHT THAT THE BUTTOCKS SHOW " .
There is a no visible midriff rule , a straight ban on body piercings ( especially tongues ) , no tattoos while unintentional flashes of bra strap are also strictly forbidden .
Tight tops , good make - up , clean hair and flesh - coloured pantyhose are , by contrast , de-rigeur , as is the obligation to " SMILE !!! "
Perhaps most controversially , staff are required to sign up to the " entertainment through female sex appeal " philosophy by putting their name to an extraordinary disclaimer accepting , " I do not find my job duties , uniform requirements or work environment to be offensive , intimidating , hostile or unwelcome " , which critics claim is a clear abrogation of their rights .
Hooters burst into life in 1983 in Clearwater , Florida , site of a series of failed business ventures .
Though it writes its own colourful history on its website , something about a group of " semi-intellectual " businessmen who felt the overpowering urge for the smell of " roughsawn lumber " and the " taste of buffalo - style chicken wings " the truth is more prosaic .
True , it was started by a group of six " drinking buddies " with no catering experience and a penchant for the Floridian good life .
Furthermore , this pioneering group was richly rewarded for the idea , holding on to the original 22 restaurants in the company 's core areas of Tampa Bay , Manhattan and Chicago , until last year when they eventually sold out to Hooters of America Inc for a cool $ 55.1 m .
But it was Brooks ' decision in 1984 to team up with a group of fellow investors to buy the rights to the Hooters concept that was to turn the restaurant into a global brand .
The entrepreneur had already gained a foothold in the food business after patenting a milkshake formula adopted by fast - food giant Burger King .
In the 1960s , he built a fortune selling non-dairy creamer to US airlines and created a range of dressings and sauces under the Naturally Fresh Foods brand adding various other businesses along the way , including a country club , speedway tracks and an Atlanta - based land development company .
The man who later became known as the World Wide Wing Commander and his successor , worked hard to extract extra value from the brand , offering everything from Hooters baby bibs to customised credit cards for its loyal customers .
There is a Hooters video game , calendar and annual beauty pageant .
More audacious still was the construction of the Hooters Casino Hotel , opposite the MGM Grand just off the Strip in Las Vegas .
Less successful was Hooters Air , the Myrtle Beach - based airline which brought the company 's unique brand of in - flight entertainment to America 's huge golf travel market .
Services were suspended in 2006 .
Mindful of the growing backlash , Hooters has run aggressive public relations campaigns in recent years , setting up its own charitable fund HooCef as well as donating money to a range of charities and dispatching its best - known calendar girls to cheer up United States troops overseas .
But all this seems unlikely to appease those lining up to oppose the roll - out of Hooters in Britain .
Critics say that communities have sat back for too long and allowed the sex industry to colonise the high streets of our towns and cities , and they say , Hooters is little more than a glorified strip joint with bad food .
As the chain prepares to mark its 25th anniversary this year , it seems certain that some British critics will try to spoil the party .
According to The Daily Telegraph ,
( A bit of theatrical licence can be granted : Britain 's broadband usage has not in fact changed beyond recognition , but perhaps the expectations of broadband users have . )
A diverse number of players , from Channel 4 to MSN to Virgin Broadband have gone on record to say that this is a good thing : all on - demand TV boats are rising on the BBC iPlayer tide .
But many commentators have pointed out that some Internet Service Providers who offer " unlimited broadband " can start to charge their customers extra after only a few TV programmes have been accessed .
What 's to be done ?
The Telegraph suggested that users stream content rather than download to save money .
We do n't think this makes any difference .
As an aside , the BBC iPlayer service offers both streaming and downloading , and will continue to do so .
Most programmes have a ratio of around eight streams for every download , but high - end drama , such as The Passion had over a quarter of its iPlayer consumption via the P2P download service .
To reiterate , the BBC iPlayer is not , as the Telegraph keeps saying , exclusively a peer - to - peer download service .
So , if streaming rather than downloading is not the answer for users to reduce their chances of exceeding their monthly cap and ending up with an additional bill , what is ?
How about a Broadband Charter ?
Here are nineteen potential actions that could help bring clarity to this issue , enable audiences to know what they 're paying for , and help ISPs move the broadband market forward ( in no particular order ) :
Internet Service Providers :
1. ISPs should be clearer in their marketing ( Ofcom can help them ) .
Unlimited broadband should mean unlimited .
2 . There should be industry agreement on what you buy is what you get : for a start , an 8 M bs - 1 tariff should deliver " at least " 8 M bs - 1 , not " up to " .
( I recognise the difficulties with the quality of the line and contention ratios etc. , but this issue needs tackling ) .
3. ISPs which offer genuinely unlimited broadband - i.e. , without a cap ( or with very high caps ) - should ( and probably will ) more aggressively use this fact as a key point in their marketing .
4 . I would not suggest that ISPs start to try and charge content providers .
They are already charging their customers for broadband to receive any content they want .
If ISPs start charging content providers , the customer will not know which content will work well over their chosen ISP , and which content may have been throttled for non-payment of a levy .
5 . There could be an industry standard for " high definition broadband " .
HD Broadband ( working title ) would be a minimum guaranteed speed of connection ( probably 8 Mbs - 1 ) .
All ISPs could market the service ( like Sky HD and Virgin HD ) and drive up revenue per sub .
If this happened , then ...
Content Providers :
6 . All content providers could create packages or tiers of HD content optimised for this new standard tier of " HD Broadband " .
( It might need guaranteed quality of service - or , alternatively , this could just be a marketing initiative rather than a regulated service ) .
7. Content providers , if they find their content being specifically squeezed , shaped , or capped , could start to indicate on their sites which ISPs their content works best on ( and which to avoid ) .
I hope it does n't come to this , as I think we ( the BBC and the ISPs ) are currently working better together than ever .
8 . There are a number of functionality solutions which content providers can implement to lighten the load on the network which should help ISPs refrain from resorting to capping .
One of these is bookmarking , which would enable us to know what programmes a user wants , ahead of transmission , and download them off - peak to the user 's hard - drive pre-transmission ( hidden and encrypted ) , to be ready to be unlocked immediately after the programme has gone out on traditional linear TV .
We are applying to the BBC Trust to be able to offer this service for iPlayer downloads .
9 . The best technical solution is usually Moore 's Law , which has delivered massive reductions year on year in the wholesale cost of bandwidth and also reduced the bandwidth needed to consume a good quality full - screen TV picture ( ever improving video codecs and compression algorithms have helped enormously ) .
But BT
Wholesale 's prices are regulated by Ofcom , and not subject to Moore 's Law .
10 .
Although some have reported that we are exploring the costs / benefits of moving our content closer to our audience ( potentially reducing much duplicated traffic , basically by putting BBC servers into the network ) , it is far too early to say whether this solution will work , or is even an appropriate intervention for the BBC .
11 . We are already taking measures : we make it clear to users to check their ISP 's tariffing structure : BBC iPlayer has a warning in its Terms and Conditions before you install the download manager .
Further , a pop - up appears after 2GB of iPlayer programmes have been downloaded recommending that you check your ISP monthly cap .
12 . Finally , we can either reduce the amount of content we offer , or reduce the quality of the programmes ( by reducing bit - rate ) .
As a fixed revenue company , this would be our only recourse if we had to pay more for distribution .
This is not a desired outcome for anyone : my worry here is this could stop the rising spring tide of increasing supply , demand and consumption .
Users :
13 . Subscribers should ( and will ) increasingly look for genuinely unlimited deals from their ISPs , and for ISPs that do not throttle bandwidth at peak hours , which can have the effect of causing streaming playback to fail to work correctly .
14 . Users can set alerts on some ISPs to warn them when they have exceeded certain levels of monthly consumption .
15 . Users should not panic unless they are very heavy users .
Typical iPlayer usage ( one programme per week per user ) on a standard tariff on the UK 's largest ISP ( BT ) would utilise 20 % of their monthly allowance , and incur no additional charge .
16 . Users should let us , and the ISPs , know their thoughts ( hence this blog post ) .
Government and the Regulators :
17 .
You can't have a debate about this issue without reference to BT Wholesale ( with whom we actually have a very good relationship ) .
The ISPs which have their own network ( Virgin ) are busily rolling out 50 Mb /s broadband .
The rest have either installed their own equipment at BT switches ( local loop unbundled - LLU ) , or simply buy capacity wholesale off BT Wholesale ( e.g. Tiscali ) , and are , to a greater or lesser extent , beholden to the ( regulated but quite reasonably profit - making motivated ) BT Wholesale .
There are those who are starting to ask whether , as with the regulator led introduction of LLU that was necessary to kickstart broadband in the first place , there is another sizable intervention required again now .
18 . A less radical alternative to an intervention against BT Wholesale would be to encourage alternative forms of distribution .
Ofcom is actively looking at everything from Wifi and Wi-Max to sewers , and exploring what encouragement and relaxation of regulation would be required to accelerate these nascent markets .
19 .
The regulators will undoubtedly determine whether this whole issue is structural , or whether what we are witnessing is that the ISPs are fighting a commercial war on a public policy stage , and that this has nothing to do with content providers or the BBC at all ( indeed Ofcom , in their market impact assessment of iPlayer , believe that much of the increase in consumption over IP would happen anyway , with or without iPlayer ) .
I put down all these points to get the conversation going .
I 'm not advocating them ( except where I explicitly say so ) , but we are pulling together our thoughts here at the BBC , and liaising with the ISPs both individually and through the Broadband Stakeholders Group , and with the BBC Trust and Ofcom , so your thoughts on these points are , as ever , very welcome .

And you can also see what
by a PhD chemist on how laypeople can understand that the towers were demolished .
And you can also see what scientists structural engineers , and other professionals say about the destruction of the World Trade Center .
You might assume that the Twin Towers collapsed on 9/11 because of their design or because the fires were so hot or because of the damage from the hijacked planes .
You probably assume that someone who knows alot more than you -- a structural engineer , or a fire expert , or a tall building designer -- has an explanation of why the towers collapsed , and that it all makes perfect sense .
At the very least , you assume that you do n't have the expertise to even think about why the Twin Towers collapsed , right ?
Well , a contradiction in the way the towers collapsed shows that this is not so .
Specifically , there are two possibilities regarding the collapse of Twin Towers on September 11th : EITHER the towers experienced virtually no resistance from their steel - reinforced concrete floors as they collapsed , in which case , how could the buildings have been pulverized in mid-air into massive dust clouds ( see also this photo ) , and why how could heavy steel beams have shot out sideways up to 500 feet as the buildings collapsed OR -- if there was sufficient resistance from the floors of the buildings to have caused the dust clouds and sideways ejection of material -- how could the buildings have collapsed at virtually free - fall speeds Did I lose you ?
Okay , let 's back up and start over .
The mid-air pulverization of tons of concrete indicates massive and competing forces -- incredibly violent collisions between objects .
Concrete usually cracks when dropped or hit , it is not pulverized .
Either the pulverization was caused by some type of explosion , or by the heavy tops of the buildings hitting massive inertial resistance in the form of the lower floors , which were steel - reinforced concrete floors solidly bolted into the steel core Likewise , the sideways ejection of heavy steel beams indicates either explosive forces or , at the very least , tremendous resistance by the floors to the downward collapses , thus forcing heavy objects to shoot out sideways .
If the buildings collapsed from any causecontrolled demolition -- which violently blows out all supports of the buildings being demolished -- then there would have been a crumpling of the buildings .
In that case , there might have generated dust clouds near the end of the collapse , but not towards the very .
And , clearly , the collapse would not have approached free - fall speeds , since the intact floors would have put up alot of resistance against the momentum of the falling floors .
Bottom line :
There could not have been both beginning - of - collapse dust clouds ( indicating huge , violently - competing forces ) AND collapses at virtually free - fall speeds ( indicating only small , minor competition of forces and little resistance ) .
The towers collapsed as fast as a house of cards , and yet produceddust clouds from early on in the collapses .
The defenders of the official story of 9/11 can't have it both ways .
Instead , the towers had to have been brought down with explosives : •
The near free - fall speed is easily explained by the demolition of the towers ' support structures , which took away the resistance which should have slowed the collapse timeAnd •
The tremendous dust clouds seen early in the collapses can be explained by the massive explosions caused by pre-set demolition charges which pulverized concrete and shot it out of the towers .

Surveillance powers designed to track terrorists are being deployed by councils to crack down on littering , dog fouling and planning law breaches , a survey reveals .
Its findings expose the vast scale of Big Brother spying by town halls and brought urgent demands for “ root and branch ” reforms to curb the fast - growing snooping culture .
Some councils have used the sweeping powers granted by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( Ripa ) more than 100 times in the last year to follow and watch residents or monitor their calls – often while dealing with the most minor of suspected offences .
Their activities emerged weeks after the Daily Mail revealed Poole council in Dorset had spied on a family because it wrongly suspected the parents of abusing rules on school catchment areas .

In the Chinese city of Yanji , just a few kilometres from the North Korean border , one of the most risky journalistic endeavours ever undertaken is taking shape .
A North Korean citizen is being trained in the techniques of using a hidden camera .
His identity is a closely guarded secret , so he chooses to use the name Lee Jun .
Mr Lee is one of a group of citizen journalists that has begun working inside North Korea , producing written reports and video footage which are then smuggled to the outside world .
He has crossed the border on numerous occasions , bringing hours of material showing everyday life in the street , on trains , even in police stations .
His images , caught on a camera concealed inside his bag , give a rarely seen glimpse of one of the world 's most closed societies .
We can compare reports to make sure we are as factually correct as possible to really reflect the authentic North Korea
Choi Jin I Much of North Korean life is here - thriving black markets doing a brisk trade , bustling street - side restaurants , and stalls with a remarkable variety of fruit and fish .
But there are signs of poverty and hunger too - barefoot children wandering in puddle - filled streets , ragged boys scrounging for food , a family collecting plastic bottles on waste ground .
And glimpses of control - in one scene an official clears the street of women hawkers operating without permission .
During one of Mr Lee 's recent trips across the border to China he recorded a short interview with Asia Press , the Japan - based journalists ' organisation co-ordinating the project .
" I just want to show the natural lives of the people , " he says .
" I may be just one individual , but if I can become a spark I can achieve my goal .
" Some people in North Korea may say I 'm a traitor , but I 'm confident in what I 'm doing , standing alone for democracy . "
Threat of prison
The risks being taken by Lee Jun and his nine fellow citizen journalists are huge .
There are reports that North Korea executed a state official last year for making phone calls abroad without government permission .
The state runs and ruthlessly controls all forms of media - television news bulletins begin with assembled military ranks singing a tribute to the leader Kim Jong - il .
Being caught producing independent journalism and sending it abroad would at the very least mean a spell in prison .
Their work eventually ends up in a small apartment in the South Korean capital Seoul where the articles are edited by Choi Jin I , a North Korean defector .
Single frame images are selected from the video footage and the material is published in a magazine , Rimjingang , published every two months .
" We sometimes ask our reporters to look at similar subjects , " Mrs Choi tells me .
" Then we can compare reports to make sure we are as factually correct as possible to really reflect the authentic North Korea . "
Tiny step
The first edition contains an apology from one of the reporters active in the North Korean border area .
" We admit that our writings will be clumsy and our pictures will not be beautiful , " says Ryu Kyung Won , also using an alias .
The magazine will be published in both Japanese and English " This is attributed to the fact that we are common people who did not have the opportunities to engage in professional training . "
But it is a brave effort nonetheless .
The reporting has included the recounting of a conversation with a North Korean soldier who predicts that his country 's army will collapse .
For decades South Koreans have had little or no information about life on the other side of the border .
This is their first chance to read genuine testimony from independent journalists working inside North Korea .
In the coming weeks the plan is to produce regular editions in both English and Japanese so that the information , gathered at enormous personal risk , can reach a wider audience .
The secretive , communist state remains cloaked in censorship .
It may be a tiny step , but for once , North Koreans are telling their own story .

Schwarzenegger calls for ' rebranding ' GOP Schwarzenegger leads party 's call for McCain to rebrand

California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger created shock and awe in the Republican Party when he warned years ago that the GOP was in danger of " dying at the box office " by failing to make the sale to a wide swath of voters .
And with the presidential election looming , the Republican governor of the nation 's most populous state - a decidedly blue state - has now found a chorus of agreement .
The Republican " brand " - thanks to an unpopular president , a war , gas prices , foreclosures and deficit - has become such damaged goods that GOP Rep .
Tom Davis of Virginia groused last week that " if we were dog food , they would take us off the shelf . "
The answer for GOP presidential candidate John McCain : take a page out of the Schwarzenegger playbook and sell a product that is " counter " to the current GOP brand on issues like global warming , spending and even immigration reform .
McCain comes to the Golden State this week on a campaign and fundraising swing , including a rally Thursday in Stockton being publicized with an invitation graced by a picture of a McCain hug - not with President Bush but with Schwarzenegger .
And the governor , in an interview with The Chronicle last week , had some candid advice and observations , not only about the GOP brand - but on McCain 's efforts to expand his appeal to independents and disillusioned Democrats .
" The Republican idea is a great idea , but we can't go and get stuck with just the right wing , " Schwarzenegger said .
" Let 's let the party come all the way to the center .
Let those people be heard as much as the right .
Let it be the big tent we 've talked about .
" Let 's invade and let 's cross over that ( political ) center , " he said .
" The issues that they 're talking about ?
Let them be our issues , and let the party be known for that . "
' It did n't work '
He observed that his own political opponents , including former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis , tried to define him in much the way McCain is being defined by Democrats - as joined at the hip with Bush .
" It did n't work , " he laughed .
But " how does ( McCain ) beat the Democrats ?
By offering a better future .
He needs to offer hope , he needs to go in and show he can solve the problem in Iraq and have better relations with other countries again ... and bring the economy back . "
As Democrats get closer to picking their party 's nominee , McCain is getting advice on his image " rebranding " from some of the same GOP insiders who helped Schwarzenegger win re-election .
They include senior campaign adviser Steve Schmidt and former Schwarzenegger communications director Adam Mendelsohn , partners in a GOP political consulting firm , Mercury LLC in Sacramento .
" The Republican brand may be in a bad position because of the Bush presidency , but people recognize that John McCain is not George Bush .
... John McCain has a long track record of being a nontraditional Republican - and so does Schwarzenegger , " said Mendelsohn .
That makes the Arizona senator well - positioned to build a coalition of voters that can cut into the appeal of the Democratic presidential nominee , who increasingly looks to be Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , he said .
With less than six months until the November election , McCain is n't alone in trying to repackage the GOP 's image and outreach ; indeed , rebranding fever appears to have caught on across the party .
It explains why , in the wake of losing a solid Republican seat in Mississippi in a special election last week , Republican leader Rep. John Boehner of Ohio sent out a memo outlining what he called a " new positive agenda " for the GOP - titled " The Change America Deserves . "
Political observers watching the rebranding effort say it represents a drive to compete with Obama - whose motto is " the change we can believe in " - as he seeks independent and Latino voters who could make or break the 2008 election .
" They do n't have any choice , " Averell " Ace " Smith , who managed campaigns for Hillary Rodham Clinton in California , Texas and North Carolina , said of McCain 's efforts to be a " counter " Republican .
" If they ran any other race , they 'd doom themselves from the first day .
Voters up for grabs
" ( Republicans ) have to move away from the status quo , because the voters up for grabs are independents and Latinos .
And neither of them are particularly in love with ideologists .
They both move toward moderation . "
On the campaign trail last week , McCain 's efforts to position himself as counter to the Republican brand were keenly evident .
He spoke in Portland on what 's been described as the first leg of his global warming tour ; later in the week , he delivered a landmark speech , drawing some distinct contrasts to the Bush White House - whose disapproval ratings are now a whopping 71 percent - politically as well as stylistically .
On the policy front , McCain said that by 2013 , the end of his first term , he envisions most U.S. troops coming home from Iraq " in victory , " as well as delivering health care and restoring " economic confidence . "
And , acknowledging a White House criticized as too partisan and insular , McCain said that as president he 'll ask Democrats to serve in his administration and vowed to " set a new standard for transparency and accountability .
...
When we make errors , I 'll confess them willingly . "
He vowed to institute regular presidential question - and - answer grillings before Congress , much like the British prime minister 's weekly televised " Question Time . "
Democrats immediately jabbed away .
" Why should McCain stop there when he could go the whole nine yards - by letting our Democratic majority in the House pick the president , just like the parliamentary system picks a prime minister ? " quipped Kirsten Xanthippe , a California Democratic activist living in the United Kingdom .
" McCain is n't the real McCoy - he 's just a ' prime mimicker ' of conservative Bush policies , dressed up in the touchy - feely softness of sheep 's clothing , " she said .
Schwarzenegger disagreed .
" It was wise for him to do what he did this week , " the governor said .
" That 's an attempt to show what his vision is .
... People need to see that there 's a plan .
He 's in the center in a lot of ways , and that will help him - especially in states like California . "
' Republican brand is terrible '
Some Republicans agreed that McCain 's work is required in an election year where challenges loom for the GOP .
" The Republican brand is terrible right now , " said Bill Whalen , a research fellow at Stanford University 's Hoover Institution .
" It 's been damaged by a weak presidency ... and the various legs on which the Republican platform rests have been kicked away . "
Among them , Whalen said , has been fiscal discipline - crumbling along with the $ 1 trillion - plus deficit - and family values , a victim of corruption and scandals involving a cast of characters from lobbyist Jack Abramoff to jailed former San Diego Rep.
Randy " Duke " Cunningham .
" McCain runs at a time when the party itself is ill - defined , and that means McCain has to turn the election on personality - and that ties into being a political maverick , " Whalen said .
" You 'll see McCain saying , ' My opponent talks about change - but I not only talk the talk , I walk the walk . ' "
Party 's core principles
California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner - the only Republican besides Schwarzenegger elected to statewide office - said his party 's image has been battered because GOP officials have forgotten the party 's core principles : lower taxes , less government .
" Spending has skyrocketed .
...
There 's been this real crisis in earmarks , which are not justified , and there 's been corruption because of ethics violations , " he said .
" Republican Party leaders have done a terrible job and let the country down . "
But Poizner , speaking from Jerusalem where he accompanied Bush to celebrate Israel 's 60th birthday , said GOP leaders like himself , Schwarzenegger and McCain have proven it 's possible to stick to Republican principles and win elections , even when polls show the GOP to be the underdog .
" Swing voters are looking for people who have the ability to get things done in both the private sector and public sector , " said Poizner , who is considering a 2010 run for governor of California .
" We can win elections if we get back to the basics - and that 's something that Sen. McCain can do . "

Okay , so something has finally tipped the scales of your judgment in favor of acquiring your first handgun .
Maybe you know someone who was just victimized by a criminal .
Maybe you have a new family and feel the urge to make yourself ready to protect them .
Whatever the reason , you have decided to buy a handgun .
Here ’s how to do it .
Legality
For most United States citizens , purchasing a handgun is as simple as going to your local gun store , choosing a particular gun to buy , showing photo I.D. , filling out the background check form , and then paying for the gun upon approval from NICS ( usually instantaneous , but may take as long as three days ) .
There are a few states where this procedure is more cumbersome due to some requirement imposed by statute .
To check your state ’s particular rules , simply ask a local gun dealer or refer to Handgunlaw.us .
Each state ’s rules vary , so I wo n’t cover them here , but some states restrict not only who may purchase and possess a handgun , but what particular models are permitted for such possession within that state .
Restrictions may apply to so - called “ assault pistols , ” those that are capable of accepting high - capacity magazines ( usually 10 + ) , or those that the state may classify as “ Saturday Night Specials . ”
Possible Applications
The first , most obvious question that you must ask yourself is “ What role (s ) do I expect this gun to fill ? ”
The possible answers include competition or target shooting , hunting , home defense , and self - defense outside of the home .
Competition or Target Shooting
I can neatly avoid providing any useful information on this point because anyone who plans to spend cash on a “ race gun ” or high - performance target handgun is likely already familiar enough with weapons to have no need for my advice .
It suffices to say that there are handguns designed for fast presentation , sight acquisition , and follow - up shooting that are advantageous for competition use , but not practical or economical for defensive uses .
Likewise , there are target handguns that are designed for precise shot placement that may be too bulky , of insufficient caliber , or otherwise unsuited for defensive applications .
Hunting
Hunting handguns may be used to take a number of different varieties of game , from squirrel to deer to wild boar to bear .
Regardless of the quarry , a hunting handgun is almost always a bulky sort of implement , either because the gun is chambered in a large caliber that requires a heavy frame and barrel , because optics are mounted , or both .
The most common hunting handgun type is the large - caliber revolver .
Many states permit deer hunters to hunt with pistols and revolvers above a certain caliber , usually .40 .
The .44 Magnum cartridge is well known for its ability to take down even large , dangerous game like bear , and it may be found employed by all manner of medium and large game hunters .
Revolvers in a large caliber like the .44 Magnum are undeniably intimidating and effective enough for use in home defense , but are too bulky for most personal defense applications where discreet possession of the handgun is preferred .
Single - shot handguns utilizing either a break - action or bolt - action occupy a small but growing niche within handguns designed for hunting use .
Predominantly manufactured by companies like Remington , Savage , and Thompson - Center , these guns are extremely specialized and are designed for one thing : to accurately fire a rifle bullet out of a package much smaller than the average rifle .
The recoil is often tremendous , the time for a second shot is long , and the speed for target acquisition is as slow as it would be with any scoped weapon .
These specialized firearms may be used for hunting or for long - range target shooting , but they have little application outside of these areas .
Home Defense
For many users , a handgun is the best weapon for home defense .
The handgun is more easily wielded than a shotgun by individuals with a slight build , and the shorter length of a handgun allows greater maneuverability in close quarters than a shortened pistol - grip shotgun .
In considering a handgun for home defense , there are several questions that you should ask yourself before proceeding :
1 ) Does the gun fit in my hand comfortably ?
Is it comfortable for the largest and smallest potential shooter ?
In a life or death situation , confidence is a necessary component of a potentially life - saving action .
Having good positive control of the gun in your hands is essential to confidently wielding it against an attacker .
Additionally , you must be able to hang on to a gun in order to fire it safely and accurately .
2 ) Does the cartridge caliber / load make the handgun ’s recoil too severe for the people most likely to need to use the gun in defense ?
Recoil that is so strong as to be uncomfortable can make a shooter anxious and tends to dissuade the shooter from practicing regularly .
Both of these may mean that the handgun is less useful when a situation requiring decisive action arises .
As physics dictate , a cartridge generally generates more felt recoil as the mass it has to displace decreases .
Therefore , larger , heavier guns will typically have less recoil than smaller guns chambered in the same cartridge .
In a smaller pocket pistol , .380 ACP may be the largest round a shooter feels confident with , whereas the same shooter might be completely at ease with a .
44 Special in a heavy , full - frame revolver .
For the recoil sensitive , .380 ACP , 9 mm , and .38 Special are all safe bets that still offer reasonable power .
3 ) Is the cartridge for which the gun is chambered effective enough to insure that I will be able to stop an attacker ?
There is much debate over caliber selection within defensive handgun circles .
Many shooters argue that anything less potent than 9 mm or .38 Special is unreliable for self - defense .
Except for extremely petite or physically weak shooters , I would tend to agree that cartridges like .32 ACP , .25 ACP , .22 Short , .22 LR , .22 Magnum , and even the .380 ACP are all too impotent for a dedicated home defense weapon .
While they are all superior to a pocketknife for self - defense , I think it is worth the slight extra recoil to move up to a more effective “ major ” caliber , including 9 mm ( although this round ’s effectiveness is sometimes questioned too ) , .38 Special ( also criticized as impotent ) , .357 Magnum , .40 S&W , .44 Magnum , .44 Special , and .45 ACP , among others .
If you buy a minor caliber , you will definitely have to purchase the more expensive defensive ammunition in order to improve the round ’s efficacy against an attacker .
Standard full metal jacket or “ hardball ” ammunition will work satisfactorily for defense work if in the largest calibers , such as .44 Magnum or .45 ACP .
This should not be a major consideration , though , since I would generally recommend defensive ammo for regular carry because those rounds frequently feature corrosion resistant nickel - plated cartridge casings and are manufactured to tighter specifications .
4 ) Does this manufacturer have a reputation for reliability ?
Unless you are really pushing the poverty line , it is hard to justify buying a gun that might work when you need it .
Stay away from guns manufactured by unknown or disreputable makers .
My short list of quality handgun makers would include : Sig-Sauer , Heckler & Koch , Ruger , Glock , Smith & Wesson ( revolvers ) , Colt , Kimber , Para - Ordnance , Kel - Tec , Walther , Springfield , Beretta , Browning , and Taurus .
Some of these are better than others , but each has established a reputation for reliability and safety .
There are other companies that make good guns , but the companies listed above have history of consistent excellence for at least the past ten years , and many for over a century .
Self - Defense Outside of the Home
In addition to the considerations listed above , the selection of a handgun for self - defense outside the home requires the added consideration of concealability .
If a gun is too bulky to be worn comfortably on your person , you are less likely to carry it often and therefore less likely to have it at hand when the need for it arises .
Be sure to select a gun that is n’t too heavy for you to easily carry .
For some , this means selecting a handgun chambered in .380 ACP or some other smaller caliber .
While these calibers may not be optimal , they are preferable to being empty - handed in a situation where a gun could save your life .
Action Type
Handguns are most commonly available in one of two action types : revolver or semi-automatic .
A revolver holds five , six , or more rounds of ammunition in a rotating cylinder behind the barrel .
When all the rounds are expended , the shooter must swing the cylinder out , eject the spent casings , and load each of the chambers with a new cartridge .
The only revolvers that you should consider are “ double action ” ( DA ) , meaning that you need not cock the hammer before pulling the trigger to fire a round .
A semi-automatic holds ammunition in a magazine , usually vertically inserted into the grip .
When you pull the trigger to fire , the hammer strikes the firing pin , discharges the cartridge , and uses the force of the fired cartridge to cycle the action of the gun , reloading the chamber with a fresh round from the magazine .
Semi-automatic pistols may be single action ( SA ) , double action , or double - action only ( DAO ) .
A DA semi-automatic will fire if the user pulls the trigger when the hammer is at rest and there is a round in the chamber .
The trigger pull for the second shot will be shorter and lighter because the action of the gun automatically cocks the hammer .
A DAO has the same , heavy trigger pull each time , and the hammer is always at rest .
As with revolvers , I would recommend that most first - time buyers avoid SA semi-automatics simply because the learning curve is slightly steeper and the time required to bring the weapon into action is longer since the hammer must be manually cocked prior to the first shot .
The most popular SA semi-automatic is the M1911 .45 ACP designed by John Moses Browning and manufactured most famously by Colt .
While this venerable design has much to offer , I cannot recommend it as the sole lifeline for a beginning shooter .
When choosing between a revolver and a semi-automatic , remember these factors :
Semi-Automatic
may be reloaded more rapidly by simply removing empty magazine and inserting a fresh one ( and , depending on the model , either racking the slide again to chamber the first round or releasing the slide from its locked position )
usually has a higher magazine capacity
may be flatter and therefore more concealable
more likely to have a manual safety
malfunction / misfeed may require more steps to remedy
Revolver
cleaning is easier because disassembly is usually not required
in case of a misfire , simply pull the trigger again
Recommended Models
While I cannot offer an exhaustive list of suitable selections here , the following models are a few of those with which I have personal experience and thus can wholeheartedly recommend .
Home Defense
Any Smith & Wesson revolver chambered in .38 Special or better , including :
Any Sig- Sauer pistol chambered in 9 mm or better , including :
Sig -Sauer P229 ( 9 mm , .40 S&W , or .357 Sig ) : Less power than .44 Magnum or .44 Special , but each caliber is more powerful than the .38 Special .
High capacity in a reliable gun .
Semi-automatic .
Any Heckler & Koch pistol , including :
Heckler & Koch USP ( 9 mm , .40 S&W ) : Unbeatably reliable but pricey .
Semi-automatic .
Any Glock pistol , including :
Glock Model 23 ( .40 S&W ) : Durable , reliable , and easy to shoot .
Semi-automatic .
Concealed Carry
Any Kel - Tec pistol except the PLR - 16 , including :
Kel - Tec P3AT ( .380 ACP ) : Medium potency round , but in an extremely light , concealable package .
Very competitive prices .
Semi-automatic .
The basic model Taurus pistols and revolvers chambered in .38 Special or better , including :
Taurus Millennium Pro 111 ( 9 mm ) : More potent than .380 ACP , but slightly bulkier gun too .
Semi-automatic .
Taurus Titanium Model 617 ( .357 Magnum ) : Lighter than steel but stronger than alloy of gun below , this gun fires the potent .357 Magnum .
Relatively inexpensive compared to gun with same features from S&W. Revolver .
Any subcompact Glock , including :
Glock Model 36 ( .45 ACP ) : Incredible potency , but limited magazine capacity .
Semi-automatic .
Any Smith & Wesson J - frame revolver , including :
Smith & Wesson Model 638 ( .38 Special ) : Light alloy that is cheaper than the slightly more durable titanium revolver from S&W , fires slightly less potent .38 Special .
Concealed hammer makes for snag - free draw from concealed position .
Note also that stainless steel is less likely to corrode than carbon steel , so paying extra for a stainless steel model or a model with a tough anti-corrosion coating is often a good investment for a carry gun that will frequently come into contact with your skin , dust , etc .
Titanium , scandium , and other alloys are used instead of steel in the frames of many revolvers to save weight .
Titanium and scandium are more durable than the cheaper alloy frames , with regards to the finish of the gun .
Dealer or Show ?
Most guns at gun shows are being sold by dealers who are Federal Firearms Licensees ( FFLs ) .
They tend to mark prices down for the show because they want to be competitive with the other dealers present and they do n’t want to have to pack up the guns on Sunday .
Individuals also bring guns to sell at gun shows , so you may happen across a great deal on a used gun from such an individual .
In my experience , though , haggling at a gun shop tends to be about as effective as attending a gun show with regards to finding a good sale price on a particular gun .
If you know what you want , you will probably get it either way .
In either circumstance , paying cash tends to lower the price .
If you are looking for something unusual , or a model with a very specific configuration , attending a gun show may be advantageous .
For a specialized order , you can also either order through your local FFL or find what you want on GunBroker.com and have the local FFL transfer it to you for a fee  usually about $ 25 $ 50 .
According to federal law , an individual buyer can only buy a handgun in the state of his residence .
This means that an out - of - state dealer has to ship to your local dealer , who then performs the background check and maintains the required records .
Most states place no restrictions on individual to individual transfers , although you should get a bill of sale  handwritten or in printed form  for the gun no matter whom you buy from .
Good luck , and happy shooting !

The Best of Dick Clark
Anyone who has bought the latest textbook in , say , economics , knows that you need to haul a wheelbarrow full of dollars to the college book store .
Publishers insist that book prices have been holding steady in recent years , but most students would beg to differ .
One thing students can do is to join maketextbooksaffordable.org , a student campaign to lower textbook costs .
But they should not have to solve the problem on their own .
Help could be on the way .
A congressional conference committee has begun work on the broader issue of the high cost of higher education .
The conferees should embrace a House measure on textbooks that has been pushed by two California Congressmen– Rep. Howard P. “ Buck ” McKeon , a Republican , and Rep. George Miller , a Democrat .
The textbook provisions — contained in House bill H.R. 4137 — do not do anything drastic .
But they should make it a lot easier for faculty , students , and parents to decide whether a particular textbook is worth the cost , and they should modestly help to drive down prices .
First , publishers would be required tell faculty how much their choices for textbooks will really cost the students .
This would seem incredibly easy given Amazon.com , but many college professors routinely complain that basic information about the cost of textbooks is not easily available to them .
There ’s a clear business logic behind this .
A representative of the Public Interest Research Group describes the average textbook promotion to faculty members as resembling old - style restaurant menus for women that did not include prices .
If professors do n’t know the price ( that they wo n’t be paying anyway ) , many will pick the most expensive thing on the menu .
The textbook industry has provided some help with price listings on the web .
One source of information on texbook pricing comes courtesy of the American Publishers Association .
But more information is needed .
Second , the House bill would require publishers to “ unbundle ” textbooks .
Too many texts now come shrinkwrapped with CDs and other extras , driving up the cost .
Publishers insist that these extras really help and argue that in some cases the CD is the real text , and the book is simply an accompanying manual .
It should be obvious , however , when the book is the text , and in those cases students should not need to buy anything else .
Finally , and probably most important , the bill would require schools to post the list of required and recommended books long before students need to buy them .
That would allow them enough time to shop for the best deals — online or in used bookstores .
Faculty should also be doing their part .
Instead of assigning two expensive books and using just a few chapters of each , professors should order custom books with only the chapters they intend to assign .
Congress , though , should do what it can , because mounting textbook prices are one of a number of factors that are pushing higher education further out of reach of many young people .

Dr. Taylor recounts the details of her stroke and the amazing insights she gained from it in a riveting 18 - minute video of her speech at the Technology , Entertainment , Design Conference in Monterey , Calif . , last month .
Her fascinating lecture includes a detailed explanation of the differences between the left and right sides of the brain , complete with an incredibly cool prop — a real human brain .
On a December morning in 1996 , Dr. Taylor woke up with searing pain behind her left eye , the beginnings of a hemorrhagic stroke .
As the left side of her brain shut down , she began to feel disconnected from her body and entered an almost - euphoric like state .
It took her a while to make sense of the experience , but as her right arm became paralyzed , it dawned on her that she was having a stroke .
“ How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out ? , ” she said .
“ In the course of four hours , I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information .
On the morning of the hemorrhage , I could not walk , talk , read , write or recall any of my life . ”
Her account of the experience of stroke is vivid , and at one point , she recalled , she felt like someone had taken a remote control and hit the mute button .
“ I was shocked to find myself inside a silent mind , ” she said .
What is so surprising about Dr. Taylor ’s story is that she experienced a sort of euphoria as she was left with only right - brain functions .
She lost her sense of self , but she also shed the stress of her life and , as she puts it , “ 37 years of emotional baggage . ”
“ Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter , ” she said .
“ I felt a sense of peacefulness . ”
Dr. Taylor ’s lecture is challenging and thought - provoking , and I ’d encourage you to take the time to watch it in its entirety .
It took Dr. Taylor eight years to recover from the stroke , but she said she was motivated by a desire to share her experience of stroke and recovery , particularly her increased awareness of the right side of her brain .
“ I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be , what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives , and it motivated me to recover , ” she said .

Research finds that guys have trouble reading non-verbal cues and often mistake a friendly smile to mean sexual interest .
More often than not , guys interpret even friendly cues , such as a subtle smile from a gal , as a sexual come-on , and a new study discovers why : Guys are clueless .
More precisely , they are somewhat oblivious to the emotional subtleties of non-verbal cues , according to a new study of college students .
" Young men just find it difficult to tell the difference between women who are being friendly and women who are interested in something more , " said lead researcher Coreen Farris of Indiana University 's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences .
This " lost in translation " phenomenon plays out in the real world , with about 70 percent of college women reporting an experience in which a guy mistook her friendliness for a sexual come - on , Farris said .
Some might think the results come down to " boys being boys , " and so even the slightest female interest sparks sexual fantasy .
But the study , to be detailed in the April issue of the journal Psychological Science , also found that it goes both ways for guys — they mistake females ' sexual signals as friendly ones .
The researchers suggest guys have trouble noticing and interpreting the subtleties of non-verbal cues , in either direction .
The study 's funding came from the National Institutes of Mental Health and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism .
Flirting or not ?
To unravel it all , Farris and her colleagues examined non-verbal communication in a group of 280 undergraduates , both men and women with an average age of 20 years old .
The students viewed images of women on a computer screen and had to categorize each as friendly , sexually interested , sad or rejecting .
Each student reported on 280 photographs , which had been sorted previously into one of the categories based on surveys completed by different groups of students .
Overall , women categorized more images correctly than men did .
When it came to friendly gestures , men were more likely than women to interpret these to mean sexual interest .
More surprising , the researchers found guys were also confused by sexual cues .
When images of gals meant to show allure flashed onto the screen , male students mistook the allure as amicable signals .
So ladies trying to brush off a guy at work or the gym may need to be , uh , more direct .
Men in the study also had more trouble than women distinguishing between sadness and rejection .
Programmed for sex
The results help to tease out the underlying causes of guys ' flirt - or - not mistakes .
One common explanation for reports of men taking a friendly gesture as " she wants me , " is based on men 's inherent interest in sex , which is thought to result from their biology as well as their upbringing .
Following this idea , men and women would be aware of the same behavioral cues , but men would have a lower threshold for what qualifies as sexual interest .
In contrast , women would wait for compelling evidence before labeling a behavior as sexual interest .
However , Farris and her colleagues did n't find this to be the case .
Rather than seeing the world through sex - colored glasses , men seemed just to have blurry vision of sorts , overall .
For instance , the college guys sometimes mistook sexual advances as pal - like gestures .
" I would say that there are many factors that could relate to men demonstrating insensitivity to women 's subtle non-verbal cues , " said Pamela McAuslan , associate professor of psychology at the University of Michigan - Dearborn , who was not involved in the current study .
These factors would include socialization , gender roles and gender stereotypes , she said .
For instance , " women are supposed to be the communicators , concerned with relationships and others … men are supposed to be less concerned with communication and to be constantly alert for sexual opportunities , " McAuslan said .
" This could mean that men in general may be less sensitive to subtle non-verbal behavior than women . "
That does n't mean such men can't learn to read cues or that all men are clueless decoders of women 's gestures .
" These are average differences .
Some men are very skilled at reading affective cues , " Farris told LiveScience , " and some women find the task challenging . "
Justice Department Memo Issued in 2001 Shows White House Regarded Its Anti-Terror Surveillance Program as ' Immune ' From Fourth Amendment 's Requirement for Court Warrants ; New Book Reveals Heated Dissension in FBI and Justice Department Over Program 's Legality
So now the truth comes out :
The Bush administration knew all along that its warrantless wiretapping program against suspected terrorists would run afoul of the Fourth Amendment constitutional mandate that the government obtain warrants for such eavesdropping .
But the Justice Department concocted a claim in a secret 2001 memorandum disclosed last week that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to terrorism cases .
The White House claims it has " disavowed " the memorandum .
But why is the administration still publicly insisting to this day that its warrantless program is legal when , in fact , it 's not ?
And why is it insisting that Congress grant telecommunications companies that illegally cooperated with the government 's warrantless surveillance program immunity from invasion - of - privacy lawsuits ?

For more than two years -- almost from the timewas launched -- this blogger has argued over and over and over again that the Bush administration 's warrantless surveillance program against terrorism suspects was -- and is -- unconstitutional .
For more than two years , this blogger has repeatedly cited a unanimous 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision and a 1975 U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in arguing that the program violates the Fourth Amendment 's ban on unreasonable government searches and seizures by not obtaining court warrants for such surveillance .
Now , it turns out , the Bush administration knew all along that what it was doing was unconstitutional -- but concocted a rationale to claim that its warrantless anti-terror wiretapping was exempt from the Fourth Amendment 's requirements .
A secret legal memorandum issued by the Justice Department in 2001 made precisely that argument .
It was written at the request of the White House by John Yoo , then the deputy assistant attorney general , and addressed to Alberto Gonzales , the White House counsel at the time .
Gonzales , who would go on to become attorney general in 2005 , asserted the president has the " inherent authority " to unilaterally order secret intercepts by the National Security Agency of telephone and e-mail exchanges between people inside the United States and their contacts abroad without first obtaining court warrants .
So controversial is the government ’s eavesdropping program that it sparked heated legal concerns and silent protests inside the Bush administration within hours of its adoption in October 2001 , according to a newly - published book .
In making its case to Congress for broadened spy powers , the White House has emphasized what it claimed were the firm legal foundations of the program conducted after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks -- and had even taken the unusual step of giving lawmakers access to classified presidential orders from 2001 and early legal opinions to try to show that the program was on sound legal footing from the start , the book says .
reporter Eric Lichtblau 's new volume , is based on interviews with scores of current and former Bush administration officials .
The memo , dated October 23 , 2001 , was written just days before Bush administration officials , including Vice President Dick Cheney , briefed four House and Senate leaders on the NSA 's secret wiretapping program for the first time .
The memo remains secret , but its existence was disclosed last Tuesday in a footnote of a separate secret memo , dated March 14 , 2003 , released by the Pentagon in response to a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union .
" Our office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations , " the footnote states , referring to a document titled " Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States .
" Exactly what domestic military action was covered by the October memo is unclear .
But federal documents indicate that the memo relates to the National Security Agency 's Terrorist Surveillance Program , or TSP .
That program intercepted phone calls and e-mails on U.S. soil , bypassing the normal legal requirement that such eavesdropping be authorized by a secret federal court established under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The program began after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks and continued until January 17 , 2007 -- after the Democrats took control of Congress -- when the White House resumed seeking surveillance warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
The FISA law , passed by Congress in 1978 , established the court specifically to review and either approve or reject requests from the executive branch for warrants authorizing such surveillance for national security purposes -- and explicitly requires the government to seek such warrants .
The law arose from a scandal in the 1970s resulting from congressional investigations that uncovered years of domestic spying abuses by the FBI under then - Director J. Edgar Hoover against those suspected of communist sympathies , American Indians , Black Panthers and other activists , including Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. and Malcolm X.Lawmakers then were very disturbed at how routinely FBI agents had listened in on U.S. citizens ' phone calls without following any formal procedures under the bureau 's notorious COINTELPRO counter - intelligence program that ran from 1956 until Hoover 's death in 1971 .
As they drafted FISA and created its court , the lawmakers warned then that only strong legislation , debated in public , could stop future administrations from eavesdropping without court approval .
The administration had little choice :
It saw the handwriting on the wall when the Democrats vowed to conduct rigorous investigations of the program -- including public hearings in which administration officials were certain to face hostile questioning .
The White House also was fighting off a legal challenge to the warrantless surveillance .
A federal district court judge in Michigan ruled in August 2006 that the program was an unconstitutional breach of the Fourth Amendment 's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures and the separation of powers between the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said Wednesday that the Fourth Amendment finding in the October memo was not the legal underpinning for the TSP .
" TSP relied on a separate set of legal memoranda , " Fratto told The Associated Press .
The Justice Department outlined that legal framework in a January 2006 white paper issued by the Justice Department a month after the program was revealed by The government itself related the October memo to the TSP when it included it on a list of documents that were responsive to the ACLU 's request for records from the program .
It refused to hand them over .
Late Wednesday , Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said department officials believe the October 2001 memo was not about the eavesdropping program , but he did not explain why it was included on requests for documents linked to the TSP .
Earlier , Roehrkasse said the statement in the footnote does not reflect the current view of the department 's Office of Legal Counsel .
"
We disagree with the proposition that the Fourth Amendment has no application to domestic military operations , " he said .
" Whether a particular search or seizure is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment requires consideration of the particular context and circumstances of the search .
" Roehrkasse would not say exactly when that legal opinion was overturned internally .
But he pointed to the January 2006 white paper .
" The white paper does not suggest in any way that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to domestic military activities , and that is not the position of the Office of Legal Counsel , " he said .
Suzanne Spaulding , a national security law expert and former assistant general counsel at the CIA , said she found the Fourth Amendment reference in the footnote troubling , but added : " To know [ the Justice Department ] no longer thinks this is a legitimate statement is reassuring .
" Rubbish , says the ACLU .
" The recent disclosures underscore the Bush administration 's extraordinarily sweeping conception of executive power , " said Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU 's National Security Project .
" The administration 's lawyers believe the president should be permitted to violate statutory law , to violate international treaties and even to violate the Fourth Amendment inside the U.S.
They believe that the president should be above the law . "
" Each time one of these memos comes out you have to come up with a more extreme way to characterize it , " Jaffer said .
The ACLU is challenging in court the government 's withholding of the October 2001 memo .
Yet even as the administration says it has " disavowed " the October 2001 memo , it continues to argue publicly that the warrantless program is legal -- and continues its attempt to bully the Democratic - controlled House of Representatives into passing a bill to grant immunity to telecommunications companies from invasion - of - privacy lawsuits by their customers .
that turned over their customers ' confidential records to the government without demanding court warrants .
This blogger has pointed out repeatedly that the telecoms violated both the Fourth Amendment and the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act of 1996 by not demanding that the government produce court warrants before turning over their confidential customer records .
For their part , House Democrats twice refused to yield to the White House 's demand , insisting that to grant the telecoms immunity would violate Americans '
First Amendment right to petition the courts for redress of the government 's illegal search of their telephone records without warrants .
The administration 's claim that it has " disavowed " the October memo is further belied by its appeal of the Michigan federal court 's ruling that declared the warrantless eavesdropping unconstitutional .
On July 6 last year , a federal appeals court effectively overturned the lower court 's decision by dismissing the plaintiffs ' lawsuit , ruling that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge the program 's legality .
Why ?
Because the plaintiffs could n't prove that the their communications were being monitored by the government .
And the reason they could n't prove it ?
The government refused to turn over information about the warrantless wiretapping that would have bolstered the plaintiffs ' case , invoking national security .
For the administration to claim that it no longer wiretaps terror suspects without warrants on the one hand and insists on telecom immunity from invasion - of - privacy lawsuits on the other hand -- as well as challenging court decisions declaring the program unconstitutional is the height of a " Catch - 22 " mindset that defies all logic .
In one previously undisclosed episode , according to Lictblau 's book , Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson refused to sign off on any of the secret wiretapping requests that grew out of the program because of the secrecy and legal uncertainties surrounding it .
With the veil of secrecy around the program , Thompson was not given access to details of the NSA operation , and was so uncomfortable with the idea of approving this new breed of wiretap applications that he had a top adviser write a memorandum assessing the legal ramifications , Lictblau writes .
The adviser warned him not to sign the warrant applications because it was unclear where the wiretaps were coming from .
Meanwhile , FBI technicians stumbled onto the NSA ’s program accidentally within 12 hours of its inception , according to Lichtblau , setting off what was described as a brief firestorm of anxiety among senior FBI officials .
Some who had not been told about the program were concerned that the agency was violating laws that required a court order for the singling out of Americans in wiretaps , and they immediately alerted highers - up to what they had discovered .
“ What ’s going on here ?
Is this legal ? ” Lichtblau quoted one FBI official as asking after learning of the N.S.A. operation on American soil .
For his part , FBI Director Robert Mueller assured nervous officials that the program had been approved by Bush , Lichtblau wrote , citing several unnamed officials .
But the president 's approval came weeks before
Yoo issued his legal memo endorsing the program .
The Supreme Court in 1972 unanimously struck down a similar warrantless surveillance program by the Nixon administration , declaring that the program violated the Fourth Amendment requirement that the government obtain court warrants to wiretap the telephone conversations of suspected domestic radicals during the Vietnam War .
The high court 's ruling was subsequently bolstered in 1975 by an equally unanimous decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , the nation 's second - highest court , to expand its scope to include foreign intelligence cases .
The administration of then - President Gerald Ford chose not to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court , assuming that it would likely lose .
Thus the appeals court decision remains in force to this day .
So why is no one else acknowledging that the Bush administration 's warrantless surveillance program defies the 1972 ruling by the nation 's highest court -- bolstered by the 1975 appeals court ?
BELGRADE ( Reuters ) - Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Sunday accused NATO peacekeepers and United Nations police of using “ snipers and banned ammunition ” to quell a Serb riot against Kosovo ’s independence .
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica addresses the media during a news conference in Belgrade March 8 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Ivan Milutinovic
“ It was the international forces , ” he told the daily Vecernje Novosti in an interview , referring to a riot in the Kosovo Serb stronghold of Mitrovica last Monday in which a Ukrainian U.N. policeman was killed and a Serb badly wounded in the head .
“ Obviously , the situation in Kosovo is very difficult and there are reasonable and unreasonable people .
The battle is on for the whole of Kosovo , ” Kostunica said .
When the powers which back independence for the majority Albanian province realized that Serbia would never recognize it , “ they displayed force , ” Kostunica said “ brutal force , snipers and banned ammunition ” .
U.N. police and NATO troops raided a U.N. court building on Monday which had been occupied by Serb protesters , including Serbian interior ministry officials , according to the U.N .
The U.N. and NATO say the violence was instigated by Belgrade .
They say Serbs threw grenades and Molotov cocktails and fired automatic weapons in a deliberate attempt to kill .
Serbs say one man now in a coma was shot by a NATO sniper .
Kostunica ’s “ banned ammunition ” charge refers to plastic bullets .
VOTERS WILL DECIDE
Kostunica is now a caretaker premier .
His coalition collapsed this month over his hard - line policy of rejecting closer European Union ties until the EU reverses its recognition of Kosovo .
He said this would be the key issue in the early general election now scheduled for May 11 , with rival Democrats led by pro-Western president Boris Tadic advocating a less confrontational approach .
Serbia would not submit to blackmail , Kostunica said .
He was “ seriously worried ” by pro-EU Serbs who he said would give Serbia a “ government ready to push aside the defense of its integrity and say : Let ’s join Europe and then fight for Kosovo ” .
More than 30 countries have recognized Kosovo , led by the United States and the major EU powers .
Russia backs Serbia and refers to the declaration of independence as an illegal move .
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic , a member of Tadic ’s party , said independence was a mistake and Serbia would do all it takes to put “ the genie back in the bottle ” , and restart talks between Serbs and Kosovo ’s 90 percent Albanian majority .
“ Our battle will imply preventing membership for the so - called state of Kosovo in international institutions , ” Jeremic told Glas Javnosti in an interview .
“ I have already written to 23 international institutions and forums ... warning them that they must not respond positively to Kosovo ’s possible membership request . ”
Belgrade was working to “ consolidate the majority of countries not recognizing Kosovo ’s independence ” who would outweigh the bloc of countries that support it .
His ministry has publicly backed China in its handling of riots in Tibet .
Jeremic said the goal was to seek the opinion of the International Court of Justice and the U.N. General Assembly in September .
If placed on the agenda of the General Assembly , where each UN member country has one vote , Jeremic said it would be a “ very important tactical and diplomatic victory ” .
Taco Bell , Wal - Mart , NRA hired ' black ops ' company that targeted environmental groups John Byrne

Print This Email This Dumpster - diving firm collected Social Security numbers of activists A private security firm managed by former Secret Service officers spied on myriad environmental organizations throughout the 1990s and the year 2000 , thieving documents , trying to plant undercover operations and collecting phone records of members , according to a new report .
Documents obtained by James Ridgeway , a Mother Jones correspondent formerly with the Village Voice , reveals the contractor collected confidential internal records -- donor lists , financial statements -- even Social Security numbers , for public relations outfits and " corporations involved in environmental controversies . "
Beckett Brown International also offered " intelligence " services to the Carlyle Group , the controversial DC - based investment company ; " protective services " for the National Rifle Association ; " crisis management " for the Gallo wine company and for Pirelli ; " information collection " for Wal - Mart .
" Also listed as clients in BBI records , " Ridgeway reveals : " Halliburton and Monsanto . "
Like other firms specializing in snooping , Beckett Brown turned to garbage swiping as a key tactic .
BBI officials and contractors routinely conducted what the firm referred to as " D - line " operations , in which its operatives would seek access to the trash of a target , with the hope of finding useful documents .
One midnight raid targeted Greenpeace .
One BBI document lists the addresses of several other environmental groups as " possible sites " for operations : the National Environmental Trust , the Center for Food Safety , Environmental Media Services , the Environmental Working Group , the U.S. Public Interest Research Group , and the Center for Health , Environment and Justice , an organization run by Lois Gibbs , famous for exposing the toxic dangers of New York 's Love Canal .
For its rubbish - rifling operations , BBI employed a police officer in the District of Columbia and a former member of the Maryland state police .
Taco Bell genetic corn fiasco
The documents reveal spy thriller - like absurdities : a spy job on groups that had discovered Kraft 's Taco Bell was using genetically - engineered corn not approved for human consumption and planned to make a fuss .
A former Secret Service agent working for the company emailed another man on the payroll -- an erstwhile Maryland police officer .
Received a call from Ketchum yesterday afternoon re three sites in DC .
It seems Taco Bell turned out some product made from bioengineered corn .
The chemicals used on the corn have not been approved for human consumption .
Hence Taco
Bell produced potential glow - in - the - dark tacos .
Taco Bell is owned by Kraft .
The Ketchum Office , New York , has the ball .
They suspect the initiative is being generated from one of three places :
1. Center for Food Safety , 7th & Penn SE
2. Friends of the Earth , 1025 Vermont Ave ( Between K & L Streets )
3. GE Food Alert , 1200 18th St NW ( 18th & M )
# 1 is located on 3rd floor .
Main entrance is key card .
Alley is locked by iron gates .
7 dempsters [ sic ] in alley take your pick .
# 2 is in the same building as Chile Embassy .
Armed guard in lobby & cameras everywhere .
There is a dumpster in the alley behind the building .
Do n't know if it is tied to bldg .
or a neighborhood property .
Cameras everywhere .
# 3 is doable but behind locked iron gates at rear of bldg .
Taco Bell has also raised the heckles of activists for the price it paid those who produced its tomatoes .
After a protracted campaign by a Florida group , the firm agreed to pay an extra penny for each pound of tomatoes it buys from farm workers .
The company took three years to increase their payment per pound by a cent , which they did in 2005 .
Taking out Greenpeace 's trash
An eyewitness described a ' black op ' on Greenpeace , one of the world 's largest environmental activist groups .
" It was Mission Impossible - like , " the witness remarked .
The firm collected internal reports from Greenpeace 's garbage .
They attempted to crack the codes on the organization 's front doors .
Technically , the firm has dissolved .
But they 're not down and out .
" As for BBI 's principals , " Ridgeway writes , " they are still operating .
Tim Ward now runs a security firm called Chesapeake Strategies , which bills itself as ' a multinational security and investigative firm comprised of professionals with extensive security experience . '
Jay
Bly works there .
Its website boasts that it maintains affiliated offices in Paris , Beijng , Tokyo , Qatar , and Kuwait and that ' many team members continue to hold Secret and Top Secret government security clearances . '

Every week on The Chris Matthews Show , Matthews has a segment where he asks his panel of pundits to " Tell Me Something I Don't Know . "
This week , Andrew Sullivan of The Atlantic spoke as bluntly as any talking head has done since Bush / Cheney took office :
The latest revelations on the torture front show — the memo from John Yoo — as well as revelations from Phillippe Sands ’ book , mean that Donald Rumsfeld , David Addington and John Yoo should not leave the United States any time soon .
They will be at some point indicted for war crimes .
They deserve to be .
Damn straight .
Phillippe Sands has an article in this month 's Vanity Fair highlighting aspects of his book , which comes out next month .
“ My First Place ” Shows Off Poor Decisions
Sometime in the past two weeks I was working on No Debt Plan with the TV on in the background .
We happened to have the channel on HGTV , and the show “ My First Place ” was on .
I also happened to have it two nights ago when I was writing this article .
As you might imagine , the show is based on the premise if helping first time home buyers find that perfect first home .
It also is a great opportunity to show off some really , really bad decisions .
After watching the show , I can see exactly why we have a foreclosure problem in the US right now .
( Photo : Four letter word by Justin Shearer ) .
The first episode included a married couple that lived and worked in Seattle .
Combined , the couple earned $ 100,000 per year .
As the show unfolded , I started to sigh to myself .
Apparently , this is going to be frustrating to watch .
They visited several properties ranging from single detached homes to condos .
Their original budget was , if I remember correctly , $ 230,000 to $ 250,000 .
They did n’t like the condo because it felt like they were living in an apartment .
I do n’t blame them — we did n’t like condos / townhouses we visited either .
Of course , they saw a few options that they always found something wrong with .
Either the commute was too long , or the grass was n’t just right , or ( name your excuse here ) .
So they started to look at houses that were more expensive than their budget .
The couple did a whole slew of things wrong that really disappointed me in the show .
You ’d think instead of just taping a disaster - to - be that the show would offer some advice .
Apparently not .
They ended up with a $ 262,000 house , a 6.75 % interest - only mortgage .
Unbelievable .
Some mistakes I picked up on :
They were not pre-approved for a mortgage , so they were shopping prices that they did not know they could get a mortgage for .
A pre-approval process would help them figure out what they could afford on a 30 year ( or 15 year ) mortgage .
for a mortgage , so they were shopping prices that they did not know they could get a mortgage for .

They had no savings .
None .
If you are making $ 100,000 per year and have nothing to show for it , something is seriously amiss .
None .

The mortgage they chose was terrible .
The broker or lender they chose should be ashamed of themselves .
They even laid out the numbers on what a fixed mortgage would be , but going to interest - only would save them $ 200 per month .
Of course , they will never own their house , but they said they would pay extra in principle after they were settled .
Coming from people without savings , I highly doubt it .

Coming from people without savings , I highly doubt it .
They spent above their target budget .
They ended up in a $ 262,000 house and the target price was $ 230,000 to 250,000 .
Of course their initial expectations may have been unrealistic .
I think that is fair to say with most first time home buyers .
But they still spent above what they targeted on the high end by $ 12,000 .
That ’s no small amount of money .
The second episode was fairly similar .
It featured a single woman in Atlanta that was trying to get out of her apartment .
She worked as a personal assistant and was starting an event planning company on the side .
She connected with one of her sorority sisters that was in real estate .
Her target price was $ 250,000 to $ 260,000 .
The realtor took her from house to house , and of course there were things she did n’t like about the houses that were in her range .
She settled on a $ 265,000 house and offered $ 262,000 with the seller paying closing costs .
As she signed the offer sheet , she became very nervous about being able to afford the payments .
She was hoping she could be approved for it .
Again , no pre-approval letter showing what she could afford .
A house inspector came and found a few small things wrong with the home .
They were fixed by the seller .
The week before she was to close on the house , she was laid off from her position .
She had until the following week to find employment so that she could close .
Unable to do that , she ended up losing the house .
( I do wonder if she lost any money in the process , like deposits , etc. )
She was lucky because she lost her job before she got the house .
Imagine moving into your house the day you lose your job .
This is n’t entirely her fault , but there were still several mistakes she made along the way .
Overall , I am disappointed that the show does n’t offer any advice to the first time home buyers .
Instead , they seem to just document what is happening .
If it were my show , this is the advice I would give first time home buyers :

Waihopai Spy Base Penetrated
This morning , 30 April 2008 , we entered the Waihopai Spy Base near Blenheim .
Our group , including a Dominican Priest , temporarily closed the base by padlocking the gates and proceeded to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes .
At 6 am we cut through three security fences surrounding the domes - these are armed with razor wire , infrared motion sensors and a high voltage electrified fence .
Once inside we used sickles to cut one of the two 30 - metre white domes , built a shrine and knelt in prayer to remember the people killed by United States military activity .
We have financed our activities through personal savings , additional part - time employment and a small interest - free loan from one of our supporters .
We are responding to the Bush administration ’s admission that intelligence gathering is the most important tool in the so - called War on Terror .
This war will have no end until citizens of the world refuse to let it continue .
The ECHELON spy network including Waihopai , is an important part of the US government ’s global spy network and we have come in the name of the Prince of Peace to close it down .
The base is funded by New Zealand tax payers and located on New Zealand soil which makes New Zealand a target through our association with the UKUSA intelligence cooperation agreement .
Five years ago the Clark government opposed the US - led invasion of Iraq .
Yet at the same time the Bush administration was using the National Security Agency ’s ECHELON system , of which Waihopai is an integral component , to spy on UN Security Council members so it could more easily swing them in favour of an invasion .
There have been over 100 Ploughshares actions over the last twenty years around the world .
Ploughshares direct actions are linked through the common factors of : entry to locations connected to military activity , Christian prayers and most involve some form of property destruction .

About Waihopai & ECHELON
Green MP Keith Locke is quoted as saying that the base has cost New Zealand up to NZ$ 500 million since 1989 .
The base intercepts electronic communications throughout the Pacific region including New Zealand and is often staffed by personnel from US agencies .
In 1996 researcher Nicky Hager published an expose on Waihopai and New Zealand ’s strong links to the USA - led ECHELON network of six similar spy stations around the world .
The United Nations launched an investigation in 2003 to claims that ECHELON had been used by the US government to eavesdrop on UN diplomats and Security Council members .
A report published in 2000 showed that ECHELON had also been used by the US to gain commercial advantage for US corporations .
Information gathered at Waihopai is transferred to the Government Communications Security Bureau ( GCSB ) in Wellington and fed unseen directly to Washington DC .

( CNN ) --
On three occasions since January , Sen. Barack Obama 's passport file was looked at by three different contract workers , said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack .
Sen .
Barack Obama 's passport file was breached three times since January , the State Department said .
The contractors accessed information in the file in an unauthorized way , he said .
Two contractors were fired and one was disciplined by the contractor 's company , McCormack said .
He said the contractors are not linked .
The State Department hires contractors to design , build and maintain their systems and help employees with searches .
McCormack said two of the contractors in the Obama case were " low - level " personnel and the other was in a mid-level position with no management role .
The breach seems like " imprudent curiosity " among the contract workers , said McCormack , adding that senior management at the State Department was not aware of the incidents until Thursday afternoon .
Breaches occurred January 9 , February 21 and March 14 .
A State Department source said passport files contain scanned images of passport applications , birth date and basic biographical information , records of passport renewal , and possibly citizenship information .
Obama 's campaign is asking for a complete investigation to find out who looked at Obama 's passport file and why .
" This is an outrageous breach of security and privacy , even from an administration that has shown little regard for either over the last eight years , " said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton in a statement .
" Our government 's duty is to protect the private information of the American people , not use it for political purposes . "
Doug Hattaway , a spokesman for Sen. Hillary Clinton , Obama 's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , said , " If it 's true , it 's reprehensible , and the Bush administration has a responsibility to get to the bottom of it . "
The White House declined comment Thursday evening , just hours after the State Department upper management learned of the breach .
State Department officials say Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice was told Thursday what happened and that she told her staff she wanted a full investigation .
The department would not speculate whether the information had been shared with anyone else .
Watch Anderson Cooper discuss the controversy »
" That obviously is something we are investigating , " said Under Secretary of State Pat Kennedy .
" I have no reason to believe they did , but I certainly am not going to be dismissive of what is a serious and valid question . "
Kennedy said he will brief Obama 's senior staff on Friday .
The news was reminiscent of a breach of Bill Clinton 's passport information during the 1992 presidential campaign .
The FBI launched an investigation after the State Department reported that someone had ripped out pages from his passport file from the late 1960s and ' 70s .
The department concluded that a search of Clinton 's passport records was an attempt to influence the presidential election , reportedly by trying to show that Clinton tried to seek citizenship in another country to avoid the draft .
Clinton was running against President George H.W. Bush .
Then - State Department Inspector General Sherman
Funk found no evidence the White House ordered department staffers to dig for political dirt in Clinton 's passport files .
However , Funk said the White House probably knew it was happening .
Sen. Joseph Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , issued a statement late Thursday .
" I am deeply troubled that State Department contract employees sought access to Sen. Barack Obama 's passport files .
Firing or disciplining those responsible is an important first step .
But we need to understand why these employees had access to this information in the first place , why they sought the information , and why it took over two months for this matter to come to light .
I urge the Secretary of State to promptly refer this matter to the State Department Inspector General for investigation . "

Piping Objects : Bringing a Powershell - alike Syntax to Python
Harry Pierson recently twittered about how he missed the Powershell syntax , for piping objects between commandlets , in Python .
After exchanging emails with him , he actually prefers something like the F# syntax - which uses '| >' rather than ' | ' as a pipe .
I decided to see how far I could get with Python ( settling on '>>' as the operator ) , and I think that what I 've come up with is quite nice .
It enables you to create commandlets and pipe objects between them using '>>' ( the right shift operator ) .
Creating new commandlets is as easy as writing a function .
As I do n't actually have a use case for this (! ) , this ' proof of concept ' implementation is pretty specific to my example use case - but as it is around 60 lines of Python it is very easy to customise .
The syntax is nice and declarative , so creating a library of commandlets could be useful for working at the interactive interpreter , or it could be used for creating Domain Specific Languages .
Suppose you have a set of data that you want to pass through several filters that also transform the data , and then perform an action on each record .
With commandlets you can do things like :
some_data >> filter1 >> filter2 >> action
The normal Python technique would be to use list comprehensions .
With list comprehensions each record has to go through the filter twice , as transforming and filtering have to be done separately .
An equivalent of the above using list comprehensions looks like :
intermediate = [ filter 1 ( x ) for x in some_data if filter 1 ( x ) is not ignored ] [ action ( filter 2 ( x ) ) for x in intermediate if filter 2 ( x ) is not ignored ]
Rolling that exactly into a single list comprehension means one big-ass ugly list comprehension .
As an example of the syntax it enables , I 've implemented three simple commandlets that allow you to do :
listdir ( '.' ) >> notolderthan ( '2/3/08 ' ) >>
prettyprint
I 'm afraid that the example only works with IronPython ( because the date handling is much nicer than CPython ) , but none of the rest of the code requires IronPython .
The first part of the chain shown above is a commandlet called listdir that returns a list of all the files in a directory ( it delegates to os.listdir ) .
Although it is lists that are piped between commandlets , the functions you write ( which are wrapped in a Cmdlet class ) only need to handle one argument at the time .
You create commandlets that take arguments ( like notolderthan ) , in the same way you write decorators that take arguments - as a function that returns a function .
Here is the implementation of listdir and the notolderthan filter :
def f_listdir ( path ) :
def listdir ( ) :
return [ Path ( path , member ) for member in os .
listdir ( path ) ]
return listdir
def f_notolderthan ( date ) :
datetime = System .
DateTime .
Parse ( date )
def notolderthan ( member ) :
if member .
mtime >= datetime :
return member
return ignored
return notolderthan
listdir = Cmdlet ( f_listdir )
notolderthan = Cmdlet ( f_notolderthan )
ignored is a special sentinel value that allows commandlets to act as filters .
Commandlets can also perform an action instead of piping objects out .
prettyprint is an example of this :
def f_prettyprint ( val ) :
print val
prettyprint = Action ( f_prettyprint )
You can also pass in a generator ( or any iterable ) to the start of the chain .
Here is an argument that uses a recursive generator , listing all the files in a directory and its subdirectories , on the left hand side of the chain :
def recursive_walk ( path ) :
for e in os .
listdir ( path ) :
p = os .
path .
join ( path , e )
if os .
path .
isfile ( p ) :
yield Path ( path , e )
else :
for entry in recursive_walk ( p ) :
yield entry
recursive_walk ( '.' ) >> notolderthan ( ' 2/3/08 ' ) >> prettyprint
The Cmdlet class is a subclass of list , so a chain of commandlets returns a list ( well - a Cmdlet ) populated with the results of the call chain .
Here 's the full implementation of Cmdlet and Action :
import os
import System
__version__ = ' 0.1.0 '
__all__ = [ ' Action ' , ' Cmdlet ' , ' ignored ' , ' listdir ' , ' notolderthan ' , ' prettyprint ' ]
ignored = object ( )
class Cmdlet ( list ) :
def __init__ ( self , function , _populated = False ) :
self .
function = function
self .
_populated = _populated
def __call__ ( self , * args , ** keywargs ) :
function = self .
function
if args or keywargs :
function = self .
function ( * args , ** keywargs )
return Cmdlet ( function )
def __rshift__ ( self , other ) :
if not self .
_populated :
self [ : ] = self .
function ( )
new = Cmdlet ( other .
function , True )
vals = [ other .
function ( m ) for m in self ]
new [ : ] = [ v for v in vals if v is not ignored ]
return new
def __rrshift__ ( self , other ) :
new = Cmdlet ( self .
function , True )
vals = [ self .
function ( m ) for m in other ]
new [ : ] = [ v for v in vals if v is not ignored ]
return new
def __repr__ ( self ) :
return ' Cmdlet ( %s ) ' % list .
__repr__ ( self )
class Action ( Cmdlet ) :
def __rshift__ ( self , other ) :
Cmdlet .
__rshift__ ( self , other )
return None
def __repr__ ( self ) :
return ' Action ( %s ) ' % self .
function .
__name__
Nice .
Most of the magic is in __rshift__ and __rrshift__ , but I 'm also fond of __call__ which allows you to create commandlets that take arguments .
To run the examples you also need my homegrown Path class :
class Path ( object ) :
def __init__ ( self , path , entry ) :
self .
dir = path
self .
name = entry
self .
path = os .
path .
join ( path , entry )
self .
mtime = System .
IO .
File .
GetCreationTime ( self . path )
self .
ctime = System .
IO .
File .
GetLastWriteTime ( self . path )
def __repr__ ( self ) :
start = ' File : '
if os .
path .
isdir ( self . path ) :
start = ' Dir : '
ctime = self .
ctime
mtime = self .
mtime
return " %s %s : ctime : %s : mtime : %s " % ( start , self .
path , ctime , mtime )

Python - safethread : Python 3 without the GIL
This is a big - assed patch and I would n't rate its chances of making it into the core too highly - but it is a damn impressive project .
It allows you to compile a version of Python without the GIL ( requires changes to C extensions of course ) .
There is a performance cost for single - threaded code , but allows multi- threaded code to scale across multiple cores .
SFI Conference : Erlang , Ruby and Java ( and Concurrency )
A week before PyCon I was at a very different conference : the Academic IT Festival organised by three universities in Krakow , Poland .
I was also accompanied by my erstwhile colleague , Jonathan Hartley ( who has currently abandoned us for Mexico to get married . )
You can read his write - up in case you do n't believe mine ...
For a student conference this was fiercely well organised , with a fantastic array of speakers ( myself and Jonathan not - withstanding ) .
It was great to meet ( amongst many others ) :
Chad Fowler , author and prominent member of the Ruby community
Maciek Fijalkowski who works on PyPy
Joe Armstrong , the creator of Erlang
Gilad Bracha , one of the architects of the JVM
The conference is free and open to all , and around half the talks are in English .
Krakow is a beautiful city , so if you have the opportunity to be there next year then take it .
I 'd like share with you some of the things I learnt at the conference .
Chad Fowler
Chad is a great guy , I had a great time eating kebabs with him at one in the morning in Krakow .
He is also a great speaker and I 'd love to be as confident as him before speaking .
I 've gradually been learning more about Ruby , and Chad filled in a few more gaps for me .
One interesting point was that the Ruby community generally sees Rubinius ( a kind - of - equivalent of PyPy for Ruby ) as the future of Ruby .
Currently the VM is written in C , but they aim to develop a static - subset of Ruby so that the VM can be maintained in Ruby .
This an idea originating , I believe , in Slang for Smalltalk , but also seen in RPython for PyPy .
I would love to see the future of Python in PyPy .
Maintaining Python in Python sounds much more fun than maintaining it in C , but also I see it as the only viable path that can lead us away from the GIL and reference counting .
I also learned that in some ways Ruby is more restrictive than Python .
For example you can't change the type of objects ( which you can do in Python by assigning to __class__ ) , or the bases of a class ( by manipulating __bases__ on the class ) .
Being able to change the type of an object is one of the requirements Gilad Bracha has of a dynamic language , of which he is a big fan .
Maciek Fijalkowski
Maciek is one of the PyPy developers .
He first got involved through the google summer of code .
He emphasised that one of differences between the PyPy team and the Python core developers is that while the Python - Dev team are fanatically interested in language design ( which is good news for Python users ) , the PyPy team are much more interested in remaining language agnostic and producing the best possible VM .
There has been a sea-change in PyPy development recently .
In the past PyPy has been a fantastic project for producing a wealth of not - quite - working - but - really - cool side projects .
As a result PyPy has been at the ' nearly working ' stage for a long time .
They have recently pruned the codebase of anything unmaintained or that was blocking development .
Some really cool things ( like the ability to write CPython extensions in RPython ) have gone ( possibly to return ) , but the new focus on solidifying and completing the core is great .
Unsurprisingly though , the core Python developers , who have no familiarity with the PyPy code base , do n't see it as a ' replacement ' for the code base of CPython which they are very familiar with .
Hopefully , as the JIT integration improves , PyPy will become more of a viable alternative in the not - too distant future .
( Something I see as being potentially important to the concurrency with Python story . )
Maciek is also interested in the Resolver Systems Ironclad project , to see if parts of it could be reused to bring compatibility with CPython C extensions to PyPy - something that otherwise could be a barrier to adoption .
Joe Armstrong
Joe Armstrong is an eccentric Englishman living in Sweden .
He started his talk with a look to the future for computing .
Modern computing has long been based on the Von Neumann Architecture .
In recent years programmers of sequential programs ( ' normal ' programs , which Joe quaintly calls ' legacy ' programs ) have seen their code get faster and faster as CPU clock speeds have improved ( despite the fact that Intel clock speeds are largely fiddled anyway ) .
That has now started to change .
To reduce power consumption , and maintain the ever decreasing proportion of a chip that can be reached in a single clock cycle , clock - speeds are starting to drop and processors are gaining more cores instead .
Sequential programs that can only run on a single core will start getting slower rather than faster .
Single chips with hundreds of cores , the power of a super - computer , have already been produced experimentally by chip manufacturers ( who are n't keen to sell them and wipe out their market for selling many processors for supercomputers ) .
Joe has a project which is close to getting funding for blowing sixty MIPS cores onto an FPGA .
Threading with locking , as a concurrency solution , is very difficult ( but not as painful as it is often painted by the Python community - particularly if you take care with your design ) .
Some alternatives exist , like Transactional Memory ( which when implemented as Software Transactional Memory without hardware support has performance costs ) - but although this technique scales over multiple cores it does n't scale over multiple machines .
Another alternative is the functional programming language Erlang .
By using lightweight processes ( which are n't OS level threads or OS level processes but run on top of a scheduler in the VM ) and removing mutable state , Erlang programs scale to multiple cores or multiple machines as part of the language design .
Concurrency is going to be ever more important and Erlang is very trendy at the moment .
It is used by ejabbared which in turn is used by Twitter and there are some very interesting ' massively distributed hash table ' projects likely to surface soon .
In CPython , because of the Global Interpreter Lock , even threaded applications do n't scale across multiple cores .
The GIL is supposed to make writing C- extensions easier , but it is an interesting design choice to make aspects of Python more suited to writing C than to writing Python .
The Python community normally touts Process based concurrency as a better alternative .
However , with a clean design you can limit the locking needed for multiple threads , and where you use threads for doing large calculations ( and so have a lot of data to marshall back and forth ) the costs of using multiple processes are great .
Naturally Joe Armstrong things the answer is for us all to write in Erlang .
Interestingly , the work Chad Fowler has been doing recently has involved Ruby - without - Rails and Erlang .
He says that writing Erlang test driven has been ' interesting ' and has tended to make them use more processes ( where in Python or Ruby you would expect TDD to make your code more modular ) .
He is not sure whether this is a good thing or not , but it seems to be working for them .
Gilad Bracha
Gilad was one of the architects of the Java Virtual Machine , and also involved in Strongtalk , the phenomenal Smalltalk JIT that effectively became the Java hotspot JIT .
Random Aside : .NET vs Java
It was very interesting to talk to some of the Microsoft .NET guys at PyCon about '. NET vs Java ' .
Their take was " they have the better JIT while we have the better garbage collection " .
Gilad knows a lot about optimising dynamic languages .
He firmly believes that dynamic languages can run as fast as statically typed languages , the reasons that it does n't happen is that all the people who know enough about the subject are being paid to work on other things ( this is rocket science he says ) .
One of the things that Maciek emphasised in his talk was that you have more information for optimisation about a dynamic language at runtime than you do for optimising a statically typed program at compile time .
Now that Gilad has left Sun ( he is now working on a hush - hush project that involves creating a new language called Newspeak built on Smalltalk ) , he is happy to talk about the mistakes made with the JVM !
( Unfortunately the slides are n't available . )
His talk was full of great quotes , and it is a shame that I can't remember them all .
They include :
The problem with software is that you can add things , but you can't remove them .
So it bloats ( this is why his language is called Newspeak - in the book 1984 the language Newspeak was regularly revised to remove words ) .
Java has nine types of integer , and none of them do the right thing .
( C# is basically no better before .NET enthusiasts get excited . )
For example , ' Integer ' has a public constructor and you can create new ones for the same value that are n't equal to each other !
You do n't have auto promotion to big integers ( Python longs ) , so you still have to know in advance how big the results of your calculations are going to be .
The basic problem comes from having primitives that are n't ' objects ' and the consequent boxing and unboxing .
A decent JIT can apply optimisation without needing to have primitives that are n't objects .
Programs possible from languages with a static type system are a subset of all the programs that can be written .
For some people this is enough .
Do n't listen to your customer
Although it sounds like it , I do n't think he was knocking agile processes of involving customers in the design .
He was more saying do n't let your customers tell you how to do things .
Static type systems are an inherent security risk .
This last point is an interesting one , as security is one of the things that type - safety is supposed to be able to bring .
He explained it with a justification followed by a story :
Formalising real - world type systems is very difficult .
In order to formalise them , the authors of most type systems simplify them by making some assumptions .
In practise those assumptions turn out to be wrong .
Even if your formalisation is fully correct in theory , it is only safe if the implementation has no bugs ...
Gilad told the story of a bug in the Java Mobile Edition type verifier .
The byte - code has a ' jump ' instruction , and the two conditions for the jump instruction are that the target exists and that the type - state at source and target agree .
In Java ME , the type - state is tracked separately , and the type verifier only verified the type - state and forgot to verify that the target exists .
A Polish programmer discovered that he could construct bytecode that would pass verification but could jump into data .
He could then do things like overwrite the length of an array and effectively peek and poke into memory ( on a Nokia phone ) .
Using the type information in the operating system , he was then able to reverse engineer the whole Nokia operating system ...
Gilad thinks the answer is for everyone to use Smalltalk of course ( he also likes Self ) .
He is n't too polite about other languages :
On Ruby :
The performance is pathetic
On Python : I can't take seriously a language VM that uses reference counting
On Erlang and improving performance through concurrency : what Joe did n't say is that Erlang is n't exactly fast ...
Gilad 's latest blog entry on monkey - patching is well worth a read .
Jonathan and I are sort - of - quoted as ' the - pythoners ' .
Python 3 , Bytes and Source File Encoding
After PyCon
I stayed on for the sprints , spending most of the time with the core - Python guys .
Brett 's introduction to developing Python was very good .
I feel much more confident about tackling bugs now - from compiling Python , to creating and submitting a patch , to running the tests .
( Python 's test framework is awful in my opinion , but I think it 's getting better . )
It was great to renew friendships with people like Jack Diederich and Brett Cannon , plus make new friends ( despite what you may think from reading the mailing list , the Python - Dev guys are a friendly bunch ) .
On Monday I decided to help Trent Nelson , who bet Martin Lowis a beer he could get the buildbots green by the end of the sprints .
This was some challenge as at the time none of the 64bit Windows buildbots had built successfully , let alone gone green .
A problem that seemed easy was a failure in the tests for the tokenize module in Python 3 .
The problem , that we assumed would be a four line fix , was that generate_tokens was n't honouring the encoding declaration of Python source files .
In Python 3 , where string literals are Unicode , it meant that string literals would be incorrectly decoded .
I spent about a day and a half fixing it , a lot of it pairing with Trent on the work but some of it just under his watchful eye whilst he revamped the Windows build scripts and process .
generate_tokens has an odd API .
It takes a readline method as its argument , either from a file or the __next__ method of a generator so that the source you are tokenizing does n't have to come from the filesystem .
The problem is that if the file has been opened in text mode , then in Python 3 it will be decoded to unicode using the platform default .
On the Mac this is utf - 8 ( a nice sensible default ) , but on Windows it is ' cp - 1252 ' .
If the Python source file has an ' encoding cookie ' ( # coding = < latin - 1 > from pep-0263 or a utf - 8 bom ) then it will already have been ( possibly incorrectly ) decoded by the time we read the declaration .
I think this problem is fairly typical of moving from Python 2 to 3 .
If you save a text file with non-ascii characters on the Mac and then open it in text mode on Windows , it could well fail on Python 3 .
Even writing arbitrary text to a file could fail on Windows because the default encoding does n't have a representation for every Unicode code point .
Having Unicode strings is no panacea , you still have to know the encoding of your text files .
The answer for tokenize ( at least the answer we implemented ) , was to move it to a bytes API .
The readline method passed in to tokenize ( the new name for generate_tokens ) should return bytes instead of strings .
The correct encoding is then determined ( defaulting to utf - 8 ) and used to decode the source file .
The encoding declaration can be on the first line or the second , to allow for a shebang line .
The function we wrote to detect encoding may be useful if you ever have to work with Python source files .
Here 's a Python 2 compatible version :
import re
from codecs import lookup
cookie_re = re .
compile ( " coding [ : = ]\s *( [ - \w . ] + ) " )
def detect_encoding ( readline ) :
" " "
The detect_encoding ( ) function is used to detect the encoding that should
be used to decode a Python source file .
It requires one argument .
a
readline function .
It will call readline a maximum of twice , and return the encoding used
and a list of any lines it has read in .
It detects the encoding from the presence of a utf - 8 bom or an encoding
cookie as specified in pep-0263 .
If both a bom and a cookie are present ,
but disagree , a SyntaxError will be raised .
If no encoding is specified , then the default of ' utf - 8 ' will be returned .
" " "
utf8_bom = ' \xef\xbb\xbf '
bom_found = False
encoding = None
def read_or_stop ( ) :
try :
return readline ( )
except StopIteration :
return ''
def find_cookie ( line ) :
try :
line_string = line .
decode ( ' ascii ' )
except UnicodeDecodeError :
pass
else :
matches = cookie_re .
findall ( line_string )
if matches :
encoding = matches [ 0 ]
if bom_found and lookup ( encoding ) . name != ' utf - 8 ' :
raise SyntaxError ( ' encoding problem : utf - 8 ' )
return encoding
first = read_or_stop ( )
if first .
startswith ( utf8_bom ) :
bom_found = True
first = first [ 3 : ]
if not first :
return ' utf - 8 ' , [ ]
encoding = find_cookie ( first )
if encoding :
return encoding , [ first ]
second = read_or_stop ( )
if not second :
return ' utf - 8 ' , [ first ]
encoding = find_cookie ( second )
if encoding :
return encoding , [ first , second ]
return ' utf - 8 ' , [ first , second ]
Because the lines that have been read in still need to be tokenized , any lines that have been consumed by detect_encoding need to be ' buffered ' .
This is done using itertools .
chain :
encoding , consumed = detect_encoding ( readline )
def readline_generator ( ) :
while True :
try :
yield readline ( )
except StopIteration :
return
chained = chain ( consumed , readline_generator ( ) )
My first contribution to Python ( except for a couple of trivial patches ) .
As you can see from the check - in message , Trent was amused by my TDD approach to testing ...
The change may not survive into Python 3 in the wild , but working on it was very satisfying .
It was great to work a bit with Python 3 , particularly to understand the bytes / string / io changes .
The new nonlocal keyword is wicked , especially for testing .
On Wednesday I spent some time with Jerry Seutter fixing some tests for urllib2 so that they no longer do things like test for redirection by going to an external server that we know does a redirect !
That patch has n't yet been applied .
Trent got most of the buildbots green and the 64bit Windows boxes not only building but passing !
Not sure if he got the beer though ...
Fun at PyCon 2008
I really enjoyed PyCon .
It was great that the conference has grown so much but still has a real ' community ' feeling where you can stop and talk to people you do n't know .
Unfortunately the boss took ill at the last minute , which left Jonathan and I to man the Resolver Systems sponsor stand ( we had some good conversations in the exhibition hall ) and to do his talk .
We survived though , and being totally unprepared even enjoyed giving the talk together .
Even more problematic , Jonathan has a Linux laptop and I use a Mac - Giles was bringing the Windows laptop !
Resolver
One runs fine on my Macbook under Parallels , which acted as a great stand - in until Van Lindberg came to the rescue with a loan laptop .
( Many thanks Van ! )
This was a double rescue , as in an attempt to get his Linux laptop to work with a conference projector Jonathan managed to blow away his X - server configuration and could n't boot his laptop an hour before his talk on Test Driven Development .
I could n't find Jonathan before doing the Resolver Systems lightning talk though , so I did it from the Mac .
I did n't attend many talks in the end ( at least I do n't think I did - it 's all a bit of a blur ) , but my favourite was Raymond Hettinger on Core Python Containers ( which as it is specific to CPython was n't really relevant to me as I 'm spending most of my time buried deep inside IronPython these days ) .
As for the great ' sponsor controversy ' ... personally I did n't enjoy the sponsor keynote (s ? ) particularly , but not everyone agrees .
I 'm afraid that most of the lightning talks on Friday were pretty dull , but the ones on Saturday and Sunday were much better ( even the sponsor ones ) .
As usual the issue has been blown out of proportion , but the organisers are well aware of what worked and what did n't .
I think my talk went OK .
I dashed from the talk with Jonathan on ' End User Computing and Resolver One ' , straight into my ' Python in the Browser Talk ' .
Rather than having any time to prepare myself , Chris McAvoy introduced me as I walked into the room .
The audience was then treated to an undignified scramble as I tried to get my computer in a fit state to give the presentation .
The best part of the talk was showing the prototype ' Interactive Interpreter in the Browser ' right at the end .
This used some bugfixed IronPython binaries that Dino Viehland delivered to me the morning of my talk .
As if it was n't rushed enough already !
I think that once the updated binaries , the ' interpreter in the browser ' will be a great tool for teaching Python .
After the talk I gave a brief ( 7.5 minutes podcast ) interview with Dr Dobb 's Journal on Silverlight and IronPython .
There were many other highlights .
I talked to a lot of great folks , too numerous to mention all of them , including folks like Maciek of PyPy ( who I met at the SFI conference and will also be at RuPy ) :
And Dino the lead IronPython developer ( he gave me some great reasons why Resolver Systems should upgrade to IronPython 2 including improved performance and startup time ) :
His talk was amazing ( showing Django on IronPython using Silverlight ) .
In order to maintain feature parity with Jython Dino implemented from __future__ import GIL whilst I was watching !
I presented the Ironclad Overview at the ' Python and .NET ' Open Space organised by Feihong Hsu ( who gave a great talk on Python . NET ) :
After the Open Space a bunch of us went to downtown Chicago ( including Mahesh Prakriya who you can see lingering in the back of the picture above and Harry Pierson who would prefer I did n't call him the new commander - in - chief of dynamic languages at Microsoft ) .
We went up the John Hancock Tower which has an astonishing view of the city .
After this it was onto the sprints .
Jonathan and I went out with a crew of the ' Python - Dev ' guys to a Mexican restaurant .
Never have I seen an individual so excited to find good Mexican food !
Whilst hanging around in the Python - core sprint I got to meet Mark Hammond :
The sprinting was massively my favourite part of the whole event , and deserves a blog entry of its own ...
IronPython & Silverlight 2 Tutorial with Demos and Downloads
Instead of posting my PyCon talk slides , I 've turned them into a series of articles instead , which should be easier to follow .
All the examples are available online and for download .
This is everything you need to get started with IronPython and Silverlight 2 .
All the articles , demos and downloads can be found at : Voidspace IronPython and Silverlight Pages .
You can experiment online with the IronPython & Silverlight Web IDE .
There is also a prototype of my Interactive Python Interpreter in the Browser .
Due to a bug in the current Dynamic Silverlight binaries it can't handle indented blocks .
I expect Dino will be able to post fixed binaries soon .
If you want to help me make the Javascript cross - browser then get in touch !
( Currently it is safari only I think . )
The Articles
These articles will take you through everything you need to know to write Silverlight applications with IronPython :
Downloads & Online Examples
You can download several of the examples used in the articles :
The easiest way of experimenting with the Silverlight APIs is through the Web IDE :
The following downloads use C# :
One of the most exciting things about Silverlight 2 is the possibility of embedding an interactive interpreter inside web pages :

WASHINGTON  Senator John McCain ’s chief advertising strategist , Mark McKinnon , announced Tuesday that he was resigning , following through on a vow he had made months ago not to work against the candidacy of Senator Barack Obama .
His resignation follows the departures of five other aides in recent days because work they have done outside the campaign  as lobbyists for corporations and foreign nations , and , in one case , as a strategist for an independent political group  had presented conflict of interest issues .
In telling the Cox News Service last June that he would not work against an Obama candidacy , Mr. McKinnon had said that Mr. Obama ’s election to the presidency “ would send a great message to the country and the world . ”
In that interview , Mr. McKinnon had said that he had policy differences with Mr. Obama , especially on Iraq , and that he believed Mr. McCain was best suited for the presidency because of his national security positions .
But , he added , “ I just do n’t want to work against an Obama candidacy . ”
Mr. McKinnon ’s decision highlights challenges Mr. McCain may face in running against a man who will be the first black presidential candidate from a major American political party if he cinches the Democratic nomination .

Some University of Washington students , faculty and staff are being tracked as they move about the computer - science building , with details of where they ’ve been , and with whom , stored in a database .
Professor Gaetano Borriello checks a computer to find graduate student Evan Welbourne ’s last location : on the fourth floor , outside room 452 at 10:38 a.m. Wednesday .
He opens another screen to reveal the building ’s floor plan , and a blinking green dot representing Welbourne shows him walking down the hall .
If it seems a bit like Big Brother , that ’s the intention .
The project is meant to explore both positive and negative aspects of a world saturated with technology that can monitor people and objects remotely .
" What we want to understand , " Borriello said , " is what makes it useful , what makes it threatening and how to balance the two . "
The technology , radio frequency identification , or RFID , is rapidly moving into the real world through a wide variety of applications : Washington state driver ’s licenses , U.S. passports , clothing , payment cards , car keys and more .
The objects all have a tiny tag with a unique number that can be read from a distance .
Many experts predict that the radio tags , as an enhanced replacement for bar codes , will soon become ubiquitous .
Leaders of the UW ’s RFID Ecosystem project wanted to understand the implications of that shift before it happens .
They ’re conducting one of the largest experiments using wireless tags in a social setting .
" Our objective is to create a future world where RFID is everywhere and figure out problems we ’ll run into before we get there , " said Borriello , a computer science and engineering professor .
RFID has been used primarily to track goods in supply chains , and the RFID Ecosystem works as a kind of human warehouse .
For more than a year , a dozen researchers have carried around RFID tags equipped with tiny computer chips that store an identification number unique to each tag .
Researchers installed about 200 antennas throughout the computer - science building that pick up any tag near them every second .
The researchers hope to expand the project , funded by the National Science Foundation , to include participation by about 50 volunteers — people who regularly use the building .
Volunteers will have the option of removing their data at any point .
The system can show when people leave the office , when they return , how often they take breaks , where they go and who ’s meeting with whom , Borriello said .
The technology seems less intrusive than a camera , but it ’s much more precise .
It ’s a lot easier to fool a camera with a blurred image or disguise .
But the latest RFID tags contain a 96 - bit code meant to uniquely identify an object or person .
Yet if people do n’t see the tags , it ’s easy to forget they are giving out information whenever they come within range of a reader .
" One of the most surprising things is how invisible these tags can be , " said Welbourne , who stashed the paper - thin tags in his jacket and bag nine months ago and does n’t always remember he ’s carrying them .
" It ’s a risk for people .
I built part of the system , and I ’m caught off - guard . "
Lessons learned
UW researchers are gaining some valuable lessons on how to make the technology useful while protecting privacy .
Radio tags add a new dimension to social networking .
The key is allowing subjects to control who sees what information about them .
They created an application called RFIDDER that lets people use data from radio tags to inform their social network where they are and what they ’re doing .
The feature can be used on the Web and on a mobile phone , with a connection to the social - networking service Twitter .
Borriello can let Welbourne , the project ’s lead graduate student , see where he is all day , or he can modify settings so Welbourne can only see where he is within 15 minutes of their scheduled meeting .
The system is transparent , so each can tell if the other has checked his whereabouts .
The lab ’s Personal Digital Diary application detects and logs a person ’s activities each day and uploads them to a Google calendar .
Users can search the calendar to jog their memories about when they last saw someone or how , where and with whom they spent their time .
Potential pitfalls
Yet the UW researchers also recognize many potential privacy pitfalls .
Some systems , including new U.S. passports and driver ’s licenses , have been designed to divulge more information than necessary , opening the door to security and privacy problems , Borriello said .
Experts from the UW RFID team went to Olympia to testify on privacy issues related to the state ’s Enhanced Driver ’s License .
" There ’s no reason to have remotely readable technology in a driver ’s license , " Borriello said .
He recommends a system that requires contact with the surface of a reader , so the license - holder knows when information on his license is being read .
However , the U.S. Department of Homeland Security required states to use an RFID chip that is readable from a distance to be compatible with its REAL ID initiative .
Washington state went along so it could offer an optional Enhanced Driver ’s License as an alternative to a passport for residents crossing the Canadian border .
Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill last week that attempts to mitigate security and privacy concerns by making it a felony for unauthorized users to read or possess information on another person ’s identification document without that person ’s knowledge or consent .
Piecing a profile
Without the right safeguards , data from radio tags can be pieced together to offer a detailed profile of a person ’s habits without his or her knowledge .
" People do n’t understand the implications of information they ’re giving out , " Borriello said .
" They can be linked together to paint a picture , one you did n’t think you were painting . "
If someone carrying the new RFID - chipped driver ’s license visits a store that has an RFID reader and then uses a credit card , the store can start to form an association between the ID number and the credit - card number .
That information can be used to send targeted advertising messages to the customer , a scenario depicted in the film " Minority Report . "
A man is recognized as he walks by a store and given a personalized sales pitch .
RFID readers placed around shopping malls and airports could help government agencies collect information about visitors ’ travel patterns , shopping habits and relationships .
" People might think maybe it ’s a good thing .
Maybe it will make me safer , " Borriello said .
But he added , " You can see this inching forward until we ’re tracking people wherever they go . "
That might sound far - fetched , but it ’s going on in other parts of the world .
Last year , the number of police requests for information from London ’s RFID - based transit card rose from four per month to 100 , Borriello said .
Police use the data in criminal cases .
In southern China , the government is installing RFID readers throughout the city of Shenzhen to track movements of citizens , and U.S. companies are helping deploy the technology , The New York Times has reported .
Chips in national ID cards contain not just a number , but a person ’s work history , education , religion , ethnicity , police record and reproductive history .
" You could argue for any of this stuff in the name of security , " Borriello said .
" It ’s important to understand what the technology can do and we , collectively , have to decide what we ’re going to use it for . "
The lessons from the UW RFID project point to the need for consent and transparency , informing people what data are being collected and giving them a way to review , correct or delete it .
The technology alone ca n’t be made to do the right thing without a good system of laws and policies around it .
Protection lacking
So far , there are few such legal protections in the U.S. , Welbourne and Borriello say .
While RFID is relatively new , one technology with a potential to track people is well - established : cellphones .
" Most of us trust that information is not being tracked by anyone , but in fact it is , " Borriello said .
Large U.S. telecommunications companies are in the middle of a bitter dispute over their role assisting in government wiretapping , and whether they can be sued or be given legal immunity .
Right now RFID is following a typical technology cycle , moving from obscurity into popular usage .
The UW researchers are trying to stay ahead of that cycle .
" As soon as it becomes widely used , then it ’s more attractive and people start attacking it , " showing its vulnerabilities , Borriello said .
The trouble is " by that time , it ’s hard to change . "

RAMALLAH , West Bank 
The Palestinian West Bank , besieged by Israeli occupation , political division and weak leadership , got a boost on Monday : the announcement of a plan , led by the American government , to help tens of thousands of people buy homes .
The plan , which establishes a $ 500 million mortgage company , aims to build 10 new neighborhoods over the next five years and , in the process , create thousands of jobs in construction and real estate .
In doing so , it could improve the depressed local economy and the political prospects of the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , of the relatively pro-West Fatah party .
Mr. Abbas , who has been engaged in peace talks with Israel ’s prime minister , Ehud Olmert , will be in Washington next week to see President Bush , who hopes to have a Palestinian - Israeli peace outline before his term ends .
A secondary aim of the housing program is to send a message to the Gaza Strip , run by the Islamist party Hamas , that its citizens , too , could benefit from international generosity and economic progress if they restore Fatah ’s authority , overturned by Hamas forces in a battle last June .

PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama , trying for an upset in Pennsylvania 's pivotal April 22 primary , is hoping the Teamsters Union can help him reel in the state 's huge blue - collar vote .
Sen . Barack Obama speaks at a rally in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , in March .
Teamsters president Jim Hoffa , leading a convoy across Pennsylvania , told CNN that he believes the Illinois senator " can change this country . "
Obama , who has n't been doing well with blue - collar workers , took his own tour across Pennsylvania .
" I met folks in factories and on farms , in bars and bowling alleys , " Obama recently said .
Hoffa said voters desperately want change .
" There 's a despair out there that we can't change things , we 've been beaten down , " Hoffa said .
On Wednesday , the Teamsters convoy made its way to Reading , Pennsylvania , where the York Peppermint Patty factory is shutting down , moving more than 250 jobs to Mexico .
The target of the workers ' anger , according to Hoffa , is NAFTA .
" People remember Clinton and NAFTA , and I think when we talk about changing NAFTA , I think that Barack Obama has more credibility , " he said .
Obama is running as a Washington outsider , and he subtly reminds voters that he 's not part of that system .
" For over two decades , what we heard from the Bush administration is ... you 're on your own , " Obama has said .
But the two decades he refers to would include the Clinton years in The White House .
Obama is counting on his outsider appeal , more than his lifestyle , to break Clinton 's lock on blue - collar voters in Pennsylvania .
He reminds workers that when it comes to enjoying the gains of economic growth , they 're outsiders , too .

Technology is fulfilling several promises to date and has a lot many to offer in the future to make the world a better place .
It helped us become more intimate with the rest of the world , but the constant availability has led to a significant amount of reliability over machines .
The modern technology and economy of the world are intertwined ; any one of them can not be meddled with .
In a world that is at it ’s fastest pace of progress and growth , technology also keeps on advancing ; becoming an integral part of everybody ’s day to day lives .
The use of technology initially played the role of making lives more comfortable and effort saving , but stagnant misuse has raised the question of responsibility .
We are increasingly alienating from one another because of the dependency over technology for every essential thing .
Having a conversation face to face is not common anymore ; people are comforting themselves by masquerading behind the dais that social media has given them .
When comparing our generation with the older one , one can notice a significant difference because of the modern technology where the ball is in our court , but too many cooks spoil the broth .
When we talk global about technology , mechanization has relieved people of many manuals and challenging labor .
Proper use of medical techniques has also cured many diseases .
The modern means of technology has increased the possibilities of shaping the present and the future .
Technology is being used in various manners to facilitate organizations , it is being used to gather information , transferring data , organizing , processing and tracking records , etc .
Without technology dependency , most things today would create chaos but technology is not the silver spoon .
People think it gives us a quick fix for everything , but because of the natural solutions available , we often forget to put on the useful and essential efforts required .
It does n’t convey that it is impossible to live in an environment that supports the safe and responsible use of technology ; instead , it can be used to reinforce accountability and build a safe place to work .
Ethics of using technology are concerned with ethical and responsible conduct with legitimate motives and norms . , but now they also would face the wrath of technology of they try to control everything .
The emerging problem is to know if we can contain and control it or not .

( Oct 27 , 2019 ) A commercial charter operator Pure Salt installed a new digital era Bluetooth traps technology ( 200 self - resetting traps ) on the Indian / Mamuku island in Dusky Sound .
The company has also installed motion - sensing cameras to detect and observe pest behavior , which helped discover previously unknown kiwis on the island .
It would help monitor pest eradication , by sending a notification to a smartphone app every time a trap kills a pest and reminds users when to reset traps .
In 2012 , the island was declared pest - free .
Now it is clear that Saddam Hussein had no WMD , that al - Qaida has become stronger in Iraq , and that liberal democracy has failed to spread through the Middle East , one fallback justification for the Iraq invasion remains : it overthrew a murderous , fascist dictator .
Even if it went catastrophically wrong , runs the argument , the invasion had a good , liberal , humanitarian cause embedded in it .
In that sense , as Tony Blair often suggested , it was like the second world war .
Much of what the allies did between 1939 and 1945 - the blitz on German towns and cities , the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki - may have been morally questionable , but the ultimate war aim of overthrowing fascist regimes was irreproachable .
But was the second world war quite what we think it was ?
I have just read Human Smoke , by the American author Nicholson Baker .
It has caused controversy in the US , and will probably be the most hotly debated book of the year when it reaches Britain next month .
Essentially , Baker puts the pacifist case against the second world war .
I am not a pacifist and , therefore , do not accept it .
The historical evidence that Baker adduces is selective and sometimes unreliable : for example , Hugh ( later Viscount ) Trenchard , the founder of the RAF , is frequently quoted as though he were a figure of some importance which , by the 1940s , he was n't .
Baker 's account , however , reminds us that the war was not fought for humanitarian or democratic ends .
Britain fought Germany for the same reason it had always fought wars in Europe : to maintain the balance of power and prevent a single state dominating the continent .
America fought Japan to stop the growth of a powerful rival in the Pacific .
The book ends on December 31 1941 .
At that moment , he says , " most of the people who died in the second world war were still alive " .
They included nearly all victims of what we now call the Holocaust .
Did waging the war " help anyone who needed help " ?
Baker asks rhetorically , and gives his answer through a series of documentary snapshots .
But , historically , it 's the wrong question .
The war was n't supposed to " help " anybody .
The idea that wars can be " helpful " is a relatively new conceit .
The second world war was fought as an instrument of British and , later , American foreign policy .
To be sure , it started when Britain went to " Poland 's aid " .
As AJP Taylor pointed out in The Origins of the Second World War : " In 1938 , Czechoslovakia was betrayed .
In 1939 , Poland was saved .
Less than one hundred thousand Czechs died during the war .
Six and a half million Poles were killed .
Which was better - to be a betrayed Czech or a saved Pole ? "
Both countries , he might have added , were ultimately " liberated " from Hitler only to be handed over to Stalin .
We have given the second world war such a retrospective glow that many now believe that it was fought because Hitler was beastly to the Jews .
Yet at the time , almost nobody talked about the Jews .
Hitler 's intention to murder every Jew in occupied Europe was well corroborated by December 1942 .
In that month Rabbi Stephen Wise , head of the American Jewish Congress , presented President Roosevelt with a 20 - page dossier called Blueprint for Extermination .
The House of Commons stood for a minute 's silence after it heard of this " bestial policy " .
Yet nobody in authority gave more than a few minutes ' thought to how Jews could be saved .
Would the Holocaust have happened if there had been no war or if the western democracies had acted against Nazi Germany earlier ?
We can never know - though it is likely that , if Britain had made peace in 1940 after the fall of France , the Jews would have been sent to Madagascar .
What is certain is that the war prevented any concerted attempt at rescue .
Resources used to help Jews would be diverted from the war .
Any mass movement of refugees ran the risk of the Germans planting agents among them .
Oil supplies were too vital to Britain to risk upsetting Arabs by evacuating them to Palestine .
Any of the suggested swaps - Jews for German PoWs , for example - might suggest allied weakness .
Besides , why should the allies assist Hitler to rid Europe of Jewry ?
The best we could do , as Anthony Eden , the British foreign secretary , observed in 1944 , was to " hope that the German government will refrain from exterminating these unfortunate people " .
Once we were at war with Germany , we existed on a similar moral plane .
Baker records how the British , not the Germans , started the night bombing of civilian populations , and how Churchill would n't allow food relief to occupied Europe .
Towards the end of the war , Eden acceded to Soviet demands that Russians found in previously Nazi - controlled areas should be returned home , knowing full well that many of them would be shot .
" We can not afford to be sentimental about this , " he wrote to Churchill .
Because of our alliance with Stalin , our moral superiority by 1945 consisted almost entirely in our not having instigated the Holocaust .
But because we were indifferent , even that superiority was qualified .
Romanticising the second world war has led us into foreign policy traps ever since .
We look for new crusades against new Hitlers and new Mussolinis .
We yearn to cheer our young men into " good wars " , to fight once more against the simple badness of fascism .
Tony Blair thought he could detect a national interest in fighting Saddam because he was so anxious to emulate Churchill and defeat " evil " .
Hitler was monstrous and wicked ; but we fought him , not for that reason , but because he was trying to make his country a rival great power , using force where necessary .
Other leaders , including British and American , have pursued similar foreign policies .
As Taylor observed , there was nothing especially wrong with Hitler on the international stage except that he was a German .
Equally , there was nothing wrong with Saddam except that he was an Iraqi .
The difference between him in 2003 and Hitler in 1939 was that the latter posed a genuine threat and there was no need to quote liberal or humanitarian justifications .

In this week ’s issue of Newsweek , Republican Presidential candidate John McCain tried to reassure voters about his position on a potential war with Iran .
Michael Hirsh interviewed McCain and asked him if his Los Angeles speech last week was designed to quiet some voters ’ fears that he wants to lead the nation to war against Iran .
McCain answered , “ No , not so much .
I first said that in the 1990s , when I was n’t running for president .
I was trying to express my views that the veteran hates war more than anyone else , because they mourn the loss of a comrade and know the horrors of war firsthand .
I ’ll repeat this time after time — that armed conflict is the last option . ”
Ok , so John McCain wo n’t go to war with Iran , or will he ?
In his answer to the next Iranian related question , where he was asked if he would go to war should Iran not give its nuclear program , McCain said , “ Well , if I could not evade your question but put it in a more sensible form , I think we have to exhaust every possible option .
I think there are many options that are viable , including those in conversations I had with [ French President Nicolas ] Sarkozy and [ British Prime Minister Gordon ]
Brown on my recent trip to Europe , on a meaningful path to sanctions .
But I will also state unequivocally that we cannot afford to have Iran … acquire nuclear weapons because of the obvious consequences — proliferation in the region , the threat to the existence of Israel , etc . ”

So even if war is a last resort , he would n’t rule it out .
This was probably the prudent political answer , but I did n’t find it very comforting .
In fact the more I hear about John McCain , the more I am nervous about this man as commander in chief .
In some ways , he is more zealous than George W. Bush .
Bush ’s religion is evangelical , but McCain worships at the altar of the military .
Does anyone seriously thinking that attacking Iran , while Iraq and Afghanistan are in shambles is a good idea ?
Remember that Iran is at least a decade away from producing weapons , but yet , McCain is still willing to leave the military option out there .
Should n’t the nation be trying to win the wars that it ’s already involved in instead of starting new ones ?
I do n’t see how McCain is ever going to win this election by promising the American people more of something that they already do n’t want .
I realize that the GOP had to nominate someone , but John McCain seems like he would plunge this nation farther down the dark path that George W. Bush started us on .
America needs hope more than war .
If we give up our liberties and continue to fight unnecessary wars out of fear , then the terrorists have already won , because they will have made us change who we are as a nation .

There has been no consistency among the Du Pont family members in the spelling they have employed to write their name .
The correct variations in spelling the Du Pont name are as follows : Dupont , DuPont , du Pont , duPont , Du Pont , and du Pont de Nemours .
In English the second syllable is accented .
In French , neither syllable is accented .
The name has tended to be spelled du Pont for the family and Du Pont for business .
I decided for this article to standardize the spelling in line with this tendency .
A DYNASTY OF SATANIC ROYALTY
Sitting down to write about the du Pont 's reminded me of two other families .
Recently , John Coleman , a researcher on the elite , commented to me that when he had researched the Queen of Denmark he had discovered that the royal danish family was slipping away secretly from everyone and they were going to Satanic rituals .
It is also noteworthy that 5 modern kings of Denmark have been the leaders of Freemasonry in Denmark , and the Danish royal family , princes etc. have been active Masons .
John Dale wrote a book The Prince and The Paranormal which goes into the secret occult activities of the British royal family , especially Prince Charles , but also many other royal family members too .
Besides the secret occult activities of the British Monarch , they have been openly leaders of Freemasonry ( see the Appendix of Be Wise As Serpents for a detailed chart on this . )
The du Ponts are similar to these families in that they too are a dynasty , they too have a very public image , and they too have a totally hidden life .
In fact , the du Ponts have better control over the press 's coverage of them than the British Royal Family .
One of the clues that the family is a top Satanic family are the frequency of marriages between relatives of the du Pont descendants .
Few people are aware of the immense importance bloodlines play in the upper levels of Satanism .
Blood is believed to carry the occult power .
Unless a person has the correct blood he or she will not rise to the highest levels of Satanism .
The du Ponts have intermarried with the Balls and the Gardners .
These other families are known to be involved with the Illuminati and Satanism .
For instance George W. Ball is on the important permanent steering committee of the Bilderbergers and has attended the Bilderberger meetings that I know of starting with the original first meeting in 1954 , plus in 1955 , 1957 , 1963 , 1964 , 1966 , 1967 , 1968 , 1974 , 1975 .
George W. Ball is also a member of CFR and the Trilateral Commission .
Eliza Cazenove ( Gardner was a sister to a du Pont .
Dorsey Cazenove ( Gardner was a distant cousin .
Will Gardner and Bessie Gardner duPont were cousins of the duPonts .
John W. ( Gardner is a 60 Illuminatus and in charge of the Rockefeller Bros .
Fund .
I have found the ( Gardners in the thick of Satanism and witchcraft .
THE COMPLETE FACTS ARE DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER
At the library , I checked out a book Du Pont by William Dutton .
The book had been a gift to the library from the Du Pont Company .
I also checked out a book Alfred I. Du Pont by Joseph Frazier Wall .
That book 's author J. Wall was financed to write the book by the trustees of the Jessie Ball du Pont Fund .
Although scholarly in appearance , it is what they do n't say that can be so crucial to really understand the history of the du Pont family .
When a family is worth billions they can afford to tidy up their family histories , and keep people from spilling the beans about secrets .
On May 16 , 1893 the press reported the death of Alfred Victor du Pont with great laudatory comments .
Alfred ( known as Fred ) had been in business in Louisville , KT and was widely known in the area as a philanthropist .
Louisville 's main paper the Louisville Commercial gave the public a totally fictitious story about how Alfred Victor du Pont died , along with many pages of the highest praise .
If it had n't been for the honesty of the Enquirer ( a Cincinnati paper - not to be confused with today 's national tabloid by the same name Enquirer ) the public would not have learned what really had happened .
The false story ' said that Fred died of apoplexy while visiting his brother Biderman .
The duPont family still maintains this fiction is true , although all the facts of the case are blatantly known , and were public knowledge to quite a number of people whose lives were involved with what actually happened .
Both Fred du Pont and his nephew Coleman du Pont were regular customers at the most expensive house of prostitution in the area , Maggie Payne 's bordello .
Although rich , Fred was not willing to help support a distraught prostitute raise the child she was sure he had sired .
So she shot Fred in the heart .
Coleman du Pont , who was familiar with Maggie 's , soon went down to Maggie 's , retrieved the body with a hearse and took the body to Biderman 's house .
There the coroner was willing to lie on the death certificate that the death was caused by ' effusive apoplexy . '
It is most likely Coleman made that lie worth his effort .
Henry Watterson , editor of the Courier - Journal , although he later admitted he knew the real story of the murder , went ahead and printed the false story on behalf of the du Ponts .
This article starts out with this anecdote to make a point - the 13 top families do control the press - and are very sensitive to any negative publicity of any kind .
Not only are their Satanic activities deeply hidden , but even just the normal everyday sinfulness or human soap box drama of their lives is deeply hidden .
By the way , Coleman duPont , an extremely hedonistic man , is one of the duPonts I strongly suspect was into Satanism .
Further secrecy has been obtained by working through trusted proxies .
Today , a key proxy is the jew Irving Saul Shapiro .
The du Pont family is represented in a number of groups by Irving Saul Shapiro , who is on the Council of Foreign Relations .
Irving S. Shapiro is a key person who has been the go - between to coordinate the activities of the Rockefellers , the du Ponts , and the Watson families ( Watson family members who are 6° Illuminati are mentioned in the 1/1/93 newsletter .
Shapiro was a member of Carter 's Advisory Council on Japan - US .
Economic Relations , is a trustee of the University of Delaware , director of the Jewish Federation of Delaware , director of IBM ( which is a Watson - Rockefeller business ) , director of Citicorp ( Rothschilds and Rockefellers - headed in the past by 6° Illuminatus , CFR member , Bilderberger Walter Wristen ) , and the U.S. /U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council ( which Rockefeller plays a big part of ) .
Shapiro is or was director of Continental American Insurance Co. , International Business Machines ( under IBM ) .
Irving Saul Shapiro was chairman of the du Pont company .
BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING
The biographies of the du Pont family usually begin with the marriage of Samuel du Pont to Anne Alexandrine Montechanin in 1737 in Paris , France .
Although Anne was a Huguenot , she was a medium with the spirit world .
Anne came from an ancient noble family that lived in Burgandy , France .
It is quite possible that it was Anne 's bloodline that gave the Du ponts their occult power .
Anne 's bloodline may possibly tie in to the House of David .
At any rate , Samuel and Anne 's son was the first du Pont to rise to greatness , and the first du Pont that can be connected directly to the Illuminati .
Samuel and Anne 's son was Pierre Samuel du Pont .
Later Pierre Samuel added de Nemours to his name to prevent confusion between him and other French legislatures named Dupont .
Pierre Samuel du Pont was a genius .
Pierre 's mother taught him to be a medium with spirits , but early on Pierre had to deny it publicly .
His father Samuel could not understand the boy 's genius , such as his ability at age 12 to translate Greek and Latin at sight .
When Pierre 's mother died when he was 16 , be no longer had a parent in the family who could understand him , and after getting one of his frequent beatings from his father , he ran away , and was spared near starvation by his Uncle Pierre de Monchantin .
Initially , Pierre was a watchmaker , but within a short time he attracted the attention of several top Illuminati for his ability to write good tracts , and articles that advocated various economic and political views that they wanted promoted .
Pierre Joined the Freemasons , and at some point was illuminized , as most of the French lodges became .
Although Pierre went through severe financial difficulties after the French Revolution , be regularly made payments to Masonic organizations in France .
Besides being friends with all the famous Masons of the time , one Mason brother of his worthy of note is the french astronomer Lalande , who helped hide him during the revolution .
Someone very powerful protected Pierre Samuel during the French Revolution , this is hinted at by historian Pierre Jolly , although Jolly never gives his protector 's name .
I believe he was protected because DuPont was part of the Inner Satanic hierarchy .
He was also protected by the daughter of Swiss financier Jacques Necker .
This daughter was Madame Germalne de Staël .
The Madame was a close friend of Pierre Samuel and she operated a famous salon / cathouse .
Madame de Staël was nothing less than an intimate friend of St. Simon .
She shared his occult revolutionary ideas .
Henri de St. Simon was a student and friend of Jacques Rigomer - Bazin who was associated with the Inner circle of several occult - based revolutionary groups during Pierre du Pont 's time in France .
St. SImon was the author of The New Christianity which
foreshadowed the creation of international communism .
He also wrote in the early 1800s The Globe and The Reorganization of the European Community laying out ideas and plans for European unity .
In the early 1800's , the Saint - Simonians suggested in the early 1800's that the date 2000 be the target date for the New Order .
In order to rearrange the world into the New Order , a number of items and stages needed to occur .
Two canals - one through the Suez and one through Panama were needed they said to create " Interdependence " between the nations .
They also suggested a high dam on the Nile .
They suggested the technological transformation of the earth , and the biological creation of a new , androgynous humanoid .
( Androgynous beings are being produced in underground facilities - they are the small greys used to fly the saucers ! )
Progress would be brought about by a series of revolutions .
( Study from Fire in The Minds of Men by James H. Billington to understand how the occult fraternities have created all the revolutions since the French revolution . )
St. Simon , an Illuminatus , wanted to have a child with Madame de Stall which would become the anti-Christ .
It did n't happen , but anyway , it is significant that the person who personally intervened during the French Revolution and saved Pierre Samuel DuPont 's life was Madame de Staël .
Necker along with Lafayette would later loan DuPont large sums of money for him try out his schemes in business and in forming a communist society .
It 's interesting that the Physiocrats journal was Les Ephémérides du Citoyen The title has astrological occult undertones .
On Jan. 1 , 1769 Pierre Samuel DuPont took over the journal 's management .
He became a key leader in France advocating a new order .
Pierre Samuel DuPont believed in Plato 's idea of government which included a philosopher - king .
Pierre Samuel was deist .
He spoke of " God " but he meant nature 's deistic God , not a personal God .
He believed nature was a higher God than his mechanical deist " God " .
Notice , the Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence also wrote " nature 's God " .
This is because the deists like Jefferson and Du Pont believed Nature was the highest God .
The ambiguity of meaning has permitted people to think Jefferson was referring the Christian God in the Declaration of Independence .
It is a common occurrence that Christians assume that others who use words that they use , think like the Christians .
Even today , many New Agers have an easy task to snow Christians .
For instance they just say , " I believe in Christ . "
The Masonic reference book 10.000 Famous Freemasons put out by the Missouri Lodge of Research provides this about Pierre Samuel DuPont :
" When 23 he published two pamphlets on finances , which attracted the attention of the celebrated Quesnay .
He then expounded the doctrines of Quesnay 's school , " the physiocrats . "
Went to Poland in 1774 at the request of King Stanislaus - Augustus [ a Freemason ] to organize a general system of national education .
When Turgot became comptroller - general of French finances , DuPont was named inspector - general of commerce ....
He was recalled by Vergennes to assist in negotiating with England the treaty to accord independence to the U.S. in 1789 he was a member of the States .
General , but his reactionary views led to his imprisonment in 1792 ....
In 1799 he emigrated to the U.S. with his family , and at Jefferson 's request , started on a plan for national education in this country .
He returned to France in 1802 and was instrumental in promoting the treaty of 1803 , by which Louisiana was sold to the U.S. "
Pierre Samuel was a key figure in attempts to create a national education system in both Poland and the new U.S.
A national education system was a Masonic / illuminati goal to control education and take it out of the hands of sincere Christians .
Jefferson , who was a Grand Orient Mason of the famous Nine Sisters Lodge , and apparently a key Illuminatus , was a close friend of Pierre Samuel and was instrumental at several key points in Pierre Samuel 's life when he needed help .
Jefferson arranged for the first gunpowder order ( which was a government order ) when the Du Ponts went into the gunpowder business .
Benjamin Franklin , a key leader of several secret occult fraternal groups was also a close friend of Pierre Samuel .
When Benjamin Franklin arrived Dec. 1776 in France , one of the first people who sought out to visit with was Pierre Samuel DuPont .
During the next year after that , DuPont was a frequent visitor to Franklin 's residence in the village of Passy .
In 1783 , DuPont expected to sit with Franklin at the treaty table in Paris , but John Adams got the Americans to sign a treaty with Britain without France 's involvement .
Alexander Hamilton , whose role in the conspiracy is now known , was DuPont 's lawyer in the U.S .
THE NEXT GENERATION
During the second year of Pierre Samuel 's marriage to Made Le Dèe , Victor Made was born with the Marquis de Mirabeau as his godfather .
Victor Marie Du Pont ( 1767 -1827 ) was an aide - de-camp to Illuminatus Lafayette from 1789 - 1792 .
Whether Victor was a Mason in France before the family came to the United States in 1800 , I do not know .
Victor Marie DuPont soon got involved in Freemasonry in the United States after arriving .
The following are some of the highlights to his secret Masonic career according to Masonic records .
1808 - signed a masonic petition to create a lodge at Angelica , NY
1813 - joined Washington Lodge No. 1 of Delaware
1814 - joined Knights Templars of Wilmington , Del .
1819 - Grand Marshall of the Grand Lodge of Delaware ( also 1822 , 1823 , 1825 , 1827 )
1825 - Grand Treasurer of the Grand Lodge of Delaware
Pierre Samuel had two more sons - Paul François ( died at age 1 month ) , and Eleuthère lrénée .
Eleuthère lrénée followed his father 's steps in getting Illuminated .
Eleuthère lrénée was a prominent outspoken Jacobin .
THE JACOBINS
The Duc d'Orleans , Grand Master of the Grand Orient of France , that is head of all the French masons , along with two other key Masons Talleyrand and Mirabeau started the Jacobins .
According to the book The War of the Antichrist with the Church ( a book made from the lectures of George Dillon ) ( Dublin , Ireland : M.H. Gill & Son , 1885 ) where Dillon lectures on the French Revolution he states that both Talleyrand and Mirabeau were key Illuminati .
The name of the original lodge of the Jacobins was changed to Club Breton and then Jacobin Club .
The Jacobins were basically an illuminized type of Freemasonry .
The President of the Jacobin Club was the Freemason Georges Jacques Danton , who was a member of the famous and powerful Nine Sisters Lodge ( nine sisters or nine muses is what the Pleiades is called . )
Lafayette was a Jacobin , as well as the key players in the French Revolution .
A very secret body of 300 key Freemasons ruled France secretly during this period according to the Autobiography of Wolfe Tone ( pub. by R. Barry O'Brien , 1893 ) .
Robespierre , was both a Freemason and an illuminatus .
In fact , he was both a disciple of Weishaupt and Rousseau .
Prussian Baron Anacharsis Clootz was also a Freemason and illuminatus .
He also was a disciple of Weishaupt and understood better what Weishaupt was trying to accomplish .
If one studies what these men taught you will discover it is what was later known as Socialism and communism .
The original idea for all the French Revolution started with the Satanic hierarchy .
In Nov. 1793 , the true colors of this Satanic inspired business can be seen in the campaign against religion , where anyone who was a priest in France was killed , and the Illuminati posted one of Its motto's in public " Death is an eternal sleep . "
Eyewitnesses testify that Satan has a very detailed plan which he entrusts to his very select few at the top .
Much of what seems coincidence and unrelated is actually according to a yery clever ( diabolical ) plan .
Eleuthère lrénée Du Pont was a major printer for the Jacobins .
He was a convinced Deist and worshipped nature too .
A POWDERMAN BECOMES DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL BANK
Later in the United States , after successfully setting up the best gunpowder factory in the world , Eleuthère Irenée DuPont was selected along with his friend Nicholas Biddle to be a director of Hamilton 's creation the United States Bank .
Remember that Astor was also selected as a director of this " National " Bank .
The Mason Stephen Girard ( 1750 - 1831 ) , initiated into Masonry in 1788 in Charleston , S.C. , helped establish the second Bank of United States in 1816 and served as its director .
Girard had amassed a S9 millIon fortune by the time of his death .
He was born in France , and become a sea captain .
Where his money came from is somewhat of a mystery .
He gave large sums of his money to masonic charity .
EARLY YEARS IN AMERICA
On Jan. 3 , 1800 , the DuPont tribe arrived in the United States with grandiose plans .
Part of the plans were to create a new society .
While
Victor Marie and his father pursued grandiose schemes that tailed miserably , Eleuthère lrénée DuPont started a gunpowder business in Delaware .
Irénée 's success can be attributed to several factors :
The french government gave him top secret machinery and plans to produce the best gunpowder possible in that day .
It was state - of - the - art technology , and they supplied manpower to help get started .
The DuPonts had friends in various places that helped them in numerous ways , getting financing , business , land , etc .
Eleuthère lrénée DuPont was intelligent , worked very hard and worked with patience .
If he had n't had so many commendable qualities , then the Du Pont family may have sunk back in history , and another family taken their place .
A ROYAL DYNASTY
The DuPont 's are a dynasty of Kings .
They have been called Kings - and rightly so even if people have been unaware that they are a dynasty of Illuminati Kings .
I do not know which particular men have served during the Satanic rituals .
The family has always had a head of the family .
It may be that the most powerful DuPont may also secretly serve as the highest Satanist .
I do n't know who has been representing the family at the highest levels of secret Satanism ( I suspect or surmise it has not been the public head of the family in modern times ) , but I can list the public head of the family as it passed down through time :
Persons below years as head of family generation coming to America Pierre Samuel Dupont 1739 - 1817 first Eleuthère lrénée DuPont 1817 - 1834 second Alfred Victor DuPont 18341850 third Henry DuPont 1850 - 1889 third Henry A. DuPont 1889 - - fourth
These men had great authority over the tribe of duPonts .
The du Ponts had family council where even the women had voting rights .
The DuPonts , like the Rothschilds helped set up their children 's marriages , and many of the early ones were to cousins .
For instance , much to the delight of the duPonts , Sophie Madeleine du Pont married her cousin Samuel Prancis DuPont in 1833 .
( 2 of Sophie 's drawing occur later in this article . )
The family owned everything in common , and distributed according to needs and according to the contribution that each could give to the family business .
The James Bidderman , the son of Evelina DuPont Bidderman , went to France and his decedents would give the DuPonts a lineage in France .
One of the families that Intermarried and were close friends with the DuPonts was the Cazenoves family .
Both families were close friends with Thomas Jefferson and Albert Gallatin , I have concluded that both Thomas Jefferson and Albert Gallatin were Illuminati .
Further , I discovered in a forty volume set on American Statesmen in vol.
13 , p.386 that Albert Gallatin claimed to be descended from the ancient Roman Consul Callatinus .
Incredible as it may seem , the black nobility have kept track of their bloodlines .
The same people ruling the world today are in many ways the descendants of the rulers in past ages .
Antoine Charles Cazenove , born in Geneva , Sw. was a business partner with Albert Gallatin .
During the War of 1812 , the DuPont gunpowder factory since it was the primary American powder company was the known target for the British to destroy .
However , the British never attacked it .
The Du Ponts had organized a local militia called the Brandywine Rangers .
Interestingly , their militia flag was a beehive on white silk .
Lafayette visited the DuPonts in Delaware the summer of 1825 .
Another important Mason who would visit the DuPonts was Henry Clay who was the American Secretary of State and head of the whig party .
Henry Clay was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky and GranD Orator for the G.L. 1806 -09 .
He was one of the Freemasons involved in a high level meeting that used the U.S. Senate Chambers on Mar. 9 , 1822 for their meeting .
If the duPonts were already one of the primary top families , it may well be Clay was coming to them for guidance on how to steer the nation .
The duPonts played a role too in the building of the American capital , which was laid out and constructed with numerous occult patterns .
THE NEXT GENERATION - Pierre Samuel 's grandchildren
Eleuthère lrénée du Pont had a daughter Sophie Madeleine du Pont ( 1810 - 1888 ) .
Sophie was also her mothers name .
Sophie Madeleine du Pont ( her name Sophie / Sophia is popular with Moriah ) wrote diaries , journal voluminous correspondence .
Sophie also drew hundreds are drawings and sketches , many of them charactures of people .
Of her sketches , this article reproduces two of them which bear importance to this newsletter .
The first is a drawing by Sophie du Pont of one of the duPonts dressed up like Satan with long paper horns and a tail .
Interestingly , according to a 12/12/1829 letter by Sophie to one of her relatives Sophie comments that the costume of Satan was mistaken " for Old Nick . "
( See the article on Saturn in this newsletter for evidence of the connection between Satan and Santa . )
The next drawing is a drawing that went with a letter from Sophie to Clementina Smith , 21 July 1837 which is a self - portrait of what Sophie calls " blackies " ( black servants ) who " toted " ( carried ) her to her bath in a special chair .
This drawing is included to show how wealthy the DuPonts were within a short time after coming to Delaware , U.S.A .
Alfred Victor DuPont , who took over as head of both the family and the factories making gunpowder , was married to Meta .
Meta was into Swedenborgianism , which was a type of mystical religious Freemasonry , that was based on the swedish mason Swedenborg 's teachings .
Alfred Victor apparently did n't feel anything negative toward this .
His wife Meta organized a Swedenborg church in town .
Around the CIvil War times , the DuPonts became less identified with Deism and more Identified with the Episcopal church .
Joanna Smith DuPont was Instrumental in this change .
One of the families that the DuPonts would marry with was the Cazenoves , who were Episcopalians , and some members were I suspect involved with the Illuminati .
Christ Church was built off the DuPont communal property for Episcopal services .
By the Civil War , the state of Delaware was lock - stock - and - barrel under the control of the DuPonts and their friends the Bayards , the Saulsburys , and the Greys , in this 20th century , the DuPonts have gotten firmer control .
Because the state of Delaware is controlled by the DuPonts , et. al , it is worthwhile to examine some of the people the DuPonts and their elite friends have placed into office .
This is a very unfinished skimpy list , I have done only a little research in this direction .
GOVERNORS OF DELAWARE ( chronological order ) John Collins ( Gov. 1819 - 1822 ) - Collin's family
Caleb P. Bennett ( Gov. 1832-1836 ) - Freemason
Thomas Stockton ( Gov. 1844 -?? ) - high ranking Freemason
Charles C. Stockley ( Gov. 1883 - 87 ) - Freemason
BenjaminT . Briggs ( Gov.1 887-1891 ) - Freemason
Pierre Samuel duPont , IV ( 1977 - ) - also U.S.Representative , and other gov . positions U. S. SENATORS OF DELAWARE ( alphabetical order of surnames ) T.Coleman duPont ( Sen.1 921-192 ? )
Henry A. DuPont ( Sen.1 895-1896 ) ( 1906 - 1916 )
In 1896 , the U.S. Senate rejected his election and therefore Henry duPont 's credentials due to proof of voter fraud .
Delaware legislature ( republican ) replaced Henry ( a republican ) with a democrat .
But in 1899 when the Senate seat became available and another one in 1901 too they could not come to any agreement on a selection of a Senator because Henry A. DuPont and John Edwards O'Sullivan Addicks the two republican leaders were fighting so much .
Consequently in 1899 Delaware only had one U.S. Senator and from 1901 to 1903 Delaware had no U.S.Senators .
L.H eislerB all ( 190345,1 919 - 25 ) also served Del.as state treasurer - Freemason .
James H. Hughes ( Sen. 1937 -42 ) - Freemason , also was Del. Sec. of State
Richard R. Kenney ( Sen. 1897 - 1901 ) , Freemason , also adj .
general of Del .
Arnold Naudain ( Sen. 1830 - 36 ) , Freemason , Grand Master of the G.L. of Del. , also state senator ( ‘36 - 39 )
John G. Townsend ( Sen. 1929 - 42 ) , Freemason , banker , alternate delegate to the U.N. General Assembly in 1946 .
James M. Tunnell ( Sen. 1941 - 47 ) , Freemason , 32° , also lawyer
John Wales ( Sen. 1849 -51 ) , Freemason , Pres. of Nat. Bank of Wilmington and Brandywine , sec. of state of Del. 1845 - 49 .
William V. Roth .
Jr. ( Sen. 1971 - ) CFR , Trilateral Commission , also on the Rep. Nat. Comm .
The DuPont gunpowder factories dominated the industry .
Within only a short time after getting started in 1802 they had the best quality gunpowder in the world for the general market .
Every war the United States has fought starting in 1802 with the war against Tripoli ( today Ubya ) and the Barbary Pirates until the incursion Into Somolia this last year the American military has depended upon DuPont gunpowder .
Henry du Pont ( 1812 - 1889 ) took over command of the gunpowder manufacturing when he was thirty - eight .
He was very authoritarian and was known as Boss Henry .
His narrow - minded , backward and authoritarian thinking ran the DuPont company into the ground in spite of their control of the gunpowder market .
When he died , Alfred I. duPont , Pierre Samuel du Pont II ( 1870 - 1954 ) , and Thomas Coleman du Pont ( 1863-1930 ) took over various DuPont manufacturing affairs .
This triumvirate revived the aging Du Pont factories .
They bought out the rest of the gunpowder manufacturers , giving them an absolute monopoly in the munitions industry .
They modernized the DuPont factories and put the DuPont businesses back Into top shape .
On August 22 , 1857 the du Ponts lost their first family member to an explosion , Alexis duPont .
The duPonts had always beea in the forefront on safety at their gunpowder factories , but that did not prevent them from having to suffer repeated explosions over the years .
An explosion at a gunpowder factory is easily set off and very deadly .
The tutor that was hired in 1852 to tutor the DuPont children , R. Page Williamson , described in his letters to Virginia that the duPont children were very spoiled and difficult to work with .
In 1872 , Henry duPont brought together Laflin & Rand and Hazard Powder Co. in order to form a Gun Powder Trade Association .
What the Association did was to eliminate competition between the three largest manufacturers of gunpowder , and create a monopoly for this cartel .
Eventually DuPont bought out the other two plus numerous other small gunpowder companies .
I suggest that everyone who believes that the DuPonts and the rest of the elite are capitalists , should take another look at history .
These men do not believe in capitalism , they believe in monopolies - which boils down to the same thing that occurs under communism .
When these people described their setting up a monopoly they call it " bringing order and stability to a fragmented and chaotic industry . "
In 1889 , Alfred I. du Pont attempted to bribe French officers in charge of the production of smokeless gunpowder to give the secrets to him .
But no amount of bribe would work , as the Frenchmen knew they would lose thefr lives if they gave the secrets to him .
The British were not any more helpful .
Ufe was not all peaches and cream .
Fred was murdered .
William du Pont ( 1855 - 1928 ) was trapped in a marriage with a duPont cousin , May du Pont , that he dit n't want to be married to .
Louis Cazenove du Pout a handsome , intelligent young - committed suicide with a bullet in the library at the Wilmington Club .
Alfred was shot in the face by accident on a hunting trip .
The duPont family had their share of heartaches , broken marriages , insanity , etc .
When Mary Belin married into the family she brought some Jewish blood .
As a major part of the budding military industrial complex the DuPonts during the 19th century had to work with the army and navy .
The army and navy convinced them to Implement a contract with the Coopal Co. in Belgium for smokeless powder , which when the formula was received was found to be inferior to what the American were already producing .
However , this whole episode ended with the DuPonts going with their own formula and setting up a new plant at Carney 's Point , New Jersey .
This hits the highlights of the family history in their first 100 years in this nation .
To celebrate their first hundred years , every living descendent of the first Pierre Samuel was invited to a great banquet .
A building was built to house them .
They numbered over 100 .
At each person 's table setting was a special gift of a gold coin , prepared especially to commemorate this centennial .
On Jan. 1 , 1900 , the DuPont tribe celebrated .
The DuPonts are shrouded in so much secrecy , that their secrecy is not even known .
When Eugene DuPont , the chief executive of the family gunpowder / high explosive business died near the turn of the century , none of the other DuPonts hardly even a vague idea of how much the company was worth or what assets it had .
At that time the DuPonts had powder plants in PA , DEL , Iowa , and TN .
The DuPonts are much the same today , except that their assets are perhaps ten times better hidden , not only from outsiders but from themselves .
The DuPonts have in general made their money the hard way - by working and producing , in contrast to the other top families .
The DuPonts are to be commended on this , even
If at times they have been very tight on what they have given their workers .
The DuPonts have also shown an amazing ability to keep their dynasty alive .
There seems to be an increasing invisibility to their family .
HITTING PAYDIRT
One of the people who bad been Involved for a short time with the Illuminati , and is now a Christian told me that they could remember the name The Society of the Cincinnati and that they knew nothing about the organization , but that it had something to do with the Illuminati .
But what is this organization ?
Without anything but the name I began my investigation .
At first look it seemed like some old ladles genealogy group who are descendents of revolutionary soldiers .
However , as I carried out what promised to be a long term research project on the Society it began to appear that something big was behind this organization .
One reference stated , " The Society of the Cincinnati # 1783 # it is likely that no Englishman feels a greater sense of pride in being a Knight of the Garter , or Scotsman , a Knight of the Thistle , than an American feels in being a member of The Society of the Cincinnati . "
WOW .
DOUBLE WOW !
Here is an organization that essentially no one I know has even heard about , and yet an American would feel a great sense of pride in belonging to it .
Interesting .
Not only that , but I knew what the Order of the Garter is !!
The Order of the Garter is the secret inner group which is an elite group within the Order of St. John of Jerusalem which is the British part of the Knights of Malta .
The Knights of the Garter are the leaders of the Committee of 300 .
They are diabolical men .
Lord Peter Carrington , who is a member of the satanic Order of Osiris and other demonic groups is a member of the Order of the Garter .
Lord Palmerston is an example from history of another similar example of a Knight of the Garter who was totally corrupt , pretended to be a Christian , and practiced Satanism .
I found out that the Massachusetts legislature had had some of its senators and representatives concerned for the welfare and safety of the United States , because , according to testimony on record , the Society of Cincinnati was " the beginning of a hereditary aristocracy in the U.S. dedicated to subverting the Republic . "
The Massachusetts Legislature declared the Society of the Cincinnati " dangerous . "
And yet speaking for the public for all the legislators trouble , the truth is nobody has even heard of the Society of the Cincinnati , let alone known or guessed it was dangerous .
When the United States was created it operated under the Articles of Confederation .
It was a confederation of Independent states - each of the states printed their - money , passed their own laws , etc .
The federal government was simply a League of Nations - type body .
The Society of the Cincinnati was partly responsible for getting that changed .
The Society of Cincinnati favored a very strong central government , a national bank , etc . The Freemason Baron von Steuben is credited with starting the organization .
The Mason Pierre L'Enfant who designed the CIty of Washington with its hidden occult symbols also designed the logo for the Society of the Cincinnati .
Every president of the United States has worn the Diamond Eagle jewell of the Society of the Cincinnati .
Wow .
And I had n't even heard about it until I got this tip from this ex-illuminatus .
Benjamin Franklin was an honorary member .
The Marquis de Lafayette was a member .
George Washington and James Monroe were Original Members .
At least 15 Presidents have been honorary members .
Pres. Franklin Pierce and Zachery Taylor ( his father was an Original Member ) were hereditary members .
Many of the high ranking Masons who were also officers in the Revolution were Original Members .
Three prominent Freemasons who were big in the Society of the Cincinnati were Henry Beekman Livingston ( 1750 - 1831 ) , James Mann ( 1759 - 1832 ) , and Hardy Murfee ( 1752-1809 ) .
Hardy served as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina beginning in 1789 .
I noticed that many very busy elite People were spending a lot of money and time on this Society , whatever its purpose was .
The Society had a museum , and a headquarters building in Washington , D.C. on Massachusetts Ave , N.W. , and state chapters .
But why ?
The stated purpose of the organization dit n't seem to explain the interest people put into the organization .
Why spend time belonging to an organization whose only purpose is to commemorate the fact that all Its members are descendents of Revolutionary War officers ?
The purpose of the organization is " To render permanent the cordial affection subsisting among the officers . "
O.K . I can understand a group of officers who are all veterens of a war getting together .
But their descendents ?
We are talking about a war whose fighting basically ended in 1781 .
That 's over 200 years ago .
Would my busy descendents care to visit with some other Vietnam vets ' great - great - great grandchildren 200 years from now ?
Yet , my 1983 World Almanac ( which lists in fine print about 1,300 associations ) gives the membership of the Society of the Cincinnati at 2,800 .
Other sources indicated that the organization had an affiliate organization in France .
But how ?
How could an organization which was open to only descendents of select Revolutionary Officers be so Identical in purpose to something in France for frenchmen ?
I could understand why , but only If the stated purposes were not the whole story .
As you can see I was very suspicious of the Society of the Cincinnati , it appears I had stumbled onto something big .
But I had n't been able to tie the Society in with the Illuminati - until I stepped up my research on the duPonts .
The tie - in between the Illuminati and the Society of the Cincinnati came when I began investigating what I thought might turn out to be an obscure Person .
His name was Leighton Coleman ( 1837 - 19 ? ? ) and he was married to Francis ( Fanny ) Elizabeth , daughter of Alexis Irenée du Pont ( 1816 - 57 ) .
Alexis died in an accident .
Occult bloodline power can pass through women or men , so it was worth it to investigate Leighton Coleman .
Leighton Coleman turned out to be the Bishop of the State of Delaware for the Episcopal Church .
He was a prime mover in the temperence movement ( which I had already discovered was Illuminati controlled ) .
Further Leighton was grand chaplain of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons in Pennslyvannia , Grand Prelate of the Knights Templar , and chaplain of the Delaware Society of the Cincinnati .
Another of the top 13 Illuminati families is the Kennedy family .
There is a connection to the Society of the Cincinatti with this family too .
Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis ( ex - wife to both J.F.K. and Aristotie Onassis ) had a grandfather named Major Bouvier , who invented a family genealogy which was mostly fiction which was self - published in 1925 as Our Forebears , but tbe fantasy Bouvier genealogy allowed him and his sons Bud and Black Jack to get into The Society of the Cincinnati .
( see A Woman Named Jackie , by C. David Heymann , p. 18 )
All three Bouviers were very proud of their memberships and would proudly display their boutonnieres on their labels showing membership .
THE THREE COUSINS THAT SAVED THE DUPONT COMPANY IN 1902
The successful three Du Ponts , Alfred , Coleman , and Pierre that together took over the gunpowder factories ended up in some serious infighting after a few years .
Alfred divorced his wife to marry his cousin , and the Coleman and many of the others did not approve of the marriage .
Alfred and the others got Into some serious family infighting .
In 1913 , Alfred at one point letting his rage get the better of him , got the Delaware legislature to pass a special law changing his first wife 's sons name to spite his first wife .
The special law passed the House in four hours secretly at Alfred 's request but failed by two votes in the Senate after the other Du Ponts found out what Alfred was trying .
Alfred built his cousin - wife Alicia the most expensive house on the east coast .
In 1910 dollars , the lowest estimate is $ 2 million , but the actual cost may easily have been several times that .
The name of the mansion was named Nemours .
The main grounds of the Nemours estate are 400 acres enclosed by an 9 - ft. wall .
Broken glass was embedded in the concrete on top of the wall .
Beyond the 400 are 2,000 acreas that make up the estate .
From 1906 until 1920 , the du Pont family broke up into two factions that waged a civil war in various arenas .
Alfred I. DuPont led a political campaign that fought the corruption of Coleman DuPont 's forces .
Up to that time politics and voting .
and vote counting were totally corrupt .
By April , 1918 Alfred had defeated Coleman for control of Delaware 's politics .
In 1911 , Alfred bought the principle daily paper in the area the Wilmington Morning News .
In 1916 , after successfully blocking his uncle Henry A. duPont from being reelected , Alfred duPont bought control of 9 Delaware newspapers .
in 1932 , on a trip to Egypt Alfred found a dog be named Mummy that was his familiar spirit .
In the biography about Alfred which I read it said , " Alfred had scored over his sister Marguerite .
Let her collect Virginia ghosts if she wanted them .
Only he had a reincarnated Egyptian mascot who could produce wonders as great as those of Aladdin 's genie . "
( Alfred Du Pont by Joseph F. Wail , p. 593 ) Alfred L du Pont himself wrote this in a letter to the Rev. Baker P. Lee ( 23 May ‘ 32 ) about his familiar spirit , " I have one or two more jobs for Mummy and then I will give her a vacation before I put her to work again . "
( He wrote at least one other letter where he talks about the magical powers of his dog .
which was his familiar spirit .
Mrs. Cazenove Lee , Jr. got a letter mentioning Mummy 's powers too . )
Alfred died in 1935 .
Ed Bali and Jessie Ball du Pont ( his widow ) took over control of his estate .
Ed Bail increased the Alfred I. duPont 's fortune and became the most powerful man in Florida .
Ed Bali's wealth passed the Billion dollar mark in the 50s or 60s .
In the late 1960s , political enemies were able to attack the wealth of Ed Ball with new legislation and some investigation of the misuse of his money hidden in the foundations .
In 1981 , Ed Bail died .
in 1985 , Ed Ball 's widow claimed that Ed's sister Jessie had actually murdered Alfred I. duPont in 1935 .
She claimed that while Ed was alive she had been too afraid to tell the truth about Alfred 's murder .
Forbes magazine carried the story in Oct. , 1965 .
T. Coleman duPont , went in business with President Taft 's brother Charles P. ( member of the Skull & Bones ) in 1910 to build McAlpin Hotel in New York City .
( Taft 's other brother Horace was a member of the Order of Skull and Bones .
In fact , the Taft family which dates back to Braintree Mass . in 1679 , helped start the Skull & Bones Order and at least eight Tafts have been in the Order . )
This was the first of a series of luxury hotels .
Coleman bought New York Equitable Life Assurance Society , which was America 's largest insurance company .
N.Y. Equitable Life Assurance company undoubtedly brought Coleman in touch with other Illuminati elite .
He belonged to the Rittenhouse in Philadelphia .
He was the director of a number of things including the Union National Bank , in Wilmington and the pres. of Central Coal & Iron Co. along with a few other coal and Iron companies .
T. Coleman has been mentioned already in connection to the Du Pont Gunpowder Business , which he ran for a number of years as head honcho .
During W.W. 1 , the Du Ponts made a mint .
The company had $ 9 million surplus in its treasury .
The result was that Du Pont absorbed General Motors .
The DuPonts also went Into the chemical business .
The american government had seized the German Dye Trust , and the DuPonts were given their patents .
The Du Ponts began to build a great chemical empire on the synthetic , such as shatterproof glass , paints , rayon , nylon , dyes , photographic flim , rubber , chemicals , drugs , etc .
Only the Dow Chemical Company is any competition with the DuPont chemical operation .
Alfred Victor duPont ( Alfred I.'s son ) served only as a private in the marines during W.W. I and was on board several ships .
And yet for some reason when W.W. 11 broke out , he was made a consultant to the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1943 to 1945 .
He was an Episcopalian .
Emile Francis duPont ( 1898 - ) graduated from Yale , like a number of duPonts have .
He was important lay person within the Episcopal church .
Pierre Samuel duPont belonged to the American Philosophical Society .
He also wears the rosette of an Officier de Ia Légion d' Honneur .
( How or why he got this I have n't found out . )
He was on Delaware 's State Board of Education , 1919 - 21 .
He was the President of General Motors from 1920 - 23 when he turned it over to Alfred P. Sloan , Jr. Pierre Samuel started what is called " the buddy system " where DuPont and GM 's management worked together .
DuPont saved GM from extinction after W.W.I and has watched over GM since .
Robert L duPont , Jr. is a research psychiatrist .
He has done research at Harvard .
He was the delegate for the US . at United Nations Commislon on Narcotic drugs ( 1973 - 78 ) .
He is especially knowledgeable about what drugs will do to a person , which le an area of his research .
And Francis Marguerite du Pont ( born 1944 in Duluth , Minn. ) is deep into research into genetics .
Those of us , who know what these people want to do , cringe when we see that some of the top genetic researchers are connected with Satanic families .
Every American almost everyday uses a Du Pont product .
When I began learning what the DuPont industries produce it is utterly astonishing .
Anything that involves chemicals is under their production .
Herbivores and fertilizers for farming .
cosmetics and nylons for women , chemicals for all types of industrial production , textiles of all kinds , cleaning fluids such as when you clothes are dry cleaned .
The list can go on and on .
Most of us are using DuPont products almost continuously all through the day !
General Motors , the explosives and gunpowder monopoly , the chemical monopoly ( which its tens of thousands of products ) gives the duPonts enormous financial leverage .
The DuPonts obviously are in close cooperation with the elite involved with oil - because so many of their products are derivatives of petroleum products .
In 1940 , it was estimated the duPont family was worth $ 5 billion .
Today , their total worth must be many billions of dollars , not to mention the enormous power they wield .
The very survival of the United States military is dependent upon the military products of the DuPonts .
THE DUPONT COMPANY USED AS A TOOL TO BRING US INTO THE NEW ORDER
Although the DuPont companies - the principle DuPont company is E.L. DuPont De Nemours & Co ( whose 1991 revenues were $ 38.7 billion ) - are run by many executives who are not duPonts , the duPont family does quietly pull the strings in the background .
Many of the executives are men whose philosophy of life matches the duPonts .
It is very clear that the DuPont companies are being used in a big way to move us toward the New World Order .
The first item on this , concerns how the Du Pont workers are being Indoctrinated .
I received a video of the Pecos River Training near Santa Fe , N.M. that DuPont workers in the east are sent to .
I also looked at a magazine article about this training ( indoctrination ) in the article " Go Take A Flying Leap ( for the company ) " ( Successful Meetings June 1992 , pp.59 - 62 ) .
A christian brother who works for the DuPonts in Tennessee has been secretly undermining the efforts of the DuPont company leaders to turn the workers into New Agers .
With the help of Christians in the plant , this Christian brother finds out what is planned , and then does his homework so that he can proof to the workers how New Age ideas are being brought in to subvert their thinking .
The company changed from calling all its people " employees " to calling them initiates .
The people at the plant were to all be sent to the Pecos River Training by DuPont , but due to the exposure of their New Age subversion , people are not allowing themselves to be led by the nose .
This brother sent me a video of the Pecos River Training .
and there are scenes in it where " strangers " are kissing each other - well , not exactly strangers because the training is designed to break down individuality and to create a group think with intimacy .
Initiates are taught , , do n't slay the ego , ego is your servant . "
Another magazine article in ( June 1992 , p15 - 16 ) tells about the five type of thinking that the DuPont company is trying to instill in their people .
They are 1 . lateral thinking ; 2 . metaphoric thinking ; 3 . posItive thinking ( this is also called visualization - or in the occult witchcraft ) ; 4 . assocIation trigger ; 5 . rapturing and interpreting dreams .
An employee environmental awards program was installed where employees can win money by submitting their environmental suggestions .
( Personal Journal Aug. , 92 , pp 60 - 71 . )
Many of the readers of this newsletter are already aware of how the environmental issue is contrived and controlled by the elite .
One of the items our new - age Dept. of Education secretary Alexander tried to get going was for education to shift from the schools to the factories .
This is a process that the Illuminati want to implement to further take us into a total slave state .
Interestingly , DuPont has been getting into the act by spearheading Delaware 's BRT task force , in which students will attend seminars at Du Pont facilities .
The DuPont company is employing A.A. - that is artificial intelligence .
The neural networks are to the point they can learn from their mistakes .
DuPont is taking us into Brave New World .
They were the first ones to initiate with Fax NOW a rapid customer service called fax - on - demand .
Du Pont is now in the process of becoming totally global .
They already have plants in a number of South American countries , Mexico , Canada , US. , Korea , Japan ; and several European nations .
They have been trying to figure out how to enter the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS - what used to be USSR ) .
Apparently , they lost some money already in that regards .
The ICI ( Imperial Chemical Industries - which is allied with the Warburg family ) in England and DuPont swapped plants .
Imperial Chemical Industries has had their headquarters in Wilmington , Del for some time before this swap .
DuPont got ICI nylon plant , and ICI got DuPont acrylic plant in the states .
Why ?
So both companies could become more international .
Or in the words of someone else to " focus resources on businesses where each can develop stronger global positions . "
( See Economist , 10/3/,92 , p.76 )
The swap will give DuPont 43 % of the European market for nylon fibers used to manufacture carpets .
Dupont has built a $ 20 - million research center in Bad Homburg , Ger. DuPont has been spending according to a recent article $ 1.27 billion on research .
Some of Du Pont 's research la in " risky " areas , that means that it is difficult to see how the research can financially benefit the company .
This has been admitted by the company .
The Aviation Week and Space Technology , 10/26/92 issue , p. 64,66 talks about the sophisticated composite materials that DuPont is producing for state of the art space and aviation vehicles .
( I Imagine some of these composite materials are finding there way to the secret UFO bases , and DuPont may well be producing some of the parts for these secret anti-gravity machines .
The article states that Boeing Defense and Space Group , Lockhead Aeronautical Systems Co. , General Dynamics and DuPont and Hercules , Inc. are working together on aeronautics projects .
Boeing and Lockhead are definitely involved with the production of flying saucers , so this may be a good due that DuPont is too .
The article states that DuPont has been a leading supplier for advanced US military programs .
An example of the sophisticated materials that the DuPonts are producing is XTC ; the first recyclable , class - A finish thermoplastic sheet molding compound for horizontal exterior body panels .
It is a flexible , porous ; interwoven sheet of polyethylene berephthalate - impregnated long - glass fiber .
General Motors ( DuPonts ) selected the material for use on their air - intake manifold on certain 1993 V - 6 engines ( Modern Plastics . " , Automotive Show Features Lots of Toughened Materials " , by Stuart A. Wood , April 1992 issue , pp 66 - 69 . )
The CEO of E.l. du Pont de Nemours & Co. is Edgar Woolard who took over in 1989 .
Edgar is innovative which will be beneficial in the '90s with all the upheavals coming .
One item that the Illuminati have planned is to put things Into our major cIty water supplies Interestingly , DuPont has research facilities and a Chamber 's Work facility in Deepwater , New Jersey which both deal with water treatment .
The du Pont family today i represented at the sixth Illuminati level - the Pilgrim Society .
I am convinced their power also run higher , but want mor information / research to bring it out to the open .
One book said that th du Ponts were one of the top three influential famIlies in the United States today .
Whether one is aware of the secret Satanic power of the duPonts or not , it is inescapable to conclude that thi family is exceedingly powerful in the United States beyond comprehension .
Every facet of our lives is influenced by products whose production is still ultimately under the control of the duPont family of control .
For those people who subscribe to the theory that the world is divided between the Rothschilds and Rockefellers , look at the duPonts , who are truly independent of the other top families dispels that theory .
To quote Karl Schriftgiesser in his book Families ,
" ... the Du Ponts of Delaware constitute a definite dynasty perhaps the most complete dynast ever establIshed in this republic an one which seems destined to continue its kingship for generations I come ... Today there are seven hundred members of thi family ...
Every time a package of cigarettes is opened , the simple tearing of the tab is a gesture of tribute to the Du Ponts , and every time a great gun booms , with whatever cost to life or property ; it echoes merrily in the feudal stronghold of this mighty clan ...
We must end with the direct statement that the Du Ponts today rule Delaware with an Iron hand , that their interests affect the daily lives of each one of us in some way , and that the Family moves on .
" It is , today , the great American dynasty .
Close , unassailed , it keeps to itself , hides its scandals , boasts not of its good works , but continues , within American democracy , to exert its own indomitable way . "

Several years ago , I developed a friendship with a man from Silverton .
From that friendship I got the vibes that something was strange about Silverton , OR .
Later , through my contacts , I found out that Anton LaVey 's church had set up their Oregon headquarters in Silverton .
I suspect this was because Silverton had some occult activity already there .
About 25 to 30 miles southeast of Silverton , Or is Mill City and Gates .
The area between this is wooded and has beautiful falls and a large park .
Now the threads of this story return to Portland .
A man who saw my book The Watchtower & The Masons told me 2 years ago that be knew John Lawrence .
He said I and John would like to meet , and that be would arrange it .
One of the weekly papers here is the Williamette Weekly and they seem to be free of some of the stifling control of the New World Order in contrast to our daily paper The Oregonian .
A research writer for the Williamette Weekly using John Lawrence 's research on the Skull & Bones Order wrote a long article in the Williamette Weekly about the Skull & Bones Order .
John Lawrence and I would be a natural shoe - in as Mends since we both investigate secret satanic groups .
But the man who knew John Lawrence always told me after promising to get us together that John had disappeared .
Not only that but this man 's original openness turned to not wanting to have much to do with me .
touching some type of very sensitive secret .
Here is what I have been able to find out .
Several satanic groups are in the Gates , OR area .
John Lawrence was extremely interested in what the 322 of the Skull and Bones Society meant .
He was convinced that number linked the Skull & Bones society with other groups .
John Lawrence and 2 other researchers like himself moved to Mill City to investigate the secret satanic groups in the area .
From someone from the inside it turns out that the CIA shot two of those researchers while they were in the Mill City area investigating .
The CIA went looking for John Lawrence .
And John Lawrence is now in hiding .
People in the Mill City area were afraid to answer my questions .
However , I was able to glean a little information with a great deal of effort .
Some occult group bought a ranch near Gates , OR .
The head of the group is Jim Cole .
They bought a ranch , which is not in Jim Cole 's name .
The last police raid against any occult activity was over five years ago , and it appears that the Satanists are in the key positions in the Mill City and Gates .
They may even have a person on the police force .
The last obvious item to comment on is that for some reason , the CIA is very mixed up and sensitive about this occult activity .
John Lawrence was
One reaction to my duPont article was that someone whose mother - in - law works for the duPonts in Pennsylvania asked a few questions and found out that her mother - in - law is an actual witch ( I do n't mean as in an old hag - I mean is in witchcraft . )
This witch is close friends of the duPonts and has been protected from being fired by the duPonts .
What is most significant in this whole thing to me is that my article got other people cognizant of what happening so that they could teach themselves .
Once people begin to really catch on to things , they will begin to detect things all around that are happening in regards to the NWO .
Most Americans do n't have any frame of reference to hang any facts about the conspiracy .
They bemoan the idea of a Satanic conspiracy , they claim there is no proof all the while it is all around them !
For instanced , did anyone catch what Bill Clinton did when he faced the people and waved at the inauguration ?
See the last article in this newsletter for an answer .
A friend called my attention to Inside Edition 's television story on Lewis Dupont Smith , the heir to the $ 10 million fortune of the Du Pont Chemical Co. Lewis Dupont Smith is exposing his family .
Of course on national television , which is controlled by the Illuminati they are not going to do much exposing - but they did let a few hints get through .
Lewis Dupont Smith did get a sentence left in what was shown on T.V. where he points the finger it " powerful families " as the culprits behind the drug trade .
The reason be was allowed to voice this , was that Lewis was the person behind the book Dope , Inc. and it was this involvement that got him in hot trouble with his family .
Lyndon LaRouche , who was truly exposing the Satanic conspiracy , wrote a good book Dope , Inc .
The book exposes the Queen of England is a participant in the drug trade .
Yes , the British royal family does tie in the elite , the occult , and the drug trade .
They are not as nice is their pictures suggest .
Lewis Dupont Smith , having a good feel for what is going on , recognized that Dope , Inc. is the as be put it ( paraphrased )
" The only book showing the involvement of powerful families . "
Lewis provided the $ 212,000 for the book to be printed .
( Good for him ! )
Let 's just make it plain , the Satanic hierarchy is behind the drug problem .
Lewis ' family was very upset that he was helping the enemy , and they got a judge to rule that Lewis was incompetent to handle his financial affairs , and the court declared that Lewis can have on $ 15,000 per /? of his fortune .
The duPonts also tried to stop his wedding .
A federal informant saved Lewis from getting captured , and taken 60 miles into the Atlantic on his father 's yacht to be tortured and programmed .
His family had hired a motorcycle gang with black hoods and some CIA - Green Beret types to kidnap Lewis .
Lewis managed to get wind of the scheme and save himself .
He tried to get his family on conspiracy to kidnap , but the duPont family bear in mind as one of the top 13 Illuminati families owns justice in this country .
He failed to get his family on the conspiracy charge .
One detail , that I did n't mention in the original story on the duPonts was the one of the more recent Governors of Delaware C. Douglas Buck was married to Alice H. duPont .
I also left out a great deal of the inside story on the politicking that has gone on in Delaware this century .
It is so detailed with so many names that I did n't want to confuse people with it .
Anyway , the bottom line is that behind the scenes , all of the Governors since the 1920s have been approved by the duPonts .
I debated whether to include the du Ponts genealogy .
I had it , so I decided to give it , on the chance someone might use it .
The genealogy shows several things , a. that the duPonts like the Astors repeatedly used the same names over and over , b , that the duPonts like the Rothschilds had a lot of first cousin marriages ( marriages between a du Pont and a du Pont are given asterisks - however some of the marriages between people with different last names are also between first cousins and other relation .
If it looks like I 've gone to a great deal of trouble for nothing - I can understand what you 're saying .
We certainly do n't need to know every du Pont .
But just like in a laboratory one deals with many exact small details in numerous experiments to discover a principle - that is what I am doing here .
Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire and begin at once , whether you ready or not , to put this plan into action .

Comcast has announced that it will lift the ban on BitTorrent traffic , which prevented its users from sharing files using the popular protocol .
The ISP and BitTorrent Inc. will work together on finding customer friendly solutions for the congestion allegedly caused by BitTorrent traffic .
Comcast has announced that it will stop targeting BitTorrent transfers and has said it will invest in its network capacity .
For the time being the company will throttle users who use the most bandwidth , not all BitTorrent users per se .
Comcast ’s chief technology officer Tony Warner said : “ Rather than slow traffic by certain types of applications — such as file - sharing software or companies like BitTorrent — Comcast will slow traffic for those users who consume the most bandwidth . ”
Comcast hoped it could quietly interfere with its customer ’s BitTorrent activities without getting too much attention .
Unfortunately for them , their actions did n’t go unnoticed , and during August last year we broke the news that this ISP does indeed mess with its customers internet connections .
Comcasts actions sparked the debate about what “ reasonable ” network management practices are , and this eventually resulted in a FCC hearing last month .
It now seems that Comcast saw the light , and wants to invest in more Internet gateway capacity after all .
BitTorrent Inc. announced today that it will work together with the ISP to optimize their software , so that it puts less stress on the network .
Ashwin Navin , president of BitTorrent Inc. told TorrentFreak : “ We are happy that Comcast is increasing the upload capacity on its network and that they will stop sending TCP resets to BitTorrent clients .
We plan to jointly test how ISPs can better address the large volume of P2P traffic and share our research with all ISPs and application developers .
This is a huge win for the Internet community as a whole . ”
Still , Comcast will continue to throttle heavy users , who actually use the bandwidth that was promised to them in their contracts .
It is to be expected that Comcast and other ISPs will have to step away from the all - you - can - eat plans they have been offering for years , now that people actually start to use bandwidth they signed up for .

The recent Data - Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in system design , programming , parallel algorithms , data management , scientific applications , and information - based applications to better understand existing capabilities in the development and application of large - scale computing systems , and to explore future opportunities .
Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google : Current Systems and Future Directions .
He discussed : • Hardware infrastructure• Distributed systems infrastructure : –Scheduling system–GFS–BigTable–MapReduce• Challenges and Future Directions –Infrastructure that spans all datacenters
–More automation
It is really like a " How does Google work " presentation in ~ 60 slides ?

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Simply by chance , a pair of new cars fell into my hands last weekend that perfectly demonstrated the yin and yang of today 's auto industry .
The Pontiac G8 was powerful , exciting , fun to drive - and as obsolete as the buggy whip .
The Nissan Cube was homely , utilitarian and slow - and we all ought to get used to it , because that 's what most of us are going to be driving in the future .
An era of personal indulgence in automobiles - when prosperity and cheap gasoline made big and fast available to everyone - is rapidly being replaced by an age of limits .
The brakes are being applied by the terrible troika of climate change , government fuel economy standards and $ 4 gasoline .
There is no other alternative .
It may come a surprise to conspiracy theorists , but the auto companies and the oil refiners have n't been collaborating to keep hyper - efficient cars off the market .
That 's because they do n't exist .
There is n't a technological path towards achieving a fleet average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 - as the federal government wants - or 44 miles per gallon as California is pushing for .
For all the happy talk about alternative fuels , the cars of tomorrow will of necessity be much lighter , smaller and slower than the ones of today .
There is simply no other alternative if you want to use less energy .
So a car like the V - 8 powered Pontiac represents the last of its kind .
Too bad , because on its own terms , the G8 succeeds .
Built in Australia by GM's ( GM , Fortune 500 ) Holden affiliate , the $ 31,000 G8 represents an excellent blend of value and performance .
It 's a five - passenger midsize car that hugs the road and accelerates with authority .
The 361 - horsepower engine rockets the car to 60 miles per hour in 5.8 seconds , as measured by Popular Mechanics , while producing appropriate noises from its twin exhaust pipes .
Yet with a combined fuel economy rating of 18 miles per gallon , there is no way that this car can exist in GM 's lineup .
It is simply too inefficient .
GM estimated the annual fuel cost of the G8 at $ 2,502 a year based on 15,000 miles of driving - and that was when gas was $ 3 a gallon .
These days , you can hike that number by a third to more than $ 3,300 .
Next to the muscularly handsome G8 , the Nissan ( NSANY )
Cube looks like a reject from " Toy Story . "
The name says it all : The Cube is a box on wheels .
Tiny wheels at that , powered by a tiny motor .
Ninety horsepower is all the Cube can muster , straining to get its driver and passengers to 60 miles per hour in more than twice the time it takes the Pontiac .
Yet for the kind of around - town driving most of us do every day , the Cube fills the bill .
There 's lots of space inside ( Nissan says it has more room than a Mercedes S - class ) , a handy cargo door in the rear and fuel economy that even a miser can enjoy .
It 's estimated at 35 to 40 miles per gallon .
While the Cube offers a different driving experience than the G8 , I 'd be hard pressed to say it is worse .
The smaller Cube is easier to turn and park , and at 1,600 pounds lighter , it feels more nimble and fun to drive .
The Cube has been on sale for a decade in Japan and a new model , created for the U.S. market , arrives here next summer .
Whether it will catch on is hard to say .
Toyota sells about 4,000 units a month of another box - shaped car , the Scion Xb ; still , this is a narrow market and it is anybody 's guess as to how wide the niche will be .
Yet there is no confusion about the direction of the overall trends .
Propelled by government regulation , environmental awareness and plain old economics , they are headed away from the G8 and directly toward the Cube .
A couple of years ago , tobacco use finally reached the tipping point where it no longer became acceptable to light up in public .
Today , it is hard to imagine that we ever did .
Powerful , high - displacement automobiles like the G8 are approaching that same juncture .
At some point , people will find it sociably unacceptable to drive them .
Exactly when that day arrives is anybody 's guess , but it surely is n't too far off .
( CNN ) -- Barack Obama and his wife released their tax returns from 2000 to 2006 on his campaign Web site Tuesday , and the Illinois senator challenged Sen. Hillary Clinton to release hers .
Later , Clinton said she expected to release her tax returns " shortly , I hope within the next week . "
Sen. Barack Obama is challenging Sen. Hillary Clinton to release her 2006 tax returns .
The Obama campaign said Clinton should immediately release her 2006 return , pointing to her decision to lend her campaign $ 5 million earlier this year .
The Obama camp also cited former President Bill Clinton 's $ 20 million payout from supermarket holding company Yucaipa as a reason why the couple should release the documents .
The Obama campaign said that company invests in tax shelters in the Cayman Islands .
Clinton has promised to release 2007 returns sometime after this year 's April 15 income tax deadline , just a few days before Pennsylvania 's April 22 primary .
" Senator Clinton recently claimed that she 's ' the most transparent figure in public life , ' yet she 's dragging her feet in releasing something as basic as her annual tax returns , " Obama 's communications director , Robert Gibbs , said in a statement .
" Senator Clinton can't claim to be vetted until she allows the public the opportunity to see her finances -- particularly with respect to any investment in tax shelters . "
But Clinton made her own challenge to Obama during a press conference in Greensburg , Pennsylvania .
" I am pleased that Senator Obama has released his tax returns .
I think that 's a good first step , " she said .
" Now he should release his records from being in the state Senate and any other information that the public and the press need to know from his prior experience . "
According to the 2006 return , Obama and his wife , Michelle , earned over $ 991,000 in 2006 and paid $ 277,431 on the income .
More than half of the couple 's income in 2006 -- nearly $ 507,000 -- came from royalties from his two books , " The Audacity of Hope " and " Dreams From My Father . "
In 2005 , Obama earned over $ 1,210,000 from royalties , according to the couple 's returns that year .
The Obamas earned nearly $ 431,000 in wages in 2006 , according to the returns .
The documents do not show what Obama or his wife individually earned , but the senator 's salary was $ 165,000 that year .
They also earned more than $ 51,000 from Treehouse Foods , an Illinois - based food manufacturer .
Michelle Obama served on Treehouse 's board from June 2005 to May 2007 .
Before 2005 , the couple had more modest incomes .
Between 2000 and 2004 , they earned between $ 207,647 and $ 275,123 a year .
The returns were posted just minutes after the Clinton campaign attacked Obama for not releasing them .
" In the public record , there are 20 years of Hillary 's tax returns , hundreds of thousands of pages of records from her time in the White House and countless other documents detailing her time in public life .
" Sen . Obama 's record is far more opaque .
Sen .
Obama has not released his tax returns , except for 2006 , " Clinton spokesman Phil Singer said in a statement sent to reporters just as the Obama camp posted the Illinois senator 's returns online .

NY Times : Aides expect Spitzer to resign RAW STORY

' If the public is fine , he 'll stay ' According to The New York Times , aides for the beleaguered New York governor caught in a prostitution scandal say that it 's only a matter of time before he steps down .
In the meantime , New York state Republicans are threatening to pursue impeachment against Governor Eliot Spitzer if he does n't resign within the next two days .
" Top aides to Gov. Eliot Spitzer said Tuesday morning that they expect the governor to resign his office , although the timing of the resignation remains uncertain , " Danny Hakim and William K. Rashbaum report for the Times .
" Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson and his staff have begun laying the groundwork for him to take over as governor and are reaching out to members of the Legislature , the aides said . "
However , late Tuesday afternoon , another Spitzer aide signaled that the governor may defy calls to resign .
" A top aide to Governor Spitzer said today Mr. Spitzer has not made up his mind about whether to step down from office despite mounting calls for his resignation amid allegations that he arranged to meet with a $ 4,300 - a- night prostitute in the nation 's capital on the eve of Valentine 's Day , " Jacob Gerhsman reports for the NY Sun .
" He has not made up his mind , " senior adviser Lloyd Constantine said .
" It is more correct to say that he is not resigning . "
The New York Times and The Daily News have reported that Constantine has been urging the governor to stick it out and not resign too abruptly .
" Gov. Spitzer is not likely to resign anytime today , a source close to New York 's scandal - tainted chief executive told the Daily News - even as the chorus to quit hit a crescendo and tentative transition talks began , " the New York tabloid reports .
" ' He is still in the place where he is trying to figure out the end run of this , ' said the source , a high - ranking official in the Spitzer administration .
' I do n't think I can give you a time line as to when something might happen , ' the official said .
' But I do n't mean to suggest he thinks he is going to weather this . ' "
The Daily News adds , " The source said the governor is ' most likely ' trying to cut a deal with federal prosecutors delving into his alleged role as a customer of a high - priced call girl ring . "
With pressure mounting , Spitzer is finding himself with few friends and lots of powerful enemies , many of whom regard him as a sanctimonious bully who got what was coming to him .
A death watch of sorts began at the state Capitol , where whispers of " What have you heard ? " echoed through nearly every hallway of the ornate , 109 - year - old building .
While Spitzer and his family remained secluded in their Fifth Avenue apartment , insiders said the governor was still trying to decide how to proceed .
Options included quitting as early as Tuesday afternoon , or waiting to use resignation as a bargaining chip with federal prosecutors to avoid indictment .
Democrats privately floated another option , telling The Associated Press that Spitzer was considering what was almost unthinkable immediately after Monday 's bombshell apology : hanging on .
" If the public is fine , he 'll stay , " said a Democrat who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject .
Still , Spitzer 's enemies were emboldened , and some of his friends went from shock to outrage .
" Particularly because of the reform platform on which he was elected governor , his ability to govern the state of New York and execute his duties as governor have been irreparably damaged , " said Citizen Action , a good - government group that supported the crusading attorney general for governor in 2006 and provided critical support in his effort to reform Albany .
" It is our strong belief that it is now impossible for him to fulfill his responsibilities as governor .
Accordingly , Citizens Union urges him to resign as governor . "
A law enforcement official said Tuesday that the governor first came under suspicion because of cash payments from several bank accounts to an account operated by a call - girl ring .
Spitzer was the initial target of the investigation and was tracked using court - ordered wiretaps that appear to have recorded him arranging for a prostitute to meet him at a Washington hotel in mid-February , the official said .
The official spoke to The Associated Press condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation .
The scandal surrounding the man who built his political reputation on rooting out corruption stunned the state .
Calls for Spitzer 's resignation began immediately and intensified Tuesday with the New York Daily News , New York Post and Newsday all demanding that he step down .
" Hit the road , John ... and make it quick ! " read the headline of the Daily News editorial , while the Post called him " NY 's naked emperor . "
Spitzer retreated from public view Monday afternoon , when he appeared glassy - eyed with his shellshocked wife , Silda , at his side and apologized to his family and the public , but did not directly acknowledge any involvement with the prostitute .
" I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my - or any - sense of right and wrong , " he said .
" I apologize to the public , whom I promised better . "
Spitzer allegedly paid for the call girl to take a train from New York to Washington - a move that opened the transaction up to federal prosecution because she crossed state lines .
The governor has not been charged , and prosecutors would not comment on the case .
A Spitzer spokesman said the governor has retained a large Manhattan law firm .
The case started when banks noticed the frequent transfers from several accounts and filed suspicious activity reports with the Internal Revenue Service , the law enforcement official told the AP .
The accounts were traced back to Spitzer , prompting public corruption investigators to open an inquiry .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey was made aware of the investigation because it involved a high - ranking political official .
The inquiry found that Spitzer was a repeat customer with the Emperors Club VIP , a high - end prostitution service , the official said .
In an affidavit filed in Manhattan federal court last week , Spitzer appeared as " Client 9 , " according to another law enforcement official who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation .
Client 9 wanted a high - priced prostitute named Kristen to come to Washington on a 5:39 p.m. train from Manhattan Feb. 13 .
The door to the hotel room would be left ajar .
Train tickets , cab fare , room service , and the minibar were all on him .
" Yup , same as in the past .
No question about it , " the caller told Kristen 's boss , when asked if he would make his payment to the same business as usual , a federal affidavit said .
The client paid $ 4,300 to Kristen , touted by the escort service as a " petite , pretty brunette , " according to the court papers .
The Feb. 13 tryst took place in the Mayflower hotel , where Spitzer rented a second room for the woman under another name , the law enforcement official who spoke to The AP on Tuesday said .
Spitzer had to sneak past his State Police detail to get to her room , the official said .
According to the court papers , an Emperors Club agent was told by the prostitute that her evening with Client 9 went well .
The agent said she had been told that the client " would ask you to do things that ... you might not think were safe ... very basic things , " according to the papers , but Kristen responded by saying : " I have a way of dealing with that ...
I 'd be , like , listen dude , you really want the sex ? "
Spitzer , a 48 - year - old father of three teenage girls , was elected with a historic margin of victory , and took office Jan. 1 , 2007 , vowing to stamp out corruption in New York government in the same way that he took on Wall Street executives while state attorney general .
Spitzer 's cases as attorney general included a few criminal prosecutions of prostitution rings and tourism involving prostitutes .
He also uncovered crooked practices and self - dealing in the stock brokerage and insurance industries and in corporate board rooms ; he went after former New York Stock Exchange chairman Richard Grasso over his $ 187.5 million compensation package .
Spitzer become known as the " Sheriff of Wall Street . "
Time magazine named him " Crusader of the Year , " and the tabloids proclaimed him " Eliot Ness . "
The square - jawed graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law was sometimes mentioned as a potential presidential candidate .
Spitzer 's term as governor has been fraught with problems , including an unpopular plan to grant driver 's licenses to illegal immigrants and a plot by his aides to smear his main Republican nemesis .
It would not be the first time that a high - profile politician became ensnared in a prostitution scandal .
Sen .
David Vitter of Louisiana acknowledged in July that his Washington phone number was among those called several years ago by an escort service .
Scandals also recently derailed neighboring Connecticut Gov. John Rowland and New Jersey 's Jim McGreevey .
And Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after being arrested last June in a Minneapolis airport restroom .
Attention turned to the state 's lieutenant governor , David Paterson , who automatically becomes governor if Spitzer quits .
There was no immediate comment from Paterson , who would become New York 's first black governor .
There was no word on Spitzer 's plans , but Assembly Republican leader James Tedisco said Tuesday he received a call Monday from Paterson .
Tedisco said Paterson raised the possibility of such a scenario by asking if Tedisco , who has been at odds with Spitzer , would be willing to start fresh with him .
" He called me to ask if we would give him the benefit of the doubt , and go forward , " Tedisco said .
" I told him we would . " ( with wire reports ) Developing ...
Poll watchers throughout Ohio are noting large numbers of Republican voters crossing over to vote in the Democratic Primary between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton .
In the Republican roost of Chagrin Falls , veteran poll worker Liz McFadden was amazed at the number of people jumping the party 's ship .
Democrats accounted for 70 percent of the voters in her precinct , one of seven at the village 's high school .
" That 's a complete reversal of what it normally is , even more so , " she said .
" I 've never seen a switch like this . "
The defectors had motives both pure and sinister .
One woman voted for Clinton in hopes of delivering John McCain a weaker debate opponent .
Another picked Obama because her vote could help deny Clinton and her husband a return trip to the White House .
A 69 - year - old Catholic nun , Sister Ann Marie , was converted to the Clinton camp because of the former first lady 's experience .
John Baggett , another ex-Republican for Clinton , said he simply wanted to switch , and Clinton represented a known commodity .
" I 'm happy with Republicans , in general , " Baggett , 50 , said .
" I do n't believe they 've done a good job the last eight years . "
In Strongsville , middle - aged couple Lucy and Pete See -- longtime Republicans -- both voted for Hillary Clinton .
" I like that she has more experience in foreign affairs , " Pete See said .
" The Republican candidate was older than me .
Lucy
See said she voted for Clinton as well .
" I want to be part of makiing history , " she said .
In North Ridgeville , pollworkers said that by noon nearly 50 Rebublicans had switched to vote Democrat , the highest crossover since the 2000 election .
Voter interest was so high that a line was forming just after 6 a.m. at the polling site , the party room of the Ridgefield subdivision off Bagley Road .
In Chester Township in Geauga County , also a GOP stronghold , Democrats had outvoted Republicans by nearly 50 percent early in the going .
Geauga Elections Board Director Arch Kimbrew said that trend was being duplicated throughout the county .
Kimbrew said morning turnout has convinced him that his projection of a 45 - percent turnout will be too low .
" There are a lot of Democrats out and at every polling place , " he said .
The Gomboc is a roundish piece of clear synthetic material with gently peaked , organic curves .
It looks like a piece of modern art .
But if you tip it over , something unusual happens : it rights itself .
It leans off to one side , rocks to and fro as if gathering strength and then , presto , tips itself back into a “ standing ” position as if by magic .
It does n’t have a hidden counterweight inside that helps it perform this trick , like an inflatable punching - bag doll that uses ballast to bob upright after you whack it .
No , the Gomboc is something new : the world ’s first self - righting object .
Image The Gomboc is the physical realization of a mathematical theorem : that a " mono- monostatic " object -- one that has a single stable point of equilibrium , or balance -- must exist .
And so it does .
No matter how you orient it , the Gomboc always rights itself .
Credit ... Illustration by Bryan Christie Design
The Gomboc is a result of a long mathematical quest .
In 1995 , the Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold mused that it would be possible to create a “ mono - monostatic ” object — a three - dimensional thingy that purely by dint of its geometry had only one possible way to balance upright .

Depuis plusieurs mois les disques durs basés sur de la mémoire flash , aussi nommés disques SSD , commencent à apparaître dans des machines comme l'EeePC d'Asus ou le MacBook Air d'Apple .
De plus il est possible d'acheter ces disques séparément pour les installer dans des ordinateurs de bureau afin d'augmenter leurs performances .
Pourtant cette apparition timide sur le marché n'est que le prélude d'un véritable raz de marée programmé par les industriels dans les années à venir .
Le monde du logiciel libre est-il prêt à exploiter de façon efficace cette nouvelle technologie ?
De nouveaux systèmes de fichiers sont - ils nécessaires et le noyau Linux doit - il être adapté ?
Cette dépêche tente de faire le point sur ces questions et d'évaluer les solutions en présence permettant le support des disques SSD .
Un disque dur classique est constitué d'un bras de lecture survolant à très courte distance un plateau rotatif magnétisé et tournant à plusieurs milliers de tours par minute .
On voit immédiatement tous les inconvénients de cette technologie : la résistance aux chocs est faible car un contact entre le bras et le plateau doit être évité à tout prix .
D'autre part la fiabilité et la consommation énergétique sont mauvaises car il y a des pièces mécaniques à mettre en mouvement .
Enfin l'accès aux données est lent car le bras de lecture doit se repositionner au dessus des données avant de pouvoir les lire .
La promesse des disques SSD est de s'affranchir de tous ces défauts d'un seul coup .
En basculant vers cette nouvelle technologie qui ne comporte pas de pièces en mouvement on obtiendrait une bonne résistance aux chocs , une fiabilité de haut niveau , une consommation réduite et des temps d'accès sans commune mesure avec les disques durs traditionnels .
Pourtant , outre l'obstacle du prix et de la capacité , il reste un problème important à résoudre afin de profiter pleinement de tous ces avantages .
En effet les systèmes de fichiers utilisés jusqu'à présent ont tous été conçus avec les limitations des disques durs en tête et une bonne partie de leur architecture est à revoir .
Actuellement les disques SSD utilisent une interface de communication standard ( souvent l'interface SATA ) et ils sont vu par le système d'exploitation comme des disques durs classiques .
Cela leur permet d'être formaté avec un système de fichiers normal et d'être inséré dans une machine sans problème en dépit du fait qu'ils ne comportent pas des secteurs mais des blocs mémoires Néanmoins ces disques SSD à base de mémoire flash sont affligés d'un défaut important puisqu'ils ne supportent qu'un nombre restreint de cycles d'écritures ( typiquement de l'ordre de 100000 ) .
Pour faire face à ce problème la technique du " wear levelling " a été développée .
Elle consiste schématiquement à enregistrer le nombre d'écritures pour chaque bloc mémoire et à répartir ensuite intelligemment les nouvelles données à écrire de façon à minimiser l'usure de chaque bloc .
Des graphiques présentant l'évolution de l'usure d'un disque SSD avec et sans wear levelling sont disponibles sur cette page
Ce algorithme est implémenté par les constructeurs de disques SSD dans des microcontrôleurs faisant le lien entre la mémoire flash et l'interface sata .
C'est certes transparent pour l'utilisateur mais cela signifie que les systèmes de fichiers traditionnels , avec toutes leurs limitations et tout leur code complexe dédié à la minimisation des temps d'accès par le bras de lecture , vont continuer à être utilisé .
Il est donc bien plus efficace de créer des systèmes de fichiers spécialement dédiés aux disques SSD et dialoguant directement avec la puce de mémoire flash sans passer par le microcontrôleur de wear levelling .
Cet algorithme est ainsi implémenté directement dans le système de fichiers optimisé pour les SSD .
C'est pourquoi de nombreux développeurs du monde du logiciel libre se sont lancés dans la conception de nouveaux systèmes de fichiers spécialisés dans les disques SSD .
Comme il est de mise dans le monde de Linux la compétition est rude et tous les projets aspirent à devenir le Ext3 de demain .
A ce stade de développement il peut être intéressant de passer en revue les concurrents en lice et d'évaluer leurs chances respectives .
Le système JFFS ( Journaling Flash File System ) , disponible sous licence GPL , a été écrit à l'origine par la société Axis Communications pour l'antique noyau Linux 2.0 .
Il a été remplacé par JFFS2 qui , sous les auspices de Red Hat et toujours sous licence GPL , a fait son entrée dans le noyau 2.4.10 en septembre 2001 .
C'est donc un système vraiment mature qui , malgré des limitations que nous verrons par la suite , représente un choix sans risques .
Alors que JFFS première mouture ne fonctionnait qu'avec les mémoires flash NOR et utilisait un mode d'écriture purement circulaire , JFFS2 propose un système bien plus abouti .
Tout d'abord la compatibilité avec la mémoire flash NAND , mieux adaptée au stockage d'informations , est assurée .
Ensuite les données peuvent être compressées ( avec plusieurs algorithmes au choix ) ce qui est précieux car les disques SSD ont des capacités de stockage inférieures aux disques durs classiques .
Enfin JFFS2 ne fonctionne pas sur un mode d'écriture circulaire comme le faisait JFFS .
Avec ce système toutes les écritures s'empilent dans une queue qui écrit en parcourant progressivement tout l'espace disque .
C'est une solution simple mais qui implique que toutes les données du disque sont réécrites ( même si cela n'était pas nécessaire ) et que cela diminue la longévité du disque .
Au contraire JFFS2 traite les données par blocs et évite de toucher aux données statiques sur le disque .
Comme les blocs mémoires d'un disque SSD sont de grandes tailles ( 32 Ko ou plus ) un ramasse - miettes ( garbage collector ) est utilisé pour récupérer de la place en fusionnant les données dans des nouveaux blocs afin que les anciens puissent libérer de la place .
Le gros problème de JFFS2 est qu'il a besoin d'examiner tous les blocs mémoires au moment du montage du système de fichiers afin de construire l'index qui est conservé en RAM .
Si cette opération n'est que peu pénalisante dans le cas d'un volume de petite taille , elle devient absolument rédhibitoire avec les disques SSD modernes ( 8 Go et plus ) .
En définitive JFFS2 est un bon système de fichiers et il est bien adapté aux disques flash de faible capacité mais , du fait de son temps de montage et de l'ancienneté de sa conception , il ne peut plus être considéré comme une solution à privilégier .
Le monde du libre a clairement besoin d'un remplaçant .
Une alternative est le système de fichiers YAFFS ( Yet Another Flash File System ) développé sous double licence ( GPL / commercial ) par la société Aleph One .
Ce système a été conçu spécifiquement pour la mémoire flash NAND et il est donc a priori bien adapté aux disques SSD .
On peut noter d'autre part que YAFFS a été conçu de façon modulaire afin qu'il puisse être utilisé avec d'autres systèmes d'exploitation ( par exemple Microsoft WindowsCE ) .
Une seconde version , YAFFS2 , a été introduite afin de respecter la nécessité de n'écrire que le moins de fois possible sur les blocs mémoires et pour permettre l'accès à la mémoire NOR .
YAFFS est presque aussi ancien que JFFS2 puisque l'ouverture du CVS date de mai 2002 mais ce système de fichiers n'a jamais vraiment " décollé " dans le monde du libre .
La société Aleph
One semble vraiment réserver son produit pour le monde de l'embarqué et n'a jamais vraiment cherché à bâtir une communauté de développement .
Un des gros problèmes de YAFFS est le fait qu'il n'est pas intégré dans la branche principale du noyau Linux et qu'il n'y a jamais eu de tentative d'inclusion .
Pour pouvoir utiliser ce système il est donc nécessaire de le compiler à partir des sources et la documentation n'est pas vraiment à jour .
Bien entendu l'évolution rapide du noyau signifie que les risques de non compatibilité avec un système de fichiers externe comme YAFFS sont élevés comme cet exemple le prouve
Un autre système de fichiers libre ( sous licence GPL ) et spécialisé dans la mémoire
Flash est également développé dans la perspective de l'arrivée en masse des disques durs de type SSD .
LogFS est écrit principalement par Jörn Engel et il est basé sur une écriture séquentielle des données ( log- structured approach ) qui ne nécessite pas de scan complet du volume au montage .
Toute la structure du système de fichiers est donc écrite directement dans le disque ce qui accélère considérablement le montage par rapport à JFFS2 .
Selon Jörn Engel , sur un disque NAND flash d'une capacité de 1
Go , on passe de 3,3 secondes pour le montage sous JFFS2 à 60 millisecondes avec LogFS .
En dépit de ces promesses , l'écriture de LogFS n'est pas réellement terminée et le travail avance lentement puisque Jörn est le seul vrai contributeur .
Tant qu'il n'y avait pas de concurrent sérieux pour le titre de " système de fichiers de nouvelle génération pour disques SSD " , LogFS pouvait représenter l'avenir ( voir cet article de mai 2007 ) .
Mais il semble que ce ne soit plus le cas puisqu'un rival très sérieux , UBIFS , vient d'apparaitre récemment .
UBI ( Unsorted Block Images ) est une couche d'abstraction présente dans le noyau Linux depuis la version 2.6.22 et qui permet de gérer les périphériques à base de mémoire NAND flash .
C'est un équivalent fonctionnel de LVM mais spécialisé dans la mémoire flash .
UBI effectue un mappage entre les blocs logiques de la mémoire flash et les blocs physiques .
Elle permet la répartition des écritures sur toute la mémoire ( wear levelling ) et elle tient compte des blocs mémoires défectueux ( bad - block handling ) .
La couche gère également la création de volumes UBI qui peuvent être dynamiquement créés , re-dimensionnés ou supprimés .
Un fichier PDF complet sur la conception d'UBI est disponible ici Comme cette couche UBI est déjà présente dans le noyau il parait éminemment logique de construire un système de fichiers gérant les disques SSD par dessus cette infrastructure afin de profiter de ses avantages et de factoriser le code noyau : Les ingénieurs de la firme Nokia , en collaboration avec l'université de Szeged , ont donc travaillé afin de développer UBIFS ( UBI file system ) et ont récemment présenté le résultat de leurs efforts sur la liste de diffusion du noyau .
Comme pour LogFS , il a été décidé de conserver sur le disque
Flash l'index de la structure du système de fichiers afin d'éviter de lire l'intégralité du disque .
L'ennui c'est qu'un scan de tout le disque est quand même nécessaire lors du montage car la couche UBI en a besoin pour attacher le périphérique .
Cependant ce scan se contente de lire les en- tête des blocs les temps de boot sont donc bien plus rapides qu'avec JFFS2 .
Un autre avantage est qu'UBIFS utilise un cache pour les données ( writeback ) ce qui permet d'éviter d'écrire les données de façon strictement synchrone .
Le gain en performances est absolument ahurissant ( ) par rapport à l'écriture synchrone de JFFS2 .
Enfin UBIFS , ou plutôt la couche UBI sous - jacente , gère parfaitement le dysfonctionnement des blocs mémoires ( courant avec la mémoire flash ) que ce soit lors de la création du système de fichiers ou au cours de la vie du système .
LogFS est limité à la gestion des mauvais blocs lors de la création et ne peut les gérer par la suite .
Un document détaillé sur le design d'UBIFS est disponible ici JFFS2 est âgé et son temps de montage le rend inadapté pour utiliser les disques modernes de grande taille .
YAFFS2 est un bon système pour l'embarqué mais il reste relativement obscur et ne vise pas à intégrer Linux .
En définitive il ne reste vraiment en lice que LogFS et UBIFS .
Par rapport à son nouveau concurrent LogFS garde l'avantage sur le plan de la compacité du code ( environ 8000 lignes contre 11000+30000 pour UBI + UBIFS ) et sur le temps de montage .
Néanmoins la situation a beaucoup changé et LogFS , qui l'an dernier semblait le candidat le mieux placé pour prendre la place du vénérable JFFS2 , a perdu un peu de son éclat depuis l'arrivée d'UBIFS .
Ce nouveau système est techniquement plus cohérent puisqu'il s'appuie sur une couche ( UBI ) déjà présente dans le noyau et les tests semblent montrer que ses performances sont meilleures .
Le fait que Nokia soit derrière ce système de fichiers alors que LogFS ne peut compter que sur un seul vrai contributeur est également une indication à prendre en compte en ce qui concerne le rythme de développement .
Bien entendu rien n'est encore joué et il faudra surmonter la redoutable épreuve de l'acceptation dans la branche principale avant que nous puissions y voir plus clair dans le domaine des systèmes de fichiers SSD pour Linux .
About DNA Day
National DNA
Day commemorates the successful completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 and the discovery of DNA 's double helix in 1953 .
The National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI ) began celebrating DNA Day annually on April 25th after the 108th Congress passed concurrent resolutions designating it as DNA Day .
The goal of National DNA Day is to offer students , teachers and the public an opportunity to learn about and celebrate the latest advances in genomic research and explore how those advances impact their lives .
NHGRI encourages organizations to host events celebrating DNA Day from January through May of each year .
That reality is spreading .
Once - sizzling housing markets in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states are cooling rapidly , as nervous Western Europeans stop buying investment properties in Warsaw , Tallinn , Estonia and other real estate Klondikes .
Further east , in India and southern China , prices are no longer surging .
With stock markets down sharply after reaching heady levels , people do not have as much cash to buy property .
Sales of apartments in Hong Kong , a normally hyperactive market , have slowed recently , with prices for mass - market flats starting to drop .
In New Delhi and other parts of northern India , prices have fallen 20 percent over the last year .
Sanjay Dutt , an executive director in the Mumbai office of Cushman & Wakefield , the real estate firm , describes it as an erosion of confidence .
Much of the retrenchment seems to be following the basic law of gravity : what goes up must come down .
With low interest rates helping to inflate housing bubbles in many countries , economists said the confluence of falling prices was predictable , if unsettling .
This is not the first housing downturn to cross borders , but its reverberations have been amplified by the integration of financial markets .
When faulty American mortgages end up on the books of European banks , the problems of the United States aggravate the world ’s problems .
Consider Britain , which had one of Europe ’s most robust housing markets , with less of an oversupply than in Ireland or Spain .
Then last summer came the subprime crisis across the Atlantic .
Within two months , mortgage approvals dropped 31 percent , compared with the previous year .
And by March , average housing prices had fallen 2.5 percent , the largest monthly decline since 1992 .
Western politicians are all calling for an end of violence and “ restraint on both sides ” after a bloody showdown in Tibet .
On a practical level , however , nothing is done to pressure the Red China government to end its oppressive policies , not only in occupied and annexed Tibet but also towards other minority nations in China , dozens of which comprise over one million people .
This is in stark contrast with the Western leaders ’ behaviour in Kosovo .
While Tibet is a genuine nation , independent until China invaded it in 1959 and began to ethnically cleanse the province , no - one is considering helping Tibet to recover its independence .
NATO is not going to send planes to bomb Peking to force it to end its atrocities in Tibet .
On the contrary , George Bush , while sending arms to Kosovo , has announced that he is going to Peking for the Olympics in August .
The West ’s hypocrisy and double standards are even worse when one considers that , unlike Tibet , Kosovo has never had a legitimate leadership in exile .
And that the Tibetan government in exile is recognized not just by Tibetans but by the Western powers as well .
Serb atrocities in Kosovo were massively published and circulated by Western media and politicians who used it to whip up anti-Serbian frenzy , which led to NATO air strikes and the ousting of Serbia ’s leaders .
Both media and politicians are showing unbelievable subtlety and restraint in their comments on the atrocities in Tibet .
There are no calls for international fact - finding missions , no calls to end ethnic cleansing , no demands to find a “ roadmap ” to Tibet ’s independence or magnanimous offers to mediate .
All is said to be China ’s internal affairs .
The Western leaders are rushing to distance themselves from calls to boycott the “ genocidolympics . ”
Clearly Red China is not the same as Serbia .
It is not realistic to expect that NATO , though it bullies a small country like Serbia , would start an outright war with a nuclear Communist power over an uprising in Tibet .
But Peking should not be allowed to get away with ( mass ) murder .
There are countless ways for the international community and for individual countries to put pressure on the Chinese Communists and to show that “ universal human rights ” are indeed universal and hold in the Himalayas , too .
The Tibetans have suffered for decades under Communist repression .
They have endured the Sinofication of their culture , the colonization of their homeland and they have seen – like the peoples of Eastern Europe during the Cold War – that there is little or no real support coming from the West .
However , the more the West looks the other way , the more it will lose its credibility .

John McCain has been wrong .
He said that he said it would be long and tough in Iraq .
In fact , in '03 , John McCain said the war would be brief and the oil would pay for it .
He was wrong .
Last month he said that Muqtada al - Sadr was losing his influence .
He was wrong .
In January he said Basra is not a problem .
He was wrong .
I think John McCain has taken positions in the course of trying to win the Republican nomination , whether it's the reversal and flip - flop on the intolerance with respect to Jerry Falwell and others , or whether it is the Bush tax cuts flip - flop , or whether it is this flip - flop now on the issue of Iraq , or whether it is , you know , global climate change , where he has not yet signed on to Joe Lieberman and John Warner 's bill .
There is a clear indication of a Nomination John McCain versus the Senator John McCain .

10 things you should know about John McCain ( but probably do n't ) :
What Everyone Should Know About Their Own Minds
Classic psychology studies show just how little access we have to the workings of our own minds .
Ever wondered where your opinions come from , how you manage to be creative , or how you solve problems ?
Well , do n’t bother .
Psychology studies examining these areas and more have found that while we ’re good at inventing plausible explanations , these explanations are frequently completely made - up .
In this series of posts , I examine some of the classic findings in psychology that show we have precious little insight into our own thought processes .
How do great artists create ?
How do brilliant scientists solve the hardest problems in their field ?
Listen to them try to explain and you ’ll probably be disappointed .
Artists say mysterious things like : “ The picture just formed in my mind . ”

When you change your attitude about something , do you know why ?
Psychologists have argued that the inner workings of our minds are largely hidden away from us .
One aspect of this is the surprising finding that people are often unaware when they have changed their attitudes .

CRISIS breeds opportunity , as the bottom - fishers starting to circle beaten - up mortgage bonds and leveraged loans can attest .
For George Soros it offers a chance of a different sort : to revive his favourite intellectual theory .
In his latest book , “ The New Paradigm for Financial Markets ” , published on April 3rd , he sets out to illuminate the credit crunch through the prism of “ reflexivity . ”
The 77 - year - old hedge - fund supremo and slayer of sterling has nothing to prove financially ( he is worth upwards of $ 8 billion ) .
Intellectually , however , he has long been frustrated at not being taken seriously .
Just as he was about to give up , along came a debacle that , he believes , validates his Weltanschauung .
The theory draws on thoughts first developed in his 1988 bestseller , “ The Alchemy of Finance ” , which was itself influenced by the work of Karl Popper , one of Mr Soros 's philosophical heroes .
Essentially , it says that financial markets have built - in biases which have an impact not only on prices but also , in extreme times , the fundamentals themselves .
In such moments , market events affect as well as reflect supply and demand .

Reflecting on reflexivity
America 's housing crisis , he contends , exemplifies this .
Lenders made more money available for home - buying in the 1990s .
More people bought houses , increasing their prices .
This boosted the value of the collateral on banks ' balance sheets , encouraging them to lend more .
Prices rose further , prompting more lending and a relaxation of underwriting standards , and so on .
Financial history is dotted with booms and busts , as Mr Soros knows all too well ; he first got his hands dirty in the conglomerate bubble of the 1960s .
But this crisis is profoundly different from its predecessors , he argues — at least , all those since the Depression — because two bubbles are coinciding : a “ straightforward ” one in housing , pumped up by low interest rates in the wake of the dotcom collapse ; and a longer - term , more complicated “ super - bubble ” fed by globalisation , deregulation and decades of credit expansion , which is taking in commodities , currencies and more besides .
As a result , investors are fleeing the dollar and are unlikely to return soon .
Its days as the world 's reserve currency are numbered .
The subprime - mortgage crisis exposed the cracks in financial innovation , especially synthetic structured products .
But it was “ merely the trigger that released the unwinding of the super - bubble , ” reckons Mr Soros .
His prognosis is grim .
America will pay for its “ market fundamentalism ” , which was “ no better than Marxist dogma ” .
Thanks to a general inability or unwillingness to factor in reflexivity , he says , the entire system has been brought to the point of breakdown .
As central banks struggle to contain the damage , they face new demons .
The giant market for credit - default swaps , overrun by hedge funds acting essentially as unlicensed insurers , hangs like a Damocles sword that will fall when corporate defaults rise .
The economic impact on America will be hard .
Just as the financial bubble lifted the economy , so the credit contraction will drag it down .
The flow of credit has already been disrupted more severely and for a longer period than ever before , he contends .
The Fed 's hands are largely tied because of the vulnerable dollar and the spectre of inflation .
Strong exports will help offset the pain , but only for a while .
The wider picture is less depressing .
Thanks to enduring strength in the developing world , a global recession can be avoided .
But China is in the middle of an asset bubble that will , eventually , cause a financial crisis .
The new paradigm that Mr Soros advocates is the financial equivalent of the political third way .
We need markets — how else do you make a few billion ?
But we must accept that , left to their own devices , they will lurch dangerously in both directions .
Regulators need to regain the control they happily ceded in the 1980s , particularly over excessive borrowing .
The idea that risk management can be left to the moneymen is an “ aberration ” .
After three decades of stellar growth , the financial - services industry needs to shrink and become less profitable .
The last two chapters are peppered with smaller suggestions , such as the creation of a clearing house with proper margin requirements to ease counterparty fears in derivatives markets .
But all this raises as many questions as it answers .
Mr Soros admits that while more regulation is needed , regulators themselves tend to mess things up .
Indeed , he pours scorn on American supervisors : waving through Byzantine products that they could not have understood — since even their clever creators did not — was a “ shocking abdication of responsibility ” .
Is he really giving markets a fair hearing ?
True , the situation is ugly .
But all crises look worse than the last when you are in the middle of them — even to greybeards .
Prices may have a lot further to fall , as he contends .
Or they may not .
( Once the bottom - fishers start to nibble , expect a feeding frenzy . )
Innovation clearly went too far .
But who wants to go back to the 1970s , when banking was all but frozen by draconian regulation ?
Ultimately the palindromic arch - speculator , lured by another chance to meld philosophy and finance , may be trying too hard to make reflexivity work .
“ I have always wanted to be a philosopher , and finally I may have become one , ” he gurgles at one point .
In any case , if the past is a guide , most readers will be more interested in his latest investment strategy than his grand theories .
They will find what they are looking for on page 135 , where Mr Soros crisply points out that he is “ short US and European stocks , US ten - year government bonds , and the US dollar ; long Chinese , Indian and Gulf States stocks and non-US currencies . ”

Kanye West performing , alongside Daft Punk , a new version of Stronger .
If you have n’t been living under a rock or something until now , then you ’d more then certainly got bugged by all the Grammy hype , that thankfully ended last night .
As expect nothing special , no surprise prizes , no stellar moments or mind blowing performances , but I ’ve personally gotta admit it was n’t as lame as I thought it would be .
Think I may even have had some fun for a few good seconds , but I do n’t wanna stretch it .
The 50th annual Grammy Awards , held now at the traditional Staples Center in Los Angele , was kicked off by Alicia Keys , as she “ dueted ” with a vintage performance by Frank Sinatra of “ Learnin ’ the Blues . ”
After that , the rest of the show was kinda boring with various mediocre performances , however with some occasional moments of good rockin , ’ like the live shows from the Foo Fighters , who played a orchastral version of the Pretender alongside conductor John Paul Jones ( [ tag ] Led Zeppelin [ / tag ] ) and violinist Ann Marie Calhoun ( the winner of the FF Grammy Moment contest ) , also worth mentioning was Tina Turner ‘s performance , as well as the magnificent Love - in show by Cirque Du Soleil .
A fun moment was also at hand when John Fogerty , Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard took the stage , each , at the Grammy Awards for a short session of classics .
The 62 - year - old Fogerty , was the first to start ; it was also his first time ever to perform at the Grammys .
The 72 - year - old Lewis was next , blowing the dust off of his classic “ Great Balls of Fire . ”
After that , another great piano player was in center , as the 75 - year - old Little Richard simply blew awaythe crowd with “ Good Golly , Miss Molly . ”
John Fogerty playing next to Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard .
On the awards side , as expect Amy Winehouse brought home a handful , meaning no less then five wins , while Kanye West came at a close second with four wins ; no more party crashing , hu smart guy ?.
Speaking of Kanye , the dude may have some severe self indulging issues , but he threw a hell of a show last night , when he was joined by Daft Punk live ( the duos first ever televised performance ) and played a special , alternate version of the hit single “ Stronger . ”
Their performance was dedicated to Kanye ’s late mother ; peace man .
The night ’s shocker however , came when the Best Album Award was being announced .
Everybody was expecting Amy or Kanye to take it home , but none other then Herbie Hancock won with his “ River : The Joni Letters , ” a pleasant surprise I might add .
All in all it was a decent edition of the Grammy Awards , most of the time it did n’t deliver , but some of the present artist ’s great shows made up for it to a certain extended and almost made the time spent seem not like a total waste of time .
Bellow you can find the full list of Grammy Award winner , per each category .

National Public Radio continues to move aggressively against Federal Communications Commission proposals that would , if not allow nonprofits to build more Low Power FM stations ( LPFM ) , at least let existing ones survive the intrusion of new full power neighbors .
NPR is quite plain about the matter in its FCC filings : it stands opposed to the Low Power exceptions , even though they might help keep FM offerings diverse .
NPR charges that the FCC is putting feel - good policies ahead of the laws of physics .
" The laws of physics have not changed , and a system of full power broadcast stations serves many more listeners with less interference compared to low power broadcasting , " NPR told the FCC this month .
" While LPFM stations may advance the interests of localism and diversity , the Commission cannot assume that LPFM is inherently better than full power service . "
NPR opposes proposals to strengthen rules allowing LPFMs to obtain channel interference waivers when an " encroaching " full power station arrives on the scene .
And the broadcaster decidedly dislikes measures that would require new full power signals to offer technical and even financial help to an LPFM that they 've suddenly squatted on ( or squatted next to ) .
This is a serious issue , because over the last decade the NPR service has expanded from 635 to 800 affiliated stations .
Public radio's stance on this puts it at odds with practically every media reform group in the country .
But first , let 's recap the history of this bitter struggle , which goes back almost a decade .
A victory deferred
After years of highly - publicized battles between pirate radio stations and the FCC , agency Chair William Kennard 's Commission in 2000 set up some rules to establish two classes of LFPMs : an LP100 class with a maximum of 100 watts of power and an LP10 class with a limit of ten watts .
License applicants for this new service had to honor various limits : nonprofit status and a " second adjacent " rule which meant that an LPFM could not set itself up within two channel notches of a full power station .
The FCC established that restraint in defiance of National Public Radio and the National Association of Broadcasters .
Both entities demanded that a three notch No Man's Land be thrown up around a full power signal .
NPR pursued this goal with particular vigor , going so far as to suggest that the FCC disregarded laboratory tests that showed that LPFM stations without third adjacent restrictions would interfere with its member stations .
Nonetheless , the agency stood these accusations down .
It concluded that " imposition of a third - adjacent channel separation requirement would restrict unnecessarily the number of LPFM stations that could be authorized . "
So the big guys raised hell and asked Congress to stomp the FCC's 2000 Order .
Capitol Hill complied with a rider to a District of Columbia appropriations bill that instructed the FCC to put that third adjacent rule in there , despite the FCC 's own conclusions .
This was a big setback for LPFM , because it meant that significantly fewer such stations could be licensed in more densely - populated areas .
As the FCC later conceded , various " otherwise technically grantable applications " became " short spaced , " prompting " the eventual dismissal of those applications . "
The agency subsequently canceled 17 licenses and almost 100 construction permits " for failure of the holder to satisfy certain procedural and / or technical requirements . "
The DC Congressional rider did contain one silver lining .
It authorized the FCC to commission an engineering study on the third adjacent problem , which the government did .
The wheels of agency process moved slowly , but they moved .
A little over two years later the Mitre Corporation submitted a report on the second / third adjacent problem , from which the FCC once again drew the conclusion that the third adjacent rule was not necessary .
Then , on December 11th of last year , the FCC enacted an Order and Proposed Rulemaking asking Congress to permit it to re-establish that second adjacent guideline .
Mike Doyle ( D - PA ) in the House has sponsored such a bill , as has Maria Cantwell ( D - WA ) in the Senate .
While we wait for Congress . . .
The Commission 's December 11th Order also asked for comment on other proposals to help keep afloat the estimated 809 LPFMs broadcasting in the United States .
These include more firmly establishing procedures for second adjacent waivers .
At present , if a new full power station shows up too close to an LPFM , agency practice has been to consider a waiver if the smaller signal suddenly finds itself afoul of the second adjacent limit .
The FCC now wants to turn that occasional practice into a rule , but it also wants guidance on under what circumstances it should grant such leeway .
And the Commission wants public wisdom on whether its waiver procedures should be expanded to first and even co-adjacent situations .
Second ( and NPR truly hates this idea ) , the FCC wants to know if the " encroaching " full - service station should be required to offer technical assistance and even financial help to an LPFM that can demonstrate full power interference .
This might include paying for filtering technology and other interference aides .
And the agency thinks that a full power station should give an LPFM advance notice if the former anticipates interference with the latter .
" It should also be required to cooperate in good faith with the LPFM station in developing the best technical approach , " the Commission contends , " including a possible LPFM site relocation , to ameliorate the interference and / or displacement impact of its proposal . "
In addition , the FCC proposes to raise standards for the kinds of LPFMs that get this sort of help , and seems to be leaning towards codifying these new policies only for stations that provide eight hours of local programming on a daily basis .
Finally , the FCC proposes to use contouring methodology to license new LPFM stations .
Contour measurement is a more flexible way of assessing the possible interference of a broadcast signal .
It takes into account mountainous and watery areas , therefore offering station applicants a wider range of " new licensing opportunities , " as the FCC puts it .
Defense and offense
On April 7th , a medium - sized platoon of public interest groups and radio stations filed a 23 - page statement on behalf of these proposals .
They included the usual suspects : Prometheus Radio , Free Press , Benton , Future of Music , and Reclaim the Media , plus quite a few parties you do n't come across very often , such as the Forest Hills School District of Cincinnati , Ohio .
These 46 groups enthusiastically endorsed the FCC 's suggestions .
" Low power radio stations are governed and operated by community based organizations with limited resources , " they wrote .
" It is only fair , then , that full - power stations that choose to move into the low power radio's community must provide technical and financial assistance to assist the low power station in resolving interference or in its move to a new channel . "
In addition , the filing took on the delicate issue of FM translators , which NPR affiliated stations rely on heavily to expand their audience reach .
Prometheus wants to limit the number of translators .
No entity , Prometheus et al says , should be able to own more than ten translators in the biggest 303 Arbitron measured markets " on a basis that is primary to an LPFM station that pledges to provide local originated programming . "
In addition , LPFMs should not be able to convert to translators .
Needless to say , NPR sees these matters very differently , and was not afraid to be blunt about its perspective in its filing , submitted the same day as Prometheus .
When Congress created the Low Power FM service , NPR 's comment argues , it intended these stations to broadcast " where full power stations could not . "
Thus the Commission should understand LPFM stations as " secondary to full power stations , " NPR writes .
From this point of departure , practically everything that the FCC recommended in its December 2007 Order becomes illegitimate in NPR 's eyes , ignoring " longstanding policy determination that full power service is the most efficient use of broadcast spectrum . "
If an LPFM wants a second adjacent waiver , it must first " resolve all actual interference complaints , " NPR insists , and prove that " other factors " have not caused the problem .
But it should get no help from the encroaching full power station in question : " The Commission has no place demanding that one NCE [ Non-Commercial Educational ] station reallocate its scarce resources to another , unrelated one , no matter how deserving the Commission believes the latter to be . "
And as for notifying an LPFM of impending signal interference , NPR says that 's not an All Things Considered broadcasters ' job .
" If the Commission perceives a special need to alert LPFM stations to potentially significant Commission actions or provide other accommodation , the Commission itself should take on those tasks . "
In a more recent filing , submitted to the FCC on April 21st , NPR also opposed the ten translator limit .
In a sense , NPR has traveled full circle on this matter .
In 2000 it protested imagined signal interference from LPFMs .
Now it insists that real interference from its affiliates ' signals should be someone else 's problem .
In its FCC comments , National Public Radio claims that it " continues to support the LPFM service and the Commission 's efforts to ensure that it remain true to its original ideal . "
But a detailed examination of public radio's stance on LPFM will lead some to a different impression .
" To the extent the Commission is motivated by the desire to prevent the loss of LPFM stations , " NPR writes in the same statement , " we also regret the community 's loss of a valued public service , but risk is inherent in the secondary nature of the LPFM service . "
Perhaps , then , NPR sees LPFM as a lesser species that , with time , will be driven to deserved extinction .
That is , if the Federal Communications Commission does not enact rules that thwart the survival of the fittest .

Highest birth rate in Europe + highest divorce rate + highest percentage of women working outside the home = the best country in the world in which to live .
There has to be something wrong with this equation .
Put those three factors together - loads of children , broken homes , absent mothers - and what you have , surely , is a recipe for misery and social chaos .
But no .
Iceland , the block of sub -Arctic lava to which these statistics apply , tops the latest table of the United Nations Development Programme 's ( UNDP ) Human Development Index rankings , meaning that as a society and as an economy - in terms of wealth , health and education - they are champions of the world .
To which one might respond : Yes , but - what with the dark winters and the far from tropical summers - are Icelanders happy ?
Actually , in so far as one can reliably measure such things , they are .
According to a seemingly serious academic study reported in the Guardian in 2006 , Icelanders are the happiest people on earth .
( The study was lent some credibility by the finding that the Russians were the most unhappy . )
Oddny Sturludottir , a 31 - year - old mother of two , told me she had a good friend who was 25 and had three children by a man who had just left her .
' But she has no sense of crisis at all , ' Oddny said .
' She 's preparing to get on with her life and her career in a perfectly optimistic frame of mind . '
The answer to why the friend perceives no crisis in what any woman in a similar predicament anywhere else in the western world might consider a full - blown catastrophe goes a long way towards explaining why Iceland 's 313,000 inhabitants are such a sane , cheerful , successful lot .
There are plenty of other , more obvious factors .
Statistics abound .
It is the country with the sixth highest GDP per capita in the world ; where people buy the most books ; where life expectancy for men is the highest in the world , and not far behind for women ; it 's the only country in Nato with no armed forces ( they were banned 700 years ago ) ; the highest ratio of mobile telephones to population ; the fastest - expanding banking system in the world ; rocketing export business ; crystal - pure air ; hot water delivered to all Icelandic households straight from the earth 's volcanic bowels ; and so on and so forth .
But none of this happiness would be possible without the hardy self - confidence that defines individual Icelanders , which in turn derives from a society that is culturally geared - as its overwhelming priority - to bring up happy , healthy children , by however many fathers and mothers .
A lot of it comes from their Viking ancestors , whose males were rampant looters and rapists , but had the moral consistency at least not to be jealous of the dalliances of their wives - tough women who kept their families fed in the semi-tundra harshness of this north Atlantic island while their husbands forayed , for years at a time , far and wide .
As a grandmother I met on my first visit to Iceland , two years ago , explained it : ' The Vikings went abroad and the women ran the show , and they had children with their slaves , and when the Vikings returned they accepted it , in the spirit of the more the merrier . '
Oddny - a slim , attractive pianist who speaks fluent German , translates English books into Icelandic and works as a city councillor in the capital , Reykjavik - offers a contemporary case in point .
Five years ago , when she was studying in Stuttgart , she became pregnant by a German man .
During her pregnancy she broke up with the German and reconnected with an old love , a prolific Icelandic writer and painter called Hallgrimur Helgason .
The two returned to Iceland where they lived together with the new baby and in due course had a child of their own .
Hallgrimur is devoted to both children but Oddny considers it important for her first - born to retain a close link to her biological father .
This happens on a regular basis .
The German flies over and stays at Oddny and Hallgrimur 's far - from - spacious home for a week , sometimes two , at a time .
' Patchwork families are a tradition here , ' explained Oddny , who was off work , at home , on the Thursday morning we met , looking after her youngest child .
' It is common for women to have kids with more than one man .
But all are family together .'
I found this time and again with people I met in Iceland .
Oddny 's case was not atypical .
When a child 's birthday comes around , not only do the various sets of parents turn up for the party , the various sets of grandparents - and whole longboats of uncles and aunts - come too .
Iceland , lodged in the middle of the North Atlantic with Greenland as its nearest neighbour , was too far from the remit of any but the more zealously obstinate of the medieval Christian missionaries .
It is a largely pagan country , as the natives like to see it , unburdened by the taboos that generate so much distress elsewhere .
That means they are practical people .
Which , in turn , means lots of divorces .
' That is not something to be proud of , ' said Oddny , with a brisk smile , ' but the fact is that Icelanders do n't stay in lousy relationships .
They just leave . '
And the reason they can do so is that society , starting with the parents and grandparents , does not stigmatise them for making that choice .
Icelanders are the least hung - up people in the world .
Thus the incentive , for example , ' to stay together for the sake of the kids ' does not exist .
The kids will be just fine , because the family will rally round them and , likely as not , the parents will continue to have a civilised relationship , based on the usually automatic understanding that custody for the children will be shared .

The comfort of knowing that , come what may , the future for the children is safe also helps explain why Icelandic women , modern as they are ( Iceland elected the world 's first female president , Vigdis Finnbogadottir , a single mother , 28 years ago ) , persist in the ancient habit of bearing children very young .
' Not unwanted teen pregnancies , you understand , ' said Oddny , ' but women of 21 , 22 who willingly have children , very often while they are still at university . '
At a British university a pregnant student would be an oddity ; in Iceland , even at the business - oriented Reykjavik University , it is not only common to see pregnant girls in the student cafeteria , you see them breast - feeding , too .
' You extend your studies by a year , so what ? ' said Oddny .
' No way do you think when you have a kid at 22 , " Oh my God , my life is over ! "
Definitely not !
It is considered stupid here to wait till 38 to have a child .
We think it 's healthy to have lots of kids .
All babies are welcome .'
All the more so because if you are in a job the state gives you nine months on fully paid child leave , to be split among the mother and the father as they so please .
' This means that employers know a man they hire is just as likely as a woman to take time off to look after a baby , ' explained Svafa Grönfeldt , currently rector of Reykjavik University , previously a very high - powered executive .
' Paternity leave is the thing that made the difference for women 's equality in this country . '
Svafa has embraced the opportunity with both arms .
For her first child , she took most of the parental leave .
For her second , her husband did .
' I had a job in which I was travelling 300 days a year , ' she said .
She had her misgivings , but these were alleviated partly by the knowledge that her husband was at home , partly because of the top - class state education that Iceland provides , starting with all - day pre-schools , rendering private schools practically nonexistent .
( ' I think there is one , but 99 per cent of kids , be their parents plumbers or billionaires , use the state system , ' Svafa said . )
The 300 days ' travelling job was as deputy CEO in charge of mergers and acquisitions for a generic pharmaceutical company called Actavis , where Svafa worked for six years .
During this period the company rose from global minnowhood to become the third largest of its kind in the world , buying up 23 foreign companies along the way .
A propagandist not just for her former firm , which she left when she could no longer fight the guilt she felt over her maternal absences , she listed some of the more notable feats of entrepreneurial prowess her country had achieved in the past 10 years , boom - time in what had traditionally been a fish - based economy .
Icelandic banks now operate in 20 countries , and the Reykjavik - based company deCODE is a world leader in biotechnological genome research .
Icelandic firms are gobbling up food and telecommunications firms in Britain , Scandinavia and Eastern Europe , further evidence of the island 's economic growth .
Svafa is a lively , wiry woman with a sassy haircut and a sharp , humorous mind .
And she has a corner office to match .
Spacious , minimalist ( so much so she does not even have a desk ) and modern in the clean Nordic style , it has the feel of a lounge and views to kill for .
From one window you see over Reykjavik 's red and green rooftops to the fishing port and the dark blue sea ; from another you look on to a ridge of low , snow - capped mountains .
It 's a beautiful landscape to look at but a hard one in which to live , especially in the 1,000 years Iceland was inhabited prior to the invention of electricity and the combustion engine .
' You have to be not only tough but inventive to survive here , ' said Svafa .
' If you do n't use your imagination , you 're finished ; if you stand still , you die . '
As the Vikings showed , part of that imagination means getting out into the world .
That is what Svafa did ( she studied for a PhD at the London School of Economics , lived in the US , spending a total of 10 years abroad ) and what practically all Icelanders do .
Very few do not speak excellent English .
But now that Iceland has become prosperous the invitation is out to the world to come to Iceland .
Reykjavik University has staff from 23 countries and the idea , after a planned move in two years to what Svafa describes as a new space - age campus , is to expand the foreign presence both in terms of teaching staff and students , and convert the university into a hub of global business education .
Reykjavik University is already entirely bilingual .
' Students who only speak English can come and do postgraduate studies here . '
Does nobody worry about losing the Icelandic language , when , after all , so few people speak it ?
' Not at all , ' declares Svafa .
' Our language is safe . '
Not prey to the nationalist neuroses of other small countries ( though practically none are smaller than Iceland ) , Iceland 's obsession is with embracing the world , not fearing it .
' We are into brain gain , not brain drain .
We want to do what the Americans have done to great effect , in our specific case to create an elite campus in Europe that attracts the best in the world . '
Icelanders know how to identify the best and incorporate it into their society .
I talked about this to the Icelandic prime minister , Geir Haarde , whom I met at an official event at a steamy public swimming bath , a popular meeting place for Icelanders , like pubs for the British .
Easygoing as everybody else I met , and without anything dimly resembling a bodyguard anywhere near him ( there is almost no crime in Iceland ) , he agreed on the spot to sit down and do a quick interview .
' I believe we have blended the best of Europe and the United States here , the Nordic welfare system with the American entrepreneurial spirit , ' he said , pointing out that Iceland , unlike the other Nordic countries , had exceptionally low personal and corporate tax rates .
' This has meant not only that Icelandic companies stay and foreign ones come , but that we have increased by 20 per cent our tax revenue owing to increased turnover . '
Which is not to say that Iceland has been immune to the financial panic affecting the rest of the world right now .
Icelandic banks being , in the US manner , aggressive and optimistic global players , there are worries they may have over - extended themselves .
The rise in food and oil prices is generating the same sort of headlines in Iceland 's papers as we are seeing elsewhere .
Yet there is no suggestion that the economic system itself is under threat .
Icelanders will continue to receive not just free , top - class education but free , top - class healthcare , private medicine being limited in Iceland chiefly to luxury procedures , such as cosmetic surgery .
Dagur Eggertsson , until recently the mayor of Reykjavik and every inch a future prime minister of Iceland , made the point to me that what has happened in Iceland has defied economic logic .
' In the Eighties and Nineties right wingers in the US and UK were saying that the Scandinavian system was unworkable , that high state investment in public services would kill business , ' said Dagur , a boyish , super - bright 35 - year - old who , like most Icelanders , is a furiously hard - working multi- tasker - as well as a politician , he is a doctor .
' Yet here we are , in 2008 , ' he continues , ' and you look at the hard economic statistics and you see that these last 12 years we and the Scandinavian countries have been roaring ahead .
Someone called it bumblebee economics : scientifically , aerodynamically , you cannot figure out how it flies , but it does , and very nicely , too . '
Iceland 's spectacular success comes from that capacity for hard work Dagur exemplifies , plus that imperative for creativity Svafa spoke of , plus an American faith in the feasibility of big ideas .
' Many of us have lived in the US , studied there , ' said Geir Haarde , ' and what we have both taken from them and found that naturally we share is that can - do attitude - that if you work hard , anything can be done . '
Svafa seemed to be the living expression of what Haarde was describing .
She rejoiced in the civilised generosity of the Icelandic state but worked in pursuit of her own private goals with tireless optimism .
A similar spirit lies behind the success of Reykjavik Energy , the company that provides Icelanders with most of their hot water and electricity .
Pipes dug deep into the earth 's icy crust extract not oil , but water , which one kilometre down reaches temperatures of 200C .
In 1940 , 85 per cent of Iceland 's energy came from coal and oil .
Today , 85 per cent comes from underground volcanic water , which supplies half the country 's electricity needs at a price just two - thirds of the European average .
Iceland has the world 's largest geothermal heating system , and the world is coming to have a look .
The prime ministers of China and India have visited Iceland in recent years to see what they can learn about clean , cheap renewable energy and Reykjavik Energy is engaged in joint projects to replicate the Icelandic model in places as far flung as Djibouti , El Salvador , Indonesia and China .
The success of Reykjavik Energy is a metaphor for Iceland 's broader achievement : harnessing the harshness of nature and transforming it , through invention and hard toil , into rich , fruitful energy .
Artists have done much the same .
The country is crawling with writers , painters , film makers and - like Oddny - accomplished musicians .
Iceland has Björk , its cool answer to Madonna , but also a national symphony orchestra that plays to the highest standards all over the world ; it has its own opera company ( while I was there , La Traviata was being performed at the Reykjavik Opera House , entirely by Icelanders ) .
Baltasar Kormakur , a former TV soap opera heart - throb , is a successful local film director whose films have been shown in 80 countries , and is about to make his first Hollywood film this year .
He has also directed a play at the Barbican , where he will soon be staging a production of Shakespeare 's Othello .
As for writers , half the population appears to have written a book , as if inspired by the single greatest cultural legacy Iceland has so far given the world - the 13th - century Viking sagas , which Jorge Luis Borges , the greatest writer never to receive a Nobel prize , described as the first novels , 400 years ahead of Cervantes .
As a consequence , the one thing Icelanders could do that many in richer countries could not , even in the 19th century , was read - and the abundance of bookshops in Reykjavik is testament to this .
Painting as an art form did not exist in Iceland until 100 years ago , but a large sector of the population dabbles in it now and at least 100 Icelanders live off their art full time .
Haraldur Jonsson , who studied in Paris and whose father was a champion multi- tasker ( he was both an architect and a dentist ) is an abstract painter , sculptor and video and performance artist who describes his task as ' making the invisible world visible ' , transforming emotions into things you can see and touch .
He has exhibited all over the world , including London , Barcelona , Berlin and Los Angeles .
Why is there such an abundance of artists in Iceland ?
What drives them ?
' We do it so as not to become mad , ' replied Haraldur , who is tall , nervy and thin with eyes that have the concentrated energy of a laser beam .
Not to become mad ?
' Yes , to keep the beast at bay . '
The beast ?
' The beast is Iceland , this island on which we live with its terrifyingly harsh nature , its bitter ever - changing weather .
It 's Goya 's dark nightmare world , beautiful but grotesque .
This is the moody beast of Iceland .
We can not escape it .
So we find ways to live with it , to tame it .
I do it through my art , ' said Haraldur , whose attempts to pacify the monster have also included the writing of three books in which ' there are no animals , no trees .
We have to have a rich internal life to fill the empty spaces , to fill the silence with our own noise . '
There is another beast to which Iceland owes a debt : the Second World War .
The Icelanders must be the only people in the world to whom Adolf Hitler bequeathed a legacy of value .
Before the war , Iceland was Europe 's poorest country .
Suddenly , in 1939 , it became a strategic location of immense value .
The British and the Germans raced for it , and the British got there first .
They established a military base on a finger of land near the Reykjavik coast .
' Suddenly there was an abundance of jobs that were , for the first time ever , unrelated to fishing or farming , ' recalled Asvaldur Andresson .
' I remember that before the war we barely had roads , and those we had we had to build with picks and shovels .
The British and Americans came and then it was Caterpillar trucks and tar roads and all sorts of wonderful new tools with which to work . '
Asvaldur , who was born in 1928 in a fishing town in Iceland 's wild far east called Seydisfjordur , emigrated west to Reykjavik at the end of the war and found a job as a bus driver at the US base .
After that , following long hours of hard night - time study , he spent most of his life as a refurbisher of bashed - up cars .
His life was always tough , but especially when he was growing up , when Iceland was that worst of possible mixes , a Developing World country with brutally cold weather .
He left school at 12 and went to work on a fishing boat amid the icy storms of the Arctic circle 's southern edge .
His sister died of whooping cough at the age of three , and when his father died , Asvaldur , then 16 , was out at sea , so he did not find out about it until after the burial .
He worked 16 - hour days all his life to keep his family fed .
Today , he has a full - time job looking after his invalid wife .
The blessing is that he receives money from the state to do so , a big reason ( consistent with the culture of family cohesion ) why most old people in Iceland live not in residences but at home .
' I look back at my life and I see how this country has changed and I can hardly believe my eyes , ' said Haraldur .
The most remarkable thing is what has become of three of his grand - daughters , all grown up now .
One makes documentary films in Paris ; one is a bio-technology whizz who assists surgeons in a Reykjavik hospital ; the eldest , at 26 , has a flying licence from the United States and is undergoing training to become a pilot with Ryanair .
Icelandic women being the early reproducers that they are , Asvaldur and his wife have not one or two but five great - grandchildren .
They are all sure to be receiving a fine education , especially should any of them happen to go to a school I visited in Reykjavik called Hateigsskol .
The principal , a quietly passionate man called Asgeir Beinteinsson , showed me around .
The children range from the ages of six to 16 , and every classroom , which we visited unannounced , was a picture of cheerful industry .
Apart from the wide variety of subjects obligatory to all , from cookery to carpentry via all the traditional lessons , what was striking was the ingenuity in the teaching and the degree of liaison with the parents .
One method of teaching for younger children involved the use of drama to explain history and science .
The story of the first settlers who left Norway in 874 , for example , is learnt by acting out how they would have navigated to Iceland using the sun and the stars , and how they survived when they first arrived on Iceland 's barren rocks .
As for the parents , there is one member of staff whose job it is to compile detailed data on internal assessment exercises conducted with a view to keeping the school on its toes , and standards high .
After consultation with pupils , teachers and parents , progress is rated on everything from the quality of maths teaching for nine - year - olds to the satisfaction levels of the teachers with their colleagues to the pupils ' feelings about the school buildings .
The information is then made available to the parents on the internet .
' The philosophy behind everything we do , ' said Asgeir , 'is that we must challenge the children with a broad educational foundation , teach them in a warm , creative environment where we respect everyone equally .
All are equal . '
Asgeir and his staff have , like many other Icelanders , looked abroad for ideas and inspiration .
Two teachers I met had just returned from England , where they had spent time at a school in Birmingham with a reputation for doing an especially good job .
Asgeir himself has been to Denmark , Scotland , the United States and Singapore , and he was off to New Orleans the week after I met him .
For good measure , all teachers have the opportunity to take a year off to study a subject of their choice on full pay .
If the bumblebee flies , if Iceland is the world 's best place in which to live , and one of the richest , it is because of the way governments have added enlightened policies to the island 's pragmatic , inventive human raw material .
' I as a medical doctor and as a politician believe that there is an intimate link between the country 's health and the quality of political decisions that are made , ' said Dagur Eggertsson , Reykjavik 's former mayor .
' We were the poorest of nations 100 years ago , but we all could read and we had strong women .
On that we have now built strong policies .
My point is that more important for the health of a country than not smoking and eating well are the social phenomena we stress here : equality , peace , democracy , clean water , education , renewable energy , women 's rights . '
Dagur , like the many people I spoke to in Iceland who were proud of their country , was confident but not complacent ; content but ambitious - and open to the world in all its diversity .
That was manifest even at Asgeir 's school , where I came across children from China , Vietnam , Colombia , even Equatorial Guinea .
When I was talking to Svafa about the better influences from the rest of the world that Iceland seemed to have wisely plucked , or just happened to have , we mentioned , as the prime minister had done , the humaneness of Scandinavia and the drive of the United States .
We also discussed how the Icelanders - who have excellent restaurants these days and whose stamina for late night partying must come from the Viking DNA - seemed to have much of southern Europe 's savoir vivre .
Then I put it to her that there was an African quality to Iceland that the rest of Europe lacked .
This was to be found in the ' patchwork ' family structures Oddny had spoken of .
The sense that , no matter whether the father lived in the same home or the mother was away working , the children belonged to , and were seen to belong by , the extended family , the village .
Svafa liked that .
' Yes ! ' the pale - skinned power executive exclaimed , in delighted recognition .
' We are Africans , too !'
Partly by dint of travel , partly by accident , Iceland , we agreed , was a melting pot that had contrived to combine humanity 's better qualities , offering a lesson for the rest of the world on how to live sensibly and cheerfully , free from cant and prejudice and taboo .
Iceland could not be less like Africa on the surface ; could not be further removed from the lowest country in the UNDP 's Human Development Index , Sierra Leone .
Yet the Icelanders have had the wisdom to take , or accidentally to replicate , the best of what 's there , too .
Without any hang - ups at all .
Siegelman released from jail , pending appeal RAW STORY
Published : Thursday March 27 , 2008

Print This Email This UPDATE : Judge releases ex-Alabama Gov. on bond pending appeal A federal appeals court approved the release of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman on bond Thursday while he appeals his convictions in a corruption case .
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the former governor had raised " substantial questions of fact and law " in challenging his conviction .
The once - popular Democrat began serving a sentence of more than seven years in June on his conviction on six bribery - related counts and one obstruction count .
He has been serving the sentence at a federal prison in Oakdale , La .
The full Associated Press story is available here .
Earlier : House Judiciary Committee wants Siegelman to testify The House Judiciary Committee asked the Justice Department Thursday to temporarily release former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman from prison in early May to testify before Congress about possible political influence over his prosecution .
A spokeswoman for the committee said Siegelman , a Democrat serving more than seven years in a Louisiana prison , would travel to Washington under guard of the U.S. Marshals Service .
She said Committee Chairman John Conyers , a Michigan Democrat , wants to hear directly from Siegelman because lawmakers are having trouble getting information elsewhere , particularly from the Justice Department .
" The chairman has determined it would be appropriate to hear from Mr. Siegelman himself and believes he would have a lot to add to the committee 's investigation into selective prosecution , " spokeswoman Melanie Roussell said .
Democrats last year began reviewing Siegelman 's 2006 corruption conviction as part of a broader investigation into allegations of political meddling at the Justice Department by the Bush administration .
Justice and the federal prosecutors who handled the prosecution have denied any political influence , emphasizing that Siegelman was convicted by a jury .
But critics , including about 50 former state attorneys general , have called for a review and said the case raises a number of questions .
The effort gained momentum after a Republican lawyer who had volunteered for Siegelman 's re-election opponent  current Republican Gov. Bob Riley  said she overheard conversations suggesting that former White House adviser Karl Rove was talking with Justice officials about Siegelman 's prosecution .
Last month , CBS's " 60 Minutes " reported that a key witness against Siegelman said that prosecutors met with him some 70 times and had him repeatedly write out his testimony because they were frustrated with his recollection of events .
Siegelman was elected governor in 1998 and served one term .
He was convicted in 2006 on six bribery - related and one obstruction of justice charge .
RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrova has reported extensively on the case of Don Siegelman , a Democrat whom many people believe to have been selectively targeted for prosecution by the Bush administration and unjustly convicted .

YAML 1.2 Ensconces and Envelopes JSON - hackety.org
why さんより YAML ワーキングドラフ ト 1.2 のお知らせ。 YAML 1.2 の目玉は JSON との互換性が正式にサポートされていること。 JSON は YAML のサブセットという扱いになって，すなわち YAML 1.2 に対応すれば自動的に JSON 対応にもなるという美味しい話 。
ところで， YAML って使ったことある ？ Ruby 界隈では比較的出番が多いのかな。個人的には，数年前に XML の代替物を探していたとき，はじめて YAML と出合った記憶がある。その頃はまだマイナーな存在で，サポートの弱さを理由に導入を見送ったんだ。今ならどうかな……。
それにしても，いつのまに XML はこんなにも冴えない存在になってしまったんだろう。
YAML は「 human - readable な XML の代替物 」で， JSON は「 fat - free な XML の代替物 」 。多くの人が XML に何かしらの不満を抱えていて，それを解消するために代替物を作り出していく。もっとも，「パースする可能性のあるテキストなら何でもかんでも

ゲームの場合は Lua をデータ記述に使うのが手軽でいいと思う。 ECMAScript の軽量なインタープリターが存在するなら JSON でもいいのだけれど …… 現時点では Lua を使った方が無難かな 。
最後に小ネタ。 yaml.org のページ自体が YAML になっているのが面白い 。
これは YAML が human - readable であるというアピールでもあるのかな 。
Wheeler Peak , on
Nevada 's eastern border with Utah , reaches an altitude of 13,063 feet ( 3981 m ) with a spectacular glacial cirque on its northeast side .
Highpoint of the Snake Range , Wheeler Peak cycles through five life zones , from the hot stony desert to alpine tundra , all within a five mile line .
Along the edge of this cirque is the home of colossal bristlecone pines .
Standing as they have for millenia , in their fields of stone , they overlook the desert far below .
The 1957 Schulman discovery of old bristlecones in California brought much attention to the bristlecones in the Wheeler area .
With park development in mind , the Nevada congressional delegation asked the National Park Service for a study of the area .
Some initial research was done but months went by with no further movement .
A local group that included author - conservationist Darwin Lambert was established and together they formed the Great Basin National Park Association .
Lambert and this group believed the bristlecones of Wheeler to be every bit as old as those in California and worked hard to get scientific research to the area .
The University of Nevada showed some interest but money was short and the theory that the oldest trees were in the White Mountains of California left the group without the support they needed .
Lambert and his friends were longtime travelers to Wheeler Peak , and many of its bristlecones were lovingly given names by members of the group : names like " Buddha " and " Socrates " .
One tree was named " Prometheus " ( pronounced : Pra - me - thee - us ) after the Greek mythical character Titan , who gave fire and arts to mankind but was chained to a mountain for thousands of years by the gods for doing so .
The Association failed to get the research project , but the colossal trees along with the great beauty of the area was enough to bring attention to the Advisory Board on National Parks who endorsed the area as worthy of consideration .
Bills were introduced in both houses of Congress and their passing seemed imminent , but grazing , mining and hunting special interests intervened , and the legislation failed .
Legislative efforts continued year after year without success .
One day , while reading a newsletter clipping from the University of North Carolina , Lambert was dealt an almost unbelievable blow .
He had stumbled upon a story that escaped the public and conservationists alike .
Late in the year of 1964 a young geographer , Donald R. Currey , a student at this university , who was working toward his doctorate , was in the Southwest searching for evidence of Ice Age glaciers .
The Wheeler Peak glacier and related phenomena attracted him .
When this student and his associate came upon the bristlecones at the timberline , they began to take core samples from several trees , discovering one to be over 4,000 years old !
Needless to say they were excited , and at some point , their only coring tool broke .
The end of the field season was nearing .
They asked for and I still can't believe it !
were granted permission by the U.S. Forest Service to cut the tree down .
It was " Prometheus " .
After cutting the trunk at a convenient level , which happened to be more than eight feet above the original base , 4,844 rings were counted .
This student had just killed the oldest living thing on earth !
Eventually , dendrochronologist Don Graybill determined the tree to be 4,862 years of age .

I do n’t use Emacs as an editor — I subscribe to the belief that it ’s a great operating system , lacking only a decent text editor — but I sometimes wish I had easy access to its libraries of functions .
It turns out that you can run Elisp ( the Lisp interpreter Emacs is built on ) programs from outside Emacs by starting the program with this shebang line :
#!/usr/bin/emacs -- script
This will make Emacs work like Perl or Python or Ruby or Bash — an interpreter that reads the rest of the program and executes the code .
You will , of course , have to give the correct path to the Emacs binary ; /usr / bin / emacs is correct for OS X and for every Linux distribution I ’ve ever used , so it ’s probably right for you .
Lispers may be perplexed by that line , because , unlike Perl , Python , etc. , Lisp does n’t use the sharp symbol for comments .
But since version 22 , Emacs Lisp has been extended to handle the shebang ( sharp - bang , #! ) line the way all those other languages do .
If you ’re using an older version of Emacs , you ’ll have use a more arcane top line , as described here
[ The # ! is magical for reasons that go way back in Unix history .
Shebang lines even have their own Wikipedia page . ]
One area where Emacs really excels is in the manipulation and conversion of dates .
The Emacs calendar functions were written by Edward Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz , two computer scientists who literally wrote the book , as well as several papers , on Calendrical Calculations .
I have an earlier edition of the book , which is now available at Google Books .
You can also get a PostScript version of their original paper from Reingold ’s site .
Reingold and Dershowitz are very good writers and if you read any of their calendrical stuff , you ’ll learn not only a lot about calendars , but also how to build complex programs out of very simple pieces .
Here ’s the source code of an Elisp program that takes a date in the Gregorian calendar and converts it into several other calendars .
The script is very short because of the power of Emacs ’ calendar functions .
1 : #!/usr/bin/emacs -- script 2 : 3 : ( require ' calendar ) 4 : 5 : ; Use current date if no date is given on the command line 6 : ( if (= 3 ( length command - line - args - left ) ) 7 : ( setq my - date ( mapcar ' string - to - int command - line - args - left ) ) 8 : ( setq my - date ( calendar - current - date ) ) ) 9 : 10 : ; Make the conversions and print the results 11 : ( princ 12 : ( concat 13 : " Gregorian : " ( calendar - date - string my - date ) "
" 14 : " ISO : " ( calendar - iso - date - string my - date ) "
" 15 : " Julian : " ( calendar - julian - date - string my - date ) "
" 16 : " Hebrew : " ( calendar - hebrew - date - string my - date ) "
" 17 : " Islamic : " ( calendar - islamic - date - string my - date ) "
" 18 : " Chinese : " ( calendar - chinese - date - string my - date ) "
" 19 : " Mayan : " ( calendar - mayan - date - string my - date ) "
" ) )
Lisp has a reputation for being hard to read , but it ’s not so tough once you understand a few things :
Function calls put parentheses in different places from Algol - based languages .
You say
( function argument ) instead of function ( argument )
Arguments are separated by whitespace , not commas .
So a function with three arguments is called like this : ( function arg1 arg2 arg3 ) Everything is a function , even things that you usually think of as operators .
So you say
(+ 2 2 ) instead of 2 + 2
Functions return a value , which may then be operated on by an enclosing function .
It ’s common to see things like this
( func3 ( func2 ( func1 argument ) ) ) where the functions are applied in 1 - 2 - 3 order .
Line 3 of my script imports the Reingold and Dershowitz calendar library .
Lines 6 - 8 handle the command line arguments passed to the program ( see below ) .
The built - in Elisp variable command - line - args - left is the list of arguments passed to the script as strings .
Lines 14 - 19 actually do the conversions to the six listed calendars .
Line 12 concatenates the date strings , and Line 11 prints them out .
I ’ve called this program “ date - convert , ” and put it in my ~/ bin directory , which is in my $ PATH .
If it ’s called without any arguments , like this
date - convert
it will print out the current date in seven different calendars :
Gregorian : Tuesday , April 8 , 2008 ISO : Day 2 of week 15 of 2008 Julian : March 26 , 2008 Hebrew : Nisan 3 , 5768 Islamic : Rabi II 1 , 1429 Chinese : Cycle 78 , year 25 ( Wu - Zi ) , month 3 ( Bing - Chen ) , day 3 ( Wu - Yin ) Mayan : Long count = 12.19.15.4.2 ; tzolkin = 2 Ik ; haab = 5 Pop
If it ’s called with three numeric parameters — month , day , and year — it will print out that date in those same calendars .
So
date - convert 6 6 1945
leads to
Gregorian : Wednesday , June 6 , 1945 ISO : Day 3 of week 23 of 1945 Julian : May 24 , 1945 Hebrew : Sivan 25 , 5705 Islamic : Jumada II 24 , 1364 Chinese : Cycle 77 , year 22 ( Yi - You ) , month 4 ( Xin - Si ) , day 26 ( Bing - Wu ) Mayan : Long count = 12.16.11.8.10 ; tzolkin = 8 Oc ; haab = 8 Zip
If you give it more or fewer than three arguments , it will behave as if you gave it no arguments and print the current date .
If you give it nonsensical arguments , like letters instead of numbers , it will print an error message from the calendar library .
I do n’t see much point in elaborate error handling in a script this simple .
The world wo n’t come to an end if I give it bad input .
The script can be altered to give fewer or more conversions .
The library can also handle the French Revolutionary , Persian , Coptic , and Ethiopian calendars .
Many very clever things have been written in Elisp .
Using Emacs as an interpreter is a way of bringing those things to you even if you hate Emacs as a text editor .
Update
A later post adapts this into a CGI script .

If you 're a hospital patient and a doctor refers to you as a " rock " it 's probably not a compliment , but try not to take offense if a nurse mutters " S.O.B. " in describing your condition .
Those are just two examples of the common slang and shorthand that reveal one of medicine 's little secrets :
Doctors and nurses gossip just like anyone else , and they 're not above gossiping about the patients they serve .
Some of the jargon is harmless or even useful ; for instance , " S.O.B. " usually is an acronym for shortness of breath .
But medical educators are trying to curtail the use of more callous language that can lead doctors to think of their patients as obstacles to overcome , rather than human beings deserving of empathy .
Medical residents tend to pick up such terms quickly during training , and many said the lingo ranges from humorous to downright nasty .
A patient not in obvious need of surgery may get the tag " lgfd " — short for " looks good from the door . "
But a " rock " describes someone whose condition never seems to get better or worse , creating a hassle for doctors who often see their job as moving patients smoothly through the system .
" It 's implying that these human lives , these suffering people , are no more than mere insults to you , " said Dr. John Schumann , a professor of internal medicine at the University of Chicago Medical Center who tries to prevent medical students from adopting crude habits of speech .
Medical slang is always changing , but doctors say many of the terms in current use appeared a generation ago , when residents routinely endured seemingly endless shifts and a crushing workload that was supposed to prepare them for the rigors of medical practice .
Some residents said they still pick up slang terms from the influential 1978 novel The House of God , one doctor 's fictionalized account of the absurdity and emotional churn of medical training .
One of the most infamous words that book introduced was " gomer , " short for " Get Out of My Emergency Room " — usually for elderly patients with difficult , chronic illnesses .
" Oh , we never use that word anymore , " said Dr. Alexis Dunne , a third - year internal medicine resident at Northwestern University School of Medicine .
" That 's old school . "
But other trainees said the dread word still makes an appearance now and then .
Dr. Mark Obermeyer of Loyola University Medical Center said his colleagues strive not to use offensive language around patients , but some amount of venting is only natural .
" A lot of this work is pretty morbid , " said Obermeyer , a resident in internal medicine and pediatrics .
" If you 're working in an ICU with people who may die any day , you use different ways to keep your mood up . "
Indoctrination into the finer points of slang is part of what many professors call the hidden curriculum of medical school and residency training .
The official coursework requires reading textbooks and paying attention during medical rounds , but the rest comes from watching how older doctors and nurses actually deal with the sometimes overwhelming experience of caring for patients .
A common slip happens when doctors refer to a patient as his or her disease — as in , " the gall bladder in Room 602 " or " the P.E. ( short for pulmonary embolism ) who was admitted last night . "
Gregory Makoul , director of Northwestern 's center for communication and medicine , said such references can make doctors forget the human dimension of their decisions .
" When you start labeling someone as a disease you can't help but see them as a problem and not as a person , " Makoul said .
" We try to get people to recognize that , the power and detriment of that sort of label . "
Some residents note that medical privacy regulations have made doctors and nurses careful about using a patient 's name , which can encourage shorthand such as referring to patients by their diseases
Many medical slang terms revolve around the struggle to get patients in and out of the hospital in as short a time as possible .
Schumann said such concerns reached new heights in the 1980s , when Medicare and many insurance plans began paying hospitals fixed rates according to a patient 's illness , putting a premium on wrapping up care quickly
These outrageously revealing bikini jeans from Sanna 's Brazil Fashion , a Japanese clothing company , blur the line between blue jeans and a string bikini .
Low - riding blue jeans are a fashion trend that seems to have long legs - pun definitely intended .
The only question is , how low can they go ?
Sanna 's Brazil Fashion seems to have given us the answer with their new line of bikini jeans that combine ultra low - cut blue jeans with an integrated string bikini bottom .
The effect is stunning ... outrageously revealing yet extremely flattering , and without showing more skin than a normal bikini displays .
Here they are being modeled on a Japanese TV show .
I 'm guessing this segment caused more seizures in the viewing audience then those Pokemon cartoons of a few years back ...
The eyebrow - raising design is practical as well as provocative , as the bikini portion helps keep the pants securely hitched to the hips .
From the rear , the bikini portion can also serve to mask another fashion trend whose 15 minutes expired some time ago : trashy " tramp stamp " tattoos .
If you 'd like to set a new fashion trend in your neighborhood , you can order the " bijini " , at the Sanna 's Brazil Fashion website .
hile some styles are temporarily out of stock , Sanna 's is offering the Nano Low - Rise Black Jeans Pant - VIP ( shown above ) , priced at 8,950 yen or just under $ 100 per pair .

As BarbinMD and Kevin Drum ( via kidneystones ) and Juan Cole , the Los Angeles Times and others have been pointing out , we 're getting a spew of very suspicious " statistics " in the run-up to General David Petraeus 's congressionally required report on the splurge of blood and bucks that Fred Kagan engineered late last year .
Engineered ( with others , such as retired General Jack Keane ) to give the Cheney - Bush administration cover for ignoring 95 % of the Iraq Study Group 's suggestions for dealing with the debacle Kagan and others helped to create in the first place .
Anybody who has followed even cursorily the surge of propaganda that has accompanied the Iraq war and occupation since March 2002 or so ( when the war drums got their first public pounding ) knew full well we were n't going to get the straight skinny when the time came for an assessment of the administration 's latest maneuver .
Four years ago , these guys were warning the media not to use the term " insurgent " because , they said , there was no such thing in Iraq .
In other words , anybody paying the slightest attention knew , despite General Petraeus 's vaunted integrity , that magical September was going to bring us another boatload of lies .
The folks over at the National Security Network have an analysis to help pre-empt some of those lies .
An excerpt :
There were significant revisions to the way the Pentagon ’s reports measure sectarian violence between its March 2007 report and its June 2007 report .
The original data for the five months before the surge began ( September 2006 through January 2007 ) indicated approximately 5,500 sectarian killings .
In the revised data in the June 2007 report , those numbers had been adjusted to roughly 7,400 killings – a 25 % increase .
These discrepancies have the impact of making the sectarian violence appear significantly worse during the fall and winter of 2006 before the President ’s " surge " began .
[ DOD , 11/2006 .

6/2007 ]
According to figures compiled by the Associated Press , Iraq is suffering approximately double the number of war - related deaths throughout the country compared with last year .
The average daily toll has risen from 33 in 2006 , to 62 so far this year .
Nearly 1,000 more people have been killed in violence across Iraq in the first eight months of this year than in all of 2006 .
The AP tracking includes Iraqi civilians , government officials , police and security forces killed in attacks such as gunfights and bombings , which are frequently blamed on Sunni suicide strikes .
It also includes execution - style killings — largely the work of Shi ’a death squads .
Insurgent deaths are not a part of the Iraqi count .
These figures are considered a minimum and only based on AP reporting .
The actual numbers are likely higher , as many killings go unreported or uncounted .
That said , the AP notes that UN figures for 2006 are higher than the AP’s .
[ AP , 8/25/07 ]
U.S. data on civilian violence is unreliable and excludes most acts affecting sectarian and ethnic cleansing .
" No Iraqi data are reliable and US and Coalition data focus far too much on major bombings , major incidents , killed to the exclusion of wounded , and violent acts to the exclusion of most acts affecting sectarian and ethnic cleansing .
No data can be fully trusted in terms of accuracy .
More importantly , many current metrics are useful largely as measures for counterinsurgency in a nation filled with diverse civil conflicts and where the most violent insurgent acts are only an uncertain indicator of the trends in security and stability . "

An excerpt just can't do it justice .
It ’s really quite a phenomenon .
In every state that has held caucuses this year , we ’ve seen great enthusiasm and excitement — and unprecedented turnout .
My mother and father ( not latte drinkers , btw ) gladly waited in the snow for 2 1 / 2 hours to just get inside the building for their caucus in Maine .
Yet , the caucus system has been met with criticism and disdain by the Clinton campaign , which started after Clinton started losing all the caucuses .
Yesterday , Harry Reid stepped in to quell and rebut the criticism of the caucus system :
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) on Wednesday defended his state ’s January caucus , saying it created a “ tremendous sea change on how politics are looked at in Nevada . ”
His comments came as the campaign for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) has increasingly criticized the caucus system , which has favored Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) in the two senators ’ quest for their party ’s presidential nomination .
Clinton won the popular vote in the Nevada caucus , but she has fallen short on a number of other caucuses , including Saturday ’s in Wyoming .
Reid is one of the most influential uncommitted superdelegates — the members of Congress and state and party officials whose support could tip the nomination to one of the two candidates .
Reid said Wednesday he will continue to stay neutral in the race .
“ In a period of an hour , we had 30,000 new Democrats in Nevada , ” Reid said in defending the Nevada caucus on Wednesday .
“ We had tremendous new participation we ’ve never had before . ”
That was repeated across the country .
You ’d think that would be a cause for celebration in the Democratic party .
And , it is .
But , not for team Clinton .
What ’s most annoying is that the Clinton campaign knew the rules and agreed to play by the rules .
Now , in the middle of the process , they want to change the rules .
Reid put an end to that idea , too :
Some Clinton supporters have suggested that caucus delegates should be treated differently than pledged delegates from states that hold primaries , but Reid seemed to reject that suggestion .
“ If we ’re going to change any of the rules it has to be [ in the ] next election , ” Reid said at a “ fireside chat ” podcast honoring the 75th anniversary of Franklin Delano Roosevelt ’s first such chat .
“ You ca n’t change things that have already taken place . ”
Exactly .
It ’s always the loser who wants to change the rules .
Scientists image a single HIV particle being born
A mapmaker and a mathematician may seem like an unlikely duo , but together they worked out a way to measure longitude – and kept millions of sailors from getting lost at sea .
Now , another unlikely duo , a virologist and a biophysicist at Rockefeller University , is making history of their own .
By using a specialized microscope that only illuminates the cell ’s surface , they have become the first to see , in real time and in plain view , hundreds of thousands of molecules coming together in a living cell to form a single particle of the virus that has , in less than 25 years , claimed more than 25 million lives : HIV .
This work , published in the May 25 advanced online issue of Nature , may not only prove useful in developing treatments for the millions around the globe still living with the lethal virus but the technique created to image its assembly may also change the way scientists think about and approach their own research .
Video available on the front page of http://www.rockefeller.edu/
“ The use of this technique is almost unlimited , ” says Nolwenn Jouvenet , a postdoc who spearheaded this project under the direction of HIV expert Paul Bieniasz and cellular biophysicist Sandy Simon , who has been developing the imaging technique since 1992 .
“ Now that we can actually see a virus being born , it gives us the opportunity to answer previously unanswered questions , not only in virology but in biology in general . ”
Unlike a classical microscope , which shines light through a whole cell , the technique called total internal reflection microscopy only illuminates the cell ’s surface where HIV assembles .
“ The result is that you can see , in exquisite detail , only events at the cell surface .
You never even illuminate anything inside of the cell so you can focus on what you are interested in seeing the moment it is happening , ” says Simon , professor and head of the Laboratory of Cellular Biophysics .
When a beam of light passes through a piece of glass to a cell ’s surface , the energy from the light propagates upward , illuminating the entire cell .
But when that beam is brought to a steeper angle , the light ’s energy reflects off the cell ’s surface , illuminating only the events going on at its most outer membrane .
By zeroing in at the cell ’s surface , the team became the first to document the time it takes for each HIV particle , or virion , to assemble : five to six minutes .
“ At first , we had no idea whether it would take milliseconds or hours , ” says Jouvenet .
“ We just did n’t know . ”
“ This is the first time anyone has seen a virus particle being born , ” says Bieniasz , who is an associate professor and head of the Laboratory of Retrovirology at Rockefeller and a scientist at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center .
“ Not just HIV , ” he clarifies , “ any virus . ”
To prove that what they were watching was virus particles assembling at the surface ( rather than an already assembled virion coming into their field of view from inside the cell ) , the group tagged a major viral protein , called the Gag protein , with molecules that fluoresce , but whose color would change as they packed closer together .
Although many different components gather to form a single virion , the Gag protein is the only one necessary for assembly .
It attaches to the inner face of the cell ’s outer membrane and when enough Gag molecules flood an area , they coalesce in a way that spontaneously forms a sphere .
Simon , Bieniasz and Jouvenet found that the Gag molecules are recruited from the inside of the cell and travel to the cell ’s surface .
When enough Gag molecules get close and start bumping into each other , the cell ’s outer membrane starts to bulge outward into a budding virion and then pinches off to form an individual , infectious particle .
At this point , the researchers showed that the virion is a lone entity , no longer exchanging resources with the cell .
By using tricks from optics and physiology , they were able to watch the steps of viral assembly , budding , and even scission off the cell surface .
With such a view they can start to describe the entire lifeline in the birth of the virus .
“ I think that you can begin to understand events on a different level if you actually watch them happen instead of inferring that they might occur using other techniques , ” says Bieniasz .
“ This technique and this collaboration made that possible . ”
In this tutorial I will show you how to get a simple datastore - backed Django application up and running on the Google App Engine .
I will assume that you are somewhat familiar with Django .
Update 1 : You can download the full set of files from here .
Make sure to fix the sys. path in main.py .
Update 2 : There is now a Turkish translation of this tutorial , courtesy of Türker Sezer .
Update 3 : Now in Russian as well .
Update 4 : Brazilian Portuguese tranlation by Marcio Andrey Oliveira .
Register an app name and install the development kit per the instructions
Step 2 : Create a directory for your application — for this tutorial my application is called mashname :
tmp$ mkdir mashname tmp$ cd mashname
Step 3 : Add a file called main .py to your new directory :
# main .py import os , sys os.environ [ " DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE " ] = " mashname.settings " sys.path.append(" /home/brox/tmp/mashname " )
# Google App Engine imports .
from google.appengine.ext.webapp import util # Force Django to reload its settings .
from django.conf import settings settings .
_target = None import django.core.handlers.wsgi import django.core.signals import django.db import django.dispatch.dispatcher # Log errors . # django.dispatch.dispatcher.connect ( # log_exception , django.core.signals.got_request_exception ) # Unregister the rollback event handler .
django.dispatch.dispatcher.disconnect ( django.db._rollback_on_exception , django.core.signals.got_request_exception ) def main ( ) : # Create a Django application for WSGI .
application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler( ) #
Run the WSGI CGI handler with that application . util.run_wsgi_app( application ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : main ( )
This is basically the same file as suggested here , except I had to set the Python path to be able to test locally .
I also had to set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE — this might not be necessary when running on the App Engine .
I had to disable the error logging which I was not able to get working .
Step 4 : Add a file called app.yaml to the same directory :
application : mashname version : 1 runtime : python api_version : 1 handlers : - url : /.* script : main.py
Make sure to get the application name right .
Step 5 : From your mashname directory , create a new Django project :
tmp /mashname$ django - admin.py startproject mashname
( I ’m assuming that your current Django setup is working as it should . )
Step 6 : You should now be able to test your application :
tmp /mashname$ cd .. tmp$ dev_appserver .py mashname INFO 2008-04-08 19:08:10,023 appcfg.py ]
Checking for updates to the SDK .
INFO 2008-04-08 19:08:10,384 appcfg.py ]
The SDK is up to date .
INFO 2008-04-08 19:08:10,404 dev_appserver_main.py ]
Running application mash name on port 8080 : http://localhost:8080
Point your browser towards http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and you should get the standard Django
It worked !
message .
Step 7 : Create a Django app within the project :
tmp$ cd mashname tmp / mashname$ python mashname / manage .py startapp main
Step 8 : Now it is time to add a model .
We will be creating a simple application that logs all visitors to the data store and displays their IP address and time of visit .
Edit ~/ mashname/mashname/main/models.py so that it looks like this :
# models .py from google.appengine.ext import db class Visitor ( db. Model ) : ip = db.StringProperty ( ) added_on = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True )
There is no need to sync the database since we are not using regular Django models .
Step 9 : Now we create a view that is responsible for both adding data to the Visitor model and showing the previous visitors .
Edit views .py ( in the same directory as models . py ) so that it does what we want :
# views.py from django.http import HttpResponse from mashname.main.models import Visitor def main ( request ) : visitor = Visitor ( ) visitor.ip = request .
META [" REMOTE_ADDR " ] visitor.put ( ) result = " " visitors = Visitor.all( ) visitors.order ( " - added_on " ) for visitor in visitors.fetch ( limit=40 ) : result += visitor.ip + u " visited on " + unicode( visitor.added_on ) + u " " return HttpResponse ( result )
Step 10 : Finally , make your urls .
py point towards the view :
# urls.py from django.conf.urls .defaults import * urlpatterns = patterns ( " " , ( r " ^$ " , " mashname.main.views.main " ) , )
Step 11 : Test your application ( as in step 6 ) and everything should hopefully work .
For each page reload a new entry is added to the Visitor model and shown in the view .
Step 12 : Upload your application to the Google App Engine :
tmp $ appcfg.py update mashname
For the first upload you will have to provide the mail address and password for your Google account .
Step 13 : Enjoy !
To view the final results , go to http://mashname.appspot.com/.

CNN : Many Israelis ' uncomfortable ' with pastor who supports McCain David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday April 9 , 2008

When radical right - wing pastor John C. Hagee announced his support for Republican presidential candidate John McCain last February , McCain , who had sought the endorsement for more than a year , immediately said he was " very honored . "
The Catholic League quickly accused Hagee of being a bigot , who has described the Catholic Church as a " false cult " and " the Great Whore of Revelation 17 , " and since then the McCain campaign has maintained its distance from Hagee .
In contrast , many conservative Jews and Israelis have welcomed Hagee as a fervent supporter of Israel , who rejects the idea of a two - state solution and has given financial help to the illegal West Bank settlements .
" The Jewish people are a chosen people , they are a cherished people , they are the apple of God 's eye , " Hagee recently stated while visiting Jerusalem with 1000 of his followers .
Some Israelis , however , are disturbed by the doctrine of " pre-millenial dispensationalism , " which holds that the rise of Israel will lead to the second coming of Christ and a final apocalyptic battle in which Jews must either accept Christianity or perish .
Many liberal Jews also find Hagee 's extremist politics unacceptable .
For example , he has advocated " a pre-emptive military strike against Iran to fulfill Gods plan for both Israel and the West a biblically prophesied end - time confrontation with Iran , which will lead to the Rapture , Tribulation , and Second Coming of Christ . "
Hagee 's beliefs were denounced last week by the president of the Union for Reform Judaism , Rabbi Eric Yoffie .
" If implemented , these views would mean disaster for Israel , and would lead to diplomatic isolation , increased violence and the loss of Israels Jewish majority , " Yoffie stated .
Yoffie also noted that " Christian Zionist leaders have engaged in repeated attacks , expressed sometimes in shocking and unacceptable language , directed against other religious traditions .
This is not a matter of highlighting differences in belief but of making use of overheated rhetoric that spews hatred and vitriol toward the Muslim and Catholic faiths . "
Rev .
Hagee shot back that " Rabbi Yoffie 's speech demonstrates not only a lack of respect for me but a troubling lack of respect for the truth . "
There are now suggestions that the two men may meet to discuss their differences .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. summer gasoline demand will shrink for the first time since 1991 as skyrocketing pump prices and the wider economic malaise hit holiday plans , the Energy Information Administration forecast on Tuesday .

With some regions seen facing the shock of $ 4 a gallon gasoline this summer , fuel demand could contract 0.4 percent from 2007 as cars and gas - guzzling SUVs spend more time in driveways and less on highways .
It would be the first decline in summer gasoline use since a recession choked the U.S. economy 17 years ago .
Many analysts forecast that this year ’s housing crisis , credit crunch and high oil prices could cause an economic retraction .
“ The economy did have a slight recession in 1991 , so that ’s one similarity between that year and this ( year ) , ” said EIA administrator Guy Caruso .
“ We are projecting a small recession for the first half of the year , ” he said .
Meanwhile , several U.S. senators urged the Federal Trade Commission to prohibit manipulation in petroleum markets .
“ Record energy prices and industry profits are coming at a time when supply and demand suggest that prices should be significantly lower , ” said Sen. Olympia Snowe , Republican of Maine .
Even though gasoline inventories hit a 15 - year high on April 1 , the EIA forecast record gasoline prices , citing expensive crude oil .
The agency said crude should average $ 97 a barrel this summer , up $ 30 from last year .
Gasoline prices will peak in June at an average $ 3.62 a gallon , the EIA predicted , with an average of $ 3.54 for April - September , up 61 cents from the previous driving season .
Truckers also will feel the sting at the pumps , with diesel prices to average $ 3.73 a gallon this summer , up 88 cents from last year , after hitting a monthly peak of $ 3.91 in April .
CRUDE SUPPORTS
U.S crude shot to a record $ 111.80 a barrel in March as investors seeking to hedge against inflation rushed into commodities , helping to push retail gasoline prices to an all - time high of $ 3.33 a gallon this week .
The EIA now forecasts the price of oil -- which accounts for 70 percent the cost of making gasoline -- should average over $ 100 a barrel for 2008 , and $ 103 in May and June .
Strong oil demand outside the United States should keep crude prices high this year , despite large fuel supplies and tepid demand in the world ’s top oil consumer , the agency said .
“ The combination of rising world oil consumption and low surplus production capacity is putting upward pressure on oil prices , ” the EIA said .
In absolute terms , the EIA forecast that U.S. summer gasoline demand should slip to 9.404 million barrels per day during the first half of 2008 , down 36,000 bpd from last year .
A U.S. economic turnaround in the second half should push annual growth to 1.2 percent for the year , still the lowest rate since 2001 , the agency said .
Lower U.S. fuel demand should drag down gasoline imports this summer by 91,000 bpd to 1.074 million bpd against year ago levels , while domestic gasoline production should fall 20,000 bpd to 8.241 million bpd .
An injection that dramatically relieved the symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease within minutes would qualify as the discovery of the decade .
That is exactly what was claimed yesterday for an experimental treatment being tested in America .
Scientists at the Institute for Neurological Research at the University of California have treated around 50 patients at a private clinic by injecting an anti-arthritic drug , etanercept , into the spinal column in the neck and then tilting the patients to encourage the drug to flow to the brain .
They claim 90 per cent respond to the treatment , usually within minutes , and have released videos of patients to prove it .

In one , a nurse sits down with an 82 - year - old patient , Marvin Millar , who frowns and mumbles incoherently as she asks him identify everyday objects such as a bracelet and a pencil , which he is unable to do .
But five minutes after being injected with etanercept – according to the film which was supplied and edited by the clinic – he greets his wife .
Visibly shocked , she says he has not recognised her for years .
Mr Miller then hugs her .
In a separate interview , also supplied by the clinic , she describes his improvements four weeks later , saying he makes sense 90 per cent of the time now , compared with none of the time before treatment started .
After the BBC reported the claims yesterday , callers jammed the Alzheimer 's Society 's helpline demanding details of the treatment .
Experts urged caution , warning that the drug had been tried on only a very few patients and , crucially , had not been tested against a placebo in a randomised controlled trial .
Etanercept is not a new drug , but this is a novel use of it .
The California researchers injected it between the cervical vertebrae at the back of the neck , just below the skull , directly into the spinal column .
Tilting is thought to encourage the drug to cross the blood - brain barrier .
In arthritis , the drug blocks a chemical – tumour necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF ) – which causes inflammation and pain in the joints .
It is thought TNF may also influence inflammation in the brain , and that by damping down the process the drug may preserve brain function .
Professor Edward Tobinick , who is leading the research , said : " What we see is an improvement in ability to think and calculate , memory improves , verbal ability improves , [ patients ] find words easier , they seem happier and we often also see an improvement in gait in patients whose gait is affected . "
The researchers said improvement usually continued with weekly injections until it reached a plateau at about three months .
Some patients had been taking it for three years .
But they have only published details of 15 patients in a pilot study .
An estimated 400,000 people suffer from Alzheim - er 's disease in the UK and claims for new treatments are seized upon by relatives , desperate for any straw to clutch .
Suzanne Sorenson , head of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said she had been sceptical of the claims when she heard about them in January but having seen the film foot - age , considered it was now time to run a trial .
" On the surface these results are exciting but we need to treat the study with caution , " she said .
" There are large gaps in the resear - ch , which used a small pilot group .
We cannot draw conclusions until a controlled trial is carried out . "
Clive Holmes , professor of biological psychiatry at Southampton University , a centre for research on dementia , said he was prepared to test the drug .
" The evidence from basic science suggests it is worth giving these drugs a trial to see if there is evidence on a larger basis , " he said .
The elusive search for a cure
* A hundred years after Alzheimer 's disease was discovered , a cure for the progressive neurodegenerative condition remains a distant dream .
Despite dramatic breakthroughsin other areas , there has been little to celebrate in Alzheimer's .
The main advance has been drugs to control symptoms such as agitation and restlessness .
But restoring memory and cognitive ability has proved much harder .
The condition is caused by an accumulation of protein deposits in the brain which produce the symptoms of dementia .
There are three drugs with claims to halt the disease 's progression ( though not reverse it ) , Aricept , Reminyl and Exelon .
In 2005 their NHS use was restricted to the moderate stage of the disease – as opposed to early or late stages – by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence because of their limited effect .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Lee Iacocca , author of " Where Have All the Leaders Gone ? "
With DaimlerChrysler ( Charts ) looking to unload its troubled U.S. division , Fortune 's Alex Taylor III caught up with Iacocca , the 82 - year - old former Chrysler chairman and CEO , to talk about the future of Detroit - and the fate of his old company .
Your third book , due out this month , is about the state of American leadership .
How is Detroit doing on that score ?
I give [ GM CEO ] Rick Wagoner a lot of credit .
He had a lot of pressure on him , but he kept his cool and he stayed with his plan .
Their styling is getting better , and they 're doing better .
Ford ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) has more difficult problems than GM ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
It has so much invested in the truck business ; it has got to get some good cars .
I think this new guy from Boeing [ CEO Alan Mulally ] knows the business pretty well - not the auto business , but he knows what it takes to run a big organization and deal with the labor unions .
As for Chrysler , [ president ]
Tom La Sorda is doing a great job in manufacturing , but I do n't know what 's going to happen .
I 'm reading about it every day .
I would hate to see Chrysler go under .
It would be tough to live with .
There are four apparent bidders for Chrysler , including Kirk Kerkorian 's Tracinda , which has offered $ 4.5 billion .
What is your take ?
He 's a gambler , and I do n't know what his end game would be .
He 'll be 90 years old in June , but he 's a healthy guy and he exercises a lot .
Twelve years ago we [ Kerkorian and I ] tried to take over Chrysler , and we could n't raise the money .
I 've decided to stay neutral on this one .
Who do you think will end up with Chrysler ?
Who knows ?
Private - equity funds scare me .
Do they really understand the car business ?
I would like to see somebody with a leadership group that has the experience to handle the dealers and the employees .
If I had the money , I 'd buy it .
I 'd come out of retirement to buy it .
Chrysler builds great cars .
Maybe you can sell off Jeep , but I 'd hate to see it busted up .
Why did the merger fail ?
There were no synergies .
None .
And culturally the Germans operated differently than the Americans .
Chrysler was like a renegade outfit compared to them .
It was emotional when Chrysler sold out to the Germans .
It 's extra-emotional now that the Germans are selling - they 're throwing us to the curb , in effect .
If you were back as chairman and CEO of Chrysler , what would you be doing ?
To succeed today , you have to set priorities , decide what you stand for .
You can't do all things for all people .
I think the model lines are too complicated at all the Big Three - too many different kinds of cars for customers to assimilate what they 're being sold .
There 's no easy answer .
It 's hard work .
Find good people , stay with it , and things will be okay .
President Bush said the auto companies should get relevant and compete , and I got the shivers .
Mr Hu has campaigned on several human rights issues
Hu Jia with his family A prominent activist who publicised human rights abuses across China has been convicted of subversion and jailed for three - and - a - half years .
Hu Jia , 34 , was convicted of " inciting subversion of state power and the socialist system " , his lawyer said .
He has long campaigned for the environment , religious freedom and for the rights of people with HIV and Aids .
His sentence comes a day after a rights group accused China of a campaign to silence dissent ahead of the Olympics .
The US was " dismayed " by the verdict , a spokeswoman for the US embassy in Beijing said , while the European Union called for Mr Hu's immediate release .
" We said very clearly before the trial that he should not have been detained in the first place and that he should be released and this remains our position , " Beijing spokesman William Fingleton told the French news agency AFP .
Internet articles Hu Jia 's case has attracted a great deal of international attention , both from rights groups and Western diplomats .
Before his arrest late last year , he had been an outspoken critic of China 's record on a variety of human rights issues .
As for critics ' view that China is trying to increase its efforts to arrest dissidents ahead the Olympic Games , I think all these accusations are unfounded
Premier Wen Jiabao ,
18 March 2008
Anguish over sentence Correspondents say he had become a kind of one - man clearing house for information , passing it on to journalists , organisations and foreign embassies .
Evidence presented against Mr
Hu in court included interviews he gave to foreign media and political articles that he wrote for the internet , lawyer Li Fangping said .
" As lawyers we propose that Hu Jia appeal this sentence but it is up to him and we will wait for his decision , " Mr Li said .
" We have not had a chance to exchange ideas with him so far . "
Chinese state news agency Xinhua said the court had been lenient with Mr Hu because he had admitted his crimes .
" Hu spread malicious rumours , libel and instigation in an attempt to subvert the state 's political and socialist systems , " Xinhua said , quoting the court ruling .
Olympic claims Mr Hu's conviction comes only two weeks after another activist , Yang Chunlin , was jailed on similar charges .
On Wednesday , UK - based rights group Amnesty International accused Beijing of carrying out a " wave of repression " ahead of the Olympic Games .
The authorities were targeting those who criticised the government in a bid to present a stable and harmonious image when the Games began in August , the group said .
In response , the China Society for Human Rights Studies accused Amnesty of bias and of ignoring positive developments in the country 's human rights record .
Last month , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was asked about Hu Jia 's case .
He said it should be handled according to the law .
" As for critics ' view that China is trying to increase its efforts to arrest dissidents ahead the Olympic Games , I think all these accusations are unfounded , " he said .

Christian Urban Legends
Six fictional events that were exposed
by the Institute for Creation Research .
Sponsored link .
Below are listed six of the Christian urban legends exposed as false by the Institute for Creation Research in their Science , Scripture and Salvation radio program on 1999 - APR - 17 : 1 Charles Darwin 's deathbed conversion : A woman by the name of Lady Hope allegedly visited Darwin shortly before he died and heard his deathbed conversion to Christianity .
This event might have happened , but it is extremely doubtful .
Lady
Hope did visit Darwin , but it was originally believed to be " in the fall of 1881 , about 6 months before Darwin died . "
2
Many historians believe that he had lost his faith completely some 30 years before his death , when his beloved daughter Annie died .
One researcher , Richard Rorty , tracked down over 100 occurrences of the legend , and successfully showed that Lady Hope ( Elizabeth Cotton ) did exist , and probably did visit Darwin near the end of his life .
But he discounts the possibility that Darwin abandoned his Agnostic beliefs .
His family energetically denied his conversion .
His daughter Henrietta commented in 1922 : " I was present at his deathbed .
Lady
Hope was not present during his last illness , or any illness .
I believe he never even saw her , but in any case she had no influence over him in any department of thought or belief .
He never recanted any of his scientific views , either then or earlier .
We think the story of his conversion was fabricated in the U.S.A. . . .
The whole story has no foundation whatever . "
3
The fable appeared in the 1955 - OCT issue of the Reformation Review and in the 1957 - FEB issue of the Record of the Free Church of Scotland .
It circulates widely on the Internet via Email and is seen on many creation science web sites .
Charles Darwin confesses evolution is a hoax :
We received an E- mail in 2003 - SEP which said that evolution is a hoax .
Darwin just " thought it up " and presented it as truth even though he knew it had no evidence to back it up .
It is doubtful that anyone reading Darwin 's books ( On the origin of species , The descent of man , The voyage of the Beagle : Charles Darwin 's Journal of Researchers , Charles Darwin's Zoology Notes and Specimen Lists from H.M.S. Beagle , and his autobiography ) could come to this conclusion .
His finding that evolution happened and happens through natural selection is based on a massive number of observations of nature .
There is a second indicator that Darwin was serious about his theory : why would he have exposed himself to such hatred and vilification from religious sources if he did not believe that his conclusions were accurate ?
The missing day of Joshua :
This urban legend refers to a computer program at NASA which experienced an apparent bug .
In some versions of the legend , Mr. Harold Hill , president of the Curtis Engine Company in Baltimore Maryland publicized the event .
The NASA computers were running a program that computed the locations of the sun , moon , and planets at any time in the future or past .
The purpose of the program was to prevent artificial satellites from colliding with these objects .
This allegation is a good indication that the story is an urban legend .
Even satellites which are in geosynchronous orbit are only 22,241 miles ( 35,786 kilometers ) above the surface of the earth , whereas the moon is more than ten times further away , and the sun and planets are tens of millions of miles from earth .
4
So there is no possibility of a collision , and thus no need for such a program .
The legend maintains that the program allegedly failed consistently at a specific date in the past .
Exactly 23 hours and 20 minutes was missing back in the time of Joshua .
Someone at NASA allegedly went back to his / her office , read Joshua 10:12 - 13 , ( which talks about an interval of missing time approximately one day in duration ) and the account of Isaiah 's visit to Hezekiah in 2 Kings 20:8 - 11 when God was said to have caused the sun to go backwards by 10 degrees and produce an additional 40 minutes lost time .
This information accounted precisely for the entire loss of time .
The main problem with this legend is that computer programs could n't fail in this way , even if a day were missing ; the program would continue to subtract dates in times in increments of 24 hours .
5
NASA 's Public Affairs office has stated that " There is no truth to the recurring story that NASA uncovered a lost day in the movement of the Earth . " However , Harold Hill publicized the legend in one of his books " How to Live Like a Kings ' Kid . " 6
Snopes.com comments that this is a very important urban legend for those who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible .
It it were true then :
It would show that the Joshua passage is literally true , even though its description of missing time seems very strange to - day .
It shows that the Bible authors knew more about science than do the scientists .
Scientists and religion collided and the Bible is proven superior .
Unfortunately for Bible literalists , the legend is not true .
Sponsored link : Janet Reno critical of Christians :
This rumor became public in a 1993 conservative Christian newsletter .
It was later widely circulated by Email and Fax .
It involved former Attorney General Janet Reno being interviewed on 60 Minutes .
She allegedly defined what a cult member is : " A cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bible and the Second Coming of Christ ; who frequently attends Bible studies ; who has a high level of financial giving to a Christian cause ; who home schools for their children ; who has accumulated survival foods and has a strong belief in the Second Amendment ; and who distrusts big government .
Any of these may qualify ( a person as a cultist ) but certainly more than one would cause us to strongly look at this person as a threat , and his family as being in a risk situation that qualified for government interference .
Waco was one of those situations that qualified under our definition of people being at risk that necessitates government action to save them . "
According to the Justice department , the controversial statement first appeared in the " Paul Revere Newsletter " published by the Christian Defense League in Flora IL in its 1993 - AUG issue .
7
The facts are that Ms. Reno had never appeared on 60 Minutes prior to the time that the rumor started to circulate .
She avoids using the term " cult " and " cultist . "
She as never defined either of them in public .
The story was triggered by a newsletter in Illinois who later printed a retraction .
8
Unfortunately , once urban legends are launched they are often unstoppable .
Earthquakes are increasing :
The rumor is that earthquakes have been increasing in frequency and / or intensity in recent years .
This legend is often heard in connection with end - time prophecy - predictions about a coming end - of - the - world scenario .
This is commonly called TEOTWAWKI ( The End Of The World As We Know It ) .
Conservative Christians generally interpret Matthew 24:6 - 16 as predicting the precursors that will be observed prior to the tribulation , rapture , second coming of Jesus , war of Armageddon , etc. Matthew 24:7 states : " ... there will be earthquakes in diverse places . "
Near the close of the 20th century , many religious conservative anticipated the end of the world in their immediate future , perhaps in the year 2000 .
They naturally assume that the Bible 's predictions refer to the present time , and that earthquakes are currently on the increase .
Actually , they are decreasing .
Geologist Steve Austin said on the ICR program that he has a data base containing information on about 4 million earthquakes .
Their frequency has been decreasing during the 20th century .
Vultures multiply in the valley of Armageddon : According to the Book of Revelation , massive armies will converge on this valley to wage war .
The vulture legend has been traced to a Christian tract published in the 1970's .
It said that ornithologists have observed that vultures in that area have been laying twice as many eggs as normal .
The suggestion is that the birds are building up the population of scavengers , preparing for an upcoming war with its availability of dead bodies to munch on .
The story , of course , is groundless .

From Queerty :
We previously informed you that North Carolina Governor Mike Easley used the word “ pansy ” in his Hillary Clinton endorsement .
Said Easley , “ [ Mrs. Clinton ] makes Rocky Balboa look like a pansy . ”
One reader sent us a note on this poor word choice , which we ’d like to share :
You might point out [ to your ] readers that one would use that term , say , when chasing a gay guy with intent to harm .
Or , say , not hiring him .
Or maybe not letting him rent an apartment in one ’s building .
I expect more from her .
She ’s no dummy .
She knows exactly what that word means .
Considering the Senator ’s silence , we get the impression that she simply does n’t care .
And this is a gay ally ?
Taichung – the world ’s greatest CO2 emissions coal power plant
Location : TaiwanEmissions : 41,300,000 Tons CO2 per yearMWh Energy : 45,100,000
Intensity : 1,832 The plant emits the most carbon dioxide per coal power plants in the world and number two is 3500 tons behind .
What ’s pathetic is the fact that this country emits more in a year than 65 countries COMBINED .
What ’s even more pathetic is the fact that the plant emits more than 144 individual countries .
This single power plant almost emits as much in a year as does Ireland .

Neither Clinton nor Obama can win before convention Bottom line :
It'll take the convention to determine Democratic nominee
Neither Clinton nor Obama can win enough delegates before the convention
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , D - N.Y. , seen at a primary night rally , won the popular vote in the Democratic primary in Texas but may not be the ultimate winner in the state .

Resting up after a bruising primary battle , Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama left Texas in their rearview mirrors Wednesday and headed home to plan for three more months of political combat .
But even as the candidates tried to decipher the daunting math required to lock up the closest Democratic presidential race in a half - century , their surrogates squabbled over which candidate actually won the most delegates in Texas .
The Lone Star State 's complicated delegate - selection methods gave both campaigns a plausible reason to claim victory .
In final , unofficial results , Clinton won the popular vote , 51 percent to 48 percent .
But Obama backers boasted that the Illinois senator had won a majority of the state 's pledged delegates — a result of his ability to mobilize supporters in the evening caucuses , which account for about one - third of the delegates selected Tuesday .
" It could be our Texas version of ' Dewey Defeats Truman , ' " said Waco Rep . Chet Edwards , an Obama supporter , referring to the infamous Chicago Tribune headline that misstated the 1948 election results .
" After all the confetti and uncorked champagne bottles , it could turn out that Obama won Texas . "
Projections released Wednesday afternoon by the Texas Democratic Party based on still - incomplete caucus returns indicated that Obama would receive 98 delegates elected Tuesday to Clinton 's 95 .
Clinton led Obama in delegates selected as a result of primary voting , 65 to 61 , while Obama appears headed for a 37 - to - 30 edge among delegates selected through the caucuses .
Including elected officials and party leaders with automatic " superdelegate " status , the two candidates are dead even at 107 Texas delegates , with 14 superdelegates still uncommitted .
But whichever campaign ends up with Texas bragging rights , Clinton 's narrow 12 - delegate edge in Tuesday 's contests in Texas , Ohio , Rhode Island and Vermont has done little to change the intricate delegate dynamics of 2008 .
Bottom line :
With just 600 delegates up for grabs and front - runner Obama 658 short of the 2,025 needed for victory , it is mathematically impossible for either candidate to clinch the nomination before the process is scheduled to end with Puerto Rico 's June 7 caucuses .
Obama remains in the overall delegate lead , 1,567 to 1,462 , according to Associated Press estimates .
With neither candidate able to wrap up the nomination during the primary season , Clinton and Obama must try to seal the deal by courting the 350 still - uncommitted superdelegates , including 14 from Texas .
These party insiders get invitations to the Democratic National Convention in Denver based on their elected positions or leadership role in the party .
" The key to the nomination is the superdelegates , " said University of Houston government professor Christine LeVeaux - Haley .
" The superdelegates seemed to lean to Clinton before Super Tuesday .
With her now proving that she is a viable candidate — again — the superdelegates who have been leaning toward Clinton will stick with her . "
Going after superdelegates
To influence any undecided superdelegates , Clinton and Obama will try to build a sense of momentum over the next three months .
Their goal is to be the candidate with the most elected delegates — something that is becoming increasingly difficult for Clinton to do .
The former first lady would need to win more than 60 percent of the remaining primary election delegates to catch up with Obama .
" We are vigorously talking to the uncommitted automatic delegates , " Clinton adviser Harold Ickes told reporters .
" The Obama campaign is doing the same thing . "
Clinton 's aim in the next two months is to convince currently uncommitted superdelegates that she is the Democrat most likely to defeat Arizona Sen .
John McCain in swing states such as Ohio , Pennsylvania and Florida .
But Obama , who has won far more states and total votes than Clinton , counters by citing polls indicating that he runs stronger than Clinton against McCain .
He also tells superdelegates that it is their moral obligation to back the choice of most rank - and - file Democrats .
" I cannot imagine party insiders , behind closed doors , overturning the votes of millions of Democrats , " said Edwards .
Florida , Michigan re-votes ?
A potential wild card is the continuing battle inside the Democratic National Committee over the seating of delegates from Florida and Michigan , two states whose convention votes have been taken away because they scheduled January primaries in violation of party rules .
But governors of both states are talking about arranging for a June re-vote if private funding can be arranged to cover the costs .
For very different reasons , the idea unites Clinton and GOP leaders .
Republicans see these " do- overs " as an opportunity to drain Democratic resources and create additional tension between the two foes .
Clinton 's strategists eye an opportunity to erase Obama 's edge .
" It could turn into the most expensive primary contest in the history of the world , " said Harris County Democratic Chairman Gerald Birnberg .
In the meantime , Birnberg has some advice for the exhausted and edgy rivals : " Both of the candidates need to take about three or four days off and chill . "
That 's not likely to happen .
Obama wants to regain the upper hand with wins in Wyoming on Saturday , where just 12 delegates are at stake , and Mississippi next Tuesday , when voters pick 33 more .
With just 10 states left to weigh in , Obama hopes to avoid a catastrophic defeat and end the primary season in June with a significant lead in elected delegates .
Pennsylvania is key
Clinton is hoping for a split in the coming week 's contests and then a resounding win April 22 in Pennsylvania , the last big contest currently on the primary calendar , with 158 delegates up for grabs .
It 's a state that should be natural Clinton territory , with its large number of struggling manufacturing workers , high proportion of senior citizens and large number of blue - collar Catholic voters — all Clinton constituencies .
The Democrat - only primary also excludes independent voters who have strongly supported Obama in other states .
And to those who think that Texas ' involvement in the selection process is over , consider this :
The Texas state Democratic convention falls on the same day as the Puerto Rico primary , so Texas could still come back into play as Clinton and Obama struggle to claim every single vote tied to the still - unsettled Tuesday caucuses .

Journalists , bloggers are threats in terror drill Associated Press

It 's the government 's idea of a really bad day : Washington 's Metro trains shut down .
Seaport computers in New York go dark .
Bloggers reveal locations of railcars with hazardous materials .
Airport control towers are disrupted in Philadelphia and Chicago .
Overseas , a mysterious liquid is found on London 's subway .
And that 's just for starters .
Those incidents were among dozens of detailed , mock disasters confronting officials rapid - fire in the U.S. government 's biggest - ever " Cyber Storm " war game , according to hundreds of pages of heavily censored files obtained by The Associated Press .
The Homeland Security Department ran the exercise to test the nation 's hacker defenses , with help from the State Department , Pentagon , Justice Department , CIA , National Security Agency and others .
The laundry list of fictional catastrophes  which include hundreds of people on " No Fly " lists suddenly arriving at airport ticket counters  is significant because it suggests what kind of real - world trouble keeps people in the White House awake at night .
Imagined villains include hackers , bloggers and even reporters .
After mock electronic attacks overwhelmed computers at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , an unspecified " major news network " airing reports about the attackers refused to reveal its sources to the government .
Other simulated reporters were duped into spreading " believable but misleading " information that worsened fallout by confusing the public and financial markets , according to the government 's files .
The $ 3 million , invitation - only war game simulated what the U.S. described as plausible attacks over five days in February 2006 against the technology industry , transportation lines and energy utilities by anti-globalization hackers .
The government is organizing another multimillion - dollar war game , Cyber Storm 2 , to take place in early March .
" They point out where your expectations of your capabilities may be overstated , " Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told the AP .
" They may reveal to you things you have n't thought about .
It 's a good way of testing that you 're going to do the job the way you think you were .
It 's the difference between doing drills and doing a scrimmage . "
The AP obtained the Cyber Storm internal records nearly two years after it requested them under the Freedom of Information Act .
The government censored most of the 328 pages it turned over , marked " For Official Use Only , " citing rules preventing the disclosure of sensitive information .
" Definitely a challenging scenario , " said Scott C. Algeier , who runs a cyber - defense group for leading technology companies , the Information Technology Information Sharing and Analysis Center .
For the participants  including government officials from the United States , England , Canada , Australia and New Zealand and executives from leading technology and transportation companies  the mock disasters came fast and furious :
Hacker break - ins at an airline ; stolen commercial software blueprints ; problems with satellite navigation systems ; trouble with police radios in Montana ; school closures in Washington , Miami and New York ; computer failures at border checkpoints .
The incidents were divided among categories : computer attacks , physical attacks or psychological operations .
" We want to stress these players , " said Jeffrey Wright , the former Cyber Storm director for the Homeland Security Department .
" None of the players took 100 percent of the correct , right actions .
If they had , we would n't have done our job as planners . "
How did they do ?
Reviews were mixed .
Companies and governments worked successfully in some cases .
But key players did n't understand the role of the premier U.S. organization responsible for fending off major cyber attacks , called the National Cyber Response Coordination Group , and it did n't have enough technical experts .
Also , the sheer number of mock attacks complicated defensive efforts .
The little - known Cyber Response group , headed by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security , represents the largest U.S. government departments  including law enforcement and intelligence agencies  and is the principal organization for responding to cyber attacks and recovering from them .
The exercise had no impact on the real Internet .
Officials said they were careful to simulate attacks only using isolated computers , working from basement offices at the Secret Service 's headquarters in downtown Washington .
However , the government 's files hint at a tantalizing mystery :
In the middle of the war game , someone quietly attacked the very computers used to conduct the exercise .
Perplexed organizers traced the incident to overzealous players and sent everyone an urgent e-mail marked " IMPORTANT ! " reminding them not to probe or attack the game computers .
" Any time you get a group of ( information technology ) experts together , there 's always a desire , ' Let 's show them what we can do , ' " said George Foresman , a former senior Homeland Security official who oversaw Cyber Storm .
" Whether its intent was embarrassment or a prank , we had to temper the enthusiasm of the players . "
This video is from The Associated Press , broadcast January 31 , 2008 .
A woman who described graphic hardcore pornography to her blind husband has been given a suspended jail sentence for downloading child abuse films .
Sylvia Pearce , 59 , from Ivybridge , Devon , admitted three counts of making an indecent image of a child .
Her barrister said she was just a naive woman " finding her way " on the net .
She was sentenced to eight months for each count to run concurrently , suspended for two years , and ordered to sign the sex offenders ' register .
' Utterly disgusting '
Plymouth Crown Court heard Pearce downloaded three films , which showed scenes of children as young as eight engaging in sexual acts with adults and each other .
The three films were part of a library of hardcore adult pornography so large it would be impossible to view it all , the court was told .
Prosecutors told the court the pornography was discovered when police were at Pearce 's home for an unrelated matter in February 2007 .
When interviewed by police , Pearce claimed she downloaded them " for a laugh " and would describe the films to her husband , who was not named in court .
In mitigation , defending barrister Piers Norsworthy said its was a case of a naive woman who was " finding her way on the internet " and that , as a grandmother , the idea of child pornography was " abhorrent to her " .
Judge Francis Gilbert QC rejected the claim .
Sentencing Pearce , he said : " She knew exactly what she was doing and this was utterly disgusting and depraved . "
The judge said he would have immediately sent her to prison were it not for her age and that she had to care for her husband .
" To err is human , " the old joke goes .
" But to really mess things up requires a computer . "
This Answer Line collection concentrates on the absolute disasters of Windows computing -- the problems that threaten your PC , your career , and your peace of mind .
Here 's what to do when Windows throws the dreaded Blue Screen of Death your way , and how to restore your OS even if you 've lost the original restore CD .

Why Does My PC Keep Dying With a Blue Screen of Death ?
Gael Busson , Montreal , Quebec , Canada
What 's worse than the sudden , unexpected appearance of a blue screen filled with white text ?
Recurring appearances of blue screens filled with white text .
The fewer times you have to read the maddeningly passive - voice observation " A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down … , " the better .
Microsoft calls these freeze - frame moments " stop errors , " but everyone else uses a much more descriptive title : The Blue Screen of Death ( BSoD ) .
They occur whenever Windows senses a problem that wo n't let it operate properly .
When you encounter a BSoD , there 's not much you can do except mourn your lost data ( whatever was in memory but not yet saved to disk ) , reboot your machine , and go on with your life .
If you start getting them regularly , however , you have a problem that must be addressed .
The question is , what 's causing the problem ?
Believe it or not , BSoD screens actually contain some useful information - - albeit not much .
The next time your monitor and mood suddenly turn blue , grab a pen and a sheet of paper and jot these items down before rebooting :
• The problem description : Write down whatever text appears between the boilerplate first paragraph ( " A problem has been detected … " ) and the one that begins " If this is the first time … "
• ??? Technical details :
Write down everything that appears under the heading ' Technical information ' .
Once you 've rebooted , use your favorite Internet search engine to find pages that mention both BSoD and some of the terms that you jotted down .
The statement in all caps with underlines instead of spaces will likely be useful here .
If a Web search does n't yield helpful information , ask yourself what has changed on your PC lately .
Did you add hardware or update a driver just before the problem became common ?
Bad drivers often give Windows the blues .
If you recently updated a driver , try reverting to an older version .
Here 's how :
1. ???
Select Start , Run ( in Vista , Run is enough ) , type devmgmt.msc , and press Enter .
2. ???
Double - click the device in question , click the Driver tab , and then click the Roll Back Driver button .
Conversely , if you recently added new hardware to your system , installing a more recent version of the driver may fix the problem .
Check the vendor 's
Web site to see whether there 's an update .
A bad RAM module is another potential cause of BSoDs .
You can test your modules easily with Memtest 86 , a free program downloadable at Memtest.org .
Memtest is n't a Windows program , and you must boot it before running it .
You can download it as a CD image .iso file .
Nero , Easy Media , and other disc - authoring programs can easily burn this .iso file into a bootable CD .
Once you 've burned the CD , boot and see whether Memtest finds any problems .
Overheating is another common culprit .
Check your computer 's air vents for blockage .
If you have a desktop , open it and use an air canister to remove any dust you find .
( If you have a laptop , check with your vendor to see whether you can clean out dust without resorting to professional intervention . )
And while your desktop is open , check the internal connections to confirm that all of them are firmly attached .
A loose connection is yet another possible cause of Blue Screens of Death .
As with virtually every other major Windows problem , the fault may lie not in your hardware , but in your Registry .
If you can , use System Restore to return that great compendium of necessities and problems to the state it was in on a date before the problem arose .
Or you can try running a Registry cleaner .
As I have in the past , I recommend ToniArts ' free EasyCleaner and ChemTable 's $ 40 Reg Organizer for this purpose .
If all else fails , back up your data and take your PC to a professional .
It 's OK to admit that you can't fix some things yourself .
Max Tegmark and Flora Lopis have been working hard on teaching the 8.033 course on relativity at MIT .
They publish it today on the arXiv saying :
“ To maximize the learning experience from this technical review , the reader is encouraged to sing it to the tune of Yellow Submarine , with italicized lines going like the chorus … ”
Romer measured the speed of light ,
and something basic just was n’t right .
because Michaelson and Morley
showed that aether fit data poorly .
We jump to 1905 .
In Einstein ’s brain , ideas thrive :
“ The laws of nature must be the same
in every inertial frame ”
We all believe in relativity , relativity , relativity .
Yes we all believe in relativity , 8.033 , relativity .
Einstein ’s postulates imply
that planes are shorter when they fly .
Their clocks are slowed by time dilation ,
and look warped from aberration .
Cos theta - prime is cos theta minus beta … over one minus beta cos theta .
Yes we all believe in relativity , 8.033 , relativity .
With the Lorentz transformation ,
we calculate the relation
between Chris ’s and Zoe ’s frame ,
but all invariants , they are the same .
Like B dot E and B - squared minus E-squared ,
… and the rest mass squared which is E - squared minus p-squared .
’cos we all believe in relativity , 8.033 , relativity
Soon physicists had a proclivity
for using relativity .
But nukes made us all scared
because E = mc2 .
Everything is relative , even simultaneity ,
and soon Einstein ’s become a de facto physics deity .
’cos we all believe in relativity , 8.033 , relativity .

No presidential election for a long time has excited so much interest as this year 's , outside and inside America .
In personal terms , a black man , a woman and a septuagenarian war hero make most elections in most countries seem thin stuff .
And yet the truth is that , while Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama slug it out in a popularity contest ( or a competition in gaffes that may yet be disastrous for the Democrats ) , there 's little to choose between them politically .
John McCain 's startling success in routing his opponents means , however , that Republican debate has been ended , certainly on the great questions of war and peace .
This includes the quixotic presidential bid of Dr Ron Paul , a Republican congressman from southern Texas and one of America 's most fascinating political figures - who this month has again demonstrated his independence and courage in the House of Representatives , on a subject where all other Washington politicians speak with one voice .
Unlike some of our own " Dr " MPs , Paul is a real physician , serving as a US air force doctor before delivering more than 5,000 babies as an obstetrician .
He is an intransigent libertarian , who believes that " rights belong to individuals , not groups ; that property should be owned by people , not government ; that government exists to protect liberty , not to redistribute wealth ; and that the lives and actions of people are their own responsibility , not the government 's " .
All of that would make David Cameron shudder : Paul advocates low taxes , the gold standard , and " the return of government to its proper constitutional levels " .
Quite apart from his abhorrence of the welfare state , many of his views will seem eccentric here , not least his belief that Tony Blair is a rabid socialist .
A loopy reactionary from the boondocks , then ?
Not for the first time the concept of " left and right " proves most unhelpful .
Paul is called a conservative , but in British terms he is an extreme liberal - individualist in the tradition of FW Hirst and Sir Ernest Benn .
Anyone dismissing him as rightwing should look at his unflinching opposition to the Iraq war , and more generally to the foreign policy of George Bush and previous presidents .
Ten years ago Paul called " the fateful " Iraq Liberation Act " a declaration of virtual war " , as it proved .
In 2002 he voted against the coming Iraq war , or more accurately the pre-emptive abdication by Congress of its constitutional right to declare war .
He opposed the equally shameful Patriot Act and , to his credit ( and my delight ) , the granting of a Congressional gold medal to Blair - on the thrifty ground that " forcing the American people to pay tens of thousands of dollars to give a gold medal to a foreign leader is immoral and unconstitutional " , and because he thought Blair a mountebank .
If that were n't enough , when the House of Representatives was recently passing another denunciation of Palestinian violence , Paul refused to support it .
He abhorred all attacks on civilians , he said - but on Palestinians by Israelis as much as on Israelis by Palestinians .
" It is our continued involvement and intervention - particularly when it appears to be one - sided - that reduces the incentive for opposing sides to reach a lasting peace agreement , " he said .
" We must cease making proclamations involving conflicts that have nothing to do with the United States .
We incur the wrath of those who feel slighted while doing very little to slow or stop the violence . "
It says something about US politics today that words as sane and humane as those come from an " extremist " .
No doubt this excellent man 's bid for the Republican nomination was by way of being a romantic gesture .
But what about Ron Paul for secretary of state ?

Edward Weiler named as interim replacement for Alan Stern .
Alan Stern 's resignation has shocked the space - science community .
NASA
Alan Stern stepped down as head of science programmes at NASA on Tuesday .
NASA Administrator Mike Griffin has named Edward Weiler , currently director of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland , as Stern 's interim replacement .
Weiler held Stern 's post , of associate administrator for science , from 1998 to 2004 .
A NASA spokesman says that no immediate reason was given for Stern 's sudden departure , which has shocked the space - science community .
“ This is terrible news .
This is a surprise , ” says William McKinnon , a planetary scientist at Washington University in St Louis who is on the science team with Stern for the Pluto - bound New Horizons mission .
“ I ’ve never seen anybody work so hard , ” McKinnon says of Stern .
Stern sent an e-mail Wednesday morning to the science - mission directorate .
It said : “ Yesterday I offered , and Mike Griffin reluctantly accepted , my resignation as associate administrator .
I will remain at NASA for a few weeks .
It ’s been my privilege to serve the NASA and science community , and to work with you .
I also want you to know that Mike and I remain on good terms .
He remains in my eyes the best administrator NASA has ever had . ”
McKinnon ’s immediate speculation was that Stern ’s departure could have resulted from fallout associated with a struggle with the Mars programme .
Stern had cut the Mars programme to help pay for a future mission to the outer planets , and said that the programme would be held accountable for hundreds of millions of dollars in cost overruns for its flagship Mars Science Laboratory mission , which is due to launch in 2009 ( see Mars rovers under strain from cuts ) .
But McKinnon adds that there could be many other reasons , including personal ones .
Stephen Mackwell , director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston , Texas , says that the episode seems to reflect some strong influence from the Mars community .
" One has the distinct feeling that someone pushed pretty hard on Alan and he said , ' No , I wo n’t be pushed ' . "
OTTAWA  The Canadian government moved Friday to ban polycarbonate infant bottles , the most popular variety on the market , after it officially declared one of their chemical ingredients toxic .
The action , by the departments of health and environment , is the first taken by any government against bisphenol - a , or BPA , a widely used chemical that mimics a human hormone .
It has induced long - term changes in animals exposed to it through tests .
Also on Friday , Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , said he intended to introduce on Monday a bill that would ban many uses of BPA - related plastics .
It would prohibit them in all children ’s products , including nonfood items they may put in their mouths , as well as in any product used to contain food or beverages .
The toxic designation will allow Canada eventually to ban the manufacture , import or sale of baby bottles made with polycarbonate .
Polycarbonate , which dominates the North American baby bottle market , mimics glass but is lighter and shatter - resistant .
Congo ( TGW ) – Several African governments and the world ’s largest construction firms and banks met recently to discuss a proposed $ 80 billion hydroelectric dam that would double the amount of electricity available to the African continent .
Proponents hope the Grand Inga dam in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will jump start the continent ’s economy , and say the dam will produce twice as much electricity as the world current largest dam , the Three Gorges in China .
Activists , however , believe the dam will ignore local peoples and leave the Congo with massive debts .
" The project would be a magnet for corruption in one of the world 's least stable regions .
Inga will centralize a vast store of the region 's electric and financial power , a development model that can foster tensions and civil wars , " said Terri Hathaway , Africa campaigner with International Rivers , a watchdog group monitoring the project .

More physical therapy today .
I was asked how much improvement I am seeing by the therapist .
I had to say not much , since my knee has worked very fine since the surgery .
Could it be the Nutreix supplements .
I do not know , but my knee is getting stronger everyday .
My sessions consist of riding the stationary bike for 10 minutes , followed by some weight machine exercises and finishes off with manual therapy .
It will be 3 weeks since the Arthroscopic surgery , and I 'm expecting to be participating in all baseball practices shortly .
Stairs still bring a little twinge of pain .
I 'm looking forward to this going away .
The way the 700MHz auction played out was pretty darn interesting , but the recent antics between Block C winner ( Verizon ) and Block C bluffer ( Google ) are straight up theatrical .
When Google pushed the bidding above the reserve , never planning to purchase , it forced the Winner of the Block C auction to provide an “ Open ” spectrum that could not legally , “ deny , limit or restrict the ability of their customers to use the devices and applications of their choice . ”
Verizon knew the winner had to play by these rules .
The same rules for which Verizon sued the FCC hoping to change beforehand .
They did n’t win that fight and they still purchased Block C for billions of dollars … knowing the rules .
But did they have a trick up their sleeve ?
They seemingly “ saw the light ” and completely reversed their opinion , releasing a press release in late November of 2007 outlining their “ Any Apps , Any Device ” program that would begin in 2008 .
Under the program , customers could bring any handset passing Verizon ’s admittedly easy standards for use on the Verizon network and use any application on it as well .
Really ?
Was it that easy to make nice with the Big Red ?
Not at all … they then seemingly plotted to do the teenage equivalent of sneaking out after midnight and saying they did n’t know they had a curfew .
One can interpret rules and laws in different ways and thus is half the reason the Judicial branch exists in America .
Google had an irking suspicion that Verizon was going to allow any application on any device as demanded by the FCC guidelines .
But what if “ any device ” did n’t include Verizon devices ?
What if Verizon claimed that because the FCC was obviously discussing devices external to the Verizon network that “ any device ” meant “ any non-Verizon device ” ?
Then Google told Mom on Verizon .
“ Moooooooooooooooooooom , ” Google screamed , “ I heard Verizon talking to his friends and he is going to sneak out after midnight ! ”
Mom is of course the FCC and the Google scream came by way of a Formal Petition to the FCC .
In the petition , Google suggests the FCC would be made to look like fools if they somehow let Verizon get away with the above possibility .
It would be counter productive to the entire concept of the Open Spectrum , Google claims , and they suggest the FCC demand Verizon formerly clarify , in writing , their explicit intent to abide by the rules .
Verizon then simultaneously acknowledged the authority of “ Mom ” while dropping a Put - You - In - Your - Place Bitch Slap to Google for tattle - taling :
Jim Gerace ’s post on the Verizon Policy Blog appeases the FCC by saying , “ Of course we ’ll abide by those rules , ” while openly shunning the Big G , “ If Google or anybody else has evidence we are n’t playing by the rules , there are legitimate and expedited ways to address that . ”
Expedite .
Interesting word there Mr. Gerace .
You ’ll notice that win Verizon initially sued the FCC I did n’t say they “ lost ” the case … they simply did n’t win .
Their case was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit asking them to “ hold unlawful ” the open platform conditions .
Verizon did n’t lose because they withdrew their petition for expedited review .
That simply means the courts did n’t think the evidence suitable enough to make a rushed decision and the matter would have to go to court .
That is when , of course , Verizon unveiled their “ Any Apps , Any Device ” plan .
But now the tables have seemingly turned and Verizon is showing Google the Mobile Finger .
Google desperately needs the Block C Spectrum to be completely open to allow for the unhindered success of their Open Mobile OS – Android .
And that is no secret .
In their FCC petition , Google stated , “ Action now is especially necessary given the long lead time typically required for software applications developers and device manufacturers to design , develop and deploy their products to the public . ”
They might as well have just said , “ Hurry the hell up …
Android is on the way . ”
Now , being the winner and the actual terms of “ Open ” and “ Any ” not being clarified , it seems the burden of proof has fallen on Google ’s shoulders by way of the FCC .
Given how irate Verizon Wireless seems , they ’ve probably got some intention to at least make Google ’s life difficult .
Google and Verizon are both feeling the heat … you could even say they have the “ Heebie GeeVees ”
We wo n’t have to wait long to see how the next Chapter unfolds … the article on Verizon ’s Policy Blog also states ,
We expect to file at the Federal Communications Commission within the next several days on this matter . ”
Even if they 100 % agree to follow the FCC ’s terms you can be SURE that this battle , which has escalated beyond a sibling rivalry , will continue .
Afterall , Verizon still holds the keys to the Spectrum and can build regulations and terms for passing their “ Open Standards ” that pigeon hole Android devices and apps into going through more rigorous testing by creatively addressing their “ standards ” to do so .
This is just getting good … off come the gloves and for us … out comes the popcorn .
Filmmakers are often accused of writing movies that give quick snippets and no real substance , but from time to time a truly great scene comes out that includes brilliant speech writing .
This is a list of the ten greatest movie speeches .
Obviously many of you will disagree with my selection , so feel free to add your own to the comments .
Include a youtube link if you can so we can all enjoy the goods !
10 . Matt Damon ’s Speech Good Will hunting
Pride comes before a fall and in this scene – we see a perfect example of it .
This is a wonderful scene that anyone who has ever made mocked will appreciate .
I especially like the way he wraps things up with the offer to “ step outside ” – he may be a walking library , but he is also a badass !

Ruby 1.8.7で はRuby 1.9からのbackportがとても多い。つまり、Ruby 1.9のあのメソッドがRuby 1.8でも使えるようになったということだ！！
これがすごいという機能がもりだくさん、ちょっと大人になったRuby 1.8をお楽しみに。
Enumeratorは組み込みになり、eachなどのイテレータメソッドはブロックをつけないとEnumerable::Enumeratorを返すようになった。おかげでブロック付きメソッドの柔軟性が飛躍的にアップ！

Success : 115 fulfilled

BBC News , Matera , Italy
A cave city , abandoned in the 1950s , has become the base for several high - technology companies .
As you arrive in Matera by car , it looks like many other Italian cities in the poor south - slightly scruffy , but with a lively feel .
It is only when you drive off the plateau where the new town was built , into the old town clinging to the side of a valley , that you realise it is actually an extraordinary place .
Carving out a future : Modern Matera ( pic : Unesco / M.Modoveanu )
The historic area known as the " Sassi " ( the stones ) is a cave city .
Some dwellings are little more than caves with a door on the front .
Others have elaborate fronts , hiding the cave quarters behind .
In the 1950s Matera was a slum city .
Tens of thousands of people lived in the Sassi in unhygienic troglodyte conditions , and malaria was prevalent .
The prime minister at the time declared it was " Italy 's shame " .
The solution was to evict everyone from the old town and build shiny new blocks into which the population moved happily .
The Sassi were abandoned completely and left empty .
Hi-tech future
Now the empty caves are coming back to life .
We found large computer servers , with their lights blinking , tucked away in cave rooms once occupied by people and animals .
A call centre company called Datacontact has taken over a whole complex .
Their computers are in one cave , the people answering calls are in others .
The Datacontact call centre where 500 people work is now the third - biggest employer in Matera .
A software house has also been operating in the caves for several years .
The Sassi of Matera are now a Unesco World Heritage Site .
Pietro Laureano , the architect who led the rebirth of the caves , is enthusiastic about the arrival of the hi-tech companies .
" Sassi de Matera is a prehistoric town .
It is the future of technology and it's a town which can be linked to the whole world .
It is very interesting to see the city go from Stone Age to the future age , " he said .
Matera is also a fast - developing tourist centre , with atmospheric hotels and restaurants opening in the caves .
But tourism is seasonal , and the Sassi might not be fashionable forever .
The people of Matera hope the servers blinking in the caves will be the best answer to their long - term unemployment problems .
