While appearing on CNN’s The Situation Room , James Carville , not only suggested , but made the case for Al Gore as Barack Obama ’s running mate .
“ If I were him , I would ask Al Gore to serve as his vice president , his energy czar , in his administration to reduce our consumption and reliance on foreign energy sources , ” Carville said .
After a clip of Gore was played where he said that he would probably only get back into politics as a presidential candidate , Carville continued , “ Well , I ’m not suggesting he ’s just any vice president .
I ’m suggesting that Senator Obama as president would give him a lot of authority to deal with our consumption of oil .
I think it would send a signal to the world and send a signal to Congress and American people that he ’s going to be really serious and we ’re going to cut it and coordinate all of that as the vice president . ”
Carville also said that climate change is the most important issue that the next president will face .
Carville also added that he was just trying to be provocative , and that he would love it if Obama picked Clinton .
Just for the sake of letting our imaginations run wild for a second , I tend to think that climate change is definitely in the top five , but I doubt that would return to American politics as a vice president for anyone .

People forget that besides working on an issue that is his true passion , Gore has also made a fortune since leaving public life .
Anytime he speaks about returning to politics , he looks and sounds like a man who is 90 % retired from the public sector .
An idea that I think Gore would go for is if Obama appointed him to head up a special committee to formulate climate change solutions for the country .
I believe that Gore would dive at the chance to play this sort of policy role .
I get the sense that Al Gore wants to be in politics , but he does n’t want to run for office anymore .
If Obama is smart , he will give
Al a critical role on the issue of climate change , but I doubt that anything could drag him back to being a candidate again .

( CNN ) --
Child welfare officials have agreed to return 12 children taken from a polygamist sect 's ranch to their parents while the courts weigh hundreds of other cases , a family spokeswoman said Friday .
An FLDS family waits at the San Antonio , Texas , courthouse for a reunion with a seized child .
Some of the children were reunited with their parents shortly after the agreement , which came after a hearing in San Antonio , said Rene Haas , a lawyer representing Joseph Steed Jessop Sr. and his wife , Lori .
The Jessops ' three children were among those released .
Under the agreement , the children must stay in the county under state supervision until the Texas Supreme Court weighs in on the massive custody case that began April 3 , when authorities raided the Yearning For Zion Ranch in Eldorado .
It was unclear whether the agreement reached in San Antonio would apply to families of the more than 400 other children taken in the raid , which Haas called " a huge mistake " for the state .
" I think that CPS does not want to give any of these children back , and that makes me very sorrowful as a mother and a grandmother , " she said .
" These children now need to go back to their parents immediately . "
Authorities removed more than 400 children from the ranch , which is owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , based on reports that minors possibly were being sexually abused .
Officials with Texas Child Protective Services said they found a " pervasive pattern of sexual abuse that puts every child at the ranch at risk . "
On Thursday , the 3rd District Court of Appeals court ruled that the department failed to prove there was an urgent need to remove the children and that it was wrong to extend the abuse allegations to the entire community .
The state of Texas appealed that ruling Friday , arguing that the appeals court overstepped its bounds by ruling that the state erred in taking emergency custody of the children .
In its 27 - page appeal , the department said the appeals court 's role is merely to determine whether a lower court abused its discretion rather than reconsider the evidence and second - guess the lower court 's decision .
" The appellate court cannot concern itself with the burden of proof or conduct a legal or factual sufficiency review , " the state wrote in its appeal .
The appeal also stated that " this case is about adult men commanding sex from underage children ; about adult women knowingly condoning and allowing sexual abuse of underage children ; about the need for the department to take action under difficult , time - sensitive and unprecedented circumstances to protect children on an emergency basis ... and about the intermediate court 's mandate to return the children without giving the court the opportunity to determine which parents are entitled to possession of which children . "
In response , lawyers for the 38 women who challenged the children 's placements in temporary state custody said the children face " continuing , irreparable harm every day that they are separated from their parents . "
They argued that local courts can ensure the safety of the children and called the state 's claims that it had been unable to figure out which children belong to which mothers a " red herring . "
" The matching of children with parents did not become a problem for the department until a court decided that it had to give the children back , " the lawyers wrote .
" The department 's claim of ignorance strains credulity . "
If the state 's Supreme Court appeal fails , a permanent reunion of families is assured , said Jeffrey Toobin , CNN senior legal analyst .
" I think it 's clear that if [ Thursday 's ruling ] stands , all these kids are going back with their mothers , " Toobin said on CNN's " Anderson Cooper 360° . "
A sect mother who has four children in state custody said Thursday that the possibility of an appeal kept her from celebrating too much .
" I 'm very grateful , but I 'd like to see the children in my arms before I rejoice greatly , " Margaret Jessop said on CNN's " Larry King Live . "
Watch Jessop react to the ruling »
Jessop and other FLDS parents said they had been permitted regular visits with their children in state custody .
Zavenda
Young said two of her children were sent to Waco , Texas , and two to Hockley , 148 miles away .
" They 're in Boys and Girls Country in Hockley .
And it 's just a -- it's an institution , " she told host Larry King .
Their father , Edson Jessop , said the experience has been rough on the children .
" You can see it 's a lot of stress on them , " he said .
" Every time we leave , they go through that trauma again .
It 's enough to rip your heart out . "
" They feel betrayed by adults , and they 're hurting very badly , " Margaret Jessop added .
The Texas Child Protective Services Department 's
Web site says the agency has been " coordinating with many professional service and government agencies to ensure the safety , health and comfort of the children and women in Eldorado . "
A statement from the agency Thursday said it did the right thing when it raided the ranch .
" Child Protective Services has one duty : to protect children , " the statement said .
" When we see evidence that children have been sexually abused and remain at risk of further abuse , we will act . "

IN COLONIAL times , the Coronation Building in old Delhi was one of the city 's most prestigious hotels .
Today , it is home to a commodity - futures market .
But you would not know it .
The Rajdhani Oil and Oilseeds Exchange is hidden among a cluster of small shops and peopled by men in kurta pyjamas , their hair dyed with henna , reclining in the afternoon heat under rusted fans .
Over an ageing intercom , they take orders to buy and sell mustard seed and jaggery for delivery one or two months hence .
The day 's opening and closing prices are chalked on a blackboard .
The blackboard shows that prices of the two commodities have fallen in recent weeks .
This will come as a relief to India 's policymakers , who are frantically seeking to suppress a nasty bout of commodity - price inflation .
On April 4th the Ministry of Commerce and Industry revealed that wholesale - price inflation , the measure most closely watched by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) , the central bank , rose to 7 % in the 12 months to March 22nd , its highest rate since December 2004 .
This price pressure is worrying .
But the government 's panicked response to it is even more so .
Behind the jump in inflation were higher prices for fuel , food ( including edible oils ) and metals .
The price of iron ore leapt by 46 % .
This has spooked the government , which faces elections in several big states as well as a national poll before next spring .
In response , it has cut import duties on edible oils and banned the export of pulses and rice ( except for basmati rice ) .
It even briefly banned the export of edible oils , such as coconut oil , much to the chagrin of Keralite emigrants to the Gulf , who swear by the stuff to keep their hair black and their joints flexible .
Steelmakers in particular have felt the sharp edge of the government 's resolve .
The Steel Authority of India ( SAIL ) , a state - owned steelmaker , boasts that “ there 's a little bit of SAIL in everybody 's life ” , a slogan that runs above pictures of metal bridges , pipes , jugs and even dog - food bowls .
After prices rose by more than 20 % in the first three months of the year , everybody 's life became a bit dearer .
Carmakers and scooter - makers protested to the government .
Dog - owners no doubt joined them in spirit .
The government threatened to add steel to its list of 15 “ essential commodities ” , which would allow it to dictate the production and distribution of the alloy .
In response , steelmakers “ voluntarily ” agreed to cut the prices of steel bars used in construction and the corrugated sheets that poor households use for roofing .
But steelmakers complain that they are merely passing on the rising costs of coke and iron ore .
They fear being caught between “ the two prongs of a pincer ” , according to the Indian Steel Alliance , an industry group .
Commodity traders , such as the ones reclining in the Coronation Building , fear they may be next in line .
Last year the government banned futures trading in two types of bean , rice and wheat , arguing that speculators were driving up prices , beyond what the fundamentals would dictate .
Some in the leftist parties , on whose support the government relies , now argue it should extend the ban to other commodities , such as edible oils and perhaps even iron and steel .
This would be like “ shooting the messenger ” , argues B.C. Khatua , chairman of the Forward Markets Commission , which regulates futures exchanges .
Before they were shut down , he points out , the futures markets conveyed the message that prices of wheat and rice would continue to rise .
Sure enough , that is what happened .
Banning futures trading would do little to curb prices , especially for commodities like edible oils that are heavily imported .
But it would arrest the development of India 's financial system , which is finally growing more sophisticated .
Since 2003 , the government has allowed trading in future contracts for many commodities .
One of the two main exchanges , the Multi Commodity Exchange , averages volumes of over $ 3 billion a day .
The Rajdhani exchange turns over about $ 20 m a month .
Great hopes for such markets were expressed this week in a report by a 12 - man committee on financial - sector reform , appointed by the planning commission , and led by Raghuram Rajan , now of the Chicago Graduate School of Business , and formerly chief economist of the IMF .
It laments “ the knee - jerk reaction to ban [ markets ] or intervene in them whenever they send unpleasant messages . ”
The futures market provides farmers with a sneak preview of the prices they will face in the months ahead , which should allow them to make an informed decision about what to sow .
In principle , futures contracts should also allow farmers to lock in a price for their crops , insulating them from the vagaries of the spot market .
At the moment , farmers are too small to participate in the market directly .
But Mr Rajan 's report suggests that small banks could aggregate the demands of farmers up to a practical size .
“ Just as it is counter - intuitive to steer in the direction of the skid ” , Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University once wrote , “ it is difficult to persuade the layman ” that the best solution to scarcity is a market price , which encourages supply and discourages demand .
As Bajrang Lal Goyal , a trader who joined the Rajdhani exchange 40 years ago , points out , India 's winter crop is just days away from hitting the market .
If the politicians who bash the futures market could be bothered to look at the message it is conveying , they would see that the prices of several sensitive commodities are already on their way down .
Just in time , that is , for the elections .
Sixteen months after Venezuela 's leftist President Hugo Chávez drew bipartisan hurrahs in Nicaragua with his promise to solve the country 's " oil problem , " the cheers have turned to jeers as Nicaragua 's fuel crisis has become more crippling than ever .
Mr. Chávez last year promised to supply Nicaragua – which is now ruled by his ideological comrade President Daniel Ortega – with 10 million barrels of oil , sold at market price through a secretive Nicaraguan - Venezuelan oil company known as ALBANISA .
The Venezuelan leader has also provided funding for Nicaragua to buy several new oil - burning power plants to increase production by 20 percent by 2009 .
Yet gas pump prices have soared to over $ 5.20 a gallon – the most expensive in Central America – and electricity costs have gone up on four occasions since Mr. Ortega took office last year .
The addition of the new Chávez - funded power plants have made the country even more dependent on foreign oil , which observers now fear could help grind the fragile economy of one of the hemisphere 's poorest countries into the ground .
" We are even more dependent on petroleum now than were a year and a half ago , when we were having six - to - eight hour blackouts every day , " says opposition Liberal Party lawmaker Francisco Aguirre , president of the National Assembly 's Economic and Budget Commission .
" If the American economy is reeling because of energy prices , imagine what that means for us in Nicaragua . "
How oil dependency developed
The country 's oil dependency is a relatively new problem .
Before Ortega 's leftist Sandinista revolution in 1979 , more than 70 percent of Nicaragua 's energy was hydroelectric .
Today , thanks to a lack of state planning by the last four governments from the right , left , and center of the political spectrum , the trend is going the other way fast .
" Governments have always acted to resolve the energy problem in the easiest and cheapest way possible , which is through petroleum plants , " says César Zamora , president of Corinto Power , the largest energy provider in the country .
" An oil plant can be installed in two years , but a hydro plant takes five years to build , a year of study , and a lot more money . "
Plus , Mr. Zamora says , no one ever expected oil prices to reach such nose - bleed heights .
When Ortega forged his oil deal with Chávez at the beginning of 2007 , the international price was $ 74 a barrel .
The price has since jumped to over $ 130 , meaning the country 's oil bill to Venezuela this year will be nearly double what was budgeted at the beginning of the year
Soaring oil prices have already doubled food costs , led to a recent nationwide transportation strike over fuel prices , and kept the country teettering on the edge of power - rationing blackouts .
Ortega managed to bring an end to the transportation strike two weeks ago by offering taxi and bus drivers a $ 1.30 subsidy on diesel , but prices have since gone up twice and the transportation sector is again threatening a work stoppage as their subsidy whittles away .
As the situation worsens , a growing chorus of critics are questioning the oil promises made to Nicaragua under the label of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas , or ALBA – Chávez 's leftist trade alliance among Venezuela , Bolivia , Cuba , and Nicaragua .
" ALBA is a mystery enveloped in a cloud of fog , wrapped in an enormous enigma , " Mr. Aguirre says .
Though the lawmaker says that Venezuelan aid could " theoretically " be a great help to an impoverished country such as Nicaragua , the secrecy with which ALBA has been handled by Ortega has only fueled criticism and conjecture .
European donor countries – as well as the International Monetary Fund , opposition lawmakers , civil society , and the national media – have all asked for an explanation of Venezuelan aid under ALBA .
But so far Ortega has remained tight - lipped , aside from admitting that Venezuelan aid to Nicaragua already totals $ 520 million .
The secretive oil ties to Chávez
Journalists ' attempts to investigate the issue have been thwarted by the government .
" Instead of answering any basic questions about Venezuelan aid , they accuse you of trying to destabilize the government and conspiring with the oligarchy , " says investigative journalist Moisés Martínez of the national daily La Prensa .
Economists , too , are unable to explain ALBA , or account for the $ 520 million that Venezuela has supposedly given to Nicaragua – money that Ortega manages in a separate discretional fund with no third - party oversight .
Ortega 's explanation of ALBA aid – including $ 35.3 million for unidentified " social programs " and $ 60.6 million for " other programs " – has done little to satisfy the opposition 's call for transparency and accountability .
" Nothing about this is clear , " says economist Adolfo Acevedo .
What is clear is that Ortega 's handling of the government is translating into unfavorable polling numbers .
In a poll released in May by M&R Consultants , 64 percent of those surveyed describe Ortega as an authoritarian ruler who wants to implement a dictatorship , and 88 percent said they do n't think the Nicaraguan economy has improved under his watch .
Ortega argues that things would be worse without him .
" If we were n't in government , I do n't know where Nicaragua would be right now , " Ortega said in a recent speech in which he credited Venezuelan solidarity from saving the country from complete disaster .
" Thank God we came to power .
On the contrary , the country would be in a situation of total chaos , without energy or petroleum . "
If oil reaches $ 150 a barrel , economists warn that widespread instability would be right around the corner .

BANKS have endured a brutal nine months since credit markets froze in August .
Losses and write - downs already total $ 335 billion ; many of their best businesses have disappeared .
In developed economies , almost all banks are facing economic and regulatory headwinds that will cut revenues and jobs .
Yet the biggest danger facing Western finance is not a fall in its earning power but a loss of faith in how it works .
Two criticisms assail the industry , one based on fairness and the other on efficiency .
The first argues that finance is rigged to enrich bankers , rather than their customers , shareholders or the economy at large .
Some worry about the way bonuses are calculated ; others about moral hazard .
Bankers will take wild bets because they know they will be bailed out by the taxpayer .
Look at Bear Stearns or Northern Rock .
The second , deeper question is whether a market - based approach to finance is efficient .
Some Chinese officials claim the Western system has been shown up by the crisis ( see article ) .
This week Germany 's president demanded that the “ monster ” of financial markets “ be put back in its place ” : bankers had caused a “ massive destruction of assets ” .
The critics do not lack ammunition .
The lapses in credit - underwriting in the subprime - mortgage market hardly reflect a wise allocation of capital .
The opacity of the shadow banking system and the mind - boggling complexity of those toxic asset - backed products have raised doubts about the discipline of the market .
Forever blowing bubbles
Be careful .
It is not just that a rush to regulate is seldom wise : witness Sarbanes - Oxley , the governance act hurried through in the wake of the corporate scandals earlier this decade .
The current assault is dangerous because it mixes a number of small truths with a big , alluring myth .
The fiddly verities concern the ways in which finance can indeed be made a bit more efficient or fairer .
But you can make those changes only if you dismiss the myth : that finance can somehow be stripped of its failures and perfected .
Bubbles , excess and calamity are part of the package of Western finance .
And still it is worth it .
Some change is desirable and inevitable .
Most of it will be supplied , belatedly , by the market itself — especially if it is bathed in the cleansing sunlight of transparency .
America 's mortgage business is already transformed .
Hundreds of unregulated lenders have disappeared , as has the fatally lazy assumption that house prices do not fall .
Demand for complex securitised products has shrivelled and the most complex may never come back .
The safest forecast in banking is that the next crisis will not be rooted in America 's mortgage market .
Regulators also have lessons to learn .
Most of them come in two categories .
The first is to take a broader view of risk .
That means looking at off - balance - sheet assets and at gross exposures ( Jérôme Kerviel , accused of losing Société Générale $ 7.2 billion , went unnoticed because managers were watching only his net positions ) .
For national supervisors , it requires a lead regulator with a remit to watch the system .
Internationally , the global capital markets would ideally have global regulatory norms — or at least more co-operation between national authorities .
Now that the investment banks know the central banks will stand behind them , they also need closer scrutiny and higher capital standards .
For the moment supervisors need monitor only what banks lend hedge funds , but you could imagine some hedge funds becoming so central to the system that they too need direct attention .
The second change in philosophy is to bully banks to build buffers when times are good so they have stronger defences when times are bad .
The system has come to amplify the extremes of the cycle .
Fair - value accounting , which pegs assets to current market prices rather than their historic value , leads to downward ( and upward ) spirals in asset prices , and hence leverage .
Banks ' risk models have been backward - looking , so no time appeared safer than the moment before the bubble burst .
Working out when an asset boom has become a bubble is not easy — just as it is hard to use monetary policy to lean against asset - price bubbles .
But rapid growth , whether in asset prices or market share , should be a signal to worry , not relax .
And if banks are to be subject to the firmer discipline of fair - value accounting , it makes sense to have extra padding .
These changes would certainly come at a cost — which is one reason to weigh them more carefully than the framers of Sarbanes - Oxley did .
They would have the effect of increasing the amount of capital and liquidity that banks set aside when risks are building , and reducing the amount of leverage they can take on .
That would reduce the size and capacity of the industry , although not the size of individual institutions : one result of the crisis is that universal banks are likely to become even more hulking as they seek the benefits of diversification .
On balance , these costs are worth paying to make finance a little safer .
Other reforms do n't pass that test .
For instance , limiting pay or forcing bankers to take equity stakes in their business will not stop moral hazard : Bear Stearns had high levels of employee share - ownership and it did not know it would be able to call on the Federal Reserve .
Indeed , whatever you do , finance will not be “ fixed ” in the way critics are demanding .
Rome or the barbarians : your choice
As this week 's special report on international banking makes clear , the main structural causes of trouble — the collective misjudgment of risk ; a zealous search for yield ; and the failure of oversight — are deep - seated .
In financial history they crop up time after time .
Financiers are rightly rewarded for taking risks , which by their nature cannot be entirely managed away or anticipated .
The tendency for success to breed complacency and recklessness is as ingrained in financial markets as it is in any other walk of life .
However bankers are paid , they cannot just sit out a credit boom ; they have to keep dancing .
Regulators lack the knowledge , the clout ( and often the talent ) to keep up with the banks ' next brilliant scheme .
That reads like an indictment , until you consider the alternatives .
Western finance , to paraphrase Churchill , is the worst way to allocate capital , except for all those other forms .
It is obviously better than the waste and dysfunction in China , where centrally planned capital is dished out to the well - connected .
But it is also better than the financial system the West used to have .
Thanks to the astonishing innovation of the past few decades , derivatives can help firms and investors to hedge risks ( there are plenty of Chinese manufacturers who would be grateful for an easy way to soften the impact of exchange - rate shifts ) .
Securitisation widens access to capital for borrowers and to assets for investors : it can finance everything from water utilities to film studios .
Leverage brings more lazy companies within reach of determined investors and more homes within reach of poorer consumers .
It is true that financiers have enjoyed vast profits — and the vast salaries that go along with them ( pay at American investment banks has been nearly ten times the national average ) .
But the collapse of the credit bubble will bring that down .
And despite all the disasters , there are signs of finance 's resilience .
In the past few months the banks have commanded enough confidence to raise $ 200 billion in new capital from investors .
Bear Stearns and Northern Rock were calamities , but rare ones , because the vast overall losses were spread far and wide .
This time , there has been no industry - wide government recapitalisation .
After 20 years of growth , the flaws of modern finance are painfully clear .
Do not forget its strengths .
Facebook Disconnects Google : Protecting Users ... Or Itself ?
from the privacy - or - competition ?
dept
Inforworld reports that Facebook has cut off Google 's Friend Connect service from accessing Facebook 's APIs .
Facebook claims that Google Friend Connect " redistributes user information from Facebook to other developers without users ’ knowledge , which does n’t respect the privacy standards our users have come to expect . "
Techcrunch has more details about what Google was doing and what Facebook objected to .
Facebook is getting a fair amount of flack for this decision , and it's not hard to see why .
Given that Facebook has just rolled out its own competing service for linking third - party websites to Facebook , we can't help but wonder if the privacy issues are n't just a cover to avoid having to interoperate with a major competitor .
Still , Facebook 's privacy concerns are n't totally bogus , and this dispute does illustrate the point we made on Monday about the challenge of building an open API while preserving user privacy .
It 's true that users ultimately have control over which applications and sites they approve to access their Facebook data .
But users are n't necessarily going to know which applications have good privacy policies , nor are they necessarily going to want to invest the time and effort to figure it out .
So it 's not necessarily a bad thing that Facebook is imposing at least some minimum standards on sites that use their API .
And while Google obviously is n't a fly - by - night organization , Facebook may be worrying about the precedent it would set if it started allowing sites to funnel information gleaned from the Facebook APIs to third party sites that Facebook had no control over at all .
Mike Arrington wonders , " How dare Facebook tell ME that I cannot give Google access to this data . "
I certainly agree with this sentiment in principle , but I think it 's missing the way applications work on Facebook .
About once a week I get asked to try out some new Facebook application that I 've never heard of .
I 'm already pretty reluctant to approve any of these applications , but I 'd be a lot more reluctant if I knew that there was a reasonable chance that signing up would lead to my data being available to random third parties .
And in most cases I do n't have the time and the interest to research the details of each application 's privacy policy .
So there 's some value in having Facebook enforce reasonable privacy rules on behalf of its users .
But on the other hand , the fact that Facebook can and does arbitrarily disable Facebook apps is n't going to be good for the health of the Facebook ecosystem .
If I were a software developer , I would certainly be reluctant to develop for an " open " platform like that .
And in the long run , that 's a big threat to Facebook 's dominance of the social networking universe .
Facebook is big , but it 's not as big as the rest of the web put together .
If a company like Google can figure out how build a usable , open social network atop hundreds of websites , it will give Facebook and MySpace a real run for their money .

Getting a Hello Kitty tattoo is bad , getting one right smack front and center of your forehead pretty much assures that you have – how should I say this diplomatically – lost your damn mind ( my theory is that Sanrio has invented a Hello Kitty virus that makes people do things like this … ) :
This is the type of tattoo that gets put on when you have had a few too many beers and then you wake up the next morning and wonder why the damn thing wo n’t rub off .
At least , that is what I truly hope happened because it just does n’t register that anyone would purposely want to do this to themselves .
But then again , one should never underestimate what the evil feline will get people to do willingly …

In Australia 's first known case of murder due to " water rage , " a dispute over a suburban man 's water usage led to him being beaten to death in front of his home .
According to police , 66 - year - old Ken Proctor was watering the lawn in front of his home in Sydney on October 31 at approximately 5:30 p.m. when a passerby made a comment to him about wasting water .
Proctor then turned his hose on the other man , who knocked him to the ground and began to punch and kick him .
The attacker was tackled by two bystanders , including an off - duty policeman , and an ambulance came for Proctor .
Proctor later died in the hospital after experiencing a massive heart attack .
Due to a severe , nearly eight - year drought , intensive water restrictions are in place across most of Australia .
Nearly all states have banned garden sprinklers and the use of hoses on cars or sidewalks .
Sydney , in addition , prohibits leaving hoses or taps unattended except to filling pools , and permits are required for pools larger than 10,000 gallons .
The use of fire hoses is prohibited for any use other than firefighting .
Hand watering of lawns or gardens is only allowed on Wednesdays or Sundays before 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m.
Because the incident that led to his death happened on a Wednesday , Proctor was actually complying with the city 's water rules at the time .
The drought is Australia 's worst in at least 100 years .
Combined with over - extraction of water , the drought has caused the flows of the country 's two largest southeast rivers , the Murray and Darling , to dwindle .
More than three - quarters of New South Wales is experiencing a drought , and Victoria has announced that 100 percent of its farmland has been hit .
While a number of suburban disputes , arguments and calls to police have risen from water restrictions , Proctor 's is believed to be the first death cause by such a water dispute .

When Wendy Gonaver was offered a job teaching American studies at Cal State Fullerton this academic year , she was pleased to be headed back to the classroom to talk about one of her favorite themes : protecting constitutional freedoms .
But the day before class was scheduled to begin , her appointment as a lecturer abruptly ended over just the kind of issue that might have figured in her course .
She lost the job because she did not sign a loyalty oath swearing to “ defend ” the U.S. and California constitutions “ against all enemies , foreign and domestic . ”
The loyalty oath was added to the state Constitution by voters in 1952 to root out communists in public jobs .
Now , 16 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union , its main effect is to weed out religious believers , particularly Quakers and Jehovah ’s Witnesses .
As a Quaker from Pennsylvania and a lifelong pacifist , Gonaver objected to the California oath as an infringement of her rights of free speech and religious freedom .
She offered to sign the pledge if she could attach a brief statement expressing her views , a practice allowed by other state institutions .
But Cal State Fullerton rejected her statement and insisted that she sign the oath if she wanted the job .

“ I wanted it on record that I am a pacifist , ” said Gonaver , 38 .
“ I was really upset .
I did n’t expect to be fired .
I was so shocked that I had to do this . ”
California State University officials say they were simply following the law and did not discriminate against Gonaver because all employees are required to sign the oath .
Clara Potes - Fellow , a Cal State spokeswoman , said the university does not permit employees to submit personal statements with the oath .
“ The position of the university is that her entire added material was against the law , ” Potes - Fellow said .
In February , another Cal State instructor , Quaker math teacher Marianne Kearney - Brown , was fired because she inserted the word “ nonviolently ” when she signed the oath .
She was quickly rehired after her case attracted media attention .

It is hard to know how many would - be workers decline to sign the pledge over religious or political issues .
Some object because they interpret the pledge as a commitment to take up arms .
Others have trouble swearing an oath to something other than their God .
--
Public agencies do not appear to keep a record of people denied employment over the oath .
Union grievances and lawsuits are rare .
Some agencies take the oath more seriously than others .
Certain school districts and community colleges have been known to let employees change the wording of the oath when they sign or to ignore the requirement altogether .
Others , including the University of California , advise employees on how they can register their objections yet still sign the pledge .

All state , city , county , public school , community college and public university employees -- about 2.3 million people -- are covered by the law , although noncitizens are not required to sign .
UC Berkeley was the first to impose a tough anti-communist loyalty oath in 1949 and fired 31 professors who refused to sign .
After a version of the oath was added to the state Constitution , courts eventually struck down its harshest elements but let stand the requirement of defending the constitutions .
In one court test , personal statements accompanying the oath were deemed constitutional as long as they did not nullify the meaning of the oath .
Now , the University of California advises new employees who balk at signing the pledge that they can submit an addendum , as long as it does not negate the oath .

UC even provides sample declarations , such as : “ This is not a promise to take up arms in contravention of my religious beliefs , ” or “ I owe allegiance to Jehovah . ”
The California State University system takes a firmer approach .
Kearney - Brown , the math instructor fired by Cal State East Bay , said she added the word “ nonviolently ” just as she had when taking previous jobs as a high school teacher .
The university , however , told her she could not alter the pledge .
After her case attracted media attention and help from the United Auto Workers , which represents some Cal State employees , the university reversed course .
The office of Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown drafted a statement declaring that the oath does not commit employees to bear arms in the country ’s defense .
Cal State agreed to let Kearney - Brown attach it to her oath and she was reinstated .

Kearney - Brown said she believed she was defending the Constitution by objecting to the oath and argued that signing a pledge should not be reduced to a meaningless formality .
“ The way it ’s laid out , a noncitizen member of Al Qaeda could work for the university , but not a citizen Quaker , ” she said .
The 23 - campus Cal State system has fired instructors over the oath at least twice before .
In 2001 , Cal StateDominguez Hills dismissed geography lecturer Alejandro Alonso after he refused to sign .
He said at the time that he identified with the Jehovah ’s Witnesses and that swearing an oath to anyone but God violated his religious beliefs .

When his request for a religious exemption was denied , he proposed signing the oath and attaching a personal statement .
That also was denied .
Alonso , who went on to teach at USC , has become an expert on Los Angeles gangs and runs the website www.streetgangs.com.
In 1995 , Methodist minister Bud Tillinghast was teaching a course on comparative religion at Humboldt State University , when he was pulled out of class by campus police and fired because he had not signed the oath .
Tillinghast said he believed that swearing an oath to the state helped establish the government as a religion .
“ I was teaching world religions and I ran up against a state religion , ” the retired minister recalled .
“ My concern was that this was breaking down the separation of church and state and making the state a religion you swear allegiance to . ”

He filed suit against Cal State for reinstatement arguing that the oath violated the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
But after a court found that law unconstitutional , his suit was thrown out .
In all , Tillinghast said , he went up against the loyalty oath three times .
Before being fired by Humboldt , he taught a religion class at a community college for nearly a decade .
For that job , the school allowed him to sign an alternate oath .
Last year , he was named to the Humbolt County Human Rights Commission .
A potential problem was averted when officials decided he did n’t need to sign the oath .

Efforts to remove the oath from the state Constitution have been unsuccessful , although the matter came under scrutiny in 1998 when a congressional subcommittee held a hearing on religious freedom .
Among those who testified was Zari Wigfall , a Jehovah ’s Witness who said she twice lost jobs at Sacramento City College in 1994 because of the oath , first as a student tour guide and later as a theater house manager for a children ’s play .
“ Citizens are entitled to certain rights , and also minorities , including religious minorities , are given certain guarantees , ” she told the committee .
“ And I just did n’t think that . . . because of my religious beliefs I would have two jobs taken away from me . ”
She is now a dancer , choreographer and teacher in Southern California .

For Gonaver , the oath came up unexpectedly .
She was offered the job at Fullerton teaching two classes last fall , Introduction to American Studies and Introduction to Intercultural Women ’s Studies .
She received two appointment letters and signed a contract .
When she attended an orientation session for new faculty , she heard of the oath for the first time .
After researching the issue and learning that UC allowed its employees to provide personal statements , she submitted her own six - sentence declaration to Fullerton .
In her statement , she wrote that the oath violates the 1st Amendment and discriminates against religious pacifists , such as Quakers and Buddhists .
She called the pledge an “ instrument of intimidation . ”
And she wrote that employees who sign it “ while harboring legitimate religious and political objections ” could be exposed to a charge of perjury .
Advertisement
Margaret Atwell , the Fullerton school ’s associate vice president for academic affairs , replied in an e-mail that Gonaver was not allowed to submit any statement , no matter what the practice at UC .
Gonaver would have to sign the oath or lose the job , Atwell said .
Gonaver refused .
Potes - Fellow , the Cal State spokeswoman , said the university stands by its stricter interpretation of the requirement and is not affected by how UC or other public institutions handle the oath .
“ The university concluded that state law did not allow her to attach her addendum , ” Potes - Fellow said .
Advertisement
The attorney general ’s statement that Kearney - Brown was allowed to attach her oath did not violate Cal State ’s policy because it was not an addendum , Potes - Fellow said .
“ We think the circumstances are different in both cases , ” she said .
Gonaver said the attorney general ’s statement does not go far enough in answering her objections to the oath .
But if she had been offered a chance to use it last fall , she said , she probably would have signed the oath and would have been teaching all year at Fullerton .
Now , she would like to see the oath eliminated for all public employees except those who deal with sensitive information .
She also would like an apology and a job next year .
“ It makes no sense that they do this to people , ” she said .
“ It ’s people who take it seriously who do n’t get hired . ”

The loyalty oath
From Article XX , section 3 , of the California Constitution :
“ I , ______ , do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California ; that I take this obligation freely , without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion ; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter . ”
Official results say Morgan Tsvangirai gained the most votes
The long - awaited results of Zimbabwe 's presidential poll have been announced , with the opposition 's Morgan Tsvangirai winning 47.9 % , forcing a second round .
Election officials say Mr Tsvangirai beat President Robert Mugabe 's 43.2 % , but neither candidate passed the 50 % threshold for an outright win .
A spokesman for 84 - year - old Mr Mugabe says he will stand in a run - off vote .
But Mr Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) said the result was " scandalous daylight robbery " .
The MDC accuses ruling party supporters of rigging the vote and of launching a campaign of intimidation and violence following the elections on 29 March .
It says the delay in announcing the results was to give pro-government militants time to organise and carry out their attacks .
Reaction :
In quotes Tough call for opposition Zanu - PF party says the scale of the violence has been exaggerated and accuses the MDC of staging political attacks .
Chief Elections Officer Lovemore Sekeramayi said former Finance Minister Simba Makoni came third with 8.3 % .
He said a date for the second round between Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai would be announced later .
It should be held within three weeks .
Mr Makoni held back from endorsing either candidate after the results announcement , saying instead Zimbabwe could not afford another round of voting , the AFP news agency reports .
" The way forward for this country is for the political leaders to work together , " he said .
A spokesman for Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF , Bright Matonga , told the BBC that both main parties had been aware that no - one had won outright .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The laws of Zimbabwe and the constitution clearly states that for one to be an outright winner , they have to achieve 50 [ per cent ] plus one , " he said .
" We are following our constitution , not people 's wishes . "
MDC Secretary General Tendai Biti told the BBC that Mr Tsvangirai should be declared president , as he had gained 50.3 % of the vote .
Mr Tsvangirai has in the past said he would not take part in a run-off unless international observers were involved .
He has moved out of Zimbabwe amid fears for his safety .
Before the official results were announced , the MDC had queried 120,000 votes given to Mr Mugabe - which they say could have tipped the balance in the president 's favour and stopped Mr Tsvangirai winning outright .
" This whole thing is a scandal , scandalous daylight robbery , " said MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa , after the results were announced .
" What we are being given here as the outcome are some fudged figures meant to save Mugabe and Zanu - PF . "
But projections from independent monitors were similar to the official results , with Mr Tsvangirai just short of the threshold for outright victory .
Observers needed The UK and United States have raised doubts about the results and the possibility of a second round being fair .
The UK Foreign Office said the results " lack credibility " , adding that a second round would not be fair unless the violence ended and more international monitors were present .
Robert Mugabe came second in the vote but is determined to keep fighting " President Mugabe 's campaign of violence and intimidation coupled with the arrest of 99 electoral commission officials in the last month show exactly how Zanu - PF will approach any second round , " a spokeswoman said .
The election officials have been accused of trying to rig the elections in favour of the MDC .
US state department spokesman Tom Casey said it was hard to see how a run -off could be fair " when the government has done everything it could to both delay and obscure the results " .
The MDC and human rights groups say there has been a massive campaign of violence against opposition activists in rural areas in anticipation of a run -off vote .
The MDC says hundreds of people have fled their homes and 20 have been killed .
On Thursday , the defence minister in neighbouring Botswana said Zimbabweans were fleeing the violence , with almost 100 people arriving in the past three days .
He said in the past , Zimbabweans had been economic migrants but now they were seeking political asylum .
There have been similar reports from Mozambique .

Organic Chemistry - A Definition Organic chemistry focuses on molecules mainly composed of carbon and hydrogen , along with a handful of other elements - such as oxygen , nitrogen , silicon , sulfur , and phosphorus .
Organic chemistry deals with synthetic methods , reaction mechanisms and kinetics , and uses analytical methods for reaction control and purification such as chromatography ( TLC , GC , HPLC ) , and structure confirmation such as NMR and IR , but also structure determination such as NMR and X - ray crystallography .
New fields of organic chemistry for example include organometallic chemistry , which is the study of carbon - based compounds that contain metals , and bioorganic chemistry , which combines organic chemistry and biochemistry .
Methods of organic chemistry are used in medicinal chemistry , natural product chemistry , and materials science .
In the industry , organic chemists work in discovery chemistry ( making new molecules ) and process optimization ( finding better synthetic methods for large scale production ) .

Gateway to the Redwoods Considers Resolution Directing Congress to Impeach Bush – Cheney
Submitted by Chip
Willits , CA , known as the “ Gateway to the Redwoods ” in the heart of Mendocino County , is celebrating a local victory .
After months of presentations to the City Council and private talks with each its members , last night Mayor Holly Madrigal presented a Resolution calling for Willits City Council to vote to direct Congress to hold impeachment hearings on Bush and Cheney .
The council chamber was packed , and many people spoke eloquently on this administration ’s abuse of powers , violations of civil liberties , illegal invasion of Iraq , admitted use of torture , obstructing needed environmental measures , and lying to the American people about the run up to the war .
We presented the council with over 300 signatures on petitions , and 300 more names were on county - distributed petitions submitted by Robin Warren .
Greg Kanne , Holly Madrigal , Karen Oslund , and Larry Stranske ( a conservative Republican who hates what Bush is doing , and usually is opposed to any taking “ non-local ” actions ) voted for , Tami Jorgenson against as she feels her role as council member is limited to local issues and does not call for her comments on broader issues .
Melinda Clarke wishes to thank everyone who signed and circulated petitions , who helped out this historic moment for Willits .
Since Linda Williams , reporter from Willits News , was not present , she asks that all who were there write letters and statements to the paper .
Melinda notes that they have also heard from Mike Thompson ’s office ( CA - 1st District ) that he has finally taken the step towards signing on publicly for an impeachment hearing , this week sending John Conyers of the House Judiciary Committee a letter stating his position .
Let ’s call Thompson ’s office and thank him .

Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky is a Russian politician , founder and the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia ( LDPR ) , Vice - Chairman of the State Duma ( Russian Parliament ) , and a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe .
If I am to understand correctly , he 's drunk on a train , sends an aide to the back to get his shotgun so he can hunt crows from the speeding train ... gets trigger happy and so starts taking aim at chicken coups of the locals along the tracks as well .
As if hunting crows from a train was n't a bad enough idea .
Apparently this is a public train no less .
I edited out the long lead in of him jabbering on and on and sending the aide to get his gun ... I guess he 's given to anti-semetic rants , which I think he was doing prior to this , but my Russian is n't so good .
This guy is the # 2 in the Duma , and has run for president of russia several times .
To his credit , he stops long enough to wave to kids .

A team of researchers at Penn Sate has used an animal model to reveal , for the first time , a physiological basis for the effect of alcohol on male sexual behavior , including increased sexual arousal and decreased sexual inhibition .
The research , which will be published on 2 January 2008 in the scientific journal PLoS ONE , resulted in four novel findings with broad importance for further addiction research .
It is the first study to characterize the effects of chronic alcohol exposure in fruit flies .
" Physiological evidence supporting various theories about the effect of alcoholic drinks has been lacking , so our now having a suitable animal model makes it possible to conduct much - needed laboratory research on this issue , " explains research - team - leader Kyung - An Han , associate professor of biology and a neuroscientist at Penn State .
Information from this research can serve as a baseline for similar studies in other animals , including humans .

In contrast to previous studies in other labs , which subjected fruit flies to short - term doses of ethanol -- the intoxicating ingredient in alcoholic drinks --
Han 's team administered to fruit flies a daily dose of ethanol to more closely mimic the drinking habits of alcoholics and chronic alcohol abusers .
The team investigated several factors that influence the physiological effects of ethanol , including genetic and cellular components , age , and prior experience .
Among the team 's discoveries is that male fruit flies , which typically court females , also actively court males when they are given a daily dose of ethanol .
" We identified three molecules that are crucial for " ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition , " Han said .
In one of the team 's experiments , Han and her students generated transgenic flies whose brain activities regulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine could be turned off temporarily by changing the temperature to 32 - degrees C. " Without a temperature change , the transgenic males showed conspicuous inter-male courtship under the influence of ethanol ; however , they exhibited negligible inter-male courtship when we changed the temperature to block the transmission of dopamine neurons in the brain , " Han said .
" This result suggests that dopamine is a key mediator of ethanol - induced inter - male courtship . "
A second discovery is that repeated exposure to ethanol causes male flies to engage in more inter-male courtship , a phenomenon known as " behavioral sensitization . "
" If a behavior like alcohol consumption becomes more pleasurable the more often you do it , you are more likely to keep doing it , " Han explained .
Because the researchers suspect that behavioral sensitization results from adaptive changes in the brain 's cells and molecules induced by chronic alcohol consumption , they plan to use behavioral sensitization as a model for further physiological studies of alcohol - associated behavior and addiction .
" This part of our study demonstrates that sexual behavior is not determined only during an organism 's development , but it also can be influenced by a post - developmental environmental factor ; in this case , recurring exposure to ethanol , " Han said .
" These findings represent the first demonstration of enduring behavioral changes induced by recurring ethanol exposure in a fly model . "
A third achievement of the team 's research is its demonstration that daily ethanol exposure induces chronic tolerance to the sedative effect of ethanol in flies , as it does in other animals .
Han and her students also made a fourth discovery -- that ethanol - induced intermale courtship is affected by aging .
" As flies get older , their cognitive capacities decline , making them more susceptible to the negative effect of ethanol on cognition , " Han reports .
The research revealed that , under the influence of ethanol , middle - aged and old male flies ( 2- to 4 - weeks old ) have a higher propensity for uninhibited inter -male courtship compared to fully mature male flies ( 4 - days old ) .
" As a result of our research with the fruit fly , we are now just beginning to discover the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying neural changes in the brain that result from the chronic use of alcohol and that result in alcohol addiction and other behavior changes in our fly model , " Han said .
Taken together , the studies described by Han 's team provide novel insights into the physiological effects of chronic ethanol exposure on sexual behavior and adaptive physiological changes within the brain , plus a foundation for future research on the effect of alcohol consumption on sexual behavior in mammals and other species .

Wesley Clark was on Face the Nation today , and he took aim at the idea that McCain ’s Vietnam War experience makes him more qualified to be president .
“ He has been a voice on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
And he has traveled all over the world .
But he has n’t held executive responsibility .
That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded , that was n’t a wartime squadron , ” Clark said .
Host Bob Schieffer said that Barack Obama has n’t had these experiences either , nor has he ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down .
Clark replied that , “ I do n’t think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president . ”
With one swoop , Clark attacked the entire basis for the McCain presidential campaign .
McCain spokesman Brian Roberts tried to use Clark ’s statement to paint Obama as a typical politician , “ If Barack Obama ’s campaign wants to question John McCain ’s military service , that ’s their right .
But let ’s please drop the pretense that Barack Obama stands for a new type of politics .
The reality is he ’s proving to be a typical politician who is willing to say anything to get elected , including allowing his campaign surrogates to demean and attack John McCain ’s military service record . ”

Of course , Clark is correct .
The whole idea that McCain would make a better president because he was a P.O.W. is stupid .
Clark was not challenging McCain ’s military record , what he was challenging is the phony idea that McCain ’s military record makes him a more qualified candidate than Obama .
McCain ’s experience in Vietnam probably shaped his ideology , so is n’t it fair to ask if this ideology is the correct one to lead the nation forward at this time .
I am glad that somebody finally had the guts to stand up and challenge the Republican Party and their faux patriotism .
For too long Democrats have cowered at the prospect of being labeled un-American , so it was refreshing to see Wesley Clark finally step up and challenge these GOP myths .
Now I am left to wonder if Clark just elevated himself on Obama ’s VP short list .

Third political parties do not compete on a level playing field in U.S. politics ; the corporate media will spend more money in one day , promoting the campaigns of Senators John McCain , Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton , than the amount of money third political parties will spend in one year to promote their candidates , combined .
While third party candidates are spending hundreds and thousands of dollars on flyers and brochures , big corporations are spending millions to keep the names of their candidates in the public ’s view .
Stewart A. AlexanderNominee for Vice President Socialist Party USACandidate for Vice President Peace and Freedom PartyMay 12 , 2008 Recently , I was waiting at a traffic signal at the entrance of the I - 15 Freeway north , in Murrieta , California ; and while waiting , the passenger in the car waiting next to my truck , ask me about a sign on the rear window of my truck that reads “ No Liberty Quarry in Temecula . ”
I quickly asked him to support the protest against the quarry ; he then asked me to support Ron Paul for president .
I told him that I was supporting Brian Moore for president and then we both waved good bye .
Having only a brief moment to exchange information , I was not able to inform this Ron Paul supporter the fact that I am the vice presidential running mate for Brian Moore , the Socialist Party USA Nominee for U.S. President .
As the vehicle moved away I could see Ron Paul stickers on both sides of the bumper .
Several months ago , I took a trip to Fresno , California to attend a presidential candidate ’s forum that was sponsored by Fresno City College ; and as I traveled through the California Central Valley , there were huge campaign signs for Ron Paul along the 200 mile stretch of highway , and frequently I was passed by vehicles displaying a Ron Paul bumper sticker .
It is worth noting , that during my entire 300 mile trip to Fresno , I found no campaign materials promoting the campaign of Senator John McCain ; the front runner for the Republican Party .
I believe , in a fair race , with equal media coverage , Ron Paul would win more Republicans votes , in the southwest and northwest U.S. , than Senator John McCain ; according to independent media sources and information that is available through the Internet .
Fresno City College provided an outstanding opportunity for the third party presidential candidates and the public .
There were approximately 200 guests that were present for the candidate ’s forum , including the representatives for several of the presidential candidates .
I was on the panel representing Brian Moore with the Socialist Party USA and Peace and Freedom Party , Richard Becker was representing the campaign of Gloria La Riva with the Party for Socialism and Liberation ( PSL ) and the Peace and Freedom Party .
George Phillies , the candidate for president for the Libertarian Party , appeared in person ; also John Crockford , another candidate for Peace and Freedom Party , appeared in person .
At least a dozen presidential candidates were present or represented at the FCC candidate ’s forum .
Missing at the forum were CNN , Fox News , MSNBC , CBS , NBC , ABC , C - SPAN , the Los Angeles Times and the San Francisco Chronicle and all the corporate media .
In a nationwide field of more than 300 presidential candidates , America ’s corporate media has narrowed the field and choices down to three presidential contenders ; Senators Barack Obama , Hilary Clinton , and John McCain .
America ’s corporate media has blacked out all third party candidates ; on television , Spanish , Vietnamese and Korean speaking stations , and all major newspaper publications nationwide .
However , third parties and third party candidates continue to campaign against the incredible odds imposed by the Democrats and Republicans and the corporate media .
These third party candidates are getting their message to the public with the help of volunteers and supporters , with bumper stickers , brochures , flyers , business cards and attending meeting , and using the Internet .
Third political parties do not compete on a level playing field in U.S. politics ; the corporate media will spend more money in one day , promoting the campaigns of McCain , Obama and Clinton , than the amount of money third political parties will spend in one year to promote their candidates , combined .
While third party candidates are spending hundreds and thousands of dollars on flyers and brochures , big corporations are spending millions to keep the names of their candidates in the public ’s view .
Socialists have remained extremely critical of the media coverage for all third party candidates ; third party candidates are snubbed by the press , and to a great extent , are excluded from participating on national television and radio programs .
Unfortunately , a majority of Americans have been confused by the corporate media and are now persuaded that there are only three presidential candidates .
It is also unfortunate that the three corporate candidates do not offer fair representation for working class people and are not committed to the social , economic and political changes that are important to most working families .
The socialist ’s candidates have received the least amount and minimal coverage from America ’s corporate media .
The socialist ’s candidates have been out spoken opponents to the Iraq War and the illegal occupation of Afghanistan .
The socialist ’s candidates have also been strong advocates for political and social change in the U.S. and improving our political relations in the international community ; those positions for change have remained censored by the U.S. corporate media ; however , the corporate media is providing round the clock coverage for the three presidential candidates that have promised no more than to stay the course that has been mapped by President Bush to advance U.S. imperialism .
Senator Obama , McCain and Clinton represents big money and big businesses ; the three senators only give the appearance that they represent the millions of working people that are presently in jeopardy of losing their homes , they only give the appearance that they represent the millions of colleges students that cannot afford a higher education , they only give the appearance that they represent the 48 million Americans that are without health care insurance , and the three senators only give the appearance that they represent the more than 100 million Americans that are now receiving smaller checks and paying more to meet household expenses .
The socialist ’s presidential candidates believe it is necessary to nationalize the petroleum and ethanol industries to control the skyrocketing cost of fuel and food ; the cost of fuel has risen more than 30 percent within the past year and a worldwide food crisis is now looming .
Senators Clinton , Obama and McCain have tried to avoid any serious discussion about these two critical industries that are now placing more than half the world ’s population at risk .
Still , the corporate media is broadcasting the same rhetoric that the two corporate parties and their candidates have adopted over the past three decades .
In the 2008 U.S. presidential race , the corporate media continues to focus on the 1 percent of the presidential candidates who are the representatives of big corporations and the corporate rulers .
Socialist Party USA and Peace and Freedom Party , both socialist parties , believe that all qualified candidates should get equal time on the television and radio networks and that this should be provided without any cost .
The air waves are public resources and should not be used by the corporate rulers to continue their rigging of the U.S. elections to elect their candidates .
I also believe that the systemic problems in the U.S. electoral system will only be resolved when we have a mass working class socialist alternative that will equalize not only the election crisis but expose the fact that both the Democrats and Republicans are responsible for this criminal war in the Middle East , the financial rip - off of millions of working people and the destruction of our housing , education and social systems in the United States .
The people of the United States deserve a real choice , not determined by union busters , profiteers , corporate rulers , and the corporate controlled media that is out of control .

All of the candidates prattle on about " change . "
The " change " they propose , however , is to do more of the same .
This was well illustrated in a recent speech in California by Senator John McCain .
He proposed ( if elected ) to give 300 million to the developer of a superior automobile battery , rendering unnecessary the current mish - mash of hybrids , semi-hybrids , plug - in electrics , etc .
He said that the 300 million was " a small price to pay " for such a development .
Well , he would say that : HE was n’t paying it .
In typical political fashion , he was being generous with other people ’s money , and without asking their permission or advice before offering it .
McCain would also give automakers a 5000 tax credit for every car they built and sold with " zero - carbon emissions . "
He would increase fines for auto manufacturers who evade existing fuel - efficiency standards , and hold out incentives for greater use of alcohol - based fuels .
And , as if he had n’t said enough , he would increase government regulation of energy traders , whose speculations he blamed , at least in part , for the skyrocketing price of oil .
Wow !
Something for everybody !
Where to begin in analyzing this series of proposals and threats ?
Well , for one thing , there are some contradictions .
For instance , the senator decried the present mixture of hybrids and natural - gas cars , with different incentives , as " — the handiwork of lobbyists , with all the inconsistency and irrationality that involves . "
Would we be unreasonable to assume that , if the senator were elected and implemented his plan , Washington would be awash with lobbyists for battery manufacturers , and their suppliers ?
And is it not " irrational " to offer incentives ( dare we call them bribes ? ) to battery manufacturers , while ignoring the development of hydrogen - fueled cars ?
What about cars driven by compressed air , or solar energy , or fuels as yet unimagined ?
Why single out a single energy source ?
And , come to think of it , what business is it of government anyway ?
And speaking of government , since when does the president reward some and punish others ?
Does he propose to do this lawfully ?
Then lawmakers — Congress — would be involved , and the president is not one of them .
Unless we plan to abandon the term " president " and simply acknowledge an emperor , or king , ruling by fiat , there is no procedure by which a president can bring about such changes .
McCain ’s remarks were triggered by the escalating price of gasoline .
The price of gasoline is high in terms of today ’s fiat , but is that the fault of oil companies ?
Using the Consumer Price Index , we find that gasoline at nearly 4.00 / gallon today compares with gasoline at 40 cents / gallon in 1949 .
( I picked 1949 because that was the year I got my drivers ’ license . )
Today , a bag of " junk silver " coins ( silver coins without numismatic value ) with a face value of $ 250 costs 3350 .
At that rate , a gallon of gas , costing 4.00 / gallon , would cost about 30 cents , if our silver coinage had n’t been taken away from us .
And let ’s not forget that a significant portion of that 4.00 / gallon is state and federal taxes , which have increased since we could buy gas with silver .
If the good senator is concerned about the high price of gasoline , let him look to the root of the problem : the Federal Reserve and its policies .
Is he likely to do that ?
No , it ’s easier to inveigh against speculators , who are merely making rational investment decisions based on existing conditions that they did not create .
The senator ’s inducements to develop a " clean car " could , undoubtedly , lead to an automobile with zero emissions .
Wonderful !
But , if that car were battery powered , what about emissions from the factories producing the batteries ?
What kind of mining might be needed to get the raw materials for such batteries ?
Would the batteries yield less electrical energy than that required to manufacture them ?
There is a " law " of unintended consequences .
Rather than rush headlong in a particular direction , which might yield catastrophic side effects , would n’t it be wiser to let the development of alternative energy sources be gradual , unforced , and diverse ?
It ’s the same old story .
If there ’s a problem , magnify it .
If there is n’t , create one .
Then throw money at it , creating political allies .
It worked with the military - industrial complex , and it ’s working with the medical - industrial complex , and it will work with the environment - industrial complex .
So what ’s new ?
Where ’s the change ?

For some reason , when I think of open relationships I think of Disco Stu .
The hippest dude in the Simpsons ' pantheon of characters , Disco Stu always wears his sunglasses and refers to himself exclusively in the third person .
Based only on that criteria , Disco Stu is inarguably cool .
A babe magnet .
But most of all , I think we all agree that if we had to guess , we 'd conclude that Disco Stu is a swinger .
And if Disco Stu were a senator , I can't help but think that the cultural conversation about sex scandals would be different if a supposedly cuckolded Mrs .
Stu made a statement to the press that , actually , she did n't care about the other woman .
Because you see , they have an agreement .
Then , the sex scandal would no longer be such a scandal .
And that would n't get ratings , now would it ?
Of course , open relationships are in reality far from the playful cartoon caricatures of swingers , or the other end of the non-monogamy spectrum : nightmarish Texan polygamous fundamentalist sects .
As the No. 1 request I 've gotten for topics to be covered in this column is non-monogamy , and there is only one Disco Stu , I think the question is simply , " What are open relationships ? "
It just so happens that the interest in non-monogamous advice has been reaching a peak in my inbox at the same time that infamous New York sex educator Tristan Taormino ( puckerup.com ) has released her newest book " Opening Up : A Guide to Creating and Sustaining Open Relationships " ( Cleis Press ) .
The book has its own blog , chock - full of resources for couples and singles interested in understanding and exploring options outside of monogamy .
What 's more , Taormino lands in town this weekend for two events to celebrate and raise awareness about the indispensable information in her book .
Monday , she 'll be hosting a workshop called " Making Open Relationships Work , " and on June 5 , she 'll be celebrating at a free release party for both the book and her new " reality porn " video " Chemistry # 4 " , along with stars from the film Penny Flame , Adrianna Nicole and Sinnamon Love .
Even if you do n't consider monogamy monotony , the book is an eye opener .
Disco
Stu could not be reached for comment , but Taormino patiently answered my questions about threesomes , changing relationships and more .
Violet Blue :
What 's the biggest myth about open relationships ?
Tristan Taormino :
There are so many myths about open relationships .
I think one of the most popular is that people in open relationships have intimacy issues and trouble with commitment .
The assumption underlying this myth is that true intimacy can only be achieved between two people in a monogamous relationship .
In other words , if you are emotionally and physically intimate with more than one person , it somehow dilutes the intimacy of each relationship .
This is based on the notion that love is a quantifiable thing , like , if you have 100 pounds of love , you can give 100 pounds to your partner .
But if you have multiple partners , you have to split the 100 pounds between them .
Intimacy is about being willing to be open , honest and vulnerable with your partner and bonding on a deep level .
Monogamy does not automatically equal intimacy and non-monogamy does not automatically equal lack of intimacy .
Plus , non-monogamous relationships often involve the same level of commitment as monogamous ones .
People in non-monogamous relationships are not avoiding intimacy or commitment , they are cultivating a relationship style that meets their needs and works for them .
Violet Blue :
How can someone be in a monogamous relationship and change it to an open one without destroying the relationship ?
Tristan Taormino : I think it can be easier for a couple who begin a relationship as an open one than a couple who start out monogamous and then decide to transition to non-monogamy .
Both people need to let go of some of the fundamental ways they 've been interacting with one another as a monogamous couple .
It can definitely be a rocky time when you need to get comfortable with your partner having sex and / or relationships with other people .
That can be a very big leap for people to make .
I think it 's best to start out small rather than dive into the deep end — and communicate a lot .
If you are both committed to it , it can absolutely work , but you both need to be on board 100 percent .
Violet Blue :
How many kinds of open relationships are there ?
Tristan Taormino :
One of the most significant things I learned as I researched this book and talked to so many different people from diverse backgrounds is that while people 's open relationships may have things in common , no two are alike .
They are as individual as the people involved in them .
In my book , I identify and discuss six of the most common styles : partnered non-monogamy , swinging , polyamory , solo polyamory , polyfidelity and the mono / poly combination ( where one partner is monogamous and the other is polyamorous ) .
But I emphasize that within each style , there are plenty of subtle and not - so - subtle differences .
For example , the way that four people in a quad practice polyamory and a straight spouse and a queer spouse practice it will differ greatly and depend on lots of factors .
Violet Blue :
What are examples of rules in open relationships ?
Tristan Taormino :
There are so many rules — or some people do n't like that term and prefer " agreements " — people have negotiated .
Safer sex was at the top of the list of everyone I interviewed for the book .
From there , it varied wildly .
No sex with other people in our bed .
No dates with other people on Saturdays .
I do n't want to know the details .
I want to know as much as you 're willing to share .
I 'm your only Sir and you 're my only boy .
No anal sex with other people .
We can only hook up when one or both of us is out of town .
We can only play with other people when we 're at a club , party or event and the play happens in public .
Those are just a few examples .
Violet Blue :
Does your book provide advice for people who want to have a threesome ?
Tristan Taormino : Certainly , someone can learn about communication , setting limits and dealing with jealousy from my book — those are useful skills for people who want to have a threesome .
But my book really is focused on relationships , so if someone is looking for a lot of sex advice or technique , this probably is n't the book for them .
I 'd recommend " The Threesome Handbook " by Vicki Vantoch , which is much more focused on sex and specifically about threesomes .
Violet Blue :
What happens in your " Making Open Relationships Work " workshops ?
Tristan Taormino : I hope to give people tools , ideas and strategies to create the open relationship of their dreams or make their existing open relationships satisfying .
We 'll discuss common challenges and benefits , different ways to resolve conflicts , and how to cope with the dynamic , ever - changing nature of an open relationship .
Violet Blue :
What do you love about San Francisco ?
Is there someplace you want to make sure you visit when you 're in town ?
Tristan Taormino : San Francisco is and has been light years ahead of most other places in the country in terms of cultivating communities for people outside the mainstream ; it 's such a welcoming place for leather people , queers , genderqueers , transpeople , non-monogamous people , sex workers and other kinds of perverts , so I always feel right at home !
I have n't been there in about five years .
One of my favorite restaurants is Greens , I love Joseph Schmidt chocolates , and I have n't seen Good Vibrations ( goodvibes.com ) since it moved to a new location !
Tristan Taormino 's workshop " Making Open Relationships Work " ( for singles and couples ) is on Monday at 7:30 p.m. , at Good Vibrations , 603 Valencia St. ( at 17th Street ) , and pre-registration is strongly recommended .
On June 5 , go to the same Good Vibes location for the " Opening Up and Chemistry 4 Release Party " at 6:30 p.m. ( free admission ) .

For the past 20 years , APIs have revolutionized the way we do business online .
Instead of coding from scratch with each programming project , APIs provide developers with the shortcut needed to provide tools like online payments to customers .
In some cases , a quick copy - and - paste allows you to offer top web productivity tools into your web build .
Take your web services to the next level with White Label API Integration .
If you ’re new to the process of white labeling , check out this quick guide to help you get started .
What are APIs ?
An API is a self - contained code that helps you add deploy website resources faster .
They are available in a variety of programming languages to help developers work across platforms .
Using an API when programming a website is similar to when you use an appliance in your home .
The appliance needs electricity but you do n’t need to go through the trouble of wiring it to the outlet .
The plug allows the appliance to reach the power source with ease .
You get your morning coffee without having to be a certified electrician .
The same goes for using an API .
A website user can access tools on your website that you did n’t need to build from scratch .
The quality level of APIs varies depending on where and how you want to use it .
For beginners , it is important to choose the right source so you get the support you need if anything goes wrong .
How to Choose an API
The major advantage of using an API is to save yourself time .
Take for instance the appliance example .
If your coffee maker needs to be rebuilt every day because of bugs , but the manufacturer offers little to no customer service , you ’d quickly get a new coffee maker .
This same way of thinking should apply when choosing an API .
You want a combination of support and convenience with working with an API provider .
Depending on your level of traffic , it can be hard to switch API providers after launching it to the general public .
This scenario is especially true of payments APIs on retail sites .
Avoid vendor lock - in by fully vetting your API provider in the following ways .
Features Review
One of the best ways to avoid vendor lock - in , or the inability to easily switch API providers , it to do a complete review of features .
Assuming that two APIs with the same general purpose provide the exact same benefits is common mistake developers make .
For example , Paypal provides extensive authorize - capture processes as a payment API .
Though Stripe provided similar payment services when the brand first started out , the authorize - capture feature was n’t included for funds transfers until recently .
Filter your API search to include the specific features you ’ll need to integrate into your website .
Use these results only to make your selection .
Documentation
It ’s important that the API provider offers detailed documentation .
You need both use cases and all parameters outlined to make the experience seamless .
Documentation is the simplest way for you to limit your trial and error period .
You need a peek into how implementation will look for your integration before making a commitment .
If there ’s no documentation at all , it ’s a major red flag for the API provider .
Data Formats
Senior developers can recall the days when XML was the format of choice for programmatic request data .
But this option is n’t necessarily a top choice for newer developers .
JSON is simpler and preferred by developers because it ’s easy to implement compared to XML .
Check to see whether the API you ’re using will return data in the format your prefer .
Interface
API documentation is n’t useful if the information is n’t clearly communicated .
Look through documentation to see whether the method and parameter names explain their purpose clearly .
They should match your own style of naming and syntax .
It ’s a personal preference that goes a long way when you ’re in the thick of programming and get sidetracked by trivial naming requirements .
The process can slow you down depending on how quickly you can adopt the required program naming conventions .
White Label API Integration
White labeling is the process of offering an API , or other services , without the branding of the original developer .
The option for white label API integration is everywhere .
The benefit of using an API without the branding of the programmer is increasing the professional look of your website .
Adding too many third party logos to your site can make your site appear cluttered and hard to navigate .
White labeling is also helpful when you are upsetting a specific service to customers .
For example , white label API can be sold to clients as a part of a web services package .
Web hosting companies commonly use this model when offering premium features like email marketing through their hosting subscriptions .
Some of these features are created by third - party developers but are offered through the web host as a part of your overall subscription fee .
If white labeling is your end goal , make sure the API limits do n’t include a request threshold per API key or IP .
These limits are in place usually to prevent abuse when working with public - facing data .
In other cases , though they are a way to get you to spend more on the implementation process .
The overhead cost should be worth it allowing you to still make a decent profit .
Check to see if there are competing APIs that do n’t offer limits at all .
Upgrade Your API Implementation
White label API integration is n’t a shortcut to providing a top - notch product .
Depending on the complexity of your web services , it might take more time than you expected .
Do your research before getting started to help you determine whether or not the API provider is a good fit for your development needs .
Spending this time working on the front end saves you hours , if not weeks , of labor on the back end .

Reuters photographer Howard Burditt was was released on bail yesterday after he was arrested on Monday for allegedly using a satellite phone to file pictures of the aftermath of Zimbabwe ’s elections .
Meanwhile , Davison Maruziva , editor of the weekly independent newspaper the Standard , was arrested for publishing an article deemed to be prejudicial to the State .
He now faces contempt of court charges .
Since the 29 March election , the government has been involved in a heavy crackdown on dissenting voices .
Freelance journalist Frank Chikowore was arrested on 15 April along with Luke Tamborinyoka , director of Information for Movement of Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Both men were charged with public violence relating to the torching of a bus .
On 2 May , both men were granted $ 5 billion Zimbabwean dollar bail ( $ 167,000 ) and ordered to report to the police twice a week .
Chickwore ’s lawyer , Harrison Nkomo was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly insulting Robert Mugabe .
He is being charged under a section of the Criminal Law Act dealing with undermining or insulting the authority of the president .
Barack Obama faced widespread condemnation today from both right and left for reneging on a promise on election campaign financing .
The Democratic presidential candidate , who normally gets a good press , found himself in the unusual position of being under attack not only from his Republican rival John McCain but papers such as the New York Times and Washington Post , think - tanks committed to election reform and even his own supporters .
Obama promised last year that , provided his Republican rival would too , he would abide by the election funding scheme set up after the 1974 Watergate scandal .
The scheme provides each candidate with $ 85 m ( £ 42.5 m ) from the public purse to fight the election campaign from early in September to November 4 , on condition they accept no outside money .
McCain , less successful at fund - raising than Obama , agreed yesterday to take public funding but Obama said he is not going to participate , the first presidential candidate ever to do so .
Obama 's campaign team insisted the candidate made the decision because the existing system is open to abuse by the Republicans .
But signing up for the $ 85 m deal would be squander a huge advantage he has in fund - raising .
Up to the end of April , Obama raised $ 265 m , spent mainly on his battle for the Democratic nomination with Hillary Clinton , compared with McCain 's $ 115 m by the end of May .
Obama is on course to raise at least another $ 265 m between now and the election .
Steve Schmidt , a senior adviser in the McCain campaign team , led the attack today , saying that breaking the promise raised questions about trust .
" As we scrutinise Barack Obama 's words , it is increasingly difficult for those of us with the responsibility of following this year 's election closely to discern what Obama truly believes at his core on the issues of great importance to the American people , " Schmidt said .
The Republican party today distributed copies of editorials from major US papers , including the New York Times and the Washington Post .
The New York Times , said ; " The excitement underpinning senator Barack Obama 's campaign rests considerably on his evocative vows to depart from self - interested politics .
Unfortunately , Mr Obama has come up short of that standard with this decision to reject public spending limitations and opt instead for unlimited private financing in the general election . "
The Washington Post was also indignant : " Mr Obama had an opportunity here to demonstrate that he really is a different kind of politician , willing to put principles and the promises he has made above political calculations .
He made a different choice ... "
Michael Malbin , director of the non-partisan Campaign Finance Institute , expressed disappointment and said the system likely would have worked well again this year .
He thought the money provided by public funds should have been sufficient : " A million dollars a day does n't look to me like chicken feed . "
The Democratic senator Russ Feingold , an Obama supporter , called Obama 's retreat " not a good decision " .
Obama has said before he believes that the more money spent , the better the chance of winning an election .
He today aired his first general election ad on television across 18 states , an early demonstration of his spending power .
In an article for USA Today , Obama wrote : " The decision not to participate in the public financing system was n't an easy one - especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections .
But the public financing of presidential elections , as it exists today , is broken - and the Republican Party apparatus has mastered the art of gaming this broken system . "
His team argues that while McCain has agreed to the limit , there are right - wing groups with millions at their disposal who could back campaigns such as the Swift Boat one in 2004 that challenged the Vietnam record of the Democratic candidate , John Kerry .
His team also says that the Republican party is cash - rich compared to the Democrats .
Both parties can spend on campaigning separate from their candidates .
Obama 's decision could spell the end of publicly financed election campaigns .
In other developments , Obama announced today that he and Clinton are to campaign jointly next Friday , the first time since she conceded the race a fortnight ago .
Obama has said he would not make any public comment about his search for a vice - presidential running mate but a Democratic congresswoman , Carolyn Kilpatrick , disclosed today after meeting his team vetting candidates that John Edwards , who was the vice - presidential candidate in 2004 , and the former senator Sam Nunn are both on the list .
Going to the mall to buy music may no longer be a rite of passage for adolescents .
For the first time last year , nearly half of all teenagers bought no compact discs , a dramatic increase from 2006 , when 38 % of teens shunned such purchases , according to a new report released Tuesday .
The illegal sharing of music online continued to soar in 2007 , but there was one sign of hope that legal downloading was picking up steam .
In the last year , Apple Inc. 's iTunes store , which sells only digital downloads , jumped ahead of Best Buy Co. to become the No. 2 U.S. music seller , trailing Wal - Mart Stores Inc .
That could be hopeful news for the music industry , which has been scrambling in recent years to replace its rapidly disappearing CD sales with music sold online .
The number of CDs sold in the U.S. fell 19 % in 2007 from the previous year while sales of digital songs jumped 45 % , Nielsen SoundScan said .

The number of people buying music legally from online music stores jumped 21 % to 29 million last year from 24 million in 2006 , according to the study by NPD Group , a market research firm in Port Washington , N.Y .
NPD declined to release figures on individual retailers ’ sales or their market shares , so it is impossible to know how close iTunes sales are to Wal - Mart’s .
The NPD market ranking of music retailers is based on a study of the music habits of Americans 13 and older over the last week .
The report , which involved 5,000 people who answered questions online , highlighted a generational split .
The increase in legal online sales was driven by people 36 to 50 , the report said , giving the music industry an opportunity to target these customers by tapping into its older catalogs .
That ’s not to say iTunes is not popular with the younger set .
Mallory Portillo , 24 , an executive assistant in Santa Monica , said she had n’t bought a CD in five years , but typically spent more than $ 100 a month buying music online .
She will turn to illegal music sharing sites only if she can’t find new releases or more obscure music on iTunes , she said .

Buying online saves her the step of having to load a CD onto her laptop so that she can then transfer the files to her iPod .
Her most recent purchase came two days ago , when she spent $ 19.99 on iTunes for Michael Jackson ’s 25th anniversary edition of “ Thriller . ”
“ Hopefully it does n’t come back to haunt me one day that my ‘ Thriller ’ CD is on my computer and therefore not a collector ’s item , ” she said .
The increase in online spending did n’t offset the revenue lost from the drop in CD sales and from illegal downloading .
Last year , about 1 million consumers stopped buying CDs , according to NPD .

There are several ways for consumers to expand a digital music collection .
They can buy music at online stores such as iTunes and Amazon.com ’s MP3 store .
They also can convert their CD collection into a digital format .
What concerns the music industry is illegal Internet file - sharing on websites where people pick up a digital song or album that others have uploaded .
They can also do what is known as peer - to - peer file sharing , when people download music while temporarily opening up their computers to others to pick up music .
The music industry says people who obtain music free online are breaking the law .
Rachel Rottman , 14 , says she has n’t bought a CD in a year .
The Santa Monica High School freshman says she downloads five or six songs a day , using paid services such as iTunes and social networking site MySpace , where bands post songs for free download .
Rachel said she had about 2,600 songs stored on her computer .
Before getting a computer in the seventh grade , she always bought CDs .
But now it ’s too much trouble , she said .

“ You have to go to the store and then you have to pay -- I do n’t know how much , $ 12 , I ’m guessing ? -- then you have to put it on your computer , ” Rachel said .
“ When you download it , it ’s right there . ”
Hunter Conrad , an eighth - grader at Lincoln Middle School in Santa Monica , says she downloads about 80 % of her music from iTunes , “ but when it ’s an artist I really like , I ’ll buy the original CD . ”
Out of her group of friends , she ’s “ one of the few ” who still buy CDs , she said .
Most of her buddies download for the convenience , to save money and to get only the songs they like .
“ Nobody really wants the other songs [ on an album ] , ” Hunter , 14 , said .
“ They just want the hits . ”

In the last year , consumers paid for 42 % of the music they obtained , the report said .
That was down from 48 % in 2006 and more than 50 % in 2005 .
“ The trend is continuing but it will flatten because there are people who will always want the physical , ” said Ted Cohen , managing partner at TAG Strategic , a digital media advisory firm .
Over the last year , the music industry has pushed back .
Some companies now permit online music stores to sell songs without copyright protections in hopes of making it easier for consumers to move digital music to different computers and devices , and thus remove the temptation to download it illegally .
Some music companies have thrown support behind Amazon ’s MP3 store , which competes with iTunes .
The music industry has also sued fans to stop them from downloading and sharing music without paying for it .

The legal efforts may have had an effect .
The report said that the portion of survey respondents who shared music on sites that facilitate illegal downloads was 19 % in 2007 , the same as 2006 .
But those who do it are doing it more .
Some said they got more than 3,000 songs a year this way .
Two years ago , teenagers accounted for 15 % of CD sales .
In 2007 , the figure was 10 % .
The digital music world has yet to completely capture the attentions of Isaac Kahn and his friend Charlie Williams , both 14 .
They buy music online but prefer to go to the Amoeba store on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood and thumb through the CDs .
“ I like to look at CDs and see if there ’s anything else I might want to buy , ” Isaac said .
Charlie , who recently bought a device to transform his father ’s 300 records into digital files , said many teens download music illegally because they are on computers .
But he does n’t have a computer .
And besides , he said , “ I ’m a musician myself ; I prefer to just buy it . ”

According to the
Energy Information Admininstration
( EIA ) , the highest average monthly gas price in the early 1980s was $ 1.417 per gallon in March of 1981 , which in today 's dollars is $ 3.22 per gallon , which also according to the EIA is the
average retail cost of gas today
.
capita disposable personal income in those years .
Gas prices averaged $ 1.245 and $ 1.38 in 1980 and 1981 respectively , and per- capita income was $ 8,822 and $ 9,765 in those years ( see chart above , click to enlarge ; source for Personal Income is
Gas is now selling for an average of $ 3.22 and per- capita disposable personal income in March was about $ 33,000 , so that 1000 gallons of gas now costs 9.76 % of per- capita personal disposable income ( see chart above , click to enlarge ) .
However , gas prices as a percent of income are still way below the early 1980s .
In both 1980 and 1981 , 1000 gallons of gas at the average price cost 14.1 % of per-disposable personal income in those years .
Gas prices averaged $ 1.245 and $ 1.38 in 1980 and 1981 respectively , and per-income was $ 8,822 and $ 9,765 in those years ( see chart above , click to enlarge ; source for Personal Income is Bureau of Economic Analysis , Table 2 ) .

Bottom Line : Gas is still much cheaper today as a percent of income compared to 1980 or 1981 .
To be as expensive as gas was in 1980 - 1981 gas ( as a percent of income ) , prices today would have to get all the way up to $ 4.62 per gallon .
The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) has launched a new database to promote the development of telecentres – community centres where people in the poorest and most remote areas , from farmers to students , gain access to computers and the Internet .
The Telecentre Online Database , covering over 12,000 telecentres in 16 countries , seeks to support research and information exchange for those involved with these e-centres .
It also provides statistical data and information on individual countries and specific projects , with information accessible by a keyword search .
The project is part of a larger initiative of the UN ’s five regional commissions called “ Knowledge networks through ICT access points for disadvantaged communities , ” which aims to empower poor and disadvantaged communities – women in particular – by converting selected e-centres into global knowledge hubs to bolster communities ’ abilities to organize , share and disseminate knowledge .
Meanwhile , a UN - backed meeting focusing on expanding affordable broadband access has opened in Pattaya , Thailand .
The three - day meeting , organized by the UN International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and the Thai Government , will also assess new regulatory measures targeted at encouraging investment and growth in information and communication technologies ( ICT ) .
“ Sharing of views , experiences and best practices among regulators is the only way to address the challenges posed by today ’s technological and market developments , ” ITU Secretary - General Hamadoun Touré noted .
“ It is only by working together that smart policies and practices can be put into place to ensure that the target of connecting the world to ICT within the next seven years can be met . ”
" Hockey Night in Canada , " a 1968 song written by Dolores Claman from Vancouver , has been a longstanding staple of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ’s hockey broadcasts , but fans wo n’t be hearing it next season .
CBC has refused to renew its license for the song , which costs the company about $ 500 in licensing fees per game .
Instead , CBC is holding a contest to see who can write a winning replacement for the theme .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
" I am saddened by the decision of the CBC to drop the Hockey Night in Canada theme ( listen below ) after our lengthy history together , " said Claman .
" I nevertheless respect its right to move in a new direction . "
Update : CBC rival CTV has purchased the song for its own hockey broadcasts .
Claman had sued the CBC in 2004 for playing the song more than its license allowed .
Her agency , Copyright Music & Visuals , says it offered CBC - TV the chance to renew its license for the song under terms that were " virtually identical " to the one that had been agreed upon in years past .
The agency ’s website for the song refers to it as " Canada ’s Second National Anthem , " and hockey fans have sprung to her defense , for which she is grateful .
" I wrote this songwith a picture of warriors in my head … hockey warriors , " said Clamant .
" Now it would seem thehockey fans are the true warriors .
Thank you so much for all of your kind wordsand anecdotes about how much the song means to you . "
According to Copyright Music & Visuals , CBC said it was notgoing to renew the deal only one minute before the CBC ’s deadline forlicensing the song .
Rather than continuing to license the song , CBC indicated that itwould run a contest to find a song to replace " Hockey Night in Canada . "
( Previously , the network had run contests
to see which band could record the best cover of the song . )
The contestis said to involve the Vancouver - based Nettwerk Records , home to AvrilLavigne , Sarah McLachlanand The Barenaked Ladies .
People would be able to tune in and vote .
It ’s unclear whether Claman herself is barred from entering ; if she were to enter , she ’d probably run away with the thing .

Mr. Waxman raised the issue after executives of a Miami Beach arms dealer , AEY , were indicted on fraud charges this month , accused of pawning off tens of millions of banned and decrepit Chinese cartridges on the United States Army to supply Afghan security forces .
The Pentagon ’s folly with the fly - by - night trafficker is just the latest example of the Bush administration ’s cynically cozy contracting practices and shockingly weak oversight that have wasted billions of dollars of taxpayers ’ money .
Congressional investigators took testimony from a United States military attaché who accused the American ambassador in Albania of helping to cover up the Chinese ammunition ’s origins .
The ambassador , John Withers , denies wrongdoing .
But Rep. Waxman is wisely working to map the dimensions of fraud and waste .
The AEY fraud case followed a detailed investigation by The Times , which found the company scored the Afghan contract despite a record of failure and risky corner - cutting in a half - dozen other plum contracts .
( Along the way , Efraim Diveroli , the company president who is now indicted , had the gall to fight off a court case accusing him of abusing his girlfriend by claiming national security privilege “ in the fight against terrorism . ” )
You ’d think the answer would be obvious , but here we have a NOAA operated USHCN climate station of record providing a live experiment .
It always helps to illustrate with photos .
Today I surveyed a sewage treatment plant , one of 4 stations surveyed today ( though I tried for 5 ) and found that for convenience , they had made a nice concrete walkway to allow servicing the Fisher - Porter rain gauge , which needs a paper punch tape replaced one a month .
Here is what you see in visible light :
Here is what the infrared camera sees :
Note that the concrete surface is around 22 - 24°C , while the grassy areas are between 12 - 19°C
This station will be rated a CRN5 by this definition from the NOAA Climate Reference Network handbook , section 2.2.1 :
Class 5 ( error >~= 5C ) – Temperature sensor located next to / above an artificial heating source , such a building , roof top , parking lot , or concrete surface . ”
Now a caveat :
There had just been a light rain , and skies had been overcast , it had just started to clear and you can see some light shadows in the visible image .
Had this rainfall and overcast not occurred , the differences between grass and concrete temperatures would likely be greater .
Unfortunately I was unable to wait around for full sun conditions .
The air temperature was 58 °F ( 14.4 °C ) according to my thermometer at the time .
Here is another view which shows the NOAA sensor array , the sky , and the evidence of recent rainfall as evidenced by the wet parking lot :
Why NOAA allows installations like this I ’ll never understand .
And this station is a USHCN climate station of record , used in who knows how many climate studies .
I ’ll tell you more on this station and others I surveyed tomorrow .

SANTANA DEAL SANTANA DEAL FANTASY ANALYSIS FANTASY ANALYSIS
It 's a pretty disappointing day for Twins fans .
Both packages being discussed by the Red Sox and Yankees during the winter meetings seemed more attractive to us .
Carlos Gomez and Deolis Guerra are big - time talents , but Gomez lacks plate discipline and might not fit in the top half of the lineup and an awful lot could go wrong before Guerra even sniffs the majors .
Kevin Mulvey and Phil Humber are third starters at best and probably more like fourths .
It 's a whole lot better than losing Santana for draft picks next winter , but we'd have taken a Phil Hughes or Jacoby Ellsbury package over this .
By Rotoworld.com
The Mets , ridiculed in New York for inactivity since their season - ending collapse last season , won the biggest prize of the winter , reaching an agreement to acquire two - time Cy Young winner Johan Santana from the Minnesota Twins .
With a 72 - hour negotiating window set to close at 5 p.m. ET Friday , Mets officials met with agent Peter Greenberg in Manhattan on Wednesday , but neither side would divulge details , according to the Associated Press .
Santana — a two - time Cy Young Award winner elgible for free agency after the season — would have to waive a no - trade clause .
ANALYSIS : Santana moves
Mets to forefront of NL East Santana is in position to become the highest - paid pitcher in baseball history , surpassing San Francisco Giants starter Barry Zito 's seven - year , $ 126 million deal .
The Mets have a good relationship with Greenberg , who already represents two of their players : All - Star shortstop Jose Reyes and reserve outfielder Endy Chavez .
The Twins stand to receive outfielder Carlos Gomez and minor - league pitchers Phil Humber , Deolis Guerra and Kevin Mulvey .
Gomez , 22 , who hit .232 last season , is expected to replace center fielder Torii Hunter , the Twins ' seven - time Gold Glove winner who signed a five - year , $ 90 million contract in November with the Los Angeles Angels .
" I hate to hear that , " Hunter said , when told of the trade .
" I mean , I 'm happy for Johan , but he meant so much for that organization .
I 'm sad for the Twins ' organization and all of the fans out there .
They loved Johan .
This is going to be tough for them to swallow . "
The Twins offered Santana a four - year , $ 80 million extension two months ago , but he rejected the offer .
The Mets , barring a breakdown in contract negotiations , now inherit the most dominant pitcher in baseball since 2003 .
Santana is 82-35 with a 2.92 ERA , including 1,152 strikeouts the last five years .
" The Mets are not only getting a Cy Young winner , " Hunter said , " but an absolute bulldog who 's great in the clubhouse .
He 's going to dominate that league .
They 're going to absolutely love him in New York . "
" I know he 's happy , too , because he really wanted to go to the Mets .
He 's always wanted to swing the wood .
He can hit .
" So I do n't know who 's happier , Johan , the Mets , or everyone in the American League because they do n't have to face him anymore . "
The Twins , who had trade talks over the last two months with the Boston Red Sox , New York Yankees , Seattle Mariners and the Mets , told teams they wanted a final offer by Monday .
The Red Sox 's final offer included starter Jon Lester and center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury in separate packages but was scaled back from initial proposals , including lesser prospects , according to a high - ranking Red Sox official .

Listen to almost any politician , President Bush included , and you ’ll hear that the fight against global warming cannot be won without cleaner technologies that will ease dependence on fossil fuels .
Yet these same politicians are on the verge of allowing modest but vital tax credits to expire that are crucial to the future of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power .
These credits are necessary to attract new investment in renewable sources until they become competitive with cheaper , dirtier fuels like coal .
When the credits disappear , investments shrivel .
The production tax credit for wind energy has been allowed to expire three times .
In each case , new investment dropped by more than 70 percent .
The credits for wind and solar expire at the end of this year , so action now is important .
Though there is plenty of blame to go around , Mr. Bush and Senate Republicans bear a heavy burden .
The House approved , as part of last year ’s energy bill , a multiyear extension of the credits , while insisting  under its pay - as - you - go rules  that they be offset by rescinding an equivalent amount in tax credits for the oil companies .
The oil companies ( though rolling in profits ) screamed , Mr. Bush lofted veto threats , and the Senate , by a one - vote margin , refused to go along .
Senator John McCain  who is far ahead of his party on climate change  missed that crucial vote .
He could be a hero if he now rode in off the campaign trail and corralled the Republican votes needed to extend the tax credits ; his vote alone might be enough .
History is riddled with the remnants of photographic tampering .
Stalin , Mao , Hitler , Mussolini , Castro and Brezhnev each had photographs manipulated — from creating more heroic - looking poses to erasing enemies or bottles of beer .
In Stalin ’s day , such phony images required long hours of cumbersome work in a darkroom , but today anyone with a computer can readily produce fakes that can be very hard to detect .
Yes , it 's again that magical time of the year when the Darwin Awards are bestowed , honoring the least - evolved among us .

Hillary Clinton is hoping an appeal to a Democratic party rules committee Saturday will revive her campaign to become the party 's candidate in November 's U.S. presidential election .
Clinton is lagging behind Barack Obama in the contest but is hoping an appeal to the 30 members of the rules committee can give her a boost .
Last September , the party discounted 2.3 million primary votes in Florida and Michigan because the two states scheduled the votes in January , before the official beginning of the Democratic primary season on Feb .
5 .
Clinton backed the party ruling at the time , saying , " It 's clear this election they 're having is not going to count for anything . "
She won both states — Obama was n't even on the ballot in Michigan — and now she 's arguing that ignoring the votes is anti-democratic .
Compromise possible
The committee may seek a compromise Saturday , perhaps seating half of the two states ' delegates at the convention , the CBC's Michael Colton reported .
The Obama campaign would welcome that , but it wo n't satisfy Clinton supporters .
" Our position is very clear , " Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said .
" Florida and Michigan ought to be seated 100 per cent .
We ought to honour the votes . "
Clinton has been so eager to get the votes counted that she has compared it to electoral problems like the Florida presidential vote in 2000 , when Republican candidate George W. Bush beat the Democratic challenger Al Gore by 537 votes out of six million cast , amid controversy about the count .
She 's even compared it to the Zimbabwean presidential election , where there were allegations of vote fraud and violence .
Obama is currently ahead of Clinton by about 200 delegates , 1,984 to 1,782 .
WASHINGTON 
As the farm economy collapsed in the 1980s , the U.S. Department of Agriculture was saddled with mountains of surplus cheese , corn and other foods that it socked away in warehouses and even caves .
As recently as 2003 , the USDA had to buy so much powdered milk to support dairy prices that beleaguered officials shipped some to U.S. ranchers for cattle feed .
STORY : U.S. could add $ 770 million in food aid While the previous surpluses were costly and sharply criticized , much of the food found its way to the poor , here and abroad .
Today , says USDA Undersecretary Mark Keenum , " Our cupboard is bare . "
U.S. government food surpluses have evaporated because , with record high prices , farmers are selling their crops on the open market , not handing them over to the government through traditional price - support programs that make up for deficiencies in market price .
Worldwide , food prices have risen 45 % in the past nine months , posing a crisis for millions , says the United Nations '
Food and Agriculture Organization .
Because of the current economics of food , and changes in federal farm subsidy programs designed to make farmers rely more on the markets , large U.S. reserves may be gone for a long time .
The upshot : USDA has almost no extra food to supplement the billions in cash payments it spends to combat hunger at home and in developing nations .
A coalition of religious and farm groups , in an open letter to Congress this week , warned that low supplies increase the risk of hunger and higher prices , calling for creation of a strategic grain reserve .
" As a matter or national security , our government should recognize and act on its responsibility to provide a stable market for food in an era of unprecedented risk , " says the letter from the National Family Farm Coalition and various groups .
Others experts say large government stockpiles are not only unnecessary , they are counterproductive .
That includes John Block who , as President Reagan 's Agriculture secretary during the 1980s , went to enormous lengths to get rid of extra food : giving commodities to farmers as payment for idling land , offering surplus grain as a subsidy to exporters and holding cheese giveaways for the poor .
" We should n't have large reserves stacked up .
It was very costly for us , " Block said , noting that for years he was accused by other nations of depressing their farm sectors by dumping extra U.S. food on world markets .
Still , even he terms the current world situation " shocking " in the sense that prices for so many types of food have risen at once .
The USDA 's sole remaining sizable stockpile contains about 24 million bushels of wheat in a special government trust dedicated to international humanitarian aid .
The special food program , which also holds $ 117 million in cash , has dwindled from its original 147 - million - bushel level as Republican and Democratic administrations have used it but not fully replenished it .
That leaves the Bush administration with less flexibility to respond quickly to international food aid needs .
President Bush in mid-April drew $ 200 million from the Emerson Humanitarian Trust , named after former congressman Bill Emerson , a Missouri Republican .
Bush 's action followed a desperate plea from the United Nations for food aid .
Thursday , the president announced he would ask Congress for $ 770 million in separate , additional funding to meet international needs .
But Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer , at a recent food aid conference , says his agency faces tough decisions about managing the rest of the reserve in times of widespread hunger .
" How far do we draw down ? " he asked .
" Do we take it down to zero because we need it ?
Do we hold some in there , because who knows what 's going to happen , for emergency purposes later ? "
Nutrition programs in need Domestic nutrition programs , supported by once - bountiful commodity supplies , also face increasing stress .
In a sign of how tight the situation has become , Keenum last summer dug into little - used legal authority to barter the last remaining USDA raw cotton and other surplus for about $ 120 million of canned meat and other processed goods desperately needed by domestic food banks and international programs .
" Now that we 've created the program , it would be great if we had more stocks we could convert , " Keenum says .
" We just do n't . "
The fact that USDA 's larders are depleted does n't mean the country is out of food .
The vast majority of U.S. grain is in the hands of farmers and private firms .
Overall , the USA is expected to have carryover supplies of 241.9 million bushels of wheat this year , for example .
But the USDA situation is indicative of broader trends , with domestic and international grain supplies in decline .
Total U.S. wheat stocks are down from 777 million bushels in 2001 , and are the lowest since World War II .
The USDA says that 's about a 35 - day supply of wheat and notes that farmers in Texas are already starting to harvest a new crop .
The American Bakers Association estimates the country has a 24 - day supply of wheat compared with the previous three - month level on hand .
International grain supplies are the tightest in three decades , and prices of wheat , corn , rice and other food staples have doubled or tripled .
" The whole world has gotten fairly sanguine about food supplies , " says Bruce Babcock , director of the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University .
" Advances in logistics and just - in - time production have allowed the world to get by on very low stock levels for a very long time .
We kind of undershot it this year . "
But Babcock says a strategic food trust like that proposed by farm and religious groups raises tough policy questions :
How would it be managed ?
When would it be tapped ?
Whom would it benefit ?
And how would USDA keep it from acting as a disincentive to advances in productivity ?
There is some basis for comparison .
The nation for years has maintained a strategic petroleum reserve as a form of energy security .
The White House , which now wants to increase supplies in the reserve , is in a struggle with members of Congress who say such a move is unwise at a time when oil prices are above $ 100 a barrel .
Congress , so far , has responded to the growing food crisis by proposing a major increase in nutrition funding in a five - year farm bill now under debate .
Lawmakers and the White House are also prepared to spend more money for international programs .
The U.S. in the last year provided more than $ 2 billion in foreign food aid .
" The commitment is there to deal with the international and domestic situation … in a formidable way , " says Rep. Rosa DeLauro , D - Conn. , chair of a House subcommittee that funds food aid .
But there has been no major re-examination of one of the major factors contributing to tight supply : recent federal laws mandating increased production of ethanol , which in the USA is generally made from corn .
Many farmers today are growing crops for fuel , not food , a development outside of USDA control and one that makes it harder for the government to manage crop production .
As much as a third of the corn crop could be dedicated to ethanol production .
Commodity programs
The USDA accumulates stockpiles several ways .
It buys dairy products when prices are low .
Farmers who grow wheat , corn , soybeans and other grains can forfeit their crop to pay off loans .
The USDA can buy crops , including fruits and vegetables , when surpluses develop .
The federal government spends more than $ 60 billion a year on food stamps , the school lunch program and other nutrition aid .
Much of that is in cash , but the programs can also benefit from surplus commodities .
The USDA on Thursday announced it would buy $ 50 million in pork products for feeding children and school lunch programs , as part of its effort to cope with rising food prices .
The purchase also helps pork producers who have been hit by rising grain prices .
In general , higher prices mean federal spending is rising , and many school districts are being forced to raise lunch prices .
High prices and low supplies have probably had the most immediate impact on food banks , which face rising caseloads and falling private - sector donations as the economy slows .
" USDA food truly is some of the most nutritional that we receive .
We are located where there is no food industry other than retail groceries and small restaurants . …
We could not feed the people we need to without the support of the USDA , " says Rhonda Chafin , executive director of the Second Harvest Food Bank of Northeast Tennessee .
America 's Second Harvest , a network of 205 food banks serving 25 million , is seeing a 20 % rise in its caseload .
Food banks and other programs receive $ 140 million in annual commodity donations , which could rise to $ 250 million in the five - year farm bill under debate .
The USDA provides extra food via a bonus program , buying surplus goods as they become available .
The program is an add - on that varies from year to year , though food banks have come to rely on it .
The bonus began to dry up several years ago as food prices rose , plummeting from about $ 250 million in 2003 to $ 58 million last year .
The USDA barter program has partly picked up the slack .
The Emerson Trust , the reserve for humanitarian aid , was created when the government was swimming in supply .
The trust is n't the main U.S. food aid program but is an important backstop that 's been tapped seven times since 2002 to aid Africa and Iraq .
Sporadic replenishment
The trust has been sporadically replenished since the mid-1990s .
In addition to wheat , it now holds $ 117 million in cash : enough to buy about 14.6 million bushels of wheat at the current price .
Still , that would leave overall supply down about two - thirds from original levels .
International feeding organizations , which have pushed for years to get the trust replenished , note that it is the only U.S. stockpile for emergency needs .
Now , at a time when it is desperately needed , they say , the stocks are not there .
Food aid " is going to have to be significantly higher if we 're going to continue to play the role we 've played in the past ; … $ 117 million is not much , " says Lisa Kuennen - Asfaw of Catholic Relief Services .
As is the case with many food programs , use of the trust has been politically charged in the past .
For example , wheat growers have protested that pulling wheat out of the trust when prices are low further depresses markets .
Companies that have been paid for years to hold supplies of wheat for the trust do n't want to lose their payments .
USDA 's Keenum says the U.S. government has the will and the money to continue providing needed resources to hungry people .
" We 're not seeing a shortage of food in this country , " Keenum says .
" The issue is having the resources to purchase food for international and domestic needs . "

John McCain ’s Time for Action tour arrived in New Orleans Thursday , where McCain toured the hurricane - damaged 9th Ward and criticized both the Bush Administration and Congress for its handling of the disaster .
Lamenting the pace of recovery , McCain said , “ I want to assure you it will never happen again in this country .
You have my commitment and my promise . ”
But McCain ’s record on Hurricane Katrina suggests that he was part of the problem , not the solution .
McCain was on Face the Nation on August 28 , 2005 , as Katrina gathered in the Gulf Coast .
He said nothing about it .
One day later , when Katrina made landfall in Louisiana , McCain was on a tarmac at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona , greeting President Bush with a cake in celebration of McCain ’s 69th birthday .
Three days later , with the levees already breached and New Orleans filling with water , McCain ’s office released a three - sentence statement urging Americans to support the victims of the hurricane .
Though McCain issued a statement the next week calling on Congress to make sacrifices in order to fund recovery efforts , he was quoted in The New Leader on September 1 cautioning against over - spending in support of Katrina ’s victims .
“ We also have to be concerned about future generations of Americans , ” he said .
“ We ’re going to end up with the highest deficit , probably , in the history of this country . ”
That attitude was borne out in McCain ’s actions and votes .
Forty Senators and 100 members of Congress visited New Orleans before he did ; he finally got there in March 2006 .
He voted against establishing a Congressional commission to examine the Federal , State , and local responses to Katrina in med-September 2005 .
He repeated that vote in 2006 .
He voted against allowing up to 52 weeks of unemployment benefits to people affected by the hurricane , and in 2006 voted against appropriating $ 109 billion in supplemental emergency funding , including $ 28 billion for hurricane relief .
Shortly after the disaster in New Orleans , McCain did introduce a bill that sought to improve communications mechanisms for first - responders and authorities .
The bill failed to go anywhere , and McCain later voted against other bills that had similar provisions .
McCain may talk sympathetically about New Orleans ’ recovery this week , but the record shows that when it mattered most , McCain failed to act .
His passion for fiscal conservatism blinded him to a city and a region in need , and his Time for Action is simply too late .

Get ready for payback , because if you own a Creative Labs MP3 player made between May 5 , 2001 and April 30 , 2008 , you could be entitled to a class - action settlement over this very issue .
The proposed settlement -- not the first of its kind -- will force Creative to " make certain disclosures regarding the storage capacity of its hard disc drive MP3 players " and give a 50 % discount on a new 1GB player or 20 % off any item purchased at Creative 's online store , if it 's approved by the court .
For its part , Creative denies any wrongdoing , but it looks like it 's offering up the settlement to smooth thing over with consumers -- but you know it 's going to fight the $ 900,000 requested by plaintiffs ' attorneys in fees .
Applications are due by August 7 , 2008 , so start digging up those serial numbers .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Tackling the global obesity epidemic will require governments to take similar action to that many used to curb smoking , a top researcher said on Wednesday .
Two audience members watch the 2007 " Farm Aid " concert in New York September 9 , 2007 .

This could include regulations that restrict how companies market “ junk ” food to children and requirements for schools to serve healthy meals , said Professor Boyd Swinburn , a public health researcher who works with the World Health Organisation .
“ The brakes on the obesity epidemic need to be policy - led and governments need to take centre stage , ” Swinburn , a researcher at Deakin University in Australia , told Reuters at the 2008 European Congress on Obesity .
“ Governments have to lead the way they did with the tobacco epidemic .
We need hard - hitting messages . ”
Action is urgent because , aside from sub-Saharan Africa , nearly every country has suffered a dramatic rise in the number of obese people in the past 30 years .
That increase has likely been a tripling in many industrialized nations , he said .
The World Health Organisation classifies around 400 million people around the world as obese , 20 million of them children under the age of five .
Obesity raises the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart problems , and is a problem that is piling pressure on already overburdened national health systems .
Swinburn says the food industry has largely driven the epidemic with a stream of processed products that are cheaper and better - tasting but filled with unhealthy ingredients .
Lack of physical fitness and exercise , while important , have played only a small role in explaining why the number of obese people has soared in recent decades , he said .
“ Commercial drivers around food have been the biggest influence over the past 30 years , ” he said .
“ The product , the price , the promotion and the placement has changed dramatically .
Swinburn urged governments to introduce policies similar to those taken against smoking .
These have included tightly controlled marketing to children and regulations warning of the dangers of smoking on cigarette packages .
Obesity is persistent despite people being increasingly aware of the risks of being overweight , demonstrating the problem requires direct government intervention , he said .
“ Governments have a number of ways to influence the behaviors of a population , ” Swinburn said .
Among anti-obesity measures taken , New York has banned artery - clogging trans - fats from city restaurants and is forcing fast - food chains to display calorie counts on their menu boards .
Britain plans to spend 75 million pounds ( $ 145 million ) on a campaign encouraging healthy lifestyles as part of a wider anti-obesity strategy including compulsory cooking lessons for children and the promotion of exercise .
With MPs voting today on a new , 42 - day detention limit for terror suspects , Lee Glendinning spoke to a 23 - year - old student about what it is like to be detained under the existing terrorism legislation
" A minute goes like an hour and an hour like a day inside a cell … You lose all concept of day or night .
There are no emotions : you can't cry , you can't laugh …
" Six days felt like six years .
I dread to think what 42 days would feel like : 28 days is harsh enough … the idea of 42 days is phenomenal .
" The ironic thing is , paedophiles , murderers , bank robbers , kidnappers and extortionists are held for four days - 96 hours maximum time .
And terror suspects are on a par with all of those . "
Rizwaan Sabir , 23 , a student at Nottingham University , found himself detained in a segregated and sealed - off prison wing last month , arrested and held under the Terrorism Act after arriving at university and catching up with a friend for coffee .
For six days , he was kept in prison without charge , under 24 - hour surveillance and interrogated daily about his views on al - Qaida and Islamic literature .
It was a subject close to his heart .
Four months earlier , Rizwaan , who was doing his masters in international relations , had clicked on an al - Qaida document online while researching his dissertation , which focused on the difference between various military organisations .
The document was an edited version of the al - Qaida training manual , downloaded from a US government website .
After completing a substantial chunk of the work in January , he sent the document to a colleague , Hisham Yezza , 30 , who worked on campus and had access to a free printer .
On the morning of May 14 , Rizwaan could have had no idea that his next week would be spent in a cell , accused of the commission and preparation of an act of terrorism , the issue of whether he would be charged or not hanging in the balance .
" After the coffee I put my stuff down and walked into the gents .
As soon as I walked in , there were three policemen behind me saying ' Do n't move !
Do n't Move !
Who are you ? '
And I was like , ' I 'm a student .
Who are you ?'
" They said : ' Well , we are police officers looking for someone who matches your description . '''
Shortly afterwards , they arrested him under section 41 of the Terrorism Act for the alleged commission , preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism ; Hisham Yezza had been arrested 10 minutes beforehand .
When Rizwaan reached the police station , the second floor had been entirely sealed off .
It was , he said , like some form of solitary confinement .
" The restricted access made me feel like a real criminal .
It felt like I was in the seventies - the lights were off and there was one table ; all the cells were empty .
I thought , ' What the hell is going on here ? ' "
For the first 48 hours , he was told nothing , but was placed under 24 - hour surveillance .
'' They watched everything you did and wrote it down .
I would read a book and they would write down what I was reading .
They would follow me when I had a shower and stand right there .
You could n't take one step out of the cell without someone following you .
They would stop and do random searches of the cell .
It was so humiliating
" Day six was the hardest .
Knowing your life depends on a decision that someone else takes ... when you have done something with the most clean - hearted intention .
It really is psychological torture . ''
Officers from the West Midlands counter - terrorism branch told him they were searching his car , computer and the family home , making him feel panicked about his family 's reaction .
His mother , father , grandmother and two siblings were at home in the suburbs of Nottingham .
His colleagues on campus were also questioned in relation to the investigation , with the focus on whether he had a girlfriend , whether he drank alcohol and whether he had always worn a beard .
" They were quizzed by police for five hours … they said to my personal tutor that if this had been a young , blond , Swedish PhD student , then this would never have happened .
The investigating officers were making these statements when I was detention . "
At one point , officers began asking him about tents they had found in his car , which he explained belonged to friends who had used them while taking part in a hunger strike .
'' They found the tents and were trying to create an adverse influence .
' Have you been camping ? ' they asked ' Are you planning to go camping ?
Have you been paintballing ?
Are you planning to go paintballing ?'''
On the sixth day , without realising his freedom was imminent , he was told by a female police officer that the document he had looked at was deemed illegitimate for research purposes by the university , and if he ever looked at it again he could face further detention .
He believed he was about to be charged .
He said : " It was breaking … absolutely terrifying , I was sitting there thinking , ' God , am I ever going to get out of here ? ' "
When told he was to be released without charge , he walked into the room to speak with his solicitor .
" I was shaking so violently I fell to the floor .
I went back to the room and just cried and cried …
Somehow , I had managed to get my emotions back . ''
Returning home to his family was traumatic in its own way : the house , he said , no longer felt like the home he knew .
It had been searched , his belongings had been taken , his room felt like it had been rummaged through , and his home felt like it had been broken into .
He still feels a sense of dread when he sees police or hears a siren .
He thinks about the possibility he could have been charged , that he could be waiting right now on remand for a court date .
He finds the idea of returning to study a difficult one - although it is what he wants - and is seeking counselling for an experience he says has scarred him deeply .
Rizwaan 's colleague , Hisham Yezza , was also released without charge after six days , but he is now being held in a detention centre and contesting moves to deport him to Algeria .
Concerned about what he calls the climate of fear the government has created in Britain , which he says has in turn prompted a society of suspicion , Rizwaan feels the UK is becoming a place that does not allow a natural interest and involvement in politicisation .
" Police are paranoid that every Muslim who is young and has a beard and is slightly involved in politics is a national security threat , " he says .
" I was a regular student who was researching a phenomenon we encounter in today 's society . "
Rethinking the desktop metaphor , or even improving it in any significant way , is a daunting task , and few dare to take the risk .
The end result is that the desktop metaphor that we use today barely changed over the years – which is quite unique for the computing industry , as normally , things change very rapidly .
The problem seems to be that any proposed improvements or changes to the graphical user interface are either too evolutionary to be significant , or too radical to be practical .
The key seems to be to strike a balance between offering genuine improvement , but at the same time , be recognisable enough so that ‘ normal ’ users can identify with it effortlessly .
I rarely , if ever , encounter such an improvement – until a few days ago .
Cue Grape .
Everyone uses their desktop differently .
Personally , I tend to use the graphical desktop as I use my normal desktop : as a temporary location for the stuff I ’m currently working on .
In addition , when it ’s Monday , and I need to publish a certain article by Thursday , I dump the corresponding file on my desktop as a sort of reminder .
As soon as I ’m done with a file , it ’s moved away from the desktop – either trashed , or filed away in my OCD - inspired directory structure .
Yann Le Coroller ‘s Grape concept seems to be tailor - made for my kind of usage pattern .
The idea is that any file you drop onto the desktop automatically turns into a preview of that file – images , text documents , videos , and so on .
You can then manipulate these previews by resizing them , moving them around , or flipping them over to edit their metadata and properties – this includes folders .
You can ‘ group ’ these files by dragging a box around it ( a ‘ pile ’ ) ; you can also name the pile , and colourise its ‘ box ’ .
The key is zooming .
When you zoom out of a pile , the previews in the pile will cuddle up together , and your desktop area will expand to reveal more space for more piles .
When you zoom back in , the pile unravels so you can see the individual files .
You can of course make one preview larger than the other if you so desire .
In Grape , you organise your desktop graphically and spatially : the more important a pile or individual file is , the larger and more prominent you make it .
And ca n’t find a file ?
You can click the ‘ find ’ tool , and graphically find the file you need ( using ‘ highlights ’ , as Spotlight does in Mac OS X’ System Preferences application ) .
What makes Grape so appealing is that contrary to many other proposed improvements , it ’s actually not a replacement ; something like Grape can easily be an optional component draped over a traditional desktop , something that you may use – or not , at your own discretion .
Addition , not substitution .
However , seeing the stunningly good looking and elegant conceptual implementation by Yann Le Coroller , I ca n’t imagine anyone not wanting to try this out .
I can confidently say that this is one of the most impressive and elegant GUI concepts I have ever seen .
I hope someone steps up and turns this into a reality – on Mac OS X , all the components to do so appear to be there ( Spotlight , Quick Look , Core Animation , etc. ) .
Four Maps from the Federal Reserve System : Where the Foreclosures Are
May 9 , 2008
The Federal Reserve System has posted some interesting maps .
These , plus two others , appeared on the web page of Ben Bernanke 's May 5 speech calling on Congress to use taxpayer money to bail out renters who took advantage of the low rates produced by Greenspan 's FED .
The FED created the housing bubble .
Now Bernanke wants taxpayers to keep the popped bubble from deflating even more .
The popped bubbles threaten to bankrupt some large commercial banks that put up the money for the bad loans .
You can read his speech here :
For comparison 's sake , where were the mortgage delinquencies concentrated in 2004 ?
This map shows us , county by county .
Here is where they were in the 4th quarter of 2007 .
Where have the changes been the most significant ?
Where have housing prices risen ?

Is knife crime as common as we think ?
Analysis
By Chris Summers
BBC News
A spate of stabbing incidents have dominated the headlines in recent weeks .
But what are the facts behind knife crime and which young people are in greatest danger ?
See the Home Office 's new anti-knife crime poster
Enlarge Image
" Tackling knife culture , especially among young people , is paramount to the safety of our communities , and I am determined to reduce the devastation caused by knife crime , " then Home Secretary Charles Clarke said in the spring of 2006 .
Since then there has been a knife amnesty , numerous government initiatives and photo opportunities , with ministers slamming home the same message - that knives will not be tolerated .
But still the deaths caused by knives go on .
The real picture According to the British Crime Survey ( BCS ) , overall violent crime has decreased by 41 % since a peak in 1995 .
The average age of homicide victims overall has been going down , with younger and younger victims
Richard Garside Knives are used in about 8 % of violent incidents , according to the BCS , a level that has largely remained the same during the past decade .
But the BCS figures do not include under - 16s , something which the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced this month would change .
Criminologist Kevin Stenson , from Middlesex University 's Crime and Conflict Research Centre , said the politicians needed to do more to address the problems of those aged under 16 and added : " They are the people who fear being attacked with knives , they carry them because they are scared and for respect .
It is about macho status . "
But Ife Igunnubole , a youth worker in Hackney , London , said knives and guns brought a sense of power to youths who felt powerlessness .
He said : " There is a level of desperation on the streets , brought about by poverty , which is creating a culture of fear . "
Mr Igunnubole , who runs mentoring and leadership projects , said tougher sentences and stop - and - search powers were all very well in the short term , but ultimately they were " just scratching the surface " and in the long term there was a need to address issues of poverty and materialism .
' Poorer most at risk ' Richard Garside , the director of the Centre of Crime and Justice Studies at Kings College London , said : " If you look at the figures for the last 10 years the number of knife victims has remained relatively stable - although there have been spikes - at 200 to 220 a year .
" But there is some evidence the demographic has changed .
The average age of homicide victims overall has been going down , with younger and younger victims . "
The falling age of victims is something that has been found with both knife and gun crime .
People give all sorts of reasons why they carry knives , including protecting themselves .
But a knife is not a weapon of defence , it 's a weapon of offence
Karyn McCluskey
Strathclyde Police Mr Garside said : " Those living in poorer parts of town are inevitably most at risk .
For many years the murder capital for knife crime has been Glasgow , but now we are seeing it as a major problem in Manchester and London and other cities . "
One Scottish police officer told BBC News : " If you think you 've got it bad down in London , you should take a look at Glasgow . "
Scotland , and Glasgow in particular , has some frightening statistics when it comes to knife crime .
Last year there were 73 murders in the Strathclyde Police force area , 40 of which involved knives Knife crime levels in Scotland are 3.5 times higher than in England or Wales Scotland has a homicide rate of 5.3 per 100,000 in the 10 - to - 29 age group , which compares with one per 100,000 in England and Wales Scott Breslin was paralysed from the neck down in a Glasgow knife attack Karyn McCluskey , head of Strathclyde 's Violence Reduction Unit , said knife crime was endemic and dated back to the " razor gangs " of the 1920s .
She said : " People give all sorts of reasons why they carry knives , including protecting themselves .
But a knife is not a weapon of defence , it 's a weapon of offence . "
Ms McCluskey said : " Much of it is to do with bravado .
Machismo is a huge issue up here and the lack of role models too .
We often get knives being used by grandfathers , fathers and sons .
" Part of the problem is that they do n't have the skills to walk away .
If they 're in a taxi queue and it 's raining and they 've been drinking , if someone looks at them in a funny way there will be a fight .
It 's as simple as that . "
She said some offenders mistakenly thought they could stab a rival in the buttocks without harm , but she added : " You can bleed to death if you hit a femoral artery .
There is no safe place to stab anybody . "
Tougher sentences
In the past few years politicians both north and south of the border have steadily increased the penalty for carrying knives , but Richard Garside said there was no evidence tougher sentences act as a deterrent .
Beatriz Martins - Paes ( left ) is serving life for stabbing Charlotte Polius " Many of these youths say they are carrying a knife for their own protection , but if they are calculating to commit a serious offence they will not think about the prospect of getting caught , " he said .
No doubt 18 - year - old Beatriz Martins - Paes was not thinking about tough sentences when she went out one night in April 2005 armed with a 4in ( 12 cm ) kitchen knife .
She is now two years into a life sentence .
The teenager plunged the knife into the chest of 15 - year - old Charlotte Polius at a party in Ilford , east London , after over - reacting to a perceived slight .
It is a shame courts are not televised , because the evidence of a Home Office pathologist would have been extremely educational viewing in schools .
Charlotte 's mother wept quietly as Dr Vesna Djurovic described how the blade entered the heart and cut through two major blood vessels , causing huge blood loss .
When asked if the teenager could have been saved by paramedics , she said : " No , I do n't think she had any chance of survival . "
But perhaps even more powerful for a class full of inner-city and streetwise youngsters would have been to witness Martins - Paes when she gave evidence .
Girls pay their respects to Rob Knox in Sidcup , Kent " I can not explain it .
It was all unreal .
I did not believe it happened .
It was just , like , shocking , " she said .
The weapon she used was a simple kitchen knife and the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police , Sir Ian Blair , said on Tuesday : " The knives we are seeing are not nearly as often home - made constructed weapons , as weapons you would take from the kitchen drawer .
" Parents have a duty now to be asking their teenagers : ' Are you involved in this knife carrying ? ' "
It may be that the recent spate of knife deaths is simply a spike on a graph - a statistical quirk - but there is no doubt the carrying of knives and guns has not gone out of fashion .
Whether this home secretary , or this government , can turn the tide remains to be seen .
Chris.

The value of Pi is not as 3.14159265 …ish as many of us would like to believe .
Legislators in Indiana once declared Pi as 3.2 , 4 , and 3.23 .

The whole thing is a mess : everyone just has to have their very own Pi .
Maciek came across yet another value for Pi while a browsing the Java Swing documentation .

Russia has warned Georgia it could take " retaliatory measures " Nato has warned Russia that its recent troop build - up in Georgia 's two breakaway regions undermines its neighbour 's territorial integrity .
Russia 's moves in Abkhazia and South Ossetia were raising tensions in the area , a Nato spokesman said .
Moscow has accused Georgia of preparing to invade Abkhazia , and says it is also boosting Russian peacekeeping forces there and in South Ossetia .
Tbilisi has described the Russian move as " irresponsible " .
" The steps that have been taken [ by Russia ] and the rhetoric have increased tensions and undermined Georgia 's territorial integrity , " Nato spokesman James Appathurai said .
He also urged both Moscow and Tbilisi to avoid harsh rhetoric .
US National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe on Wednesday said Washington was " concerned abut reports from the region " .
The European Union has appealed for caution , saying to increase troop numbers would be unwise given current tensions .
Over recent weeks Russia appears to have been significantly turning up the pressure in Abkhazia and South Ossetia , the BBC 's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says .
He says that many Western diplomats see these moves as part of a more assertive Russian policy in the wake of Western recognition of the independence of Kosovo in February .
The row over Moscow 's support for separatist enclaves in Georgia now threatens to provoke a more serious strain between Russia and the West , our correspondent adds .
' Aggressors ' Earlier this week , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that Moscow would take " retaliatory measures " if Georgia used force against its breakaway regions .
Georgia wants Russia to withdraw its troops from its two regions Russia said Georgia was massing 1,500 soldiers and police in the upper Kodori Gorge , the only part of Abkhazia which remains under government control .
In response , Moscow said it was increasing Russian peacekeepers in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Mr Lavrov said that Russia had to protect Russian - passport holders in the two regions .
Georgia denies any build - up of its own forces in the area , and says that Russia is taking provocative action .
" We think that this step , if they take it , will cause extreme destabilisation in the region , " said Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze .
" From now on , we consider every [ Russian ] soldier or any unit of military equipment coming in [ to Abkhazia and South Ossetia ] as illegal , potential aggressors and potential generators of destabilisation . "
Kosovo precedent Russia has kept a peacekeeping force in Abkhazia and South Ossetia under an agreement made following the wars of the 1990s , when the regions broke away from Tbilisi and formed links with Moscow .
There are around 2,000 Russians posted in Abkhazia , and about 1,000 in South Ossetia .
Tensions between Russia and Georgia have flared up recently , despite Russia lifting economic sanctions against Georgia earlier this month .
Last week , Georgia accused a Russian plane of shooting down an unmanned Georgian spy plane - which Russian authorities insisted was shot down by Abkhaz rebels .
And on Tuesday , Georgia said it was blocking Russia 's entry to the World Trade Organization .
Many in Abkhazia believe that Kosovo 's announcement of independence from Serbia in February provides a precedent for it to be recognised as an individual state .
Although it has its own flag and postage stamps , it is not internationally recognised .

The Antennae Galaxies are among the closest known merging galaxies .
The two galaxies , also known as NGC 4038 and NGC 4039 , started to interact a few hundred million years ago , creating one of the most impressive sights in the night sky .
They are considered by scientists as the archetypal merging galaxy system and are used as a standard with which to validate theories about galaxy evolution .
The ground - based image ( left ) is taken by Robert Gendler and shows the two merging galaxies and their impressive long tidal tails .
The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys image ( right ) shows a portion of the southern tidal tail .
The main visible component consists of young blue stars recently formed out of the gas accumulating along the spine of the tail , and many red background galaxies can also be seen .
The region is also filled by thousands of faint red stars , just visible when zooming on the image .
By measuring the colors and brightnesses of red giant stars in the system , the scientists found that the Antennae Galaxies are much closer than previously thought : 45 million light - years instead of the previous best estimate of 65 million light - years .
These red stars cannot be brighter than a certain threshold , and it is this luminosity threshold that was used to derive the new distance of the Antennae .

The Antennae Galaxies are among the closest known merging galaxies .
The two galaxies , also known as NGC 4038 and NGC 4039 , began interacting a few hundred million years ago , creating one of the most impressive sights in the night sky .
They are considered by scientists as the archetypal merging galaxy system and are used as a standard against which to validate theories about galaxy evolution .
An international group of scientists led by Ivo Saviane from the European Southern Observatory has used Hubble ’s Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 to observe individual stars spawned by the colossal cosmic collision in the Antennae Galaxies .
They reached an interesting and surprising conclusion .
By measuring the colours and brightnesses of red giant stars in the system , the scientists found that the Antennae Galaxies are much closer than previously thought : 45 million light - years instead of the previous best estimate of 65 million light - years .
The team targeted a region in the relatively quiescent outer regions in the southern tidal tail , away from the active central regions .
This tail consists of material thrown from the main galaxies as they collided .
The scientists needed to observe regions with older red giant stars to derive an accurate distance .
Red giants are known to reach a standard brightness , which can then be used to infer their distance .
The method is known as the tip of the red giant branch ( TRGB ) .
The proximity of the Antennae system means it is the best - studied galaxy merger in the sky , with a wealth of observational data to be compared to the predictions of theoretical models .
Saviane says : “ All aspiring models for galaxy evolution must be able to account for the observed features of the Antennae Galaxies , just as respectable stellar models must be able to match the observed properties of the Sun .
Accurate models require the correct merger parameters , and of these , the distance is the most essential ” .
The previous canonical distance to the Antennae Galaxy was about 65 million light - years although values as high as 100 million light years have been used .
Our Sun is only eight light - minutes away from us , so the Antennae Galaxies may seem rather distant , but if we consider that we already know of galaxies that are more than ten billion light - years away , the two Antennae Galaxies are really our neighbours .
The previous larger distance required astronomers to invoke some quite exceptional physical characteristics to account for the spectacular system : very high star - formation rates , supermassive star clusters , ultraluminous X - ray sources etc .
The new smaller distance makes the Antennae Galaxies less extreme in terms of the physics needed to explain the observed phenomena .
For instance , with the smaller distance its infrared radiation is now that expected of a “ standard ” early merging event rather than that of an ultraluminous infrared galaxy .
The size of the star clusters formed as a consequence of the Antennae merger now agree with those of clusters created in other mergers instead of being 1.5 times as large .
The Antennae Galaxies are named for the two long tails of stars , gas and dust that resemble the antennae of an insect .
These “ antennae ” are a physical result of the collision between the two galaxies .
Studying their properties gives us a preview of what may happen when our Milky Way galaxy collides with the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy in several billion years .
Although galaxy mergers today are not common , it is believed that in the past they were an important channel of galaxy evolution .
Therefore understanding the physics of galaxy mergers is a very important task for astrophysicists .
The Antennae are located in the constellation of Corvus , the Crow .

Self - injury makes some people feel part of a group .
Teenagers who self - injure often report that there is no adult they could talk to who accepts them for who they are .
“ A 13 - year - old can go on the Internet and instantly find community and get hitched to this behavior , ” Dr. Whitlock said .
“ When they do n’t want to self - injure anymore , it means they have to leave a community . ”
Self - injury can be manipulative , an effort to make others care or feel guilty or to drive them away .
More often , though , it is secretive .
Self - injurers may try to hide wounds under long pants and long sleeves even in hot weather , and may avoid activities like swimming .
Who Is Vulnerable ?
Self - injury often starts in the emotional turmoil of the preteen and early teenage years and may persist well into adulthood .
Although female self - injurers are more likely to be seen by a professional , in - depth studies indicate that the behavior is practiced equally by young men and women .
No racial or socioeconomic group has been found to be more vulnerable , although self - injury is slightly less common among Asians and Asian - Americans , Dr. Whitlock said .
Interviews with self - injurers have found background factors that may prompt and perpetuate the behavior .
A history of childhood sexual , and especially emotional , abuse has been reported by half or more of self - injurers .
Some seek relief from the resulting emotional pain .
Others self - inflict pain to punish themselves for what they perceive as their role in inviting the abuse .
Low self - esteem is common among self - injurers .
Childhood neglect , social isolation and unstable living conditions have also been cited as risk factors .
In about 25 percent of self - injurers , there is a history of eating disorders , as well as an overlap with risky drinking and unsafe sex .

The $ 30 homemade air conditioner we posted over a year ago got an upgrade !
You may recall that this neat contraption used a bucket of ice water and gravity to make cold water flow through a coil of pipe attached to the back of a fan , which made it blow cold air .

Being a big fish in a small pond is more likely to get you noticed .
That ’s good news if you ’re , say , the best pitcher in your little league division .
But it ’s not so good if you ’re an actual fish .
Because bigger fish are the ones that tend to get caught .
Not only is that bad news for the fish , but it may be bad for the whole fish population .
Or so say scientists from Australia and Canada in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
They find that fishing for the largest individuals targets the fastest growers , leaving behind their slower - growing counterparts .
Which means that current fishing practices may favor the evolution of slower - growing fish .
The scientists stocked two small lakes in British Columbia with two strains of rainbow trout : one that grows quickly and is more aggressive in chasing down food and another that grows slowly and tends to be more cautious .
They then used commercial gillnets to fish the lakes and found that they bagged the bolder fish three times faster than the shy ones , which were left behind to multiply .
So we could inadvertently be breeding fearful small fry that are nearly impossible to catch .
Which would make them … hard - to - see food .

PvP System Erweiterung
Dieses Update aktiviert die PvP Ränge .
Es ist nun möglich PvP - Stufen aufzusteigen , indem man die schon existierenden Möglichkeiten für PvP im Spiel ausübt , sei es offenes PvP , Belagerungsschlachten oder das Niederstrecken der Feinde in den PvP - Minispielen .
Insgesamt gibt es zehn Stufen im PvP , die man aufsteigen kann , um seinen Wert auf dem Schlachtfeld unter Beweis zu stellen .
Die PvP Statistiken sind nun auch im Charaktermenu einsehbar und ermöglichen eine Übersicht über die Fortschritte und Erfolge im PvP .
Zusätzlich erhalten die PvP Rüstungswerte , jetzt wo das System aktiviert wurde , nun einen Sinn .
Diese gewähren eine weitere Reduzierung des Schadens , den andere Spieler einem zufügen können .
Die neuen PvP Rüstungen werden die Hauptquelle für die Erhöhung dieser Werte sein , auch wenn wir uns schon Gedanken darüber machen , wie wir in Zukunft die defensiven PvP Werte veränderbar machen können .
Alle PvP - Gegenstände , die mit diesem Update eingeführt werden , sind als Belohnung für Spieler von Stufe eins bis fünf im PvP Stufensystem gedacht .
Dieses Update ist nur der Beginn der geplanten PvP Erweiterungen .
Als nächstes wird das PvP Konsequenzsystem ( Verbrechersystem ) kommen und weitere PvP - Gegenstände werden dem Spiel in Form von Belohnungen für die PvP - Stufen sechs bis zehn hinzugefügt .
Neue Quests
Mit diesem
Update werden dreizehn neue Quests im Eiglophianischen Gebirge eingeführt und gliedern sich nahtlos in die schon bestehende Geschichte dieses Stufe 50 - 60 Spielfelds ein , indem man unglaublichen Willen , körperliche Stärke und großen
Mut benötigt um zu überleben .
Zusätzlich wurden 40 weitere Quests verändert und verbessert .
Ein paar davon bieten nun auch ein interessanteres Ende als zuvor .
Klassenveränderungen
Mit diesem Update fahren wir fort mit der Anpassung und verändern Zaubersprüche , Talente , Kombos usw .
für alle zwölf Klassen und vier Archetypen .
Die insgesamt fast 80 Änderungen für alle Klassen beinhalten Anpassungen am Verhalten der Vertrauen / Begleiter und Verbesserungen der Kampfaktionen und Bewegungen .
All diese Veränderungen tragen zu einer besseren Gewichtung der Klassen bei .
Wir werden natürlich auch weiterhin die verschiedenen Aspekte der Klassen in zukünftigen Updates verändern und verbessern .
Edelsteinsveränderungen
Viele der Boni , die man durch Edelsteine erhielt , wurden angepasst , sodass alle Unverwundbarkeits , Ausweichen , Finishing - Move , Linkhand und Schadensboni , um einen größeren Wert verringert wurden .
Wir werden damit fortfahren das Edelsteinsystem in zukünftigen Updates anzupassen , um sicherzustellen , dass die gedachte Art und Weise der Charakterverbesserung erreicht wird , die die ursprüngliche Version des Systems nicht ganz bereitstellte .
Dieses Gebiet wird in den kommenden Wochen und Monaten mit sehr viel Aufmerksamkeit bedacht werden .
Außerdem wurden weitere Handwerksfähigkeiten verbessert .
Es wurde die Häufigkeit von verschiedenen Ressourcen , sowie die Nützlichkeit der Rezepte angepasst .
Der Hauptfokus dieses Updates liegt in der Einführung der PvP System Erweiterung , die neue Motivation und Sinn ins PvP bringt , sowie in der Bereitstellung der ersten Sets der PvP Rüstung .
Desweiteren wurden im Eiglophianischen
Gebirge weitere neue Quests für hochstufige Charakter hinzugefügt und viele Änderungen , basierend auf Spielerrückmeldungen , an den verschiedenen Funktionen des Spiels vorgenommen .
Das Update beinhaltet viele weitere Änderungen in unterschiedlichen Gebieten .

Die vollständige Liste der Änderungen in diesem Update findet ihr im Forum .
Wir hoffen euch gefällt dieses Update .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Oil prices at a record high above $ 135 a barrel are rising due to market sentiment rather than a shortage of supply , Royal Dutch Shell ’s chief executive said on Thursday .
U.S. crude oil hit an all - time peak on Thursday , climbing to $ 135.09 , lifted by concern about long - term supply and a host of predictions of further rises from influential investment banks and investors .
“ What we say and what we see is there are no physical shortages , ” Shell ’s Jeroen van der Veer told Reuters television .
He runs the world ’s second - largest fully publicly traded oil firm by market value .
“ There are no tankers waiting in the Middle East , there are no cars waiting at gasoline stations because they are out of stock .
This has to do with psychology in the markets and you cannot forecast psychology ” .
His view that there are no shortages chimes with that of other oil producers , such as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries .
Others , such as the U.S. government , say supply is tight .
While rising prices are boosting profit for the industry , the Shell CEO agreed that high oil costs were a mixed blessing .
“ For many consumers in the world , this really starts to hit them .
Secondly , we see that you get a kind of public outcry .
“ At the same time , the only thing that we can do is use the profits we make to invest for additional supplies . ”
Shell has the largest capital spending programme among its main rivals in 2008 , having spent $ 7.6 billion ( 3.8 billion pounds ) in the first three months of the year alone .
It was also alone among its peers in boosting output .
Oil ’s climb has led to rising costs in the oil industry for services such as drilling rigs and companies are increasing the long - run price assumptions they use for planning their business .
Van der Veer , asked if Shell needed a price around $ 80 a barrel to break even , declined to give a specific figure but said it had grown more costly to bring on new supply .
“ When oil prices went up , you see that the cost for new projects for the whole industry , not only for Shell , became a lot more expensive , ” he said .
“ In our industry we see quite severe inflation .
We do n’t know if that will plateau out or go up further . ”

Dr Joseph Vacanti
They believe the breakthrough could eventually lead to a biological tooth substitute to replace human teeth .
The researchers made a suspension of individual cells from a young tooth reorganise into a tooth crown containing both enamel and dentin .
Dr Pamela Yelick told BBC News
Online that it might be possible one day to grow human teeth of a particular size and shape .
She predicted that within five years , we would know whether dental stem cells could be manipulated to bioengineer teeth .
To generate a human tooth might take an additional five to 10 years .
Pigs to rats
Writing in the Journal of Dental Research , the researchers describe how they used enzymes to isolate immature tooth cells from six - month - old pigs .
They then seeded cells obtained from the immature teeth of the animals on to sponge - like biodegradable polymer scaffolds and placed them inside rats to develop .
Within 30 weeks , they report , small , recognisable tooth crowns had formed , containing all the materials found in normal teeth .
That is , dentin ( a bone - like layer ) ; odontoblasts ( cells that secrete dentin ) ; a well - defined pulp chamber ; cementoblasts ( cells that cover the roots of the tooth ) ; and enamel .
The researchers say their work is the first successful production of mature tooth crowns containing both dentin and enamel .
Other experts have used alternative approaches to form partial tooth structures , including dentin and pulp , but none have so far grown complete structures that include enamel .
Dental repair
Dr Joseph Vacanti , director of the Laboratory for Tissue Engineering and Organ Fabrication at Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , US , and a co-researcher on the project said : " It points the way for biologic repair in dental disease , using the new tools of tissue engineering . "
Of great importance , say the scientists , is the discovery that dental stem cells appear to exist in pig molar tissues .
" It suggests the existence of stem cells that could be important in many areas of dental repair , " said Dr Vacanti .
" By combining the new science of stem cell biology with the engineering concepts and techniques of tissue engineering , it demonstrates that complex structures such as living teeth can be created .
Dr Dominick DePaola , of the Forsyth Institute , where the work was carried out , added : " The ability to identify , isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionise dentistry . "
And Dr Bruce Donoff , of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine Center for Craniofacial Tissue Engineering , said : " The potential of this advance is enormous and could have a far - reaching impact on patient care . "
Natural replacement
Currently used synthetic tooth implants often provide effective replacements , though they do not wear as well as natural teeth .
Moreover , as a person 's bite changes with age , such implants do not move naturally in the jaw .
Ideally , biological teeth would have all the same properties of an individual 's natural teeth .
They would be the same size and shape , and would fit just as well as the originals .

Google I/O
Once upon a time , there was an open source project called Subversion , and it needed a new date parser .
One day , a coder came along and wrote one .
But he insisted on tagging the source code with his John Hancock .
And that was against the rules .
Subversion 's founders said that name tags would undermine collaboration .
When the founders asked the coder to remove his name , he refused , threatening to leave the project and take his date parser with him .
It was a good date parser - just want the project needed - but the founders stood their ground .
So , the coder left with his parser and never submitted another patch .
But six weeks later , a second coder came along .
" Hey , " he said , " I can write a date parser . "
Two of Subversion 's founding developers - Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins - Sussman - believe in open source projects that maintain a large " bus factor . "
That would be the number of people who could get run over by a bus before the project collapses .
A simple means of maintaining a large bus factor , they say , is banning names from source code .
" You have to discourage people from feeling like ' This is my module .
I wrote this .
Every change has to be approved by me , ' " Collins - Sussman argues .
" That 's very dangerous for the project as a whole . "
This may mean the loss of some valuable contributors - and some valuable code .
But in the end , the project comes out ahead .
There will always be more contributors .
And more code .
" You ca n't sacrifice the long - term health of a project for short - term gain . "
That 's just one lesson from Fitzpatrick and Collins - Sussman , two long - time open source gurus now plying their trade at Google .
The pair turned up yesterday at the Google I/O developer conference in San Francisco , delivering a talk they like to call " How Open Source Projects Survive Poisonous People . "
A poisonous person would be anyone who puts a drag on collaborative coding , from cruel souls who enjoy tossing a wrench into the works to social misfits who screw things up simply by being themselves .
" You have to guard against anyone who distracts you , who drains you , " Collins - Sussman said .
" Sometimes , these are trolls .
But sometimes they 're valued community members , the nicest people in the world who also happen to be perfectionists or obsessive compulsives - people who bog you down with endless discussion . "
The success of an open source project depends on " attention and focus " , the two Googlers explained , and those assets must be protected at all costs .
" If you had a group of people who are all contributing to a pile of money and someone came along and started taking money from the pile , you 'd be annoyed .
You might even call the police , " Fitzpatrick said .
" Attention and focus are the currency of an open source project . "
That may sound like commonsense .
But Brian " Call me Fitz " Fitzpatrick and Ben " Call me Collins - Sussman " Collins - Sussman laid down more than a few practical tips for making sure those poisonous people are n't so poisonous .
Rule Number One :
When you launch a project , carefully define your mission - and post that mission to a conspicuous web page .
" If it 's on a website , it 's official , " Collins - Sussman said .
This drew a hearty laugh from dozens of the developers on hand for the talk .
But Fitz was quick point out that this was a joke with more than a little truth to it : " If you say something over email , people will debate it for weeks .
If you take the time to put it on a web page , suddenly people take it seriously . "
Subversion 's mission statement : " To create a compelling replacement for CVS , " a common version control system for open source projects .
Thanks to this single sentence , Collins - Sussman argued , the project generally attracted the sort of contributors it wanted to attract .
The pair also advocates keeping discussion to a healthy minimum .
This involves maintaining a complete email archive and extensive documentation of a project 's history , including all designs decisions , code changes , big fixes , and mistakes .
If you do that , they said , you prevent people from rehashing old debates .
" If you do n't document your project 's history , you will be condemned to repeat it , over and over and over ... "
But even when you 're discussing things that have n't been discussed before , the pair went on , you have to know when to shut things up .
" We once had a guy who would n't stop talking about a particular feature .
He went on and on and on , and we could n't decide what to do , " Fitz recalled .
" So , finally , we just told him ' Let 's move on and write code . '
That did the trick .
He said ' OK . ' "
The culture of open source projects , they said , should be self - selecting .
In other words , stick to your guns .
If people do n't like it , they 'll leave .
Or , at least , most of them will leave .
There will always be those who hang around just to cause trouble .
When this happens , the Googlers said , you must n't be afraid to " flip the bozo bit " - i.e. boot them from the project .
That goes for project founders .
And geniuses .
Subversion once booted a well - known " genius " after his constant criticism threatened to bring the project down .
Collins - Sussman called it the project 's " key decision " .
Genius is n't as important as community collaboration , he said , and nowadays , code geniuses are a dime a dozen .
Bootnote
Last year , Fitz and Collins - Sussman gave a similar talk at Google 's Mountain View headquarters .
You 'll find a video here and slides here . ®
Student ’s No Longer Crossing Raging River on a Cable
Not too long ago , we did an article about some Chinese school kids who had to cross a raging river on a steel cable everyday to get to their school .
We got a lot of visibility for that article and after the story was broke , people began to make donations to help the village build a real bridge .
Six months later , a 170 x 2 meter bridge now exists across the Nujiang River , near where the kids used to cross by cable .
Looks like the school children can finally go to school without risking their lives or getting stuck for hours in the middle of that old steel cable .

本連載では、様々なユーザーの立場から見たFirefox 3というものについて、開発に関わったMozilla Japanの中野雅之氏、浅井智也氏にお話を伺っている。
今回はエンタープライズ分野からの視点、そしてデザイナーからの視点で、Firefox 3というものを見つめてみる。

1 エンタープライズで使える基盤はできている
Webアプリケーションが広く利用されるようになった今、その窓口であるウェブブラウザはエンタープライズの分野とは切っても切れない関係にあると言える。そこで、エンタープライズ分野に対するFirefoxの立場について聞いてみた。
中野氏は 、 「 Firefoxが特にエンタープライズを強く意識しているというわけではないが、技術的な基盤はすでにあるのではないか」と語っている。
すなわち、これまで紹介してきたWebアプリケーションをサポートする機能やデザインをサポートする機能が、エンタープライズアプリケーションにおいても威力を発揮できるレベルにあるということだ。
ただし 、Firefoxを用いた業務アプリケーションのための専用の開発環境というようなものは無い。オフライン機能など、今後はブラウザ側に依存する部分も多く出てくると思われるため、バックエンドのシステムと連携してシームレスにテストやデバッグができるようなツールはぜひとも欲しいものである。
Mozillaとしてそのような専用ツールをリリースする予定は今のところ無いそうだが、デバッグ環境やテスト環境を整えるための拡張などについては、その開発をサポートする姿勢だとのこと。
一例として、ウェブページ のCSSやHTML、JavaScriptをテスト/デバッグするための拡張として「Firebug」が挙げられた。この拡張についてはMozillaでも開発への参加や情報の提供などといったサポートを行っているという。
「 Firefoxのメリットのひとつは拡張性なので、拡張というかたちで様々なツールが出てくれば、開発環境としても進化していけるのではないでしょうか。それに加えてFirefoxはオープンスタンダード準拠なので、Firefoxで正しく処理できていれば他のブラウザにも対応することは容易なはずです。そういったメリットを感じてもらえればいいと思います」（浅井氏）

Finally living up to its name , Netflix today introduced the Netflix Player by Roku , a small piece of hardware that can play any Netflix titles available for Internet streaming .
With a cheap price and Netflix 's signature subscription model , the Netflix Player brings a new set of rules to the video distribution table .
Manufactured by Silicon Valley startup Roku , the Netflix Player is about the size of a Mac mini and a bit thicker than an Apple TV .
The unit impressively includes a full gamut of outputs , including HDMI , component video , S - video , optical audio , and even good ol ' fashioned composite RCA jacks .
Netflix does n't want to leave any viewers in the dust just because they have n't sprung for the latest and greatest .
The Netflix Player can get online via Ethernet or Wi -Fi 802.11 b/g , and setup reportedly requires not much more than entering a five - digit code the player gives you into your Netflix account .
After that , the movies and TV shows you 've queued from Netflix 's catalog of 10,000 - plus " Watch Instantly " streaming titles appear on your TV , waiting for a command from Roku 's notably simple remote .
You can browse the rest of the streaming catalog right on your TV and select another title to begin streaming instantly , and titles can also be rated while you browse .
The cost ?
This is where things get interesting .
Roku 's Netflix Player is a one - time purchase of $ 99 ( and available now ) .
As long as you subscribe to any Netflix plan costing $ 8.99 or more , you 're ready to stream as much content as you want .
Netflix says you can pause and rewind streaming titles , but considering that the player has no hard drive , we 'll reserve judgement until we can get a unit for review .
One particular setback of the Netflix Player , however , is that the company 's streaming catalog is n't very appealing if you crave new releases .
As CNET points out , just two of Netflix 's top 100 DVD rentals are available for streaming : March of the Penguins and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , and those are n't even really " new releases " anymore .
Still , the Netflix Player heralds the brave new on - demand future we foresaw back when we took an in - depth look at the state of video distribution .
This simple device significantly lowers the barrier to entry when considered against similar offerings like Apple TV ( which starts at $ 229 ) , and Xbox 360 ( ~$ 300 ) , a comparison we investigated back in March .
New releases aside , Netflix is the first to bring a subscription model and an all - you - can - eat ticket to a video buffet of streaming video for the living room with ( what sounds like ) a dead - simple device .
While the Netflix Player only does SD for now , it 's ready for HD streaming which the company says is coming " soon . "
This could be a big deal for both Netflix and the industry .
Netflix can look forward to eventually saving a healthy chunk of change on shipping costs , even with customers who see no reason to upgrade from the $ 8.99 plan .
Revenue sharing could also be on the table , as Netflix may be getting a cut of each Roku device .
For the rest of the industry , the Netflix Player and its streaming subscription model is an entirely new headache for traditional rental outlets like Blockbuster , and perhaps even DVD retailers everywhere .
It 's also something that the iTunes Store and Zune Marketplace 's new video section will need to deal with .
Steve Jobs may have been right when he said consumers do n't want to rent music ( exhibited by plenty of lackluster subscription music stores ) , but video is an entirely different situation .
A lucrative portion of consumers are happy to rent — not own — their movies and TV shows , and the Netflix Player could very well score an early win for Netflix in the living room 's digital distribution market .
I have a story coming in The Times overnight that focuses on a new study forecasting some Northern Hemisphere cooling in the coming decade , even as the planet continues to warm in the long haul from the accelerating buildup of human - generated greenhouse gases .
The researchers , writing in the journal Nature , stress that this is a preliminary attempt to shift climate models toward becoming a forecasting tool , mainly by tweaking them with real - world data ( in this case ocean temperatures ) as they churn through their simulations .
They forecast a plateau in warming and some possible cooling over North America and Europe in the coming decade , probably driven by shifts in ocean circulation in the North Atlantic and other ocean cycles that can affect climate .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory of NASA recently reported that the Pacific Ocean appears to be reverting to a cool phase , as well .
Whether their prediction of a plateau for warming for a decade in North America and Europe is correct or not , their research may signal a shift that many climate researchers have been calling for for awhile now — toward service - oriented climate science ( even as work continues to clarify how much warming will happen , how fast , from the greenhouse buildup ) .

You could create a political party with this system .
But that 's it .
Good luck ever standing a chance in any election .
You do realize that only young 20 - somethings use social media politically at the moment ?
You would not get a single vote from old people , who vote in mass droves .
I suggest you try implementing your approach to the parties that already exist in your electoral region .
I think as a consultative guide , online democracy could work .
But never as the ultimate policy decider of a party .
Also , all parties have a policy process similar to that of create debate .
They have people offer up ideas , there is a period to speak in favour or against ideas , and then , democratically , party members vote on policy .
It 's basically the same format as create debate , only that it happens in real life and is filled with old people .

The whole point of a political party in our system is to bring together those who support specific views / policies that are the most important to them .

I am a bit confused by the titles that were chosen for the two choices .
However as the debate went on a bit I figured out what was really being asked , or at least I think I have .
I think that a political party would benefit greatly from having this sort of tool , and actively utilizing it .
It would be a great way of solidifying platforms and maintaining a unified front .
Because even within a party there are fairly significant disagreements on how an issue should be solved or even to what extent a topic should be addressed by government .
It 'd give candidates a better feel for what the voters are looking for , rather than the other way around .
After all elected officials are expected to serve the constituent 's agenda , not their own .

No . A political party is a group of like minded voters and politicians .
A party does n't succeed unless it has unity in ideology and approach .
Create debate is the opposite of that .
If you meant to ask if a electoral system like CreateDebate would work , than I 'd say no .
It would just be a big non secret ballot .

No , I definately meant what I said .
The traditional idea of a political party is exactly what you said , but does it always have to be that ?
Would people be more interested supporting a party that it knew would go ahead with policies that the majority wanted , rather than having to make up their mind about which party best matched their mindset ( and , as with anyone , this means matching some of your ideas and opposing others -
No one I know is completely like - minded to the party they support ) ?

Then you are bastardizing the concept of a political party .
By definition , if a party is filled with people constantly disagreeing , rebutting , and campaigning against each other , then they are not a " party " .
People will already coalesce into parties based on what they already believe , and will be able to debate their views with people of opposing parties .
If they are persuaded they can always switch .
Within parties too , opinions can differ ( but always only slightly ) .
These issues are sorted our by nominating party leaders , which can and usually is majority rule .

" By definition , if a party is filled with people constantly disagreeing , rebutting , and campaigning against each other , then they are not a " party " . "
From what I hear on the news over here in the UK , that would be the Democrats .
Haha .
But no , I do understand what you 're saying .
I think you 're looking at this from an extreme angle though , in that the debates would centre around completely differing views .
This is certainly not always the case ( especially in UK politics ) .
The way I see it working is that it would simply give a centralised forum for people to discuss and debate potential policy , with the general consensus being the chosen policy .
Obviously , I can see the eventuality of this being that a certain type of politics would emerge from within that certain party :
For example , on - line republicans and on - line democrats , as it were .
At this point we could be left with the same sort of political system that we have no , but with the added functionality of allowing the people to still remain in control of what that party chooses to persue as policy .
A great example of this is in regards to the Iraq war .
The majority of people in the Uk did not want to go to war , and I am convinced that if a system like this was put in place , war would have been avoided ( regardless of whether the " party " wanted it or not ) .
I know it 's a bit of a wacky and out - there idea , but I think it is close minded to disregard it simply because it is n't the way that things are currently done .
Maybe we 've got it wrong at the moment ?
Who knows ?

" I think you 're looking at this from an extreme angle though , in that the debates would centre around completely differing views . "
If it 's going to be similar to CreateDebate it will have to .
You seem to be distancing yourself from your original proposition to give the idea more leverage .
And the rest of what you posted was either irrelevant to CreateDebate , what you were replying to , or what your original idea was .
In terms of the Iraq War , you 're right about representatives not accurately representing their constituency .
A CreateDebate type party would not solve this though ( at any given time a party may be misrepresenting 49.9 % of it 's constituency too ) .
For the party to be elected they would have had to came to a majority rule decision my then .
So , if anyone descents from the decision to go to war , they are staying in a party they disagree with ( illogical and inefficient ) .
If they change to another " create debate " party , then they will likely be entering the same situation only with different people .
More practically , they should just vote " No " on a direct vote ballot , instead of voting " No " for a party platform , which will go on from there to say " yes " or " no " depending on the majority and potentially leaving your vote uncounted .
Which brings me to my second point .
A party is only a party if there exists opposition .
If there is n't more than 1 party then the " party " really is just the general population , and the notion of party becomes a redundancy .
If createdebate party 's actually existed , in theory and in your own words , they would be bickering and disagreeing like me and you are now .
So , if party 's are made up of views which do n't reconcile , then how would one go about making 2 party 's in the first place ?
It would be 2 random samplings of disagreeing people , that , if they ever did come to 2 different decision , would just be a reflection of what we have right now : Party 's delineated by policy and ideology .
I must reiterate my first point too , which you responded to with a joke .
That party 's must consist of relatively like minded adults in ideology and policy for it to be a party .
This is not a matter of " the way things are currently done . "
It is a matter of definition .
Also , I still think you meant " electoral system " instead of " Political party system . "
At least that would make most sense with all you have said so far .

A group with this sort of system would be abused through the process of entryism .
Every radical and other party member would hijack the group through mass voting systems like this , and pass the agendas they want , even when most of the party has disagreement with the issue .
Additionally , until everyone moves online , it 's difficult to make a party that 's truly representative since many older people do not browse the internet and thus miss their opportunity to contribute to the policy process .
If you could actually get all party members to use the site , and you could ensure those who voted were only members of the party you created .

Support Dispute Clarify Add New Argument
Speedo's new LZR Racer swimsuits promise to boost the times of the fastest swimmers in the planet at this year 's Olympics , but they wo n't be the only high - tech suits to reach for the finish line .
On Wednesday , the International Olympic Committee approved new high - tech swimsuits designed by Arena , Adidas and Mizuno , all considered to be on par with the high - tech Speedo design credited with 37 world records since its release earlier this year .
The $ 550 Speedo LZR Racer swimsuit uses ultrasonically bonded seams that fit a swimmer like a true second skin , as opposed to the stitched - up suits of the past .
With low - drag panels embedded within the fabric , the suit was designed in conjunction with NASA scientists in order to find the best performing fabric .
However , the design also led to a controversial feature : potentially illegal levels of buoyancy ( due to a mix of polyurethane layers . )
There are several studies on the importance of buoyancy in competitive swimming , one of which is found here .
When Speedo - sponsored athletes began setting an inordinate number of records immediately after using the new suit , several rival companies ( as well as the national delegations they sponsor ) protested that the tech had gone too far and the competition had become unfair .
At that point , only one other company ( TYR ) had managed to create a suit with similar breakthroughs .
If the other companies ’ suit designs had not been accepted , Olympians would have faced a tough choice : Either swim with a LZR Racer and face a substantial fine ( about $ 5 K ) , or swim with your own and face the prospect of losing the race because of the competition ’s substantially better equipment .
Still , the accusations against Speedo ’s potential illegal maneuverings are not going away .
A couple of weeks ago , TYR sued Speedo and accused the company of conspiring with the U.S .
Olympic team to suppress the competition and force all competitors to wear their suits .
This , of course , would have looked good for Speedo – millions of eyeballs will be watching the games and many of them will end up buying the gear the athletes use .
Because the other manufacturers took almost three months to catch up to the Speedo suits , the whole issue may still affect the results of the races .
The athletes that were not sponsored by Speedo started to use the high - tech prototypes of the competitors only recently .
But despite the ongoing controversy , you can definitely count on one thing at the Olympics this year : Record - breaking times in the pursuit of athletic history – even if it takes a few layers of space - age plastic to do it .

A new report by The Times of London says that satellite photographs of a site in Iran indicate the location is being used to develop a ballistic missile that could reach most of continental Europe .
The Times writes that the photographs show the launch site of a Kavoshgar 1 rocket that Iran tested on February 4 .
Tehran claimed that the rocket was intended to further a nascent Iranian space program , but The Times says that the photos suggest otherwise .
Analysis of the photographs taken by the Digital Globe QuickBird satellite four days after the launch has revealed a number of intriguing features that indicate to experts that it is the same site where Iran is focusing its efforts on developing a ballistic missile with a range of about 6,000 km ( 4,000 miles ) .
A previously unknown missile location , the site , about 230 km southeast of Tehran , and the link with Iran 's long - range programme , was revealed by Jane 's Intelligence Review after a study of the imagery by a former Iraq weapons inspector .
A close examination of the photographs has indicated that the Iranians are following the same path as North Korea , pursuing a space programme that enables Tehran to acquire expertise in long - range missile technology .
Geoffrey Forden , a research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said that there was a recently constructed building on the site , about 40 metres in length , which was similar in form and size to the Taepodong long - range missile assembly facility in North Korea .
The Times adds that the rocket launched from the facility in February was based on Iran 's Shahab 3B missile , which is in turn based on North Korea 's Nodong missile .
Geoffrey Forden , a member of the UN team monitoring Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction in 2002 and 2003 , noted that while the test rocket did not indicate any significant advances in Iran 's missile technology , the launch site had " very high levels of security and recent construction activity " and appeared to be " an important strategic facility . "
If the Iranian facility is indeed developing a long - range ballistic missile , it would explain NATO 's decision last week to move ahead with the missile shield program supported by the US .
The Christian Science Monitor reported last week that the Bush administration scored a key success by persuading NATO to approve the missile shield , which is meant to protect against missiles like those that Iran is linked to .
NATO members all supported the US position on missile - shield defense , which is to be deployed in the Czech Republic and Poland .
" There is a threat ... and allied security must be indivisible in the face of it , " read the statement on missile defense .
But Iran has denied any hostile intent behind its rocket program .
While Tehran has not yet commented on the Times report , after the February test of the Kavoshgar 1 rocket it stated its intent to use the technology for launching satellites , reported The New York Times .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ... said on state - run television : " We need to have an active presence in space .
We witness today that Iran has taken its first step in space very firmly , precisely and with awareness . "
Iran has said that it wants to put satellites into orbit to monitor natural disasters and to improve telecommunications , as well as for security reasons .
Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najar said Iran would launch its domestically made satellite , called Omid , meaning Hope , in June , Fars News reported .
But US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called the launch " troubling , " noting that " the kinds of technologies and capabilities that are needed in order to launch a space vehicle for orbit are the same kinds of capabilities and technologies that one would employ for long - range ballistic missiles . "
Much of the concern of both the US and the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's nuclear watchdog , stems from evidence found on a laptop stolen by an Iranian in 2004 and turned over to US intelligence services .
Among other documents on the laptop , investigators found " drawings on modifying Iran 's ballistic missiles in ways that might accommodate a nuclear warhead , " reported The Washington Post in February .
But the problem is proving that the documents are legitimate .
U.S. intelligence considers the laptop documents authentic but cannot prove it .
Analysts cannot completely rule out the possibility that internal opponents of the Iranian leadership could have forged them to implicate the government , or that the documents were planted by Tehran itself to convince the West that its program remains at an immature stage ....
British intelligence , asked for a second opinion , concurred last year that the documents appear authentic .
German and French officials consider the information troubling , sources said , but Russian experts have dismissed it as inconclusive .
IAEA inspectors , who were highly skeptical of U.S. intelligence on Iraq , have begun to pursue aspects of the laptop information that appear to bolster previous leads .
" There is always a chance this could be the biggest scam perpetrated on U.S. intelligence , " one U.S. source acknowledged .
" But it 's such a large body of documents and such strong indications of nuclear weapons intent , and nothing seems so inconsistent . "
Despite the possibility of Iran developing a long - range ballistic missile in time , Mr. Forden says that they likely still have a long way to go .
ArmsControlWonk.com , a blog on WMDs and national security , cites Forden 's observations about the flaws revealed by the February launch .
Iran 's February 4th launch of a Shahab - 3 just keeps on getting more and more interesting ; that is if you are interested in just how good of a missile the Shahab / No 'dong is .
Video from Iran 's television show that there is a failure of the missile 's thrust vector control system nineteen seconds into its powered flight .
At that point , there is a brief flaring at the very end of the missile and an object is seen flying off for several seconds , until it leaves the video 's frame as the camera continues to follow the missile .
Tellingly , it does n't just drop off the missile but is given quite a transverse boost .
Forden says that the debris indicates that the missile 's graphite jet vanes , used to steer the rocket in flight , are being " eaten away " by the rocket exhaust .
Such a problem can knock a missile severely off course , he adds .
So what does this mean for missile proliferators in general and Syria and Iran ( and North Korea since they are all involved in the development of these missiles ) in particular ?
It means that they are still having a hard time producing graphite tough and pure enough to be used in large missiles .
It also indicates that a top priority for their missile engineers will be to develop other thrust vector control mechanisms .
There was a vote last night in the Senate on the war supplemental , which included the Webb / Hagel GI Bill .
The spending bill , including the expanded education benefits for veterans , passed overwhelmingly ( 92 to 6 ) , and will be added to the $ 165 billion that the House and Senate have already approved for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The roll - call is online ; every Democrat , and most Republicans , voted for the bill .
John McCain , as is now common , did n’t show up for work .
Barack Obama was there , and he voted for the funding .
What ’s especially interesting , though , is McCain ’s response to last night ’s vote .
Is that so .
How can McCain be “ happy ” to promote a bill that “ we ” passed to help veterans with their education benefits , when McCain opposed the Webb / Hagel GI Bill from the beginning ?
He actively fought against it .
Indeed , McCain ’s opposition nearly scuttled the bill .
What ’s more , when the Obama campaign began hitting McCain over this , he got pretty touchy about it .
And now he wants voters to think he supported the bill all along ?
That “ we ” — by implication , including himself — increased “ educational benefits for our veterans ” ?
Even by McCain standards , this is pretty outrageous .

Like a 1950s flying saucer , the Hang 's sound is out of this world !
Listen to a short solo of the Hang being played
Hang ( Hang Drum )
Hang means " hand " in the Bernese language , and is pronounced " hung or hong " .
The Hang was developed in Switzerland .
It was the result of many years of research on the steelpan and the study of the diverse collection of instruments from around the world , such as Gongs , Gamelan , Ghatam , drums , bells , etc .
The instrument is played with the hands .
Udu - like sounds are produced with the air resonance , the sounds of the clamped shallow shells sound like bells or harmonically tuned steelpans .
The inner note on the bottom dome is the bass note , and when played in a dampened way allows change in pitch like a talking drum .
Seven to nine notes are tuned harmonically around a central deep note .
The hemispheres are hardened by a process known as gas - nitriding .
This is a thermal treatment process in which nascient hydrogen atoms diffuse into the steel and form nitride compounds with many of the alloys in the steel .
The very limited availability of the Hang , as well as its cost , may be out of reach for many .
A newly developed instrument called the HAPI Drum a fun and easy to play melodic steel tongue drum , may be of interest for players of the Hang or Hank Drum , and is available from HapiTones.com
Watch some videos of the Hang Drum below
Tuning the Hang with Steel Drum Hammers Upbeat Hang Drum tune with delay effects
Acoustic Hang with Didgeridoo's
Hangs have been made using in over 45 different scales .
Go here to listen to them and see the scales
The Ding side contains 8 tone fields which together form the " tone circle " ( scale or mode ) .
This circle surrounds a central dome , called the Ding , which sounds like a Gong .
On the Gu side ( underneath ) , there is a hand size hole called the Gu for sound resonance .
The Gu can also be played like an udu , or used to modulate the sound of the DING .
The instrument is generally held in the player 's lap and played with the hands , although it can also be played with soft mallets .
By changing the position of his / her knees , the player can change the deep note and vary the timbre of the instrument while playing .
The Caribbean steelpan is probably the most important new acoustical instrument to develop in the 20th century .
Since its invention in Trinidad some 50 years ago , improvements in the technology and design have resulted from research in Europe and the United States in addition to its home country of Trinidad and Tobago .
It has also inspired the development of new steel instruments , such as the PANG family of instruments and the hand - played HANG .

This excerpt is taken from Greg Palast 's book The Best Democracy Money Can Buy available from www.gregpalast.com
George W. could not have amassed this pile if his surname were Jones or Smith .
While other candidates begged , pleaded and wheedled for donations , the Bushes added a creative , lucrative new twist to the money chase that contenders could n't imitate : “ Poppy ” Bush 's post ” “ White House work .
It laid the foundation for Dubya 's campaign kitty corpulence and , not incidentally , raised the family 's net worth by several hundred percent .
In 1998 , for example , the former president and famed Desert Stormtrooper - in - Chief wrote to the oil minister of Kuwait on behalf of Chevron Oil Corporation .
Bush says , honestly , that he “ had no stake in the Chevron operation . ”
True , but following this selfless use of his influence , the oil company put $ 657,000 into the Republican Party coffers .
That year Bush pÃ¨re created a storm in Argentina when he lobbied his close political ally , President Carlos Menem , to grant a gambling license to Mirage Casino Corporation .
Once again , the senior Bush wrote that he had no personal interest in the deal .
However , Bush fils made out quite nicely :
After the casino fiap , Mirage dropped $ 449,000 into the Republican Party war chest .
Much of Bush 's loot , reports the Center for Responsive Politics , came in the form of “ bundled ” and “ soft ” money .
That 's the squishy stuff corporations use to ooze around U.S. law , which prohibits any direct donations from corporations .
Not all of the elder Bush 's work is voluntary .
His single talk to the board of Global Crossing , the telecom start - up , earned him stock worth $ 13 million when the company went public .
Global Crossing 's employees also kicked in another million for the younger Bush 's run .
( We 'll meet Global Crossing again in Chapter 3 . )
And while the Bush family steadfastly believes that ex-felons should not have the right to vote for president , they have no objection to ex-cons putting presidents on their payroll .
In 1996 , despite pleas by U.S. church leaders , Poppy Bush gave several speeches ( he charges $ 100,000 per talk ) sponsored by organizations run by Rev. Sun Myung Moon , cult leader , tax cheat ” ” and formerly the guest of the U.S. federal prison system .
Some of the loot for the Republican effort in the 1997 ” “ 2000 election cycles came from an outfit called Barrick Corporation .
The sum , while over $ 100,000 , is comparatively small change for the GOP , yet it seemed quite a gesture for a corporation based in Canada .
Technically , the funds came from those associated with the Canadian 's U.S. unit , Barrick Gold Strike .
They could well afford it .
In the final days of the Bush ( Senior ) administration , the Interior Department made an extraordinary but little noticed change in procedures under the 1872 Mining Law , the gold rush ” “ era act that permitted those whiskered small - time prospectors with their tin pans and mules to stake claims on their tiny plots .
The department initiated an expedited procedure for mining companies that allowed Barrick to swiftly lay claim to the largest gold find in America .
In the terminology of the law , Barrick could “ perfect its patent ” on the estimated $ 10 billion in ore ” ” for which Barrick paid the U.S. Treasury a little under $ 10,000 .
Eureka !
Barrick , of course , had to put up cash for the initial property rights and the cost of digging out the booty ( and the cost of donations , in smaller amounts , to support Nevada 's Democratic senator , Harry Reid ) .
Still , the shift in rules paid off big time : According to experts at the Mineral Policy Center of Washington , DC , Barrick saved ” ” and the U.S. taxpayer lost ” ” a cool billion or so .
Upon taking office , Bill Clinton 's new interior secretary , Bruce Babbitt , called Barrick 's claim the “ biggest gold heist since the days of Butch Cassidy . ”
Nevertheless , because the company followed the fast - track process laid out for them under Bush , this corporate Goldfinger had Babbitt by the legal nuggets .
Clinton had no choice but to give them the gold mine while the public got the shaft .
Barrick says it had no contact whatsoever with the president at the time of the rules change .
[ 1]
There was always a place in Barrick 's heart for the older Bush ” ” and a place on its payroll .
In 1995 , Barrick hired the former president as Honorary Senior Advisor to the Toronto company 's International Advisory Board .
Bush joined at the suggestion of former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney , who , like Bush , had been ignominiously booted from office .
I was a bit surprised that the president had signed on .
When Bush was voted out of the White House , he vowed never to lobby or join a corporate board .
The chairman of Barrick openly boasts that granting the title “ Senior Advisor ” was a sly maneuver to help Bush tiptoe around this promise .
I was curious :
What does one do with a used president ?
Barrick vehemently denies that it appointed Bush “ in order to procure him to make contact with other world leaders whom he knows , or who could be of considerable assistance ” to the company .
Yet , in September 1996 , Bush wrote a letter to help convince Indonesian dictator Suharto to give Barrick a new , hot gold - mining concession .
Bush 's letter seemed to do the trick .
Suharto took away 68 percent of the world 's largest goldfield from the finder of the ore and handed it to Barrick .
However , Bush 's lobbying magic is n't invincible .
Jim Bob Moffett , a tough old Louisiana swamp dog who heads Freeport - McMoRan , Barrick 's American rival , met privately with Suharto .
When Suharto emerged from their meeting , the kleptocrat announced that Freeport would replace Bush 's Canadians .
( Barrick lucked out :
The huge ore deposit turned out to be a hoax .
When the con was uncovered , Jim Bob 's associates invited geologist Mike de Guzman , who “ discovered ” the gold , to talk about the error of his ways .
Unfortunately , on the way to the meeting , de Guzman fell out of a helicopter . )
Who is this “ Barrick ” to whom our former president would lease out the reflected prestige of the Oval Office ?
I could not find a Joe Barrick in the Canadian phone book .
Rather , the company as it operates today was founded by one Peter Munk .
The entrepreneur first came to public notice in Canada in the 1960s as a central figure in an insider trading scandal .
Munk had dumped his stock in a stereo - making factory he controlled just before it went belly up , leaving other investors and government holding the bag .
He was never charged , but , notes Canada 's Maclean 's magazine , the venture and stock sale “ cost Munk his business and his reputation . ”
Yet today , Munk 's net worth is estimated at $ 350 million , including homes on two continents and his own island .
How did he go from busted stereo maker to demi-billionaire goldbug ?
The answer : Adnan Khashoggi , the Saudi arms dealer , the “ bag man ” in the Iran - Contra arms - for - hostage scandals .
The man who sent guns to the ayatolla teamed up with Munk on hotel ventures and , ultimately , put up the cash to buy Barrick in 1983 , then a tiny company with an “ unperfected ” claim on the Nevada mine .
You may recall that Bush pardoned the coconspirators who helped Khashoggi arm the Axis of Evil , making charges against the sheik all but impossible .
( Bush pardoned the conspirators not as a favor to Khashoggi , but to himself . )
Khashoggi got out of Barrick just after the Iran - Contra scandal broke , long before 1995 , when Bush was invited in .
By that time , Munk 's reputation was restored , at least in his own mind , in part by massive donations to the University of Toronto .
Following this act of philanthropy , the university awarded Munk ” “ adviser Bush an honorary degree .
Several students were arrested protesting what appeared to them as a cash - for - honors deal .
Mr. Munk 's president - for - hire did not pay the cost of his rental in Indonesia .
The return on Barrick 's investment in politicians would have to come from Africa .
Mobutu Sese Seko , the late dictator of the Congo ( Zaire ) , was one of the undisputed master criminals of the last century having looted hundreds of millions of dollars from his national treasury ” ” and a golfing buddy of the senior Bush .
That old link from the links probably did not hurt Barrick in successfully seeking an eighty - thousand - acre gold - mining concession from the Congolese cutthroat .
Bush himself did not lobby the deal for Barrick .
It was n't that the former president was squeamish about using the authority of his former posts to cut deals with a despot .
Rather , at the time Bush was reportedly helping Adolf Lundin , Barrick 's sometime industry rival .
Africa specialist Patrick Smith of London disclosed that Bush called Mobutu in 1996 to help cinch a deal for Lundin for a mine distant from Barrick's .
Rebellion against Mobutu made the mine site unusable , though not for the company 's lack of trying .
In testimony in hearings convened by the minority leader of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Human Rights , expert Wayne Madsen alleged that Barrick , to curry favor with both sides , indirectly funded both and thereby inadvertently helped continue the bloody conflict .
The allegation , by respected journalist Wayne Madsen , has not been substantiated :
The truth is lost somewhere in the jungle , where congressional investigators will never tread .
Though Barrick struck out in Indonesia and the Congo , the big payoff came from the other side of the continent .
The company 's president bragged to shareholders that the prestige of the Mulroney - Bush advisory board was instrumental in obtaining one of the biggest goldfields in East Africa at Bulyanhulu , Tanzania .
Barrick , according to its president , had hungered for that concession ” ” holding an estimated $ 3 billion in bullion ” ” since the mid-1990s , when it first developed its contacts with managers at Sutton Resources , another Canadian company , which held digging rights from the government .
( See footnote 1 . ) Enriched by the Nevada venture , Barrick could , and eventually would , buy up Sutton .
But in 1996 , there was a problem with any takeover of Sutton :
Tens of thousands of small - time prospectors , “ jewelry miners , ” so called because of their minuscule finds , already lived and worked on the land .
These poor African diggers held legal claim stakes to their tiny mine shafts on the property .
If they stayed , the concession was worthless .
In August 1996 , Sutton 's bulldozers , backed by military police firing weapons , rolled across the goldfield , smashing down worker housing , crushing their mining equipment and filling in their pits .
Several thousand miners and their families were chased off the property .
But not all of them .
About fifty miners were still in their mine shafts , buried alive .
Buried alive .
It 's not on Bush 's resume , nor on Barrick 's Web site .
You would n't expect it to be .
But then , you have n't found it in America 's newspapers either .
There are two plausible explanations for this silence .
First , it never happened ; the tale of the live burials is a complete fabrication of a bunch of greedy , lying Black Africans trying to shake down Sutton Resources ( since 1999 , a Barrick subsidiary ) .
That 's what Barrick says after conducting its own diligence investigation and relying on local and national investigations by the Tanzanian government .
And the company 's view is backed by the World Bank .
See Chapter 8 of my book “ The Best Democracy Money Can Buy ” for more on this .
[ 2 ]
There 's another explanation : Barrick threatens and sues newspapers and human rights organizations that dare to breathe a word of the allegations ” ” even if Barrick 's denials are expressed .
I know :
They sued my papers , the Observer and Guardian .
Barrick even sent a letter to the internationally respected human rights lawyer Tundu Lissu , a fellow at the World Resources Institute in Washington , DC , outlining its suit against the Observer and warning that it would take “ all necessary steps ” to protect its reputation should the Institute repeat any of the allegations .
Barrick 's threats are the least of Lissu 's problems .
For supplying me with evidence ” ” photos of a corpse of a man allegedly killed by police during the clearance of the mine site , notarized witness statements , even a police video of workers seeking bodies from the mine pits ” ” and for Lissu 's demanding investigation of the killings , his law partners in Dar es Salaam have been arrested and Lissu charged by the Tanzanian government with sedition .
In 1997 , while Bush was on the board ( he quit in 1999 ) , Mother Jones magazine named Barrick 's chairman Munk one of America 's “ 10 Little Piggies ” ” ” quite an honor for a Canadian ” ” for allegedly poisoning the West 's water supply with the tons of cyanide Barrick uses to melt mountains of ore .
Notably , one of the first acts of the junior Bush 's Interior Department in 2001 was to indicate it would reverse Clinton administration rules requiring gold extractors to limit the size of waste dumps and to permit new mines even if they were likely to cause “ substantial , irreparable harm . ”
The New York Times ran a long , front - page story on this rule - relaxing windfall for Nevada goldmining companies , but nowhere did the Times mention the name of the owner of the largest gold mine in Nevada , Barrick , nor its recent payroller , the president 's father .
[ 1 ] Barrick has responded to every allegation reported in my first report on the company in a manner certain to get my attention :
The company and its chairman sued my papers , Guardian and the Observer .
While I have a distaste for retort by tort , I have incorporated their legitimate concerns to ensure their views are acknowledged in Chapter 8 of my book “ The Best Democracy Money Can Buy ”
[ 2 ] A bit of confusion here : Barrick swore to my paper that the alleged killings “ related to a time years before [ Barrick ] had any connection whatsoever with the company to which the report referred . ”
Yet Barrick 's president and CEO , Randall Oliphant , told Barrick 's shareholders that prior to their acquisition of Sutton , “ we followed the progress at Bully ( i.e. , Bulyanhulu ) for five years , remaining in close contact with the senior management team . ”
That would connect them to the mine in 1994 .
The mining company wants me to report their version of events .
Okay , here 's both of them .

So the other day I both defined Tcl procedures all by myself and used them interactively , and I liked it , to the point where it felt like some kind of local optimum .
This entry is an attempt to cope with the trauma of liking Tcl , by means of rationalizing it .
I 'll first tell the story of my fascinating adventures , and then I 'll do the rationalizing ( to skip the oh - so - personal first part , go straight for the bullet points ) .
Here 's what I was doing .
I have this board .
The board has a chip on it .
The chip has several processors in it .
There 's a processor in there that is a memory - mapped device , and I talk to it using CPU load / store commands .
The CPU is itself a JTAG target , and I talk to it via a probe , issuing those load / store commands .
To the probe I talk via USB using an ugly console that can't even handle the clipboard properly .
The console speaks Tcl .
Net result : in order to talk to the memory - mapped processor , I have to speak Tcl .
Or I can use a memory view window in a graphical debugger .
Except some addresses will change the processor state when read ( pop an item from a LIFO , that sort of thing ) .
So no , memory view windows are n't a good idea – you have to aim for the specific address , not shoot at whole address ranges .
Damn , just who thought of defining the hardware in such a stupid way ?
Why , it was me .
Little did I know that I was thereby inflicting Tcl on myself .
Anyway , there 's this bug I have to debug now , and as far as I know it could be in at least three different pieces of software or in two different pieces of hardware , and I do n't like any of the 5 options very much , and I want to find out what it is already .
So at the ugly probe console I type things like word 0x1f8cc000 ( reads the processor status ) , word 0x1f8cc008 2 ( halts the execution ) , word 0x1f8cc020 0x875 ( places a breakpoint ) .
I get sick and tired of this in about 2 minutes , when the command history is large enough to make the probability of hitting Enter at the wrong auto - completed command annoying .
It 's annoying to run the wrong command because if I ruin the processor state , it will take me minutes to reproduce that state , because the program reads input via JTAG , which is as slow as it gets .
So I figure this is n't the last bug I 'm gonna deal with this way , and it 's therefore time for Extending my Environment , equipping myself with the Right Tools for the Job , Tailored to my needs , utilizing the Scripting capabilities of the system .
I hate that , I really do .
Is there something more distressing than the development of development tools for the mass market of a single developer ?
Can a programmer have a weakness more pathetic than the tendency to solve easy generic meta- problems when the real , specific problems are too hard ?
Is there software more disgusting in nature than plug-ins and extensions for a butt - ugly base system ?
But you know what , I really fail to remember 0x1f8 cwhat the breakpoint address is .
This story has one hexadecimal value too much for my brain .
OK , then .
Tcl .
I decided to have one entry point procedure , pmem , that would get a memory - mapped processor id , ' cause there are many of them , and then call one of several functions with the right base address , so that pmem 0 pc would do the same as pmem_pc 0x1f8c0000 .
Well , in Tcl that 's as simple as it gets .
Tcl likes to generate and evaluate command strings .
More generally , Tcl likes strings .
In fact , it likes them more than anything else .
In normal programming languages , things are variables and expressions by default .
In Tcl , they are strings .
abc is n't a variable reference – it's a string .
$ abc is the variable reference .
a+b/ c is n't an expression – it's a string .
[ expr $ a +$b / $c ] is the expression .
Could you believe that ?
[ expr $ a+$b / $ c ] .
Is n't that ridiculous ?
In fact , that was one of my main applications for Tcl : ridiculing it .
I remember reading the huge Tcl / Tk book by Brent Welch with my friend once .
There was a power outage and it was past the time when the last UPS squeaked its last squeak .
And the book was there ' cause the hardware guys use it for scripting their lovecraftian toolchain .
We really did have fun .
Tears went down my cheeks from laughter .
Even people with the usual frightened / mean comments about those geeks who laugh their brains out over a Tcl book did n't spoil it .
So , ridiculing Tcl , my # 1 use for it .
The other use is the occasional scripting of the hardware hackers ' lovecraftian toolchain .
Overall , I do n't use
Tcl very much .
The nice thing about Tcl is that it 's still a dynamic language , and reasonably laconic at that , modulo quoting and escaping .
So I enter the usual addictive edit / test cycle using tclsh < script .
N minutes down the road ( I really do n't know what N was ) , I 've finished my 2 screenfuls of Tcl and the fun starts .
I actually start debugging the goddamn thing .

Weeee !
HAPPY , HAPPY , JOY , JOY !
You have no idea just how happy this made me .
Yeah , I know , I 'm overreacting .
I 'll tell you what : debug various kinds of hardware malfunction for several months , and you 'll be able to identify with the warped notion of value one gains through such process .
On second thought , I do n't know if I 'd really recommend it .
Remember how I told low - level programming was easy ?
It is , fundamentally , but there 's this other angle from which it 's quite a filthy endeavor .
I promise to blog about it .
I owe it to the people who keep telling me " so low - level is easy ? " each time they listen to me swear heartily at a degenerate hardware setup where nothing works no matter what you try .
I owe it to myself – me wants to reach a closure here .
Why should I tolerate being regularly misquoted at the moments of my deepest professional catharsis ?
Aaaanyway , in just N minutes , I bootstrapped myself something not unlike a retarded version of gdb , the way it would work if the symbol table of my program was stripped .
But no matter – I have addr2line for that .
And the nice thing about my retarded debugger front - end is that it looks like shell commands : blah blah blah .
As opposed to blah ( " blah " , " blah " ) .
And this , folks , is what I think Tcl , being a tool command language , gets right .
I come from the world of pop infix languages ( C / Java / Python / Ruby / you name it ) .
Tcl basically freaks me out with its two fundamental choices :
Tcl likes literals , not variables .
Tcl : string , $var .
Pop infix : " string " , var .
Tcl : Pop infix : .
Tcl likes commands , not expressions .
Tcl : doit this that , [ expr $ this + $ that ] .
Pop infix : doit ( " this " , " that " ) , this +that .
So basically , pop infix languages ( and I use the term in the most non-judgmental , factual way ) , pop infix languages are optimized for programming ( duh , they are programming languages ) .
Programming is definitions .
Define a variable and it will be easy to use it , and computing hairy expressions from variables is also easy .
Tcl is optimized for usage .
Most of the time , users give simple commands .
Command names and literal parameters are easy .
If you are a sophisticated user , and you want to do pmem 0 bkpt [ expr [ pmem 0 pc ] + 1 ] , go ahead and do it .
A bit ugly , but on the other hand , simple commands are really , really simple .
And eventually , simple commands become all that matters for the user , because the sophisticated user grows personal shortcuts , which abstract away variables and expressions , so you end up with pmem 0 bkpt nextpc or something .
Apparently , flat function calls with literal arguments is what interactive program usage is all about .
I 'm not saying that I 'm going to use Tcl as the extension language of my next self - made lovecraftian toolchain ( I was thinking more along the lines of doing that one in D and using D as my scripting language , ' cause it compiles fast enough and it's apparently high - level enough ) .
I have n't thought enough about this , but the grotesque escaping / quoting in Tcl still freaks me out ; I do n't want to program like that .
All I 'm saying is that I like the interactive part .
Specifically :
Short code matters a lot ; short interactive commands matter much more .
more .
An interactive command language must be a real language ( loops , functions and all ) .
Tcl allows for the shortest commands and it's a real language .
I 'm fascinated .
Allow me to elaborate .
Short code vs short commands
Lots of people have noticed that keeping your code short is extremely important .
More surprisingly , many people fail to notice this , probably because " 1 line is better than 5 " does n't sound that convincing .
OK , think about 100K lines vs 500 K and you 'll get the idea .
Oh , there are also those dirty Perl / shell one - liners that make one doubt about this .
I 've known a Bastard Programmer that used 2 K bash one - liners as his weapon of choice .
OK then , so the actual rule must be " short code is good unless it 's written by a bastard " .
But it 's the same core idea .
So we have the Architect type , who loves lots of classes which delegate work to each other , and we have the Enlightened type , who wants to write and read less .
And the Enlightened type can rant and rave all day how Python , or Ruby , or Lisp make it oh - so - easy to define data structure literals , or to factor out stuff using meta - programming , or some other thing an Architect just never gets .
And I 'm all with it .
And then we have interactive shells .
And in Python it 's doit ( " xx " , " yy " ) .
And in Lisp it 's ( doit " xx " " yy " ) , or ( doit : xx :yy ) , or ( doit xx yy ) if you make it a macro .
And in Ruby it 's doit : xx :yy , if you use symbols and omit parens .
And that 's about as good as you can get without using your own parser as in doit " xx yy " , which can suck in the ( more rare ) case when you do need to evaluate expressions before passing parameters , and does n't completely remove overhead .
Also note how all these languages use ( ) , which makes you press Shift , instead of [ ] which does n't .
Ruby and Perl let you omit ( ) , but it costs in readability .
And [ ] is unanimously reserved for less important stuff than function calls .
The whole point of short code is saving human bandwidth , which is the single thing in a computing environment that does n't obey Moore 's law and does n't double once in 18 months .
Now , which kind of bandwidth is the most valuable ?
I 'll tell you which .
It 's the interactive command bandwidth .
That 's because ( 1 ) you interact a lot with your tools and ( 2 ) this interaction is n't what you 're trying to do , it 's how you 're trying to do it , so when it is n't extremely easy it 's distracting and extremely frustrating .
This is why an editor that does n't have short keyboard shortcuts for frequently used commands is a stupid fucking piece of junk and should go down the toilet right now .
This is why a Matlab vector – [ 1 2 3 ] – is much better than a Python list – [ 1,2,3 ] ( ever noticed how the space bar is much easier to hit than a comma , you enlightened dynamic language devotee ?
Size does matter ) .
And do n't get me started about further wrapping the vector literal for Numeric Python .
The small overhead is tolerable , though sucky , when you program , because you write the piece of code once and while you 're doing it , you 're concentrating on the task and its specifics , like the language syntax .
When you 're interacting with a command shell though , it 's a big deal .
You 're not writing a program – you 're looking at files , or solving equations , or single - stepping a processor .
I have a bug , I 'm frigging anxious , I gotta GO GO GO as fast as I can to find out what it is already , and you think now is the time to type parens , commas and quotation marks ?!
Fuck you !
By which I mean to say , short code is important , short commands are a must .
Which is why I never got to like IPython or IDLE .
Perhaps Ruby could be better , because of omitting parens and all .
Ruby seems to be less inflicted with the language lawyer pseudo - right - thing mindset .
But the basic plain vanilla function - call - with - literal - args syntax still does n't reach the purity of * sh or Tcl .
Well , the shell is an insanely defective programming language , so it 's not even an option for anything non-interactive .
But Tcl gets way closer to a programming language .
Which brings us to the next issue :
Ad -hoc scripting languages – the sub-Turing tar pit
Many debuggers have scripting languages .
gdb has one , and Green Hills MULTI has one .
Ad hoc command languages usually get the command - syntax - should - be- easy part right – it 's command arg arg arg …
They then get everything else wrong .
That is , you usually do n't have any or some of : data structures , loops , conditionals and user - defined functions , option for expression evaluation in all contexts , interface to the host OS , and all the stuff which basically would make the thing a programming language .
Or you get all those things in a peculiar , defective form which you have n't seen anywhere else .
I wish people stopped doing that .
I understand why many people do that very well – they do n't know any language which is n't a 3rd generation one ( presumably C++ or Java ) .
They do n't know how scripting works except on a theoretical level .
They know how to build a big software system , with objects and relationships between objects and factories of objects and stuff .
At the system / outside world boundary they 're helpless though .
Outside of the system our objects are gone .
There 's this cold , windy , cruel world with users and files and stuff .
Gotta have an AbstractInputParser to guard the gates into our nice , warm , little system , um , actually it's " big " , no , make it " huge " system .
These are the Architects who get mocked by the Enlightened dynamic language lovers .
They normally dismiss scripting languages as " not serious " , therefore , when faced with the need to create a command language for their system , they start out with a plan to create a non-serious ( a.k.a crippled ) language .
Even if they wanted to make it a good one , they never thought about the considerations that go into making a good scripting language , nor do they realize how easy / beneficial it is to embed an existing one .
So basically we have 3GL people , who realize that commands should be short ( " it 's a simple thing we 're doing here " ) , but they do n't see that you need a real Turing - complete programming language for the complicated cases .
And we have 4GL people , who optimize for the complicated case of programming ( " what 's a scripting language – it's a programming language , dammit ! " ) , and they do n't care about an extra paren or quotation mark .
And then we have Tcl , which makes easy things really easy and scales to handle complicated cases ( well , almost , or so I think ) .
And not only does it make plain funcalls easy – it reserves [ ] for nested funcalls , in the Lispy prefix form of outercall arg [ innercall arg arg ] arg ... [ ] is better than ( ) .
Pressing Shift sucks .
And custom keyboard mapping which makes it possible to type parens without pressing
Shift is complete idiocy , because you wo n't be able to work with anyone 's machine .
This shit matters , if you program all day long it does .
Now what ?
I do n't know if I 'd use Tcl .
It 's less of a programming language than your typical pop infix 4GL .
For starters , [ expr ] is a bitch .
And then there are " advanced " features , like closures , that I think Tcl lacks .
It has its interesting side from a " linguistic " perspective though .
It has really few core syntax , making it closer to Lisp and Forth than the above - mentioned pop infix ilk .
So you can use Tcl and claim for aristocracy .
Of course you 'll only manage to annoy the best programmers this way ; the mediocre wo n't know what you 're talking about , seeing only that Tcl does n't look enough like C to be worth the name of a language .
I 'd think a lot before embedding Tcl as a scripting language for my tools , because of linguistic issues and marketing issues ( you ought to give them something close enough to C , whether they 're a customer or a roommate ) .
So the practical takeaways for me are modest :
Posted : June 4 , 2008
Pickup trucks and SUVs are hurting .
In May sales numbers , the Ford F - 150 was knocked from its perch as the best - selling vehicle in the U.S. , and sent reeling all the way to the fifth spot .
A glut of SUVs sits on used car lots , almost unsellable in today 's market .
The New York Times reports that large trucks and SUVS that were " the first generation of mass - market … to approach the six - figure mark " in price are now selling for " much closer to $ 50,000 . "
Brent Robinson , sales manager of a GM dealership in Minnesota , told the Toronto Star " We have n't had anyone crack the door on a Yukon or a Denali in 30 days . "
Is the death knell of the gas guzzler here ?
Jack Nerad , executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book , told ABC News , " Up until now , we 've said it 's not dead .
But right now , it 's probably on life support . "
USA Today writes , " For a generation , pickups and SUVs have symbolized a rugged , oversized , no -holds - barred American lifestyle .
Tuesday , automakers made it clear that consumers are hitting the brakes on their love affair with the hardiest , roomiest -- and thirstiest -- vehicles . "
According to USA Today , automakers expect the pickup truck to " trend back to its roots as the humble working partner of cowboys and contractors . "
SUVs do n't even have that working role to fall back on .
So automakers are re-organizing , planning to de-emphasize SUVs and produce more of the small cars Americans are now buying .
The Chicago Tribune reports , " General Motors announced a bold attempt Tuesday to wean itself from a dependency on large SUVs … declaring that gasoline prices wo n't retreat and the company must sell more small cars , some battery powered . "
The automaker is closing four plants that make the large vehicles , and CEO Rick Wagoner has " said the future of the company 's Hummer franchise is in review , with an overhaul of the military - style vehicle lineup or a complete or partial sale of the division possible . "
GM has announced plans to rush a 40 mpg small car to market as early as 2009 , and hopes to introduce its Chevy Volt plug - in hybrid for the 2010 model year .
Ford Vice President for marketing told the Arizona Republic , " May was a watershed month .
We are , as an industry , catching up with the breathtaking choices the consumers are now making . "
While it considers re-tooling its own lineup , Ford is making an effort to move the F - 150 off dealer lots .
The New York Times notes that Ford has " announced an ' employee pricing ' incentive plan on its F - Series pickup trucks that will allow customers to buy its trucks for the same price as the automaker 's employees in June . "
Ford will bring its new Fiesta small car to America for the 2010 model year , but has not yet announced any plans to introduce more fuel - efficient vehicles for 2009 .

SYDNEY ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Had a bad vacation ?
It probably could have been a lot worse , with men ’s portal AskMen.com coming up with a list of the top 10 hells on earth to prove how dire it could have been .
A young boy sits next to a small shelter made from a disused shipping container in a settlement in Papua New Guinea 's capital city of Port Moresby October 26 , 2005 .
REUTERS / David Gray
This list was compiled by AskMen ( www.askmen.com) and is not endorsed by Reuters :
1. Port Moresby , Papua New Guinea
Type of hell : Disease
With over 115 new HIV and AIDS cases diagnosed every month , the capital of Papua New Guinea is in trouble .
With the population expanding at an uncontrollable rate , unemployment levels have rocketed , income levels plummeted and gang members , known as raskols , have been known to carry out bank robberies with M16 machine guns and hijack cars wielding machetes .
2. Linfen , China
Type of hell : Darkness
Linfen , China , is sooty and dark .
It is located in a 12 - mile industrial belt and affected by the 50 million tons of coal mined each year in the nearby hills of Shanxi .
There ’s no escaping the smog .
3. Bujumbura , Republic of Burundi
Type of hell : Corruption
With the lowest GDP per capita in the world , Burundi is the poorest country on the planet and is scarred by a history of genocide , mass killing and assassinated political leaders .
Not only that , but a pool of 178 countries found that Burundi ’s people had the poorest satisfaction of life in the world .

4. Pyongyang , North Korea
Type of hell : Oppression
While its modern - day facade may look like any other Western city , underneath it ’s entirely autocratic .
Radios and TVs have only one channel which broadcasts special programs controlled by the government , bicycles are banned as part of a political regime to restrict movement and interaction .
5. Oklahoma City , United States
Type of hell : Natural disasters
Located in the direct path of “ Tornado Alley , ” the worst time to visit would be from March to August .
The severe weather season makes Dorothy ’s Kansas look positively calm , with Oklahoma City being the city worst affected by tornadoes in the United States .
6. Chernobyl , Ukraine
Type of hell : Radiation
Famed for a nuclear explosion that tore through the city in 1986 and contaminated most of its living organisms , Chernobyl is certainly not the kind of place you ’d like to vacation in .
Everything is still largely abandoned and remains as it was 20 years ago , with hundreds of miles of uninhabitable space , deserted buildings and poisoned lakes and rivers .
7. Mogadishu , Somalia
Type of hell : Lawlessness
With the collapse of central government in 1991 , Mogadishu is largely lawless , with no structure of real peacekeeping present , despite a failed effort in 1992 by the U.S. Marines .
Indeed , Mogadishu certainly wo n’t be found in any glossy vacation brochure anytime soon .
8. Yakutsk , Russia
Type of hell : Environmental extreme
Officially the coldest place on earth , temperatures here often drop to a hypothermia - inducing - 58 F ( - 50C ) , and if it drops below this ( which it often does ) , children get the day off school .
Another hellish aspect of Yakutsk is its isolation -- a whole six time zones away from Moscow .
9. Dhaka , Bangladesh
Type of hell : Pollution
Despite enduring political instability , military suppression and devastation from war and natural disaster , the capital of Bangladesh faces a new crisis over critically high pollution levels .
Rapid industrial development has filled the city with so much smog it is causing environmental damage , with 9.7 million tons of waste dumped in the river by the city each year .
10 . Baghdad , Iraq
Type of hell : Conflict
The city has been irreversibly damaged by the Gulf War and years of Saddam Hussein ’s dictatorship , bringing the once vibrant city to its knees .
Lootings , robberies , kidnappings , and sexual assaults have been rife , but it is the daily slaughter of troops , journalists and civilians that terrify the most .
Who to blame for rising oil prices ?
Why not speculators :
Hedge funds and big Wall Street banks are taking advantage of loopholes in federal trading limits to buy massive amounts of oil contracts , according to a growing number of lawmakers and prominent investors , who blame the practice for helping to push oil prices to record highs .
…
Some Democratic and Republican lawmakers allege that gaps in oversight are allowing deep - pocketed speculators to manipulate prices .
… George Soros , one of the nation ’s leading investors , testified in a Senate hearing this week that index funds were contributing to the rapid rise in commodity prices and were possibly creating a bubble .
If it were to burst , sending prices tumbling , the fallout could wreak havoc on banks , retiree funds and colleges across the nation .
…
Under pressure from voters , lawmakers are pressuring the CFTC to take even more forceful action to regulate the commodity markets .
This is nuts .
" Manipulation " is an action that causes a harmful chain of events that comes back to benefit the actor .
Maybe a large supplier like Saudi Arabia could " manipulate " by holding back production and to benefit them by raising the price of what they sell .
But hedge funds are not suppliers .
By pushing up prices now via speculation they are betting on higher future prices , not causing them .
If anything , their act causes reduced usage now leaving more oil for the future , which lowers future prices , which hurts them .
They only gain via the chain of events whereby they win their bets and inform the rest of us that oil will be scarcer than we thought , which if true is exactly what we need to hear .

As Greg Sargent reports at TPM Election Central , Tim Griffin is the RNC ’s new hire as the opposition researcher on Barack Obama .
Griffin has a colorful past as the RNC ’s director of opposition research in 2004 .
Here ’s some video of Griffin in the RNC war room on the night of one of the Bush - Kerry debates .
Griffin ’s memorable line that night was that his crew of oppo researchers created the ammunition for the Bush campaign to fire .
“ We make the bullets , ” Griffin is overheard saying .
But Griffin did n’t achieve notoriety until his role in the U.S. attorney purge scandal was revealed .
After leaving the RNC , Griffin went to work in the White House as an aide to Karl Rove .
With help from Rove and White House Counsel Harriet Miers , the then - 34 - year - old Griffin was installed as the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Arkansas in December 2006 .
A total of nine U.S. attorneys were ousted to make room for naked partisans like Griffin or to remove prosecutors considered too independent by the Republican political operatives in the White House and DOJ .
As the extent of the purge became known and it became clear that unqualified Griffin would never be confirmed on a permanent basis by the Senate , he withdrew is nomination .
Last June , he tearily declared that public service was “ not worth it , ” sometimes crying as he said he had no plan to return to politics .
What a difference a year makes .
The Bonnie Hunt Show today was a rerun today however , it was still as entertaining as it was when we watched it initially .
For those who missed it then , you most likely have n’t heard of the young man Shane Mercado who danced to Beyonce ’s hit and place it on Youtube .
Mercado is a dancer and said that the thing that made him so interested in this particular Beyonce hit “ Single Lady ” was the video choreography .

NEW YORK , United States — Allegations by Iran that six Bahá ’ís were arrested last week “ for security reasons and not for their faith ” are utterly baseless and without documentation , said the Bahá ’í International Community today .
“ All of the allegations issued in a statement on Tuesday by the Iranian government are utterly baseless , ” said Bani Dugal , the principal representative of the Baha ’i International Community to the United Nations , referring to statements made in a press conference given yesterday in Tehran by Iranian government spokesman Gholam - Hossein Elham , at which he acknowledged the arrest and imprisonment of six Bahá ’í leaders last week .
“ The allegations are not new , and the Iranian government knows well that they are untrue , ” Ms. Dugal said .
“ The documented plan of the Iranian government has always been to destroy the Bahá ’í community , and these latest arrests represent an intensification of this plan .
“ The group of Bahá ’ís arrested last week , like the thousands of Bahá ’ís who since 1979 have been killed , imprisoned , or otherwise oppressed , are being persecuted solely because of their religious beliefs .
The best proof of this is the fact that , time and again , Bahá ’ís have been offered their freedom if they recant their Bahá ’í beliefs and convert to Islam – an option few have taken .
“ Far from being a threat to state security , the Bahá ’í community of Iran has great love for their country and they are deeply committed to its development .
This is evidenced , for example , by the fact that the vast majority of Bahá ’ís have remained in Iran despite intense persecution , the fact that students denied access to education in Iran and forced to study abroad have returned to assist in the development of their country , and the recent effort by Bahá ’ís in Shiraz to provide schooling for underprivileged children – an effort the government responded to by arresting some 54 Bahá ’í participants in May 2006 , ” said Ms. Dugal .
In its coverage of Mr. Elham ’s press conference , the Islamic Republic News Agency ( IRNA ) reported that the six Bahá ’ís were arrested “ for security reasons not for their faith . ”
The IRNA report also quoted Mr. Elham as saying that the six Bahá ’ís were somehow linked to “ foreigners , the Zionists in particular . ”
Ms. Dugal addressed that issue also , saying :
“ The charges linking the Bahá ’ís to Zionism are a distortion of history : The Bahá ’í Faith has its world headquarters in Israel because Bahá ’u ’lláh was , in the mid-1800s , sent as a prisoner to the Holy Land by two Islamic countries : Ottoman Turkey and Iran .
“ The charge that Bahá ’ís are Zionists , which has in fact been made against Bahá ’ís for the last 30 years by Iran , is nothing more than an effort by the government to stir animosity against Bahá ’ís among the Iranian population at large .
This is but the most recent iteration in a long history of attempts to foment hatred by casting the Bahá ’ís as agents of foreign powers , whether of Russia , the United Kingdom , or the United States — and now Israel — all of which are completely baseless .
“ The real issue , as it relates to Bahá ’ís , who are committed to nonpartisanship and nonviolence , is the ideology of the government , which has undertaken a well - documented effort to utterly block the development of the Bahá ’í community not only through arrests , harassment and imprisonment but also by depriving their youth of education and preventing adults from obtaining a livelihood .
“ We would ask whether issues of state security rather than ideology were involved in recent incidents such as the destruction of a Bahá ’í cemetery and the use of a bulldozer to crush the bones of a Bahá ’í who was interred there ; the harassment of hundreds of Bahá ’í schoolchildren throughout Iran by teachers and school officials in an effort to make them reject their own religion ; or the publication of dozens of defamatory anti-Bahá ’í articles in Kayhan and other government - sponsored news media in recent months , ” said Ms. Dugal .
She also noted that over the years , a number of government officials , clerics , and members of the judiciary have in fact made statements in private noting the nonpartisan conduct of the Bahá ’í community and the unjustified nature of government charges against Bahá’ís .
She added that the present government ’s ideology is based in large part on a belief that there could be no Prophet following Muhammad .
The Bahá ’í Faith poses a theological challenge to this belief .
“ Freedom of religion is the issue and Iran itself is a signatory to international covenants that acknowledge the right of individuals to freedom of religion or belief , including the right to change one ’s religion , ” Ms. Dugal said .
“ What the Iranian government cannot tolerate is that the Iranian people are less responsive to the government ’s propaganda , because they see the reality — that Iranian Bahá ’ís love their country , are sincere in their desire to contribute to its well - being , are peace - loving , and are law - abiding — and that these qualities stem from their beliefs .
Consequently , there is growing sympathy for the Bahá’ís .
Increasingly , people at all levels of the society are coming to their defense both privately and publicly , and there is growing interest in and attraction to the Bahá ’í Faith amongst the population , ” Ms. Dugal said .
A three - judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that Abu - Jamal must be sentenced to life in prison or get a chance with a new Philadelphia jury , which would decide only whether he should get life in prison or be sentenced - again - to death .
The United States has paid more than $ 5 billion to reimburse Pakistan for counter - terrorism expenses that have often been exaggerated , if not fabricated , according to a government audit released Tuesday that blasts the Pentagon for poor management of the program .
The report concluded that the Pentagon could not properly account for as much as $ 2 billion in payments to Pakistan over a three - year period from 2004 to 2007 .
Auditors uncovered an array of questionable costs , including $ 45 million for roads and bunkers that may never have been built ; $ 200 million for the operation of air defense systems even though Al Qaeda has no known aircraft ; and overcharges for meals and vehicles used by Pakistani troops .
Overall , the report by the Government Accountability Office concluded that the Defense Department had routinely covered costs without verifying that they “ were valid , actually incurred , or correctly calculated . ”

The Pentagon has paid about $ 5.6 billion to Pakistan in counter - terrorism reimbursement funds in the nearly seven years since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , by far the largest sum paid as part of the program to a counter - terrorism ally .
The audit acknowledges that the Pentagon has recently taken steps to improve its scrutiny of the expense reports submitted by Pakistan .
“ Up until that point in time we would say that there was not sufficient oversight , ” said Charles Michael Johnson Jr. , director of counter - terrorism issues at the GAO and the principal author of the report .
Even now , Johnson said , “ we still point out concerns and areas where we think there should be further enhancements ” of the Pentagon ’s oversight of the program .
In particular , Johnson pointed to the Pentagon ’s practice of reimbursing Pakistan without taking into account favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate .
The document is the latest in a series of studies to criticize the Bush administration ’s management of the Coalition Support Funds program , which was created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and has doled out billions of dollars to 27 nations .

The report was greeted with outrage on Capitol Hill , where it was the focus of a hearing Tuesday by the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs .
“ The more I learn about Coalition Support Funds to Pakistan , the more I am troubled , ” said Rep. John F. Tierney ( D - Mass . ) , chairman of the subcommittee .
Tierney questioned whether the program should be discontinued or overhauled , saying it has “ failed to beat back the Taliban threat to our troops in Afghanistan or the threat of Al Qaeda . ”
The report provided the most detailed account to date of questionable reimbursements made to Pakistan .
The Defense Department paid Islamabad $ 200 million for radar expenses from January 2004 to February 2007 , for example , even though U.S. military officials in Pakistan urged the Pentagon to reject the charges because “ terrorists in the FATA did not have air attack capability . ”

The FATA is the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the border with Afghanistan , where Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders , including Osama bin Laden , are believed to be based .
The Pentagon also reimbursed Pakistan $ 45 million for road and bunker construction .
But the accompanying documentation “ did not provide sufficient support that all the claimed costs were based on actual activity or expenses , ” the GAO report noted .
The Pentagon has subsequently declined to cover similar charges until Pakistan provides the coordinates of the roads and bunkers it claims to have built .
So far , “ Pakistan has not provided this additional information , ” the report said .

The GAO also documented apparent overcharges for meals and vehicle maintenance .
During one period , the Defense Department was paying the Pakistani navy more than $ 3.7 million per year in repair and maintenance charges on “ a fleet of fewer than 20 passenger vehicles ” that was never used in combat .
The charges amounted to more than $ 19,000 per month for each vehicle .
Pakistan sometimes seemed to be double - dipping , submitting separate charges for “ vehicle damage ” and “ cost of vehicles repaired ” without explaining the difference between the two categories .
In response to such criticism , the Pentagon has given U.S. military officials in Pakistan a larger role in scrutinizing that country ’s counter - terrorism expenses , and has begun rejecting more requests .
Bobby Wilkes , deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Central Asia , acknowledged breakdowns in oversight but defended the program , saying that Pakistan could not afford to deploy and maintain 100,000 troops and paramilitary forces in the tribal areas without the reimbursements it receives from the United States .

The support funds are “ critical to our eventual success in Afghanistan and the war on terror , ” Wilkes said .

[ An MP3 version of this article is available for free download . ]
Chris Anderson , editor - in - chief of Wired magazine , is a well - known business guru in the world of online commerce .
His reputation has its source in the classic article , " The Long Tail , " and in a book developing the same idea .
It should not be surprising , then , that a more recent article by Anderson ( another article destined to become a book ) has been received with great interest by the Internet community .
This new piece is provocatively entitled " Free !
Why $ 0.00 Is the Future of Business . "
Its main idea can be summarized as follows :
The marginal costs of the underlying technologies of the Internet — storage capacity , process capacity , and bandwidth — tend toward zero .
In a competitive market , prices equal marginal costs , and there exists no market more competitive than the Internet .
Consequently , prices of Internet services will tend towards marginal costs , and eventually be zero , that is , free for the users .
As more and more industries are entangled in the Internet , this trend will pervade the economy .
Starting from this main idea , Anderson elaborates a taxonomy of " free , " in which he identifies six categories of business model :
" Freemium " :
It is the traditional free - sample model , with the difference that , in the digital world , the cost of providing free samples is virtually nil .
In the freemium model , that means for every user who pays for the premium version of the site , 99 others get the basic free version .
The reason this works is that the cost of serving the 99 percent is close enough to zero to call it nothing .
Advertising : an audience is built by supplying free content ; access to this audience is then sold to advertisers .
It 's the usual model for broadcast television and radio , but with vast new possibilities on the Internet .
Cross-subsidies :
A product is sold at a price below its costs , and then this loss is compensated with sales of products complementary to it , e.g. , free parking at the supermarket .
Zero marginal cost : for those goods which can be freely distributed through the Internet , like music or software .
Labor exchange : the user receives something free in exchange for completing some tasks for the provider .
Anderson 's examples of this model include the rating of stories on Digg and voting on Yahoo !
Answers .
Gift economy : in Anderson 's words , " we are discovering that money is n't the only motivator . …
In a sense , zero - cost distribution has turned sharing into an industry . "
Unfortunately , a proper economic analysis of Anderson 's ideas does not allow us to share his optimism regarding the future — at least , not on this issue .
Prices and Marginal Costs
Again , the starting point for Anderson is this : in a competitive industry , prices tend towards marginal costs .
Of course , this is not true .
Firstly , as James Buchanan shows , the tendency is just the opposite : it 's the marginal costs that are made equal with the prices by adjustment of the supply .
Only prices have objective , empirical content ; neither the marginal evaluations of the demanders nor the marginal costs of the suppliers can be employed as a basis for determining prices .
The reason is that these are both brought into equality with prices by behavioral adjustments on both sides of the market .
But , secondly , this equalization would only happen in the long term , and provided that everything remains the same .
That is , there can be changes neither in technology nor in the preferences of consumers .
These are the conditions to achieve the " evenly rotating economy " that Austrian economists refer to in order to better understand the functioning of certain economic aspects .
In the long run , it may well be that prices and marginal costs are equal , but only if there are no changes whatsoever during the process .
That seems quite unlikely in the case of the Internet .
In the short term , price exclusively depends on the preferences of individuals and on the available stock ; there is no dependence on costs .
So , there is no direct relationship between the price of a good and its marginal cost .
But , finally , even if we were to accept that prices have converged to marginal cost , it must be noted that this cost is of no relevance to the decisions of the capitalist .
Anderson himself refers to this :
But tell that to the poor CIO who just shelled out six figures to buy another rack of servers .
Technology sure does n't feel free when you 're buying it by the gross .
Of course , the marginal cost of one megabyte of hard disk may be very low .
The problem is that storage is not sold in one - megabyte chunks , but in much larger units , which , in the end , amount to big investments .
Goods are not infinitely divisible , and so it does not make much sense to talk about marginal costs as a guide for pricing .
Entrepreneurs providing storage or process capacity on the Internet are not able to buy marginal units ; they have to make big investments in order to provide those resources .
And if they do not recover those outlays , they will have to leave the market , sooner than later .
So Why Are Storage , Process Capacity , and Bandwidth Given Away for Free on the Internet ?
As explained , prices depend on individual preferences and on the available stock .
With regard to the referred goods , it can arguably be conceded that supply on the Internet is nearly infinite , at least relative to the current demand .
In those conditions , price is bound to be very low , even negligible , so that it may not make sense to try to charge for services .
Transaction costs might exceed revenues .
Now the question is , of course , why there is such a surplus of these goods associated with the Internet that their price has been driven to nil .
Have Google , Yahoo ! , and their shareholders gone mad ?
This excessive stock is precisely the result of the business models carried out by these firms .
The analysis of their structure of production reveals that it is neither storage nor process capacity nor bandwidth that they sell , but something completely different for which a price can be charged and collected .
Google offers us free use of their search engine and other web applications .
Why ?
Because that is how Google attracts our attention to its advertisements .
Google does n't sell its online services to us ; it sells an audience to its actual costumers , the advertisers .
Google is buying our time and selling it wholesale .
As time is a scarce resource , and time ( and attention ) demand is increasing as a result of fierce competition on the Internet , Google has to pay us ever more , according to the law of diminishing returns .
This payment is made not in terms of money , but as storage and process capacity .
That 's why Google keeps increasing its " free " offering to us , its providers , in terms of , e.g. , storage capacity for e-mail accounts .
If this does not prove to be enough , it is likely that these firms may start paying money in exchange for our time .
According to Anderson 's economic analysis , this would mean that marginal cost is now below zero , which is completely absurd .
Anderson 's intuition is right when he refers to " news scarcities , " the ones of attention and reputation .
As has just been explained , it is precisely the competition for these resources that seems to explain this trend to " free " services in some Internet business models , and not the existence of marginal costs reducing to zero .
( But one can hardly refer to the scarcity of time as something new : time has always been a scarce resource , and will stay this way until humans become immortal . )
One last comment : Anderson seems to think that the lowering of prices for Internet technologies is a natural phenomenon driven by technology or by researchers , e.g. , Moore 's Law .
On the contrary , it is the market drawing on current technology .
It is the competition for offering more storage and processing in the fight for our time that propels the technological advance , not the other way around .
On the Taxonomy of " Free "
Some of the business models identified by Anderson in his taxonomy deserve further assessment , because they hide economic fallacies .
For example , " labor exchange " is clearly not free .
One individual performs some work in exchange for some service .
There is a barter payment for that work , but still , there is a payment .
In this exchange , money is not involved , but that does not make it free .
Regarding " marginal cost zero , " Anderson refers only to distribution costs and completely forgets about production costs .
It may well be the case that the outlay for distributing a song or a film through the Internet is nearly zero .
But it will still have to be produced .
How are the composers to recoup the resources ( time , ideas ) invested in developing the product ?
If , as Anderson says , " music is not a moneymaking business , it 's something [ musicians ] do for other reasons , from fun to creative expression , " it is certainly grim for the future of the music industry .
A musician cannot devote resources to his music just because online distribution is free .
Of course , music may be offered for free through the Internet ( it is already happening ) , but this is not because of distribution cost being equal to zero .
Most likely , it will be a case of " freemium " or cross-subsidies .
The " gift economy " of Anderson is neither new nor surprising .
In the theory of exchange , the revenues and costs to be considered are psychic revenues and costs , not cash .
Gifts can easily be explained by taking this into account .
If the satisfaction of giving something away is higher than the actual revenue provided by direct use ( i.e. , the cost ) , the individual will proceed to donate it .
Of course , for an outside observer , this cannot be explained just by looking at the cash flows .
Final Remarks
In summary , there is no such thing as a " free market " as envisaged by Chris Anderson when he concludes , " zero is one market and any other price is another . "
If the price in a particular market seems to be zero , we are looking at the wrong side of the market .
It has been shown that price only equals marginal cost in the unlikely " evenly rotating economy , " in which no changes happen .
Moreover , the concept of marginal cost is not relevant when making investment decisions , because these are not infinitely divisible .
The reason why some goods are given away for free in some markets has no relation to any hypothetical notion of " marginal costs tending to zero . "
In fact , those supposed free goods are " given " to us in exchange for our time and attention .
As time is an increasingly scarce resource , its value is steadily rising , in terms of storage , processing , and bandwidth .
With time rightly identified as a scarce resource , economic theory is needed to understand the interchange process .
And there is no place for the " freeconomics " of Chris Anderson .
Better luck next time .

A POINT OF VIEW
Perceived wisdom may tell us to slow down our lives but maybe pressure brings the best results , says Lucy Kellaway .
A couple of weeks ago , I listened to an admissions tutor from Cambridge University talking to sixth formers .
He said he was looking for four things in prospective undergraduates .
He did n't care about being in the rugby first XV , or having a distinction in grade 8 flute .
What he wanted was intellect , intellect , intellect , and one other thing besides - an ability to manage time .
This coupling of intellect and time management struck me as an odd pairing of the old and the new .
Almost as odd as the news that English students sitting finals at Cambridge last month were asked to compare the poems of Sir Walter Raleigh to the lyrics of Amy Winehouse .
Busyness is not what is pushing us over the edge , it is what is keeping us sane .
Hear Radio 4's A Point of View
When I was a student it did n't occur to me that time was something that I could manage .
The hours and minutes ticked away and you could either spend them wisely in the library where they sometimes dragged a bit or less wisely in the pub where they skipped ahead rather more briskly .
But now we are mesmerised by time .
Every day the papers bring fresh evidence of how badly we are managing it .
Recently I 've learned that Madonna goes to bed with her BlackBerry tucked under her pillow .
And that 15 million Britons binge every night on something called junk sleep - the feeble rest one gets as a result of stress and overwork .
What is so odd is that despite all this we actually have more time that we 've ever had before .
We live for longer , we work fewer hours than we did a hundred years ago and thanks to tumble driers , hoovers and microwaves , we can dispatch our chores in a trice .
We should have plenty of time left over for twiddling our thumbs .
Yet like most people , I march through my days in a fug of busyness .
I check my e-mails before breakfast and then more times during the day than I care to admit .
There are articles to write , swimming kits to find , sandwiches to be eaten over the keyboard , recalcitrant builders to be nagged and so on and on .
On an average day I lose both my keys and my temper .
Faster heartbeat According to a whole crop of new books on time , the answer is to slow down .
Dr Edward Hallowell , author of CrazyBusy , argues that we are now running so fast on our hamster wheels that we have lost sight of the things that really matter .
Our bodies are at risk from the stress we are under and our frazzled minds are losing the ability to think at all .
But would slowing down really make things better ?
The World Institute of Slowness preaches the doctrine of doing less , but its arguments are based more on a quasi- religious belief that slow is better than anything more compelling .
Its motto : " The fast will beat the big - but the slow will beat the fast ! "
It 's unsubstantiated drivel .
It is perfectly possible to have a stroke of inspiration when doing something else
I suspect the truth is less fashionable but more obvious .
Busyness is not what is pushing us over the edge , it is what is keeping us sane .
In my view , the pressure of time bearing down is usually a force for good .
It encourages us to pull our fingers out and get things done - and getting things done is surely satisfying .
Parkinson 's
Law is a far better principle to live by than anything produced by the slow movement .
The work expands to fill the time available - if there is n't much time available , then we 'd better get a move on .
Though I often complain about being too busy , the truth is that I find it quite exciting .
Dashing around doing things raises the heartbeat agreeably .
And if , as we are told , it is a drug - then so what ?
It does n't destroy your lungs or your liver or your bank balance and it does n't make you go round snatching people 's handbags to get your next fix .
Busyness is frowned on because it is meant to leave no time for thought , but this is nonsense too .
For me at least , busyness acts as an efficient thought - filter .
It is perfectly possible to have a stroke of inspiration when doing something else .
Yet being busy also crowds out brooding .
It is hard to fret about your own mortality when you are desperately trying to find a plumber to fix the boiler .
Arguably Aristotle would n't have had quite so many top thoughts if he had been run ragged unpacking the dishwasher and checking his BlackBerry .
But most of us are n't Aristotle .
Idleness
When I have idle time I tend to use it wondering what 's for lunch , and it seems I 'm not alone in my banality .
A psychologist in Las Vegas recently did an experiment in which he gave 2,000 people bleepers and told them to write down exactly what was in their heads when the bleepers went off .
One woman thought about Christmas tree decorations .
Another spent the whole day silently repeating to herself the names of two snacks - Twinkies , Granola .
And in case anyone still believes that modern busyness is bad , they should read Jane Austen .
In her time there was a more worrying social compulsion that afflicted the middle classes than crazy busyness , and that was crazy idleness .
In Bath , where everyone repaired for the season to be relatively busy after the languor of the countryside , the women thought nothing of doing nothing all morning and then every afternoon going to the Pump Room to watch others doing very little .
And far from such stillness clearing the mind for great thoughts , much time was spent worrying over whether to wear the sprigged muslin or the plain .
The slow hysterics point the finger at technology , which they say is stealing our time and making us feel nervous and constantly on call .
We are meant to disapprove when we read that Madonna has a BlackBerry under her pillow , and take it as a sign that her soul is empty .
But I fail to see why taking a BlackBerry to bed with you is any more of a barrier to intimacy or relaxation than a copy of the Economist , which is a sort of thing that is by the bed in my household .
Connected or alienated ?
Equally we are opposed to gadgets because we are dewy - eyed about the past that they have supposedly destroyed .
Last week I spent five hours in the car with my family in heavy half - term traffic .
My husband was at the wheel and was listening to sport on the radio .
I spent the tedious hours on my BlackBerry and on my laptop .
In the back one child was texting friends .
Another was watching South Park on the impossibly tiny screen on an iPod .
Another was playing Grand Theft Auto on his PSP .
This is family life in 2008 , and you could say it was a terrifying study in alienation - a world in which no one communicates any more .
Maybe though , our car journey strikes me as a massive improvement on car journeys of my youth .
We used to sit in the back of a Ford Cortina feeling sick .
Once " I Spy " had palled we resorted to counting garages on either side of the road .
And when we had exhausted that , we bickered over boiled sweets and asked : " Are we nearly there yet ? "
Do we really want to go back to that ?
Man has always fretted about life being too fast , even when it was going at a speed that we now regard as a snail 's pace .
Here is a quote from a famous writer .
" Everything is now ' ultra ' .
No one knows himself any more , no one grasps the element in which he lives and works - young people are swept along in the whirlpool of time . "
Just as dieting makes you fat , time management courses make you inefficient
It sounds bang up to date , but that was Goethe in 1825 .
It was hogwash then and it 's hogwash now .
So what is our problem with time ?
In his bestseller Time : A User 's Guide , Stefan Klein argues that it is all a matter of control .
If we are in control of our time , then all goes well .
If we are not , then we end up frazzled .
However , the answer is not to go on a time management course and be taught how to make lists of priorities and how never to touch a piece of paper twice .
All the studies show this does no good .
after a day or two of best behaviour we go back to our old ways - only worse , as not only are we as incompetent as before but we feel like guilty failures too .
Just as dieting makes you fat , time management courses make you inefficient .
Klein suggests something more subtle , that we develop a new culture of time , that we think less rigidly in terms of hours but instead work in a rhythm that suits us and ask ourselves before we embark on any task if we really need to be doing it .
Long grass
As a first step to regain our sovereignty over time he suggests we should take off our watches and sit for half an hour doing nothing .
I tried this last weekend .
Silenced , becalmed and watchless , I looked at my daughter who was sitting next to me on the sofa doing Facebook on her laptop .
I wanted to talk to her .
I looked at Klein 's book on time sitting next to me .
I wanted to finish it .
I looked at the grass outside and thought it looked rather long .
After what seemed like an eternity , I cracked .
" Do I really need to be doing this , " I asked myself .
The answer came back in a flash .
No .
How long did I last , I asked my daughter .
Four minutes she said .
One conclusion from this would be that I am so wound up I 'm ready to snap .
Another would be that having released myself from a further 26 minutes of enforced idleness I was free to go out and cut the grass .
Here is a selection of your comments .
I 've just spent four days walking from Newcastle to Carlisle , a distance that can be covered in a couple of hours by train or car .
Those who think life is too fast should try doing things " the old way " .
Then they 'll appreciate the " fast lane " and be glad they have it .
Those who think life is n't fast enough should try it as well and then they 'll appreciate what they have .
Amy , Guildford , England I think perhaps you 're missing the point a little .
As far as I 'm concerned , " time to myself " means just that - time when I ditch the tasks of the rest of the world and focus on the things I need to work on for myself .
Ironing out frustrations , exploring motivations behind behaviours I do n't like , coming to terms with things that I find difficult and dealing with things that have made me unhappy in the last few days .
I find long train journeys , walks , runs , time when I have no other demands on my time are great times to let the world sort itself out for once and focus on sorting myself out .
Rosie , Bow , London
It 's so true ...
I long to just " be " and lay for hours reading a book or just taking in the world and my thoughts .
But that normally makes me more restless as I think about other things I should be doing .
However , I do miss the days when you could just " drop in " on a friend - they 're normally so " busy " we have to pre-arrange a month in advance .
Grace Purcell , London Good article , but are you sure you 're allowed to write this kind of thing ?
There is so much " accepted wisdom " about how things are going downhill nowadays I wonder if anyone has bothered to check the facts .
For example crime is supposedly at record highs , yet in fact empirical evidence suggests it is quite possibly at record lows .
Where does all this accepted wisdom come from anyway ?
And who 's accepting it ?
Because I do n't like being told what 's happening in the news everyday and finding the facts at odds with the opinions .
To me that seems like misrepresentation .
Maybe matching facts with opinion pieces is also a feature of those golden halycon days of times long past !
Matthew Bailey , Manchester
Goethe wrote this when the industrial revolution was in full flow .
Klein is quite correct in the need of controlling time , and this is what nature does for us .
We may try to have another man based time , chuffed at our own success to invent some other way of being in control , but the problem is , these human constructs are able to be manipulated by other humans .
So who 's left in control ?
It 's the people who define for us what time is rather than defining time for ourselves .
Daylight saving , GHz microelectronics , everything we have invented for ourselves has been turned against us in one way or another .
One reassurance is that we still have nature .
Nature 's time has governed us for all of human history .
It has been the means by which we have lived but this relationship is now being destroyed by modern man -time based existence .

Since our project is a Web 2.0 application , it should be heavily focused on the user experience .
The success of our application depends on getting users to post and share content on it .
Therefore , the user interface of our application is one of our major concerns .
This article will improve the interface of our application by introducing Ajax features , making it more user - friendly and interactive .
Ajax and Its Advantages
Ajax , which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML , consists of the following technologies :
HTML and CSS for structuring and styling information .
and for structuring and styling information .
JavaScript for accessing and manipulating information dynamically .
XMLHttpRequest , which is an object provided by modern browsers for exchanging data with the server without reloading the current web page .
, which is an object provided by modern browsers for exchanging data with the server without reloading the current web page .
A format for transferring data between the client and server .
XML is sometimes used , but it could be HTML , plain text , or a JavaScript - based format called JSON .
Ajax technologies let code on the client - side exchange data with the server behind the scenes , without having to reload the entire page each time the user makes a request .
By using Ajax , web developers are able to increase the interactivity and usability of web pages .
Ajax offers the following advantages when implemented in the right places :
Better user experience .
With Ajax , the user can do a lot without refreshing the page , which brings web applications closer to regular desktop applications .
Better performance .
By exchanging only the required data with the server , Ajax saves bandwidth and increases the application ’s speed .
There are numerous examples of web applications that use Ajax .
Google Maps and Gmail are perhaps two of the most prominent examples .
In fact , these two applications played an important role in spreading the adoption of Ajax , because of the success that they enjoyed .
What sets Gmail from other web mail services is its user interface , which enables users to manage their emails interactively without waiting for a page reload after every action .
This creates a better user experience and makes Gmail feel like a responsive and feature - rich application rather than a simple web site .
This article explains how to use Ajax with Django so as to make our application more responsive and user friendly .
We are going to implement three of the most common Ajax features found in web applications today .
But before that , we will learn about the benefits of using an Ajax framework as opposed to working with raw JavaScript functions .
Using an Ajax Framework in Django
In this section we will choose and install an Ajax framework in our application .
This step is n’t entirely necessary when using Ajax in Django , but it can greatly simplify working with Ajax .
There are many advantages to using an Ajax framework :
JavaScript implementations vary from browser to browser .
Some browsers provide more complete and feature - rich implementations , whereas others contain implementations that are incomplete or do n’t adhere to standards .
Without an Ajax framework , the developer must keep track of browser support for the JavaScript features that they are using , and work around the limitations that are present in some browser implementations of JavaScript .
On the other hand , when using an Ajax framework , the framework takes care of this for us ; it abstracts access to the JavaScript implementation and deals with the differences and quirks of JavaScript across browsers .
This way , we concentrate on developing features instead of worrying about browser differences and limitations .
The standard set of JavaScript functions and classes is a bit lacking for fully fledged web application development .
Various common tasks require many lines of code even though they could have been wrapped in simple functions .
Therefore , even if you decide not to use an Ajax framework , you will find yourself having to write a library of functions that encapsulates JavaScript facilities and makes them more usable .
But why reinvent the wheel when there are many excellent Open Source libraries already available ?
Ajax frameworks available on the market today range from comprehensive solutions that provide server - side and client - side components to light - weight client - side libraries that simplify working with JavaScript .
Given that we are already using Django on the server - side , we only want a client - side framework .
In addition , the framework should be easy to integrate with Django without requiring additional dependencies .
And finally , it is preferable to pick a light and fast framework .
There are many excellent frameworks that fulfil our requirements , such as Prototype , the Yahoo !
UI Library and jQuery .
I have worked with them all and they are all great .
But for our application , I ’m going to pick jQuery , because it ’s the lightest of the three .
It also enjoys a very active development community and a wide range of plugins .
If you already have experience with another framework , you can continue using it during this article .
It is true that you will have to adapt the JavaScript code in this article to your framework , but Django code on the server - side will remain the same no matter which framework you choose .
Now that you know the benefits of using an Ajax framework , we will move to installing jQuery into our project .
Downloading and Installing jQuery
One of the advantages of jQuery is that it consists of a single light - weight file .
To download it , head to http://jquery.com/ and choose the latest version ( 1.2.3 at the time of writing ) .
You will find two choices :
Uncompressed version :
This is the standard version that I recommend you to use during development .
You will get a .js file with the library ’s code in it .
Compressed version :
You will also get a .js file if you download this version .
However , the code will look obfuscated .
j Query developers produce this version by applying many operations on the uncompressed .js file to reduce its size , such as removing white spaces and renaming variables , as well as many other techniques .
This version is useful when you deploy your application , because it offers exactly the same features as the uncompressed one , but with a smaller file size .
I recommend the uncompressed version during development because you may want to look into jQuery ’s code and see how a particular method works .
However , the two versions offer exactly the same set of features , and switching from one to another is just a matter of replacing one file .
Once you have the jquery - xxx.js file ( where xxx is the version number ) , rename it to jquery.js and copy it to the site_media directory of our project ( Remember that this directory holds static files which are not Python code ) .
Next , you will have to include this file in the base template of our site .
This will make jQuery available to all of our project pages .
To do so , open templates / base . html and add the highlighted code to the head section in it :
Django Bookmarks |
{ % block title %}{ % endblock %}
type=" text/css " />
To add your own JavaScript code to an HTML page , you can either put the code in a separate .js file and link it to the HTML page by using the script tag as above , or write the code directly in the body of a script tag :
The first method , however , is recommended over the second one , because it helps keep the source tree organized by putting HTML and JavaScript code in different files .
Since we are going to write our own .js files during this article , we need a way to link .js files to templates without having to edit base .
html every time .
We will do this by creating a template block in the head section of the base .
html template .
When a particular page wants to include its own JavaScript code , this block may be overridden to add the relevant script tag to the page .
We will call this block external , because it is used to link external files to pages .
Open templates / base . html and modify its head section as follows :
Django Bookmarks | { % block title %}{ % endblock %}
type=" text/css " />
{ % block external %}{ % endblock %}
And we have finished .
From now on , when a view wants to use some JavaScript code , it can link a JavaScript file to its template by overriding the external template block .
Before we start to implement Ajax enhancements in our project , let ’s go through a quick introduction to the jQuery framework .
The jQuery JavaScript Framework
j Query is a library of JavaScript functions that facilitates interacting with HTML documents and manipulating them .
The library is designed to reduce the time and effort spent on writing code and achieving cross - browser compatibility , while at the same time taking full advantage of what JavaScript offers to build interactive and responsive web applications .
The general workflow of using jQuery consists of two steps :
Select an HTML element or a group of elements to work on .
Apply a jQuery method to the selected group
Element Selectors
j Query provides a simple approach to select elements ; it works by passing a CSS selector string to a function called $ .
Here are some examples to illustrate the usage of this function :
If you want to select all anchor ( $ ( “a ” )
If you want to select anchor elements which have the . title CSS class , use $ ( “ a.title ” )
CSS class , use
To select an element whose ID is #nav , you can use $ ( “ #nav ” )
, you can use
To select all list item ( ) elements inside #nav , use $ ( “ #nav li ” )
elements inside , use
And so on .
The $ ( ) function constructs and returns a jQuery object .
After that , you can call methods on this object to interact with the selected HTML elements .
j Query Methods
j Query offers a variety of methods to manipulate HTML documents .
You can hide or show elements , attach event handlers to events , modify CSS properties , manipulate the page structure and , most importantly , perform Ajax requests .
Before we go through some of the most important methods , I highly recommend using the Firefox web browser and an extension called Firebug to experiment with jQuery .
This extension provides a JavaScript console that is very similar to the interactive Python console .
With it , you can enter JavaScript statements and see their output directly without having to create and edit files .
To obtain Firebug , go to http://www.getfirebug.com/, and click on the install link .
Depending on the security settings of Firefox , you may need to approve the website as a safe source of extensions .
If you do not want to use Firefox for any reason , Firebug ’s website offers a “ lite ” version of the extension for other browsers in the form of a JavaScript file .
Download the file to the site_media directory , and then include it in the templates / base . html template as we did with jquery.js :
Django Bookmarks | { % block title %}{ % endblock %}
type=" text/css " />
{ % block external %}{ % endblock %}
To experiment with the methods outlined in this section , launch the development server and navigate to the application ’s main page .
Open the Firebug console by pressing F12 , and try selecting elements and manipulating them .
Hiding and Showing Elements
Let ’s start with something simple .
To hide an element on the page , call the hide ( ) method on it .
To show it again , call the show ( ) method .
For example , try this on the navigation menu of your application :
>>> $ ( " #nav " ) .hide ( )
>>> $ ( " #nav " ) . show ( )
You can also animate the element while hiding and showing it .
Try the fadeOut ( ) , fadeIn ( ) , slideUp ( ) or slideDown ( ) methods to see two of these animated effects .
Of course , these methods ( like all other jQuery methods ) also work if you select more than one element at once .
For example , if you open your user page and enter the following method call into the Firebug console , all of the tags will disappear :
>>> $ ( '.tags ') .slideUp ( )
Accessing CSS Properties and HTML Attributes
Next , we will learn how to change CSS properties of elements .
j Query offers a method called css ( ) for performing CSS operations .
If you call this method with a CSS property name passed as a string , it returns the value of this property :
>>> $ ( " #nav " ) .css ( " display " )
Result : " block "
If you pass a second argument to this method , it sets the specified CSS property of the selected element to the additional argument :

On New Year 's Eve 1989 , I took a trip to Las Vegas with my husband and some friends , leaving our two children at home .
Initially , I had gone to bed early feeling unwell , but throughout the evening I then found myself in different parts of the casino and could n't work out how I got there .
Scroll down for more ...
Karen 's drawing of the multiple personalities created by the abuse she suffered
When my husband finally caught up with me , I had $ 2,500 in my handbag .
I 'd started with $ 25 .
I had to make excuses about where I 'd been and why I was n't in our room - because I simply had no idea how it had happened .
There had been many other similar episodes in my life around that time .
One day , I left the house to go shopping for food ; but then I " awoke " in a department store to find myself buying my son a hat .
I do n't really remember making the decision not to go grocery shopping ; nor do I know how I got to the store .
Sometimes I 'd pick up a novel and discover the bookmark had moved - yet I could n't remember reading the chapter .
Once , I found a knife under my pillow that I could n't explain .
After the birth of my second child , I began to lose more time and the occurrences left me almost suicidal .
Crazy as it must sound , I could not remember marrying or making love to my husband .
Nor could I remember anything about my life between the ages of six and 10 .
That 's why , when I was 29 , I went to visit psychiatrist Richard Baer in Chicago .
Until that point , I 'd always tried to cover up my memory lapses .
Dr Baer told me that my " dissociative episodes " could be a way my mind had found to cope with the pain of having been sexually abused by men in my family when I was young .
During my weekly therapy sessions , he suggested I keep notes about the times I found myself in unusual situations .
After one Friday night I wrote : " It 's 2 am and I do n't know where I am or how I got here .
I do n't know what city I 'm in .
There are no homes ; it seems deserted .
I do n't know what to do .
Should I ask for help , or just keep driving until something seems familiar ?
" I can't call my husband .
He would n't understand .
I am alone and scared .
I 'm at a petrol station and there 's a lady inside .
I 'll ask her .
" The lady was very helpful and now I know where I am .
We will get home OK . "
The fact that I had used the word " we " in my note - although I was definitely alone that night - combined with other information I had already given him , made Dr Baer wonder for the first time if I might have multiple personality disorder ( MPD ) .
He thought that when I was losing time , I might not simply be disassociating with myself , but possibly switching to another personality .
A few months later , I was faced with something that would confirm his suspicions .
When I went along for my weekly session , Dr Baer presented me with a letter he had received in the post .
Written in a child 's hand , it said : " Dear Doctor Baer , My name is Claire .
I am 7 years old .
I live inside Karen .
I listen to you all the time .
I want to talk to you but I do n't know how . "
The return address on the back of the envelope was mine , and although I did n't remember writing the letter and it was written in a child 's hand , I knew instinctively it had come from me .
I was so shocked , I thought I was going to faint .
For a while I was terrified that Dr Baer - the only man I 'd been able to trust - would disown me for being too disturbed , but instead he carefully explained what he now believed .
He told me I had been suffering from MPD , and that research suggested childhood sexual abuse was the most common cause of the condition .
He explained that if a person lives with severe , persistent abuse , they sometimes create alternative personalities to cope .
He also explained that it was common for MPD patients to try to hide their symptoms because they feared being labelled as " crazy " , and that sometimes an alternate personality could come forward through - among other means - a letter to the therapist .
I realised the letter was a real sign that some part of me finally wanted this out in the open .
After the revelation of " Claire 's " letter , it was as though a switch had been flipped .
Suddenly , I started to become more aware of other personalities inside me - especially in the evenings and at night .
I could almost sit back and watch myself function .
Even routine things such as cooking dinner , housework , or driving the children to school seemed unfamiliar to me much of the time because they were being carried out by other parts of me .
I knew I 'd done them a thousand times , but I felt like I 'd never really done them at all .
At night , I could hear different voices in my head discussing the events of the day - events I could not even remember .
Bizarre though it sounds , it seemed to be a way for all these different personalities to catch up with each other .
I began trying to identify the different voices I could hear , and came up with a list that I gave to Dr Baer .
They included four children under ten ( three girls and a boy ) , two teenage girls ( Julie and Sandy ) , a 21 - year - old woman , myself , a man and a woman aged 34 ( Holdon and Katherine ) and another very angry man .
This list really helped to clarify things .
I now knew there are at least 11 distinct personalities within me .
They had names , ages , unique and separate personality traits , and their own individual histories .
I even started to " see " what they were doing and how they were behaving - but it was distressing and exhausting switching personalities all the time .
I had to rely on one personality - a 30 - something male - to drive , for example .
If he was otherwise engaged , " we " ( the personalities and I ) could n't get anywhere .
Around this time , I would bump into people who claimed to know me , but I did n't recognise them at all .
I could only assume that they had a friendship with another side of my character .
By the spring of 1994 , I could stand the chaos no longer , and Dr Baer felt I was ready to try to tackle my condition with hypnotherapy - a recognised treatment for MPD .
Under hypnosis , I was able to identify my 11 alternate characters and find out more about them .
Over time , six more personalities started to emerge through letters they wrote to my therapist and via our hypnotherapy sessions , making a total of 17 .
Each one appeared to have been formed to help me deal with specific , difficult aspects of my life and experience .
There was Jensen , for example , an 11 - year - old boy , who was " born " in 1971 when I was 12 years old and was raped by my grandmother 's brother .
I 'd never told anyone about the abuse that I 'd suffered for fear that my father would kill me - as he had threatened .
Jensen fought back against the abuse and tried to bind my breasts flat to help me appear more masculine .
He especially hated older men .
Then there was Juliann - 15 years old and very energetic , who did n't tend to worry about anything .
She was disorganised and promiscuous , and tended to talk too much .
It may seem bizarre that a human being can be organised in this way .
It 's an alternative way of thinking and functioning , but it uses the same mental tools - the same brain - that we all have .
If we all grew up under the same abusive circumstances as me , maybe we'd all operate in the way I did then .
Over the next few years , Dr Baer spent more time talking to my different personalities under hypnotherapy than he did talking to me .
This gave me terrible headaches because the parts did n't always agree .
Some of them started to keep a journal in which they could all write , but then one of the personalities burnt it .
My condition seemed to be getting worse rather than better .
Then , in the summer of 1996 , Dr Baer received a memo from Holdon , the 34 - year - old male in my group of alternate characters .
As the protector of my " group " , he had described a step - by - step procedure to help incorporate the other personalities into my own .
Dr Baer and I were both utterly amazed .
That August , Dr Baer and I tried Holdon 's integration process with Julie , my 13 - year - old persona who was " born " at a time when my grandfather was molesting me .
Julie was crippled and suffered breathing problems .
Under hypnosis , I " met " Julie in a place I visualised as secure , and Julie " stepped into " my body .
With Dr Baer 's help , I absorbed her thoughts , memories and character traits .
The process seemed pretty easy - but the results were painful .
After Julie and I integrated , I immediately started feeling very sensitive to all sounds around me .
I was able to hear Dr Baer 's breathing and the sound of his pen writing , the traffic below and the air conditioning .
When he talked , it sounded as though he was screaming at me .
The " integration " felt like I 'd gone through major surgery , and it left me with serious doubts about ever doing it again .
At home , my mind raced as if I were watching a movie in fast forward .
As the memories of what had happened to me poured into me , I felt every pain associated with them - and even though each pain lasted only a few seconds , I just wanted these memories to stop .
During the next week , I worked through all the memories the Julie character had , and gradually I started functioning again .
I realised that having Julie had always been a form of protection from what had happened to me as a child - and now I was going to have to deal with the memories of the degradation myself .
We " integrated " Claire next - and the experience did not seem to take such a toll .
Having Claire join my personality made me suddenly feel more feminine and more sensitive .
The process was long and hard , but it worked - and eventually we dealt with Holdon .
After that , I could see changes in myself .
It 's hard to pinpoint , but I felt like more of a person .
There was a new richness in everything about me - and in 2001 I divorced my husband after a troubled marriage .
It scared me to have to re-live and talk about what had happened , but the experience made me stronger .
Two years ago , I finally stopped having therapy , although I still see Dr Baer as a friend .
Today , I do n't lose hours of my life any more .
What I have come to understand is that when children are victimised , as I have been , they turn to the only safe place they know - within themselves .
I do n't ever want to forget the different parts of me - they made me who I am - but I 've missed so much of my life .
Now I feel reborn .

Oddly enough , the far - fetched proposal is apt to be accepted .
Circuit City has reportedly solicited the services of Goldman Sachs to help " negotiate a deal , " which will essentially put the troubled electronics retailer in the hands of someone else .
As it stands , Blockbuster looks to be the most interested in picking up the pieces , with billionaire Carl Icahn ( Blockbuster 's largest shareholder ) agreeing to finance the get - together .
Of course , it looks as if Blockbuster may be the only outfit interested .
Not like that 's any surprise , however , as Best Buy itself is having to look to Europe to boost revenues with US consumer spending off from where it once was .
The real question here is whether a Circuit City - Blockbuster combo would be the perfect concoction to turn things around for both flagging firms , or will we find that two sinking ships actually do go down faster when anchored to one another ?

The Battle for Burma
May 14 , 2008 by twitterpaters

While the current scope of government - facilitated death and destruction fails to move the world to further action than what the Burma junta permits , the situation is predicted as about to change dramatically for the worse .
From the Guardian on May 14 , 2008 :
Weather experts said there was a good chance the tropical depression in the Bay of Bengal could develop into a “ significant ” cyclone within the next 24 hours .
There is no doubt at this point that Burma is contributing the scope of the crisis :
Gordon Brown today described the crisis as having touched “ the whole conscience of the world ” .
He said that , while more relief planes had been allowed into the country , the situation was still “ not good enough ” .
“ A natural disaster in Burma , by the actions of a despicable regime , has been turned into a … manmade catastrophe , ” he said .
China is currently responding to its own natural disaster , demonstrating what a military can do to reach survivors in devastated areas .
From the Associated Press on May 13 , 2008 :
Soldiers hiking over landslide - blocked roads reached the epicenter of China ’s devastating earthquake Tuesday , pulling bodies and a few survivors from collapsed buildings .
China has been a major responder to the Burma crisis , but now it sounds like it can hardly handle the destruction caused by its recent earthquake .
From The Telegraph on May 14 , 2008 :
Today China poured 50,000 troops into Sichuan in an attempt to find any remaining survivors of the earthquake among the mud , rubble and tangled buildings .
But they had to battle to get through landslides which had cut off Wenchuan county , and poor weather conditions continued to hamper aid efforts .
The situation in China makes it clear that military involvement in humanitarian assistance for disasters of this magnitude is necessary :
Trucks were beginning to travel up the main roads carrying boxes of noodles and biscuits , only to be stormed by desperate crowds .
“ They had better set up a distribution system , or we will be stealing what we can , ” said one man .
Reports from the ground in Burma suggest the situation is far worse than it may appear in the news .
Via Slog , this is part of an email from a witness in the area :
[ A co-worker ] decided to go check on the family of a close family friend in one of the villages seriously hit by the cyclone .
His own supplies were limited , but he wanted to take things to share with the victims of the storm .
He gathered together some bottled water , a bag of rice and an old quilt that his family was no longer using .
When he reached his destination he started looking for his friend .
He came upon an old woman shivering .
He reached the quilt and offered it to her .
She shook her head and said , “ No , thank you . ”
Quite perplexed the man pushed the quilt toward her and said , “ Auntie ( a local term of endearment ) , you are shivering .
You need this blanket more than I do , please take it . ”
Again , the old woman shook her head refusing his offer .
Totally confused the man asked her why .
She said , “ Two days after the storm the men in uniforms came to our village with blankets , food and water .
We accepted their gifts and posed for their cameras .
When they were done taking pictures they took back the food , the water , and the blankets and drove away .
I do not think that I can face such disappointment again . ”
update : Wonkette offers a concise summary of recent events :
Chinese officials respond swiftly to the earthquake that has killed at least 15,000 people .
International aid is flowing in ; they have scaled back a domestic leg of the Olympic torch relay ; and in general they are not acting like complete buffoons .
[ Washington Post ]
In contrast , every day in Burma brings a fresh outrage .
Military rulers have allowed in 160 international aid workers from neighboring countries to address a calamity that displaced 1.5 million people and left 100,000 dead or missing .
[ Washington Post ]
update : From the BBC on May 14 , 2008 :
The UN has sharply increased its estimate of those severely affected by Burma ’s cyclone to 2.5 m people .
The figure was revised up from the 1.5 m previously thought to be in need , following the storm 12 days ago .
update : From the BBC on May 15 , 2008 :
The [ Burma ] regime is stopping most foreign aid workers already there from leaving Rangoon to go to affected areas .
More than 10 days after Cyclone Nargis struck the Irrawaddy delta , the BBC ’s Natalia Antelava , who reached the area , says it is still completely cut off from the outside world and there is little evidence of things getting better .
She says soldiers were blocking the roads but fishermen took her to affected areas by boat .
One said he wanted the world to know what was happening .
…
Burma insisted again on Thursday it was capable of coping with the crisis .
The state media New Light of Myanmar newspaper said the people “ will not rely too much on international assistance and will reconstruct the nation on a self - reliance basis ” .
update : from the BBC on May 16 , 2008 :
On a trip to the Delta this week , the BBC ’s Natalia Antelava saw muddy river banks lined with white , swollen bodies , and found survivors with barely enough rice to live on .
A Reuters team travelling to Kunyangon , around 100 km ( 60 miles ) south - west of Rangoon , found rows of beggars stretching for miles on either side of a road .
Men , women and children stood in the mud and rain , hands clasped together in supplication at the occasional passing aid vehicle .
update : from the Associated Press on May 17 , 2008 :
… a French navy ship that arrived Saturday off Myanmar ’s shores loaded with food , medication and fresh water was given the now familiar red light , a response that France ’s U.N. ambassador , Jean - Maurice Ripert , called “ nonsense . ”
“ We have small boats which could allow us to go through the delta to most of the regions where no one has accessed yet , ” he said a day earlier at U.N. headquarters .
“ We have small helicopters to drop food , and we have doctors . ”
The USS Essex , an amphibious assault ship , and its battle group have been waiting to join in the relief effort as well .
U.S. Marine flights from their makeshift headquarters in Utapao , Thailand , continued Saturday – bringing the total to 500,000 pounds of aid delivered – but negotiations to allow helicopters to fly directly to the disaster zone were stalled .
…
Britain ’s Ministry of Defense said it had dispatched a Royal Navy frigate to the area “ as a contingency . ”
The HMS Westminster broke away from an exercise with the French and Indian navies , a ministry spokesman said , speaking anonymously in line with military policy .
from the BBC on May 19 , 2008 :
Security has been stepped up around the Rangoon [ area ] in recent days – the aim to keep foreigners away from the Irrawaddy Delta , devastated by the cyclone .
…
News had reached the city of the foreign warships just off the coast , packed with aid supplies , waiting for permission from Burma ’s rulers to come in .
“ They want to help me but our government tells them to keep out , ” said the man .
“ I am so sorry to hear that .
I think they must come to our country by international law , by force . ” … roadblocks and checkpoints cannot stop information getting out of the delta to Burma ’s people .
We bought a DVD on a street corner in Rangoon , footage filmed on camcorders by ordinary citizens .
update : from the Associated Press on May 20 , 2008 :
YANGON , Myanmar – Myanmar slowly relented to international pressure to accept more outside help , but state media said Wednesday that the government will not allow U.S. warships and helicopters poised off its shores to deliver aid to cyclone victims .

The Invasion of Burma
In response to former White House press secretary 's Scott McClellan 's revelations , veteran news anchor Tom Brokaw said " all wars are based on propaganda " .
Is he right ?
Well , veteran reporter Bill Moyers criticized the corporate media for parroting the obviously false link between 9/11 and Iraq ( and the false claims that Iraq possessed WMDs ) which the administration made in the run up to the Iraq war , and concluded that the false information was not challenged because :
( the expert has an impressive background ) .
And the media support is n't just for war : it is also for conspiracies by the powerful .
For example , a BBC documentary shows that
controlled all the newspapers
.
then
I once went on a date with a fairly heavyset girl .
I met her for coffee , and she was funny , outgoing , vibrant , intelligent , open - minded , and just enjoyable to be around .
She was so great I asked her out again and then on our second date she blindsided me hard :
“ Does my weight bother you ? ” she said
I almost spit jack n’ coke out of my nose .
Quickly , I fumbled for a response to avoid lying .
“ Do n’t ask me that , ” I pleaded .
She was having none of it .
She looked my straight in the eyes and asked again .
“ Yes . ” I followed up by telling her that even though it bothered me I was trying to look past it .
We did n’t have a third date .
I think back to that occasion every so often and try to make sense of it .
I know it means that I ’m shallow .
I also like to think it means that I ’m honest .
Now , if one has any values whatsoever , shallow or not , one will be confronted on a daily basis between decisions to withhold judgment for the sake of social compromise .
The more one ’s values deviate from the norm , the more frequently this happens .
When this happens a person has two options .
He either lies to the group ( and himself ) or faces the social consequences of moral deviation .
In a of social clones , such a problem would never exist .
But in such a strikingly pluralistic one , like American society , people encounter it on a daily basis .
Most people have an easy solution to this problem , they lie .
They lie through their teeth , all day , and every day in order to avoid the social penalty .
“ Sure your tie looks great ; I wish I had one myself . ”
“ Oh I love your present Johnny . ” “ No , I do n’t think there is anything wrong with driving a gas guzzler . ”
And what happens to people who tell the truth ?
It ’s simple , we hate them .
In the English language , we have a word for honest people , they are called assholes .
The more honest the person is , the bigger the asshole .
All of the previous examples have been relatively superficial .
When someone tells the truth , however , about deeper issues , we hate it even more .
If Suzy does not like to hear she looks fat in that dress she is going to go absolutely apeshit when Bob tells her that God does n’t exist and she has the ethical awareness of a two year old .
So , when Socrates searches for truth and finds that the politicians imposters , the poets do n’t understand their own work , and that the craftsmen are pretentious nonknowers , it makes perfect sense that the Athenians would have him put to death .
Socrates was one severely engorged asshole .
I ’ve never met a single person in my life who said that they liked to be around liars , but I ’ve only known a handful that could tolerate the honesty of a Socrates , even from close friends .
The truth sucks , the more you seek it , the more people will hate you for it , and Philosophers are assholes .
In response to the above , one may say that a person could choose not to express his opinion in any of the above cases and avoid lying .
Well , that ’s fine , except not challenging the status quo amounts to passive acceptance and also imparts partial responsibility .
If one sees a person drowning and chooses not to act , we may not blame him for the death , but he ’d certainly have some questions to answer .
If a person passively accepts a situation , when he holds values to the contrary , then at the very least he is lying to himself .
As France 's parliament considers a landmark bill that would outlaw media images glamorizing the extremely thin , psychology researchers are reporting some of the most definitive findings yet on how these images affect women .
In the May issue of Psychological Bulletin , University of Wisconsin - Madison postdoctoral researcher Shelly Grabe and psychology professor Janet Hyde describe a sweeping analysis of 77 previous studies involving more than 15,000 subjects .
In it , they found that exposure to media depicting ultra - thin actresses and models significantly increased women 's concerns about their bodies , including how dissatisfied they felt and their likelihood of engaging in unhealthy eating behaviors , such as excessive dieting .
Although on one level the results seem obvious , Grabe believes many people still resist the idea that a societal influence , like the media , can have a real impact on how women view themselves .
When individual experiments have found this relationship in the past , she explains , critics have often dismissed them for focusing on groups of particularly body - conscious women , such as college students , or exposing test subjects to unusually racy photos .
Grabe and Hyde , in contrast , analyzed data from every well - designed study on the topic they could find , thus avoiding much of this criticism .
" We 've demonstrated that it does n't matter what the exposure is , whether it 's general TV watching in the evening , or magazines , or ads showing on a computer , " says Grabe .
" If the image is appearance - focused and sends a clear message about a woman 's body as an object , then it 's going to affect women . "
The effect also appears to be growing .
The researchers ' analysis reveals that , on average , studies conducted in the 2000s show a larger influence of the media on women 's body image than do those from the 1990s , says Grabe .
" This suggests that despite all our efforts to teach women and girls to be savvy about the media and have healthy body practices , the media 's effect on how much they internalize the thin ideal is getting stronger , " she says .
The results are troubling because recent research has established body dissatisfaction as a major risk factor for low self - esteem , depression , obesity , and eating disorders , such as bulimia .
At the same time , women 's displeasure with their bodies has become so common that it's now considered normal , says Grabe .
She hopes that wider recognition of the media 's role will encourage people to see the issue as a societal one , rather than as a problem of individual women as it's viewed now .
" I think we need to consider how we 're using media images as a culture to share the values we think are important , and the effect that has on our well - being , " she says .
The approach Grabe and Hyde took in their study , called meta - analysis , offers a way to quantitatively examine an entire body of research at once .
In their case , this meant 77 carefully selected studies of the effects of appearance - focused media images on women 's body dissatisfaction , investment in their looks , adoption of the thin ideal , and eating behaviors and beliefs .
The analysis also included controlled , experimental studies , in which these effects were tested directly , and investigations that correlated body concerns with women 's self - reported consumption of media .
In simple terms , the meta - analysis placed test subjects from every study into two groups : those who were exposed to media images portraying women 's bodies and the thin ideal , and those who were n't .
It then asked whether differences existed between the two and the magnitude of the differences .
In the end , the researchers did find a significant difference , with women who were exposed to media reporting less satisfaction with their bodies .
Notably , this difference was also seen across all four measures of body image concerns .
So , what 's the answer ?
The French government may try to control the media , but do n't women also need to learn to be a little less concerned with their looks ?
Grabe replies that the issue lies not with our attraction to images of beauty or with women 's desire to emulate them , but with what we 've come to define as beautiful : bodies that are unnaturally and unhealthily thin .
" I want to stress that it 's totally normal for women to want to be attractive , " says Grabe .
" But what 's happening in our society is that many women are striving toward something that 's not very realistic or obtainable , and that leads to a lot of health consequences . "

So , what has happened to net oil exports from Venezuela & Mexico to the US and what effect has had this had on Gulf Coast crude oil inventories , and why am I concerned ?
Venezuela and Mexico are critically important to the US because of their proximity to the refineries on the Gulf Coast .
From what I have been able to discern , it takes an average of about five days for a tanker to get to the US from Venezuela and Mexico versus about 30 days from the Persian Gulf .
Based on recent news reports , it certainly appears that the overall net export decline from Venezuela and Mexico is continuing into 2008 .
The simple mathematical model I have been using to talk about our export situation is called the Export Land Model ( ELM ) .
Recently , data and media reports have shown that the concerns I have expressed about our export situation are growing more valid each day .
Building on prior work by many people , including Matt Simmons and Kenneth Deffeyes , and largely based on great technical work by Khebab , I have been intensively studying the Net Oil Export issue for more than two years .
This is a guest post by Jeffrey J. Brown , known on TOD as westexas .
Jeff is an independent petroleum geologist in the Dallas , Texas area .
His e-mail address is westexas@aol.com .
First , let 's talk a bit about the ELM model .
As an aid to understanding how rate of production declines and rates of changes in consumption affect net oil exports I proposed a simple mathematical model , the Export Land Model ( ELM ) , which assumes a country producing two mbpd at peak , with a subsequent production decline of 5 % / year , and consuming one mbpd , with a consumption increase of +2.5 % / year .
This results in net oil exports going to zero in nine years , with only about 10 % of post - peak production being exported .
Here is a graphical image :
Once an exporting region hits peak production and starts declining , the net export decline rate is a function of consumption as a percentage of production at peak , the rate of change in production and the rate of change in consumption .
However , net export declines tend to consistently show an accelerating decline rate with time .
As Khebab and I warned in a recent paper on the top five net oil exporters , recent EIA data showed an accelerating top five net export decline rate in 2007 , continuing a trend that began in 2006 .
Our middle case has the top five — Saudi Arabia , Russia , Norway , Iran and the UAE — collectively approaching zero net oil exports around 2031 .
Recently , there has been increasing attention paid to the declining net oil exports worldwide , and last week the Wall Street Journal published a very important article , “ Net Oil Exporters Unable to Keep Up With Demand . ”
Neil King , the lead writer for this article , recently obtained updated 2007 net oil export numbers from the EIA .
I was particularly struck by the net oil export decline rates for Venezuela ( - 7.6 % / year ) and for Mexico ( - 16 % / year ) .
This EIA website has net oil imports into the US by country of origin , through March , 2008 .
http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbblpd...
The data show that combined net oil exports from Venezuela & Mexico to the US have dropped by 414,000 bpd from 10/07 to 3/08 , an astounding annual decline rate of - 32 % / year .
This decline was at least partially offset by increases in imports from the Persian Gulf .
However , as the decline in net oil exports from Venezuela & Mexico ( and elsewhere ) has increased , it ’s quite likely that the Persian Gulf has not been able to sufficiently offset the decline .
The EIA has recently reported a large drop in US oil imports and fairly large crude oil inventory declines , with almost all of the decline concentrated in the Gulf Coast area .
Gulf Coast crude oil inventories have dropped by 15.6 million barrels ( 9 % ) in two weeks .
The last four weeks ( ending May 23rd ) of crude oil imports from all sources into the US Gulf Coast are as follows :
6.683 mbpd
6.130
5.173
4.996
So , in looking at those numbers it seems quite possible that we are seeing some real , tangible near term effects from the ongoing net export declines from Venezuela and Mexico , and it 's possible that we could see some problems with refined product deliveries in the Gulf Coast area in the very near future , perhaps in a matter of weeks if the trend were to continue , and there seems no reason to expect it not to .
What would result from this ?
Well , first we would then almost certainly see calls to release oil from the SPR .
The problem of course is using emergency reserves to offset a long term decline in oil exports from two key nearby oil exporters .
Venezuela is showing a long term net export decline , and Mexico is on track to approach zero net oil exports by 2014 .
In October , 2007 these two countries accounted for more than 20 % of total US petroleum ( crude + product ) imports .
At the very least , this situation may force an earlier recognition of our long term problem with net oil exports .
One risk is that oil from the SPR will be used to perpetuate the myth , for a little while longer , that we can have an infinite rate of increase in our consumption of a finite energy supply .
Datamunger , in a comment yesterday , has just compiled a data table showing the last three years of total world net oil exports , showing a slow , but accelerating net export decline rate :
original location : http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4082#comment-353705
This seems to further edify my reasoning above .
All of these factors seem to provide evidence that we face a problem with our export situation .

The NVIDIA Tegra - Is This The End For The Intel Atom ?
It 's official .
The NVIDIA Tegra is n't just a figment of Intel 's worst nightmare .
It is now reality .
Just a few hours ago , NVIDIA launched the Tegra at the trendy Bando 8 restaurant in the fantastically - corpulent Hsin Kong Mitsukoshi shopping mall .
The Tegra is an entirely new product for NVIDIA , a complete system - on - a- chip ( SoC ) for miniaturized computers called Mobile Internet Devices ( MIDs ) .
This sets the stage for a direct showdown between Intel , the CPU giant , and NVIDIA , the GPU giant ; as Intel had already revealed a similar product called the Intel Atom ( which we had earlier covered in our Intel Atom Tech Report ) .
While many may think of this as a David versus Goliath duel , we should really give NVIDIA a little more credit .
While Intel has decades of experience in CPU design and fabrication , NVIDIA is the undisputed leader in 3D graphics .
It would be more fitting to think of the NVIDIA Tegra as Freddy Krueger coming alive to eat the Intel Atom .
Of course , Freddy ultimately loses in the movies , but since he never actually dies , it becomes an ongoing feud .
You get the picture .
NVIDIA themselves have little doubt about the superiority of their solution .
Derek Perez , NVIDIA 's PR
Director , told me in no uncertain terms that there was no reason for anyone to buy the Intel Atom when you can buy the much better NVIDIA Tegra .
The other NVIDIA representatives pulled no punches either during the presentations .
I wonder what will Intel say about that .
It would be interesting to see their response at the Intel Atom Processor Launch Event on June 3rd , 2008 * .
In the meantime , let 's take a look at what the NVIDIA Tegra is all about ...
* We just attended the Intel Atom processor launch .
Intel did not even bother to mention NVIDIA or Tegra .
It became apparent soon enough why they did that .
At the end of the launch , the back of the conference room opened to reveal a whole range of final products based on the Intel Atom processors .
We will have an entire report on these Intel Atom products very soon .
NVIDIA assured us that this was not a paper launch and that the three Tegra processors have been released to manufacturing and are available for purchase right now .
In fact , they are confident that Tegra - based products ( initially Tegra AXP smartphones ) will be out by the end of the year .
Unfortunately for NVIDIA , Intel Atom products are already available today .
Is the battle over before it even begun ?
What Is NVIDIA Tegra ?
According to NVIDIA 's official press release , the NVIDIA Tegra is a heterogenous processor architecture with multiple processors , each architectured for a specific class of tasks :
an 800 MHz ARM CPU ,
a HD video processor ,
an imaging processor ,
an audio processor ,
and an ultra-low power GeForce GPU
These processors are used together or independently to deliver a wonderful experience while utilizing a minute amount of power .
With this heterogenous ultra-low power processor architecture , NVIDIA Tegra processors achieve up to 10 times the power efficiency of existing products in battery - operated computer systems running compelling visual computing applications .
The highest - end model , the NVIDIA Tegra 650 , will feature :
All - day media processing for 130 hours of audio or 30 hours of HD video playback .
HD image processing for advanced digital still camera and HD camcorder functions .
Optimized hardware support for Web 2.0 applications for a true desktop - class Internet experience .
Display support for 1080 p HDMI , WSXGA + LCD and CRT , and NTSC / PAL TV - Out .
Direct support for WiFi , disk drives , keyboard , mouse and other peripherals .
A complete Board Support Package ( BSP ) to enable fast times to market for Windows Mobile - based designs .
In short , the NVIDIA Tegra promises to deliver tremendous multimedia performance in portable devices for a fraction of the power consumed by current processors .
Is that really possible ?
Let 's take a look at what NVIDIA presented to us just a few hours ago ...
Lindsay Lohan and Landon Brown Bathroom Tryst
" Me and Lindsay got really , really close .
She followed me to the bathroom during a private party , and , well , we basically got together .
" I think she knew who I was when she first saw me .
We were just staring at each other and she walked by .
I walked into the bathroom and she followed me in . "

WASHINGTON  Last fall , Blackwater Worldwide was in deep peril .
Guards for the security company were involved in a shooting in September that left at least 17 Iraqis dead at a Baghdad intersection .
Outrage over the killings prompted the Iraqi government to demand Blackwater ’s ouster from the country , and led to a criminal investigation by the F.B.I. , a series of internal investigations by the State Department and the Pentagon , and high - profile Congressional hearings .
But after an intense public and private lobbying campaign , Blackwater appears to be back to business as usual .
The State Department has just renewed its contract to provide security for American diplomats in Iraq for at least another year .
Threats by the Iraqi government to strip Western contractors of their immunity from Iraqi law have gone nowhere .
No charges have been brought in the United States against any Blackwater guard in the September shooting , either , and the F.B.I. agents in Baghdad charged with investigating whether Blackwater guards have committed any crimes under United States law are sometimes protected as they travel through Baghdad by Blackwater guards .
The chief reason for the company ’s survival ?
State Department officials said Friday that they did not believe they had any alternative to Blackwater , which supplies about 800 guards to the department to provide security for diplomats in Baghdad .
Officials say only three companies in the world meet their requirements for protective services in Iraq , and the other two do not have the capability to take on Blackwater ’s role in Baghdad .
After the shooting in September , the State Department did not even open talks with the other two companies , DynCorp International and Triple Canopy , to see if they could take over from Blackwater , which is based in North Carolina .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s nuclear power firms aim to join its auto and electronic companies as export powerhouses , analysts say , but massive domestic expansion plans may not leave them the capacity to make an overseas push for over a decade .

A $ 1 billion deal signed last week with Russia to build and supply a uranium enrichment plant in China was another step towards civilian nuclear independence , less than two decades after its first nuclear generator came on line .
The country last year sealed deals with France 's Areva CEPFi .
PA and U.S. - based , Japanese - owned Westinghouse 6502.T for several third - generation reactors , and the blueprints to allow them to develop domestic version .
And they have mastered the construction of older models at a speed that is impressing Asian neighbors who cannot afford or are not allowed to buy nuclear models pedaled by Western firms .
Countries like Vietnam and Indonesia are keen to build plants to convey a sense of modernity and to cut their fuel bills , and see Beijing as the answer to financial and political problems .
“ They know the Chinese have a lot of money and they ’re not necessarily as rigid as Western investors , ” said Eurasia analyst Bob Herrera Lim .
“ The Chinese could be the accelerator .
They could say ‘ we ’re willing to take a longer term look because these countries have a strategic value to us ’ .
And obviously there ’s a lot of policy behavior in many of their companies . ”
And the timing could n’t be better for China , as the fight against climate change and the search for cheaper energy sources revives global interest in nuclear power .
“ Their technology will improve , and worldwide demand is big so when it ... starts to grow at a high pace again , Areva , Westinghouse and other nuclear reactor suppliers cannot meet it on their own , ” said Colette Lewiner , analyst at Capgemini .
“ I know it is serious because ( the Chinese ) told me they are looking for partners to export the technology . ”
DOMESTIC EXPANSION
But China is also ramping up its domestic nuclear expansion plans , targeting a total of 60 gigawatts by 2020 .
Its current nuclear capacity is only 9 GW , under 2 percent of its total installed power generation capacity .
( For a table of China ’s nuclear plans click < ID : nSP2365 >)
And its own experts admit they will have to devote most of the country ’s technical know - how and a large portion of both listed and state - owned firms ’ capital to what will be the fastest nuclear build - out the world has ever seen .
It will need to start construction on about 4 new generators a year through 2015 to meet its ambitious target .
“ At present it ’s pretty hard for our building and design equipment to meet China ’s own development needs , so in terms of going overseas , it ’s not a big target for us , ” said an industry source close to the government who declined to be named .
Beijing sees nuclear plants as a partial answer for its mounting pollution and energy security problems , although China ’s electricity use is growing so fast that even after the breakneck expansion nuclear will provide about 5 percent of its power .
For a graphic on China 's share of nuclear power , here
The speed of the expansion is tying China to the second - generation models that have faced teething troubles rather than the safer third - generation plants it has begun buying .
“ The majority of plants started before 2013 will be that model because China is quite familiar with it , ” the industry expert said .
But there is no shortage of bidders .
Ambitious managers at all the country ’s big five listed power companies want to join the sector , once the preserve of two state - owned firms .
The country 's second - largest listed electricity producer , Datang International Power Generation Co. Ltd. 0991.HK has already invested in the Ningde plan in southeastern Fujian province , with the first reactor due to come on line in 2012 .
Nuclear is attractive because it diversifies their generating mix , adding a type of plant with a relatively predictable operating margin because fuel is such a small portion of costs .
BUSINESS IN CHINA
Despite its desire for a speedy expansion , China ’s focus on developing domestic technology means firms like Westinghouse and Areva are unlikely to repeat deals for entire plants .
But they will be rewarded for handing over some of their secrets by an ongoing stream of smaller deals for parts that Chinese companies are not yet able to manufacture , or can not produce on a large scale .
“ In the future , I see a two - way flow of business .
There will not be so many sales of big third - generation plants but equipment sales to China will be good , ” Lewiner said .
“ In the other direction Western firms will be re-exporting from China nuclear equipment and sharing skills , ” she added .
Another area where France ’s Areva looks set to pick up steady business in China is reprocessing nuclear waste .
“ Fuel manufacturing and reprocessing of used fuel are areas where China needs Western technology , because they cannot do this on an industrial scale , ” she said .

Donald Trump is a racist .
He ’s a liar and a fraud .
He ’s an ignorant , arrogant , uncurious , vicious , juvenile , petty douchebag .
The idea that he could possibly be considered for the office of president while dragging behind him gangs of venal hypocrites , Christopathic theocrats , science deniers , gun nuts and Klansmen is both horrifying and deeply disturbing .
Donald Trump must be stopped .
And not just by losing the election .
Donald Trump and the entire Republican party must be given an electoral beatdown of epic proportions – chain whipped so severely that the story is used to frighten children .
The party that unified behind him must be curb - stomped and left in the gutter .
It must be made absolutely clear to all who voted for him that such egregious offense to the very idea of political commonwealth – of government itself – will be rejected with the complete and total contempt it deserves .
It is frustrating that the Democrats make stopping him such a disheartening exercise in ethical hypocrisy .
This primary cycle reminded me of all the reasons I preferred Barack Obama in 2008 .
It also reminded in very profound ways of all the reasons I really do n’t like Hillary Clinton .
The same sort of tactics and arrogance ; the weaknesses as a general election candidate that made me prefer Obama are all still there , with the addition of new and more significant issues .
Let ’s get the stipulations out of the way : Clinton is wicked smart , deeply experienced , absolutely competent and qualified to occupy the office .
She is infinitely better than Donald Trump or any other Republican who sought the nomination .
She is not Satan .
Clinton also has a very long string of targets trailing behind her that make her , in my view , the weaker Democratic candidate in the general election : Goldman Sachs , the Iraq war vote , emails , Libya , Syria , Honduras , NAFTA / TPP , Bosnian sniper fire …
All of the foregoing in addition to the right wing ratfucking fever dreams ( Benghazi et al ) that are articles of faith among the Dittohead hordes .
She is viewed as untrustworthy and inauthentic ; has higher unfavourable numbers with a majority of voters , and is the least liked candidate in electoral history except for her opponent .
She did , however , win more Democratic primary votes and more states than Bernie Sanders .
Some argue that the primary process was bent from the moment 500 + superdelegates created Hillary ’s “ insurmountable lead ” before a single ballot was ever cast .
I ’ll leave aside voter registration problems , rule changes , miscounts , coin flips , the refusal of democratic superdelegates in individual states to follow the will of their constituents , and the media alternating between ignoring Sanders or dismissing him with shallow falsehoods about his policies .
Nevertheless , despite having fallen short in the Democratic primary , Bernie Sanders still polls better than Clinton nationally ; in swing states ; among independents , and puts red states in play .
He is viewed as honest and trustworthy by solid majorities of Democrats , Republicans and independents .
He drives turnout for the Democrats – specifically the possibly significant crowds threatening to stay home , vote third party , or cast a spiteful ballot for Trump .
He did n’t take a dime from Wall St. , voted against the Iraq war , and is n’t being investigated by the FBI .
He gives anti-establishment Conservatives ( for whom Clinton is evil in shoes ) an excuse to abandon the ignorant embarrassment leading their party , and also appeals to rust belt Republicans who are angry about the loss of manufacturing and blame Hillary for NAFTA .
I believe the Democratic party is missing an opportunity , as the Republicans nominate a racist jackass with extra-terrestrial hair , to offer an alternative to the status quo that is not only what Americans want but what America desperately needs – one that reflects the ideals the Democratic party claims to represent .
But Bernie Sanders ai n’t the nominee .
Fuck .
Such a disappointment .
The choice before the voter , then , will be Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump .
“ It ’s like choosing the noose or the electric chair . ”
Welcome to being a Liberal – where the fight never ends , and you never get to win a fucking thing without some retrograde asshole trying to take it away .
It ’s time to put down your sippy cup and change your Pampers .
This election is NOT just Hillary or Donald .
Donald brings with him the Freedom Caucus , Paul Ryan ’s budget , Inhofe ’s snowball and Sarah Palin ’s “ Drill , baby , drill . ”
He brings two ( maybe four ) Supreme Court Justices , all eight paces to the right of Antonin Scalia .
He starts deporting people , banning Muslims , disqualifying judges who rule against him , suing any reporter who asks a question he does n’t like , and cutting the same sort of crooked deals with China that drove his casinos into bankruptcy .
A belligerent , thin - skinned , narcissistic moron who lavishes praise on sycophants and vitriolic slime on all others .
A vacillating buffoon completely confident in the accuracy of his own myopic delusions .
A man who uses a presidential debate to talk about his dick and who publicly expresses that , you know , if his daughter were n’t his daughter …
Hillary Rodham Clinton , peace be upon her , brings with her Liz Warren , Bernie Sanders , Joe Biden , Al Franken ( he ’s good enough , he ’s smart enough and people like him ) , and former President Barack Hussein Obama ( you thought he had zero fucks to give now ) .
If some smug pricks get off their ass and vote , she ’ll have a Senate with 56 Democrats in it and a Congress with fewer Republicans , some of whom President Clinton can shiv into line with fear of re-election ( “ Go ahead – vote against the Clinton infrastructure spending in your home district – see how your constituents like that . ” )
Hillary ca n’t be president forever .
What the hell sort of mess are you trying to make for Liz Warren to clean up ?
On what moral basis can you shove gays back in the closet , give theocrats the right to inflict bigotry under the guise of faith , destroy health care , education and the environment while enshrining “ No taxes for the rich – sink or swim , fuckers ” as the governing economic principle for the next four years ?
On what basis do you inflict Kansas ’ economy , Mississippi ’s race relations , Pat Robertson ’s curriculum , Louie Gohmert ’s abortion laws , Pam Geller ’s outreach to Muslims , and the DayGlo orange candidate ’s “ Climate change is a Chinese hoax ” on the country because YOU’RE too fucking pure to vote against Donald Trump ?
This argument from moral purity is contemptible , not least because it is premised on a lie .
The predicate assertion is that both parties are equally bad , equally corrupt , and equally uninterested in helping the poor and middle class .
Horseshit .
One party is bent on destroying the poor and middle class .
They want to repeal health care , privatize education , end food stamps , eliminate the EPA ( the rich can BUY lead - free drinking water ) and ban both abortion and education about condoms .
They want an end to Pell grants , contracts for more private prisons , a nationwide crackdown on voter fraud (! ) , the end of welfare , Social Security and Medicare .
They shut down the government with petulant tantrums and threaten to force the country to default on its debts if they do n’t get their way .
They openly demand that judges be appointed AND REMOVED based on any ruling that does not comport with their god bothering , gun fetish or freedom to be bigots .
They are n’t rational and they damn sure ai n’t adults .
They are all lining up behind a man they ’re too morally bankrupt to admit is a racist because they ’ve been relying on racists since Nixon .
They scuttled the Paris Peace talks ; sold missiles to mullahs ; ran death squads in Central America ; lied about WMD ’s ; propped up Noriega , Gaddafi and Hussein , and TORTURED people .
Please … show me anything even distantly orbiting equivalent malfeasance by the Democrats .
I ’ll wait .
Bill Clinton got a blowjob and lied about it .
Hillary was n’t careful about her email .
You can mewl about her taking cash from bankers and fucking up Libya all you want .
None of it comes close to the cracked madness and venal hypocrisy of the GOP over the past 40 years .
“ Hillary ’s the status quo . ”
Damn her .
Damn her to HELL .
Are the Democrats too deep in the pocket of Wall St. and the corporate sector ?
Absolutely .
Is Hillary Clinton likely to sic the SEC on Goldman Sachs ?
I would n’t take any bets .
Trump and the Republicans must be stopped .
Period .
I get that you ’re too righteous to sully your sparkly moral perch with anything like a vote for Hillary Clinton .
But you damn well need to vote against Trump .
It just requires marking the ballot the same way .
Think of it as voting for Obama , again .
And for Liz Warren .
And WITH Bernie Sanders … who will also vote against Trump .
IF the people who were motivated to engage politics because of Bernie Sanders STAY engaged then , over the course of the next four years … and the next decade , we ’ll be able to gain some ground instead of watching every gain of the past eight years rolled back and then some .
And there will STILL be retrograde assholes trying to claw back every inch .
You oppose those rat bastards BY OPPOSING THEM .
Welcome , again , to being a Liberal .
Get used to heartbreak and disappointment .
Refusing to vote is not a question of principle .
It ’s nothing more than surrender under a smug and pretentious facade .
YOU are who Hannah Arendt was talking about when she remarked on the banality of evil .
If you ’re not in the fight – if you REALLY believe both sides are equally awful and you ’re just going to maintain that aura of condescension from the sidelines , at least shut the fuck up .
I ’m tired of hearing how goddamn clean your hands are .

Stumbling over ' Texas two - step ' COMMENTARY
The melodrama with which Harris County Clerk Beverly Kaufman reported a list of suspected two - timing voters to the district attorney 's office this week seemed more appropriate for irregularities associated with creative Enron accounting than voting .
There was a press conference and news release warning of up to 10 years in the pokey and a $ 10,000 fine for those convicted of the third - degree felony of knowingly voting twice .
There were Kaufman 's quotes to reporters about voters trying to double dip in both Democratic and Republican primaries " thinking they would n't get caught . "
" I could have just turned all that over quietly , " Kaufman says .
But she chose to teach voters a lesson .
" I certainly am not on a witchhunt and I do n't want innocent people thrown in the slammer , " Kaufman said .
" But I felt like making a big issue of it was the best way to educate the public on the importance of voting only once in an election . "
Trying to follow rules
While some voters are clearly in need of remedial voting instruction , Kaufman 's approach seems more intent on scaring or embarrassing any guilty parties , rather than informing voters who were confused or mistaken .
Kaufman has no proof that any of the 1,148 voters on the list actually intended to break the law .
Take Zymoral Eikner .
The 75 - year - old northeast Houston resident came clean when I called to ask her if she 'd voted once during early voting and again on Election Day .
" I suppose so , " said Eikner .
" I heard this on the news and this is frightening to me , " Eikner said .
" It said it could be a federal offense .
Or I could go to jail or something .
And I 'm just , well , I 'm just not accustomed to anything like that .
I 've never done anything wrong . "
Eikner , who divvies out meals at a Pleasantville senior center , said she and her neighbors were trying to follow what they thought were the rules in this election where so many things , including the candidates , seemed exceptional .
" They said ' you can vote twice , this is the Texas two - step . '
And I 'd never heard of Texas two - step .
And I just thought that was something we were supposed to do , " she said .
The phrase " voting twice " was used by campaigns and media to explain a two - pronged primary process by which Texans can cast one individual vote , and then return to participate in a Texas - style caucus .
Sybil Moji , a 45 - year - old sales associate in southwest Houston , also fell victim to the " vote twice " refrain .
" We were just trying to exercise our rights as citizens and now we 're getting in trouble because something was n't explained , " Moji said .
Her voter registration card had been stamped when she voted early in the Democratic primary , but she said that did n't raise any eyebrows from campaign workers when she returned to cast her second ballot .
Then there are folks who say they did n't vote twice at all .
Their only sin seems to be mistakenly signing in at the wrong party 's polling place before heading to the correct one .
Rick Shojaei , 50 , of Huffman , said he was in the voting booth before realizing there were n't any Democrats on the ballot .
He left thinking the GOP election judge would clear up the situation .
" If they did n't take my name completely off , it 's their problem , " he said .
Walter Muehr , 79 , of South Houston , could n't remember exactly what went on in the voting booth before he realized he was at the wrong primary .
" I did n't vote for anybody .
I do n't think I did .
It 's very possible I did .
I just really do n't know now , " he said .
" But I certainly was n't trying to vote twice . "
That 's probably the case for most on Kaufman 's list .
Sure , these voters could have avoided trouble by educating themselves more before voting .
But election judges and poll workers who neglected to scratch out names or check for stamps on voting cards bear some of the responsibility .
And I 'm sure former President Bill Clinton and journalists like me share in the blame for having a bit too much fun with the " voting twice " jokes .
Now the DA 's office is stuck with this haystack of names of mostly confused , lost or uninformed voters .
Investigators will be hard - pressed to locate the few needles of the ill - intentioned .
And even if they are plucked from the pile , prosecution is n't likely .
In the 1992 presidential elections , at least 6,707 people in Harris County who voted without proper registration were never punished .
Officials could n't prove they intended to thwart the law .
A couple years later , then - district attorney John B. Holmes Jr. was asked if he could recall any illegal voting charges ever being filed in the county .
He said no , but he added , " there 's been a hell of a lot of investigations . "

An Oregon federal magistrate has awarded nearly $ 108,000 to a Beaverton single mother who said the recording industry falsely accused her of illegally downloading music .
The money represents Tanya Andersen 's attorney fees and costs in successfully fighting a lawsuit filed by the recording industry against her .
The attorney fee award is separate from a national class action lawsuit Andersen filed against the recording industry last year .
Andersen 's legal battle with the Recording Industry Association of America has gained national attention as a case of David vs. Goliath .
Her suit accuses the industry of a waging a " campaign of threat and intimidation " against her and others who have never illegally downloaded music .
" While we respectfully disagree with the magistrate judge 's decision to award extraneous fees -- including on counterclaims that the defendant herself brought and dropped -- it is important to note this decision is only a recommendation and falls significantly short of defendant 's requests .
We will likely file an objection in short order , " said Cara Duckworth director of communications for the Recording Industry Association of America .
The recording industry has taken legal steps against thousands of people suspected of illegally downloading music since 2003 .
The industry sued Andersen in 2005 , but dropped the case last year after failing to turn up evidence that she illegally downloaded music .

A new anti-piracy law , proposed yesterday by New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has been criticized as pointless pandering to lobby groups , and ' cronyism ' .
Worse , the bill is based on date from the widely discredited LEK study of 2006 .
The new law proposes to make the recording of films in a cinema a class A misdemeanor with penalties of up to a year in prison , and a $ 1,000 fine for a first offender .
Repeat offenders would be charged with a felony , and correspondingly higher penalties .
Unusually , however , the bill is unnecessary , as the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 ( link ) already criminalized this action , with much stronger penalties .
The question then seems to be not what the act is about , but WHY ?
Fortunately .
The answer is n’t hard to guess at with some digging .
Mr Cuomo , has , like the MPAA chairman Dan Glickman , strong ties to the Clintons .
Cuomo was considering running for the US Senate in 2000 , but allowed current presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to run for that seat instead .
At the time , he was a Cabinet Secretary in her husband Bill ’s , White House , serving as ‘ Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ’ , during the same period that current MPAA chairman Dan Glickman was serving as ‘ Secretary of Agriculture ’ .
To some , that seems more than coincidence .
It is little surprise then , that the announcements for the law contain data from the MPAA ’s 2006 LEK study as their only supporting evidence .
A study which has not only been widely ridiculed ( including by me ) , but which the MPAA has themselves undermined earlier this year .
Speaking out against the bill has been the US Pirate Party , calling it “ a disgusting act of cronyism ” .
Ray Jenson , the Party ’s operations officer , commented on the bill saying , “ There can be no justice in this country , if a lobby group can effectively ‘ buy ’ former colleagues to propose laws like these . ”
The Party also hinted that they would soon be releasing a study , showing a more realistic view of the damage caused by ‘ cinema camming ’ .
Whilst the law has n’t been passed yet , the support shows that at least some of the millions the MPAA has pumped into its lobbying efforts have not been in vain .
Meanwhile the chairman of the US Pirate Party , Andrew Norton , had this comment to offer .
“ In the end , no amount of laws will save the horse - and - cart that is the Entertainment Industry right now , from technological progress in this automobile age . ”
The NY Attorney General ’s office had not replied to calls for comment at the time of publication .
A federal grand jury issued an indictment against a woman in Missouri accused of creating a fake MySpace page to bully a 13 - year - old girl .
The girl committed suicide as a result of the bullying .
Lori Drew was indicted this morning in Los Angeles on federal charges for fraudulently using an account on MySpace .
The indictment charges Drew in four counts – one count for conspiracy and three counts " for accessing protected computers without authorization to obtain information to inflict emotional distress , " according to a press release .
The latter charge relates to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .
The indictment ( .pdf ) alleges that Drew and her co-conspirators violated MySpace 's terms of service , which require registrants to provide truthful registration information and refrain from soliciting personal information from anyone under 18 or using information obtained from MySpace services to harass or harm other people , among other terms .
If convicted on all four counts , Drew could face up to 20 years in federal prison .
“ This adult woman allegedly used the internet to target a young teenage girl , with horrendous ramifications , ” said United States Attorney Thomas P. O'Brien .
“ After a thorough investigation , we have charged Ms. Drew with criminally accessing MySpace and violating rules established to protect young , vulnerable people .
Any adult who uses the internet or a social - gathering website to bully or harass another person , particularly a young teenage girl , needs to realize that their actions can have serious consequences . ”
Drew 's co-conspirators include her daughter and another teenager , Ashley Grills , who helped set up the MySpace account and sent comments to Megan Meier that contributed to her suicide .
It was reported earlier this year that Grills was given immunity for her cooperation with the investigation .
When asked at a press conference what this might mean for other people who engage in similar behavior , O'Brien responded that , " Anyone who engages in harassment and violates the law similar to Ms. Drew is subject to investigation and prosecution on the right facts . "
O'Brien said that Drew will be allowed to surrender to authorities and said he expected that would happen next month in St. Louis , Missouri .

Sorry to be so heavy on the cape - and - tights stuff lately , but the drawings I did last week got me excited about doing that Smokers - of - the - Marvel - Universe print I 've been kicking around .
Also , I do n't know how to do the " doink " thing where everyone has a link to a longer post , so here 's the thing in its entirety .
For those on Livejournal with me on your friends page , I do apologize for causing you to scroll so much to reach the next post .
Also , I 've had the last class of my MFA program !
Still have to finish my thesis , but for all intents I 'm done .
Anyway , without further ado :
SMOKERS of the MARVEL UNIVERSE !
Much thanks to Ryan Dunlavey , Andrew Wales , Pat Lewis , and YodaJones and SpanoMano from the ISR forum for helping me compile a list of Marvel Smokers .
We probably all know people , either at work or in our personal lives , who are really good listeners .
No matter what kind of situation we 're in , they always seem to know just what to say – and how to say it – so that we 're not offended or upset .
They 're caring and considerate , and even if we do n't find a solution to our problem , we usually leave feeling more hopeful and optimistic .
Click here to view a transcript of this video .
We probably also know people who are masters at managing their emotions .
They do n't get angry in stressful situations .
Instead , they have the ability to look at a problem and calmly find a solution .
They 're excellent decision makers , and they know when to trust their intuition .
Regardless of their strengths , however , they 're usually willing to look at themselves honestly .
They take criticism well , and they know when to use it to improve their performance .
People like this have a high degree of emotional intelligence .
They know themselves very well , and they 're also able to sense the emotional needs of others .
Would you like to be more like this ?
As more and more people accept that emotional intelligence is just as important to professional success as technical ability , organizations are increasingly using it when they hire and promote .
For example , one large cosmetics company recently revised their hiring process for salespeople to choose candidates based on their emotional intelligence .
The result ?
People hired with the new system have sold , on average , $ 91,000 more than salespeople selected under the old system .
There has also been significantly lower staff turnover among the group chosen for their emotional intelligence .
So , what exactly is emotional intelligence , and what can you do to improve yours ?
What Is Emotional Intelligence ?
We all have different personalities , different wants and needs , and different ways of showing our emotions .
Navigating through this all takes tact and cleverness – especially if we hope to succeed in life .
This is where emotional intelligence becomes important .
Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize your emotions , understand what they 're telling you , and realize how your emotions affect people around you .
It also involves your perception of others : when you understand how they feel , this allows you to manage relationships more effectively .

People with high emotional intelligence are usually successful in most things they do .
Why ?
Because they 're the ones that others want on their team .
When people with high emotional intelligence send an email , it gets answered .
When they need help , they get it .
Because they make others feel good , they go through life much more easily than people who are easily angered or upset .
Characteristics of Emotional Intelligence
In his book titled " Emotional Intelligence - Why It Can Matter More Than IQ " 1995 , Daniel Goleman , an American psychologist , developed a framework of five elements that define emotional intelligence :
Self - Awareness – People with high emotional intelligence are usually very self - aware .
They understand their emotions , and because of this , they do n't let their feelings rule them .
They 're confident – because they trust their intuition and do n't let their emotions get out of control .
They 're also willing to take an honest look at themselves .
They know their strengths and weaknesses , and they work on these areas so they can perform better .
Many people believe that this self - awareness is the most important part of emotional intelligence .
Self - Regulation –
This is the ability to control emotions and impulses .
People who self - regulate typically do n't allow themselves to become too angry or jealous , and they do n't make impulsive , careless decisions .
They think before they act .
Characteristics of self - regulation are thoughtfulness , comfort with change , integrity , and the ability to say no .
Motivation – People with a high degree of emotional intelligence are usually motivated .
They 're willing to defer immediate results for long - term success .
They 're highly productive , love a challenge , and are very effective in whatever they do .
Empathy –
This is perhaps the second - most important element of emotional intelligence .
Empathy is the ability to identify with and understand the wants , needs , and viewpoints of those around you .
People with empathy are good at recognizing the feelings of others , even when those feelings may not be obvious .
As a result , empathetic people are usually excellent at managing relationships , listening , and relating to others .
They avoid stereotyping and judging too quickly , and they live their lives in a very open , honest way .
Social Skills –
It 's usually easy to talk to and like people with good social skills , another sign of high emotional intelligence .
Those with strong social skills are typically team players .
Rather than focus on their own success first , they help others develop and shine .
They can manage disputes , are excellent communicators , and are masters at building and maintaining relationships .

As you 've probably determined , emotional intelligence can be a key to success in your life – especially in your career .
The ability to manage people and relationships is very important in all leaders , so developing and using your emotional intelligence can be a good way to show others the leader inside of you .
How to Improve Your Emotional Intelligence
The good news is that emotional intelligence can be learned and developed .
As well as working on your skills in the five areas above , use these strategies :
Observe how you react to people .
Do you rush to judgment before you know all of the facts ?
Do you stereotype ?
Look honestly at how you think and interact with other people .
Try to put yourself in their place , and be more open and accepting of their perspectives and needs .
, and be more open and accepting of their perspectives and needs .
Look at your work environment .
Do you seek attention for your accomplishments ?
Humility can be a wonderful quality , and it does n't mean that you 're shy or lack self - confidence .
When you practice humility , you say that you know what you did , and you can be quietly confident about it .
Give others a chance to shine – put the focus on them , and do n't worry too much about getting praise for yourself .
Do a self - evaluation .

Financial speculation ’s latest victims : US community college students
By Charles Bogle
11 June 2008
Some of the major banks in the US have decided to either completely cease or cut back their loans to community college students as well as some attending less prestigious four - year colleges .
This reduction in student lending has been based on profit considerations rather than the needs of the 46 percent of all US undergraduates who attend community colleges .
It takes place amidst increasing economic distress and calls for community colleges to play a greater role in preparing young people and laid off workers for the job market , underscoring the fact that everything , even education , is fair game for financial speculation .
The credit crisis has made raising money more difficult for lenders .
In order to maintain profit margins , Citibank — which has stopped making loans to students at all California community colleges — JP Morgan , Chase , PNC , and SunTrust have begun either dropping loans to community college students altogether or selectively dropping loans at certain colleges .
Meanwhile , these same banks continue to provide federally backed loans to students at the nation ’s leading universities .
The banks are making no attempt to disguise the motives behind their actions .
In a June 2 New York Times article , entitled “ Student Loans Start to Bypass 2 - Year Colleges , ” Mark C. Rogers , a spokesman for Citibank , said the bank “ temporarily suspended lending at schools which tend to have loans with lower balances and shorter periods over which we earn interest . ”
According to the article , banks say , “ their decisions are based on an analysis of which colleges have higher default rates , low numbers of borrowers and small loan amounts that make the business less profitable . ”
On the other hand , banks are continuing to loan money to students at the more elite universities , saying these loans are bigger , more profitable and less risky because graduates can be expected to earn more .
Tuition and loans are indeed lower at community colleges , because their original mission was to provide wide access to higher education , including those who do not have the money to begin their studies at four - year colleges and universities .
The actions by the big banks will further undermine the community college system and throw more obstacles in the path of working class youth seeking a college education .
The decision to cut off or reduce lending could not have come at a more inopportune time .
The existence of recession or near - recession conditions throughout the US has decreased tax revenues to state governments , resulting in a severe tightening of state funding to colleges and universities .
Lacking the sizeable endowments and federal research grants of four - year schools , community colleges have resorted to currying the favor of businesses and other private sources for facilities and other big - ticket items , which often results in renting out buildings for office space and conferences and making curriculum decisions driven by the needs of local businesses .
Privatization of student services , e.g. , food , security , and day care , has also become common .
For the majority of community college students these changes often mean higher meal prices ( which can mean skipping meals all together ) , security services that treat them as if they were potential criminals , and more expensive and less user - friendly day care ( 17 percent of community college students are , according to the American Association of Community Colleges , single parents ) .
This factor alone can determine whether or not someone can attend college .
President Bush and both of the presumptive nominees for the 2008 presidential elections have called for greater access to higher education , and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm has proposed that all Michigan students earn at least an Associates Degree ( the highest degree awarded by community colleges ) .
Such proposals , however , are little more than rhetoric since financing an education is becoming out of reach for more and more working class students .
In addition to the increasing number of “ traditional ” students age 21 and under attending community colleges due to skyrocketing tuition rates at four - year institutions , community colleges are attracting older students .
Fifty - eight percent of the community college student population is 22 years old or older , including those seeking job retraining or to meet terms of buyout agreements with auto manufacturers .
How will these students , especially the older students who have either never attended college or have been away from the college environment for a long period of time , perform without the support services necessary for their success ?
How long will they be able to attend college , or even attempt college at all , without the necessary funds ?
For example , federal Pell Grants — need - based , direct grants — are capped at $ 4,050 and are only awarded to 34 percent of low - income students attending community colleges .
Further , the money does n’t generally reach students until some time after the semester starts .
One Michigan community college administrator told this reporter that this delay results in prospective students not being able to sign up for classes on time and creates a further barrier to those already intimidated by the idea of college .
A secret deal being negotiated in Baghdad would perpetuate the American military occupation of Iraq indefinitely , regardless of the outcome of the US presidential election in November .
The terms of the impending deal , details of which have been leaked to The Independent , are likely to have an explosive political effect in Iraq .
Iraqi officials fear that the accord , under which US troops would occupy permanent bases , conduct military operations , arrest Iraqis and enjoy immunity from Iraqi law , will destabilise Iraq 's position in the Middle East and lay the basis for unending conflict in their country .
But the accord also threatens to provoke a political crisis in the US .
President Bush wants to push it through by the end of next month so he can declare a military victory and claim his 2003 invasion has been vindicated .
But by perpetuating the US presence in Iraq , the long - term settlement would undercut pledges by the Democratic presidential nominee , Barack Obama , to withdraw US troops if he is elected president in November .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The timing of the agreement would also boost the Republican candidate , John McCain , who has claimed the United States is on the verge of victory in Iraq – a victory that he says Mr Obama would throw away by a premature military withdrawal .
America currently has 151,000 troops in Iraq and , even after projected withdrawals next month , troop levels will stand at more than 142,000 – 10 000 more than when the military " surge " began in January 2007 .
Under the terms of the new treaty , the Americans would retain the long - term use of more than 50 bases in Iraq .
American negotiators are also demanding immunity from Iraqi law for US troops and contractors , and a free hand to carry out arrests and conduct military activities in Iraq without consulting the Baghdad government .
The precise nature of the American demands has been kept secret until now .
The leaks are certain to generate an angry backlash in Iraq .
" It is a terrible breach of our sovereignty , " said one Iraqi politician , adding that if the security deal was signed it would delegitimise the government in Baghdad which will be seen as an American pawn .
The US has repeatedly denied it wants permanent bases in Iraq but one Iraqi source said : " This is just a tactical subterfuge . "
Washington also wants control of Iraqi airspace below 29,000ft and the right to pursue its " war on terror " in Iraq , giving it the authority to arrest anybody it wants and to launch military campaigns without consultation .
Mr Bush is determined to force the Iraqi government to sign the so - called " strategic alliance " without modifications , by the end of next month .
But it is already being condemned by the Iranians and many Arabs as a continuing American attempt to dominate the region .
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the powerful and usually moderate Iranian leader , said yesterday that such a deal would create " a permanent occupation " .
He added : " The essence of this agreement is to turn the Iraqis into slaves of the Americans . "
Iraq 's Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , is believed to be personally opposed to the terms of the new pact but feels his coalition government cannot stay in power without US backing .
The deal also risks exacerbating the proxy war being fought between Iran and the United States over who should be more influential in Iraq .
Although Iraqi ministers have said they will reject any agreement limiting Iraqi sovereignty , political observers in Baghdad suspect they will sign in the end and simply want to establish their credentials as defenders of Iraqi independence by a show of defiance now .
The one Iraqi with the authority to stop deal is the majority Shia spiritual leader , Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani .
In 2003 , he forced the US to agree to a referendum on the new Iraqi constitution and the election of a parliament .
But he is said to believe that loss of US support would drastically weaken the Iraqi Shia , who won a majority in parliament in elections in 2005 .
The US is adamantly against the new security agreement being put to a referendum in Iraq , suspecting that it would be voted down .
The influential Shia cleric Muqtada al - Sadr has called on his followers to demonstrate every Friday against the impending agreement on the grounds that it compromises Iraqi independence .
The Iraqi government wants to delay the actual signing of the agreement but the office of Vice - President Dick Cheney has been trying to force it through .
The US ambassador in Baghdad , Ryan Crocker , has spent weeks trying to secure the accord .
The signature of a security agreement , and a parallel deal providing a legal basis for keeping US troops in Iraq , is unlikely to be accepted by most Iraqis .
But the Kurds , who make up a fifth of the population , will probably favour a continuing American presence , as will Sunni Arab political leaders who want US forces to dilute the power of the Shia .
The Sunni Arab community , which has broadly supported a guerrilla war against US occupation , is likely to be split .

( See DISCOVER 's earlier coverage of " Anything Into Oil " here and here .
See the follow - up article here . )
The smell is a mélange of midsummer corpse with fried - liver overtones and a distinct fecal note .
It comes from the worst stuff in the world — turkey slaughterhouse waste .
Rotting heads , gnarled feet , slimy intestines , and lungs swollen with putrid gases have been trucked here from a local Butterball packager and dumped into an 80 - foot - long hopper with a sickening glorp .
In about 20 minutes , the awful mess disappears into the workings of the thermal conversion process plant in Carthage , Missouri .
Two hours later a much cleaner truck — an oil carrier — pulls up to the other end of the plant , and the driver attaches a hose to the truck 's intake valve .
One hundred fifty barrels of fuel oil , worth $ 12,600 wholesale , gush into the truck , headed for an oil company that will blend it with heavier fossil - fuel oils to upgrade the stock .
Three tanker trucks arrive here on peak production days , loading up with 500 barrels of oil made from 270 tons of turkey guts and 20 tons of pig fat .
Most of what cannot be converted into fuel oil becomes high - grade fertilizer ; the rest is water clean enough to discharge into a municipal wastewater system .
For Brian Appel — and , maybe , for an energy - hungry world — it 's a dream come true , better than turning straw into gold .
The thermal conversion process can take material more plentiful and troublesome than straw — slaughterhouse waste , municipal sewage , old tires , mixed plastics , virtually all the wretched detritus of modern life — and make it something the world needs much more than gold : high - quality oil .
Appel , chairman and CEO of Changing World Technologies , has prodded , pushed , and sometimes bulldozed his way toward this goal for nearly a decade , and his joy is almost palpable .
" This is a real plant , " he says , grinning broadly .
He nods at the $ 42 million mass of tanks , pipes , pumps , grinders , boilers , and catwalks inside a corrugated steel building .
The plant is perched 100 yards from ConAgra Foods ' Butterball plant , where 35,000 turkeys are butchered daily , surrendering their viscera to Appel 's operation .
The pig fat comes from four other midwestern ConAgra slaughterhouses .
" To anybody who thinks this can't work on an industrial scale , I say , ' Come here and look . '
This is the first commercial biorefinery in the world that can make oil from a variety of waste streams . "

Still , Appel looks wearier than he did when Discover broke the news about his company 's technology .
Back then , when the process was still experimental , Appel predicted that the Carthage plant would crank out oil for about $ 15 a barrel and rack up profits from day one .
But the plant was delayed by construction problems , and federal subsidies were postponed .
After it started up , a foul odor angered town residents , leading to a temporary shutdown in December 2005 .
Production costs turned out to be $ 80 per barrel , meaning that for most of the plant 's working life Appel has lost about $ 40 per barrel .
As recently as last April , he feared the whole operation might implode .
" There have definitely been growing pains , " he says .
" We have made mistakes .
We were too aggressive in our earlier projections . "
But now , after more than $ 100 million in private funding and $ 17 million in government grants , several hurdles have tumbled .
The Carthage plant has been optimized and is expected to turn a small profit .
A tax credit has leveled the playing field with other renewable fuels like biodiesel and ethanol .
Appel is confident that new ozone scrubbers and other equipment will abate the odors .
State officials are warily optimistic .
" We are not hoping to shut them down [ permanently ] and take away jobs , " says Connie Patterson , spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources .
" We have given them a window of opportunity to solve the problem . "
Others are optimistic too .
" I 'm impressed , " says Gabriel Miller , a New York University chemistry professor and a consultant to KeySpan Corporation , a gas and electric utility that serves New York .
" The fuel that comes out is better than crude , and you do n't need a refinery to use it .
I think they can bring it deep into commercialization . "
Miller has recommended that KeySpan burn the oil in its generators .
Appel , a former Hofstra University basketball star , leans his 6 - foot - 5 - inch frame against a counter in the company 's lab and rubs his face .
He says he is confident that the process can indeed solve thorny waste problems , supplement oil supplies , become an odor - free " good neighbor , " and at last , become immensely lucrative .
The catch ?
It may not happen in the United States .

Left to right :
An on - site lab checks oil and fertilizer quality a dozen times daily ; some of the plant 's 45 workers stroll under oil - bearing pipes ; daily maintenance logs are kept on a whiteboard ; ( Below ) a truck is weighed before dumping turkey leftovers ; the scrubber system 's exhaust stack , wrapped in a steel framework , looms over the plant .
Appel has shepherded development of the thermal conversion process ( previously known as the thermal depolymerization process ; Appel changed the unwieldy moniker last year ) since 1997 , building on organic - solids - into - oil research stretching back nearly a century .
By 1999 he had lined up investors , hired an engineering staff , and had a pilot plant chewing through seven tons of waste daily in a Philadelphia industrial yard .
Early in 2003 , company officials predicted their first industrial - size plant would be steaming ahead 24/7 in Carthage by that summer .
As it turned out , continuous production did not start until February 2005 .
Which is surprising because at first blush , the thermal conversion process seems straightforward .
The first thing a visitor sees when he steps into the loading bay is a fat pressurized pipe , which pushes the guts from the receiving hopper into a brawny grinder that chews them into pea-size bits .
Dry feedstocks like tires and plastics need additional water at this stage , but offal is wet enough .
A first - stage reactor breaks down the stuff with heat and pressure , after which the pressure rapidly drops , flashing off excess water and minerals .
In turkeys , the minerals come mostly from bones , and these are shunted to a storage bin to be sold later as a high - calcium powdered fertilizer .
The remaining concentrated organic soup then pours into a second reaction tank —
Appel says the two - stage nature of the process distinguishes it from dozens of failed single - stage waste - to - oil schemes devised over the last century — where it is heated to 500 degrees Fahrenheit and pressurized to 600 pounds per square inch .
In 20 minutes , the process replicates what the deep earth does to dead plants and animals over centuries , chopping long , complex molecular chains of hydrogen and carbon into short - chain molecules .
Next , the pressure and temperature drop , and the soup swirls through a centrifuge that separates any remaining water from the oil .
The water , which in the case of slaughterhouse waste is laden with nitrogen and amino acids , is stored to be sold as a potent liquid fertilizer ( see " Garden Delights , " next page ) .
Meanwhile , the oil goes to the storage tank to await the next truck .
The whole process is efficient , says Terry Adams , the company 's chief technology officer :
Only 15 percent of the potential energy in the feedstock is used to power the operation ; 85 percent is embodied in the output of oil and other products .
The oil itself meets specification D396 , a type widely used to power electrical utility generators .
The oil can be sold to utilities as is , further distilled into vehicle - grade diesel and gasoline , or , via a steam process , made into hydrogen .
Until last year , Appel distilled his output on - site , but he has since decided to sell the oil directly to utilities and refineries .
" We just do n't make enough volume to make operating our own refinery viable , " he says .
So why has success been so long coming ?
Basically , Appel says , everything has been more complex and expensive than anyone guessed .
First , the conversion process needed tweaking .
Each variable — temperature , pressure , volume , tank - residence time — needs to precisely match the feedstock , which proves to be no mean feat on an industrial scale .
" The really difficult thing has been finding the sweet spot in the process parameters , " says Appel .
" This is n't a laboratory .
We have to respond to the real world of varying supply .
If I get two truckloads in a row of just feathers , I need to deal with that high - protein peak .
Or if I get too much blood at once , the result is too much water . "
The solution has been to blend disparate truckloads of stock in a holding tank , making what enters the process relatively consistent .
" Fat , fiber , protein , moisture , ash — getting those right , that 's our mantra , " says Jim Freiss , vice president of engineering .
" Now we are able to nail the same quality every day . "
Freiss says he and fellow engineers Terry Adams and William Lange " have learned so much that I am very confident we can build a second plant that 's optimized from the start . "
Chemistry was not the only challenge .
Since 2004 , the federal government has subsidized biodiesel , usually made from soybeans , at $ 1 a gallon .
It gave Appel zero for the fuel he produced from turkey guts .
" It was hard to believe that a competitor could walk away with a dollar a gallon while we were excluded , " Appel says .
In August that hole was plugged : The fuel Appel makes , known officially as renewable diesel , received a subsidy of $ 1 per gallon from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which took effect in January .
That boosted the company 's income by $ 42 a barrel , allowing a slim profit of $ 4 a barrel .
Appel offers no apologies for needing government largesse to make money .
" All oil , even fossil - fuel oil , gets government subsidies in the form of tax breaks and other incentives , " he says , citing a 1998 study by the International Center for Technology Assessment showing that unsubsidized conventional gasoline would cost consumers $ 15 a gallon .
" Before we got this , I had the only oil in the world that did n't get a subsidy . "
Another hurdle : Within months after opening in February 2005 , the plant smelled , and by August it had been hit by six notices of emissions violations by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources .
But some in the town , which has other large food processing operations , contend the new plant was unfairly singled out .
" The thing was , any odor at all was blamed on them , " says Mayor Kenneth Johnson .
In any case , Renewable Environmental Solutions , the subsidiary of Changing World Technologies that runs the Carthage plant , spent $ 2 million on biofilters , scrubbers , and other odor stoppers .
Between July and late September complaints had dwindled from 23 to 5 a week , says Mark Rader , an environmental specialist with the department 's southwest regional office .
Nonetheless , the Department of Natural Resources issued a temporary shutdown order for the plant in December , prompting Appel and his colleagues to install more ozone scrubbers .
But even critics say the persistence of a smell does not invalidate the technology .
The plant is just four blocks from downtown Carthage and two blocks from residences .
Building future plants in less dense areas would " make more sense , " says Department of Natural Resources spokesperson Connie Patterson .
The thermal conversion process is probably the only practical large - scale method of dismantling prions , the proteins that cause mad cow disease .
Although the process has never been specifically used to destroy prions , Jefferson Tester , a professor of chemical engineering at MIT , says he 's confident that the proteins would be ripped apart and rendered harmless by such extreme temperatures and pressures .
Mad cow disease is thought to spread via the common American practice of feeding rendered animal parts back to animals .
Appel assumed that the United States , like most modern nations , would ban the practice , creating more demand for his machinery to process leftover animal parts .
In 1997 the government did ban feeding beef parts to beef cattle , but turkey and chicken cannibalism are still legal .
" We thought we would get $ 24 a ton for taking the waste , " says Appel .
" Instead , we are paying $ 30 a ton . "
That alone raises his production costs about $ 22 a barrel .
Which brings us to why Appel and his technology are likely to move to Europe .
As the United States has crawled toward making its food supply safer , Europe has sprinted , eager to squelch mad cow disease as well as to stanch global warming and promote renewable energy .
The result is a cornucopia of incentives for thermal conversion .
Last summer Appel gave presentations to government officials and private investors throughout Europe , and the company is planning projects in Wales , Ireland , England , and Germany .
Europeans are making the pilgrimage to the Carthage plant .
In May Renewable Environmental Solutions ran 360 tons of beef waste through the Carthage plant for a visiting delegation from Irish Food Processors , the biggest beef operation in the British Isles .
The Irish newspaper Sunday Tribune wrote that CEO Larry Goodman " is understood to be planning a biofuel facility . . . and hopes to have it built by next year . "
The transatlantic lovefest is no wonder .
In Ireland , plant operators would get an astronomical $ 50 per ton to haul slaughterhouse waste away , another $ 30 per ton in carbon dioxide emissions - reduction credits , a guaranteed price of up to $ 92 per barrel , and a 20 - year price guarantee .
" In a 500 - ton - per - day plant , our production costs would be under $ 30 a barrel , and we could sell for about $ 100 a barrel , " Appel says .
" It 's just amazing . "
Only three states — California , Pennsylvania , and Virginia — have incentives that could make the process financially worthwhile for Appel .
But he is encouraged by a study commissioned by an automakers ' consortium showing that the thermal conversion process could be a solution to one of America 's most vexing solid waste problems : the unholy mix of plastics and other leftovers from automobile metals recycling ( see " Junkyard Oil , " below ) .
" If we do build a plant for that , it will likely be based in Michigan , " Appel says .
Until recently , Appel was developing a " leave - behind strategy for us as a company and planning to set up in Europe only . "
Now he believes there will be some plants built in the United States as well .
" I am just so happy to be making oil , " he says .
" I want to deploy this technology everywhere . "

Junkyard Oil
American recyclers deftly pluck nearly all the metal from the 15 million cars junked each year , but up to 4.5 million tons of residual debris goes straight to landfills .
Known as auto shredder residue , it is a virtually unrecyclable mix of at least 36 kinds of plastic , along with treated fabrics , rubber , and nylon .
Last May representatives of USCAR — a research consortium made up of DaimlerChrysler , Ford , and General Motors — along with the Argonne National Laboratory and the American Plastics Council arranged a test in which Changing World Technologies ran 3,000 pounds of the awful stuff through its Philadelphia pilot plant .
" The process is brilliant , " says Candace Wheeler , a GM research scientist .
" There are substances of concern in shredder residue such as PCBs , and traditional incineration of chlorinated plastics can make dioxins . "
But , she says , the preliminary test results indicate that the hydrolysis at the heart of the thermal conversion process breaks down the PCBs and converts the chlorine into hydrochloric acid .
" No PCBs .
No dioxins .
No emissions , " says
Wheeler , noting that the principal output of the process was a " light oil " that could be used at an electric power generation plant .
" It looks good from all perspectives , " she says .
" We think it has great potential . "

Garden Delights
Every organic gardener knows the pang of watching a neighbor blithely squirt chemical fertilizer on his vegetable garden .
Sure , the schlub has no respect for nature 's elegant cycles , but look at those zucchini !
Such envy could soon become history .
Along with oil , the thermal conversion process cranks out a liquid fertilizer that " works a great deal like some of the instant - gratification fertilizers out there , " says Jim Freiss , vice president of engineering for Changing World Technologies .
Featuring 9 percent nitrogen , 1 percent phosphorus , 2 percent potash , and 19 amino acids , it is , in essence , " an organic Miracle - Gro , " he says .
" In the organic industry , these kinds of nutrient concentrations are unheard - of .
The best that 's out there is on the order of 6 percent nitrogen . "
Tests on tomato and pepper plants conducted by Joseph Kloepper , professor of plant pathology at Auburn University in Alabama , confirmed the fertilizer 's potency .
" In my experience , " he wrote in a summary paper , " it is rare to find a biological product that demonstrates such a consistent promotion of overall plant growth and root growth on two crops in two different field soils . "
Fertilizer - industry officials are excited as well .
" Because it has been through high temperatures , there is no coliform bacteria or any of the other problems often associated with organic fertilizers such as manures , " says Raj Mehta , president of Organica Biotech , a manufacturer of nonsynthetic fertilizers and pesticides .
" I 'm convinced there will be a large market for this . "

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Britain has granted asylum to Mehdi Kazemi , a gay Iranian student who faced deportation from the United Kingdom and feared execution in Iran for being homosexual , officials confirmed Tuesday .
Mehdi Kazemi feared persecution if he had to return to Iran .
" We keep cases under review where circumstances have changed , and it has been decided that Mr. Kazemi should be granted leave to remain in the UK based on the particular facts of this case , " Britain 's Home Office said in a written statement quoting an unnamed UK Border Agency spokesman .
Kazemi's uncle , known as Saeed , says his teenage nephew received an " unconditional " letter of asylum from the Home Office on Monday .
Kazemi , 19 , moved to London to study English in 2004 but later discovered that his boyfriend had been arrested by Iranian police , charged with sodomy and hanged .
Fearing the same fate , he applied for asylum in Britain but was denied in 2007 .
The office of Simon Hughes , the member of parliament who took up Kazemi 's cause , said the Home Office has granted Kazemi leave for five years .
" Like Mehdi and his family in Britain , I am delighted by the Home Office decision that my constituent , Mehdi Kazemi , can now stay in this country and will not be sent back to Iran , " Hughes said in a written statement .
" As I have argued over the last 18 months , the Home Office should not send gay and lesbian people back to countries where they will be at risk of persecution , torture or worse , " he said .
Hughes was expected to meet with Kazemi late Tuesday .
Peter Tatchell , of the London - based gay rights activist group OutRage , said the decision " is a victory of sorts in that Mehdi has gotten only a temporary leave to remain .
At the end of five years , he will have to go through the whole appeal process again . "
He added , " Mehdi would n't have got leave to remain if there had n't been massive publicity to his case .
There are many other gay and lesbian Iranian asylum - seekers that are scheduled for deportation to Iran . "

Solving a Logic Problem with Coq
I ’ve been playing around with the Coq proof assistant tool over the weekend .
Here ’s an interesting problem and its solution proven with Coq .
I am by no means an expert in this .
I ’ve used Coq for less than 6 hours at this point .
There are a lot of nicer tutorials out there , including the one on the Coq web site .
But this is an interesting motivating example , and I ’m writing to share my experiences .
The puzzle I ’ll solve here comes from John Pratt ’s page .
A lot of supposed “ logic puzzle ” sites are n’t really logic puzzles at all , but just plays on words ; but that one is okay .
Here ’s the puzzle :
When asked her 3 children ’s ages , Mrs. Muddled said that Alice is the youngest unless Bill is , and that if Carl is n’t the youngest then Alice is the oldest .
Who is the oldest and who is the youngest ?
The first step is to start up Coq .
In my case I ’ve generally used CoqIde , which is a simple apt - get in Ubuntu .
However , for this blog post I ’ll use the command - line coq - interface in hopes of more portability .
Let ’s tell Coq a few of the basics of the problem , such as that there ’s a domain of discourse , and it has three children in it named Alice , Bill , and Carl .
Section Ages . Variable Child : Set. Variable Alice : Child .
Variable Bill : Child .
Variable Carl : Child .
Variable Youngest : Child -> Prop. Variable Oldest : Child ->
Prop .
The last two lines declare unary predicates for the domain of discourse , indicating whether a child is the youngest or the oldest .
Unfortunately , Coq does n’t know some things that we ’re assuming here .
One such fact is that the three children are different from each other .
So let ’s tell it that .
Hypothesis Diff1 : Alice <> Carl . Hypothesis Diff2 : Bill <> Carl . Hypothesis Diff3 : Alice <> Bill .
Each of these hypotheses has a name , so that we can refer to it in the proof later .
Next , there ’s some implicit meaning in the superlative words “ youngest ” and “ oldest ” .
Hypothesis Superlative1 : forall A B , ( A <> B ) -> Youngest A -> ~ Youngest B. Hypothesis Superlative2 : forall A B , ( A <> B ) -> Oldest A -> ~ Oldest B .
In other words , you ca n’t have two different children who are both the youngest or the oldest .
Even twins are usually born a few minutes apart !
Finally , “ youngest ” and “ oldest ” are opposites .
Since there is more than one child , no one can be both .
Hypothesis Antonym1 : forall A , Oldest A -> ~ Youngest A. Hypothesis Antonym2 : forall A , Youngest A -> ~ Oldest A .
Having now explained the terminology to Coq , we may now enter the information given by Mrs. Muddled in the problem .
Hypothesis Given1 : ~ Youngest Alice -> Youngest Bill .
Hypothesis Given2 : ~ Youngest Carl -> Oldest Alice .
Now that Coq understands the premises , we need to tell it what we are proving .
That requires solving the puzzle .
Simple enough : Alice is the youngest unless Bill is , which means Carl ca n’t be the youngest .
But if Carl is not the youngest , then Alice is the oldest , which leaves Bill as the youngest .
So the youngest is Bill , the middle child is Carl , and the oldest is Alice .
Let ’s tell Coq that .
Goal Oldest Alice /\ Youngest Bill .
And Coq responds by listing the goal , and all the hypotheses we may use to prove it :
1 subgoal Child : Set Alice : Child Bill : Child Carl : Child Youngest : Child -> Prop Oldest : Child -> Prop Diff1 : Alice <> Carl Diff2 : Bill <> Carl Diff3 : Alice <> Bill Superlative1 : forall A B : Child , A <> B -> Youngest A -> ~ Youngest B Superlative2 : forall A B : Child , A <> B -> Oldest A -> ~ Oldest B Antonym1 : forall A : Child , Oldest A -> ~ Youngest A Antonym2 : forall A : Child , Youngest A -> ~ Oldest A Given1 : ~ Youngest Alice -> Youngest Bill Given2 : ~ Youngest Carl -> Oldest Alice ============================
Oldest Alice /\ Youngest Bill
Fair enough .
The proof wizard does n’t know how to solve this , so we ’ll need to take it on by hand .
To prove a conjunction , we can individually prove each side .
Coq calls this the “ split ” tactic .
split .
And Coq responds :
2 subgoals Child : Set Alice : Child Bill : Child Carl : Child Youngest : Child -> Prop Oldest : Child -> Prop Diff1 : Alice <> Carl Diff2 : Bill <> Carl Diff3 : Alice <> Bill Superlative1 : forall A B : Child , A <> B -> Youngest A -> ~ Youngest B Superlative2 : forall A B : Child , A <> B -> Oldest A -> ~ Oldest B Antonym1 : forall A : Child , Oldest A -> ~ Youngest A Antonym2 : forall A : Child , Youngest A -> ~ Oldest A Given1 : ~ Youngest Alice -> Youngest Bill Given2 : ~ Youngest Carl ->
Oldest Alice ============================
Oldest Alice subgoal 2 is : Youngest Bill
In other words , we ’re currently working on proving Oldest Alice , but once we finish that , we ’ll need to prove Youngest Bill .
Well , there ’s only one good way to conclude Oldest Alice , and that ’s to show that Carl is not the youngest .
So let ’s prove the current subgoal by applying Given2 .
apply Given2 .
I ’ll stop quoting the entirety of Coq ’s responses , but here ’s the important part :
============================
~ Youngest Carl
So how do we know that Carl is not the youngest ?
Well , it ’s because Bill is the youngest .
That ’s rule Superlative1 , but we ’ll also have to tell Coq to use Bill as the other child .
apply Superlative1 with Bill .
And Coq responds :
============================
Bill <>
Carl subgoal 2 is : Youngest Bill
So we need to prove that Bill is not Carl , and then that Bill is the youngest .
( That Bill is the youngest is also subgoal 3 left over from splitting the conjunction , a fact that we ’ll think about shortly . )
For now , it ’s easy to prove that Bill is not Carl , because that was one of our hypotheses .
apply Diff2 .
And Coq responds :
============================
Youngest Bill
Now it remains only to prove that Bill is the youngest .
The way to go about that is to apply the first given .
apply Given1 .
And Coq responds :
============================
~ Youngest Alice
This is the tricky part .
The reason that Alice is not the youngest is that if she were the youngest , then Carl would not be the youngest , but then the second given statement would lead us to conclude that Alice is the oldest , which is a contradiction .
Proof by contradiction , though , is generally a technique valid only in classical logic , not in the constructive logic that Coq typically uses .
It turns out we wo n’t need to resort to classical logic for this theorem , but just to make things easier in our first pass we ’ll go ahead and use it .
This is one statement in Coq .
Require Import Classical .
So now having classical logic at our disposal , we can go about proving that Alice is not the youngest by applying Peirce ’s law .
apply Peirce .
And Coq ’s response :
============================ (~ Youngest Alice -> False ) -> ~ Youngest Alice
We ’ll split up the implication by giving a name to the hypothesis and then proving the conclusion .
This tactic is called “ intro ” .
intro H .
Coq responds :
H : ~ Youngest Alice ->
False ============================
~ Youngest Alice
Note that the new hypothesis is the double - negation of “ Alice is the youngest . ”
In classical logic , which we ’re now using , that ’s the same as Alice being the youngest , so we ’ve essentially used Peirce ’s law to start the proof by contradiction .
Now we ’ll go backward through the contradiction argument given above .
First ,
Alice ca n’t be the youngest because she ’s the oldest .
She ’s the oldest because Carl is not the youngest .
Carl is not the youngest because we ’ve assumed ( to obtain the contradiction ) that Alice is the youngest .
apply Antonym1. apply Given2. apply Superlative1 with Alice . apply Diff1 .
And here ’s where we are , according to Coq .
H : ~ Youngest Alice ->
False ============================
Youngest Alice
This is just a double negation : a rule from the Classical package that goes by the name NNPP .
Once we double - negate the conclusion , it will look slightly different from the hypothesis H , but they will actually mean the same thing .
( ~A is just shorthand for A -> False ) .
apply NNPP .
exact H .
Coq says :
============================
Youngest Bill
So we ’ve proven the left half of the conjunction : that Alice is the oldest .
We now need to prove the right half .
But wait !
We already did that , as the second step to proving the left half .
For now , we ’ll just copy and paste the last part of the earlier proof .
apply Given1. apply Peirce . intro H. apply Antonym1. apply Given2. apply Superlative1 with Alice . apply Diff1. apply NNPP .
exact H .
and Coq says :
Proof completed .
Finally , we get to say :
Qed .
Ah , we ’re done .
But it turns out we can improve the proof a little by using a few more Coq features : specifically , by proving some lemmas ( or lemmata , if your prefer ) , and by eliminating the use of classical logic ( since this happens to be a constructively valid statement ; not all classically true statements will be , though ) .
First , although Peirce ’s law ( ( ~P -> P ) -> P ) is not true in constructive logic , but we can prove ( P -> ~P ) -> ~P .
Let ’s do so , by introducing a lemma , and then by using the automatic prover .
Lemma NPeirce : forall P : Prop , ( P -> ~P ) -> ~P. auto .
Qed .
In this case , the automated theorem prover worked fine .
We could have proven the theorem by hand , as well ( by treating the ~P as P ->
False , using the intro tactic , applying the modus ponens rule , and then easily satisfying all of the hypotheses ) .
Using this , we can simplify our proof of Youngest Bill .
The process is the same , but instead of applying Peirce ’s law and the beginning and the double - negation at the end , we apply our new NPeirce lemma at the beginning , and we do n’t need double - negation at the end .
Lemma YoungBill : Youngest Bill . apply Given1. apply NPeirce . intro H. apply Antonym1. apply Given2. apply Superlative1 with Alice . apply Diff1. exact H. Qed .
Notice that I ’ve also defined this as a lemma .
That ’s because we needed to prove it twice in the earlier attempt .
May as well prove it once up front instead .
So now comes the final goal .
Goal Oldest Alice /\ Youngest Bill . split .
apply Given2. apply Superlative1 with Bill . apply Diff2. apply YoungBill. apply YoungBill .
Qed .
And we ’re done .
For reference , here ’s the entire proof as entered in CoqIde .

The intolerant monolithic Islamists are on the march , lashing out with fury at non-Islamic people and cultures .
This cult of violence and death spares neither the living nor the non-living heritage of humanity : wherever and whenever it can it commits culturecide - wiping out other people 's precious cultural treasures .
Not long ago , the Islamists ' destruction of the Buddha statues in Afghanistan shocked the world and exposed the savage nature of this cult of violence depravity .
Yet , much more destruction on a broad range is taking place in Iran under the direction of the Islamist theocrats .
The Islamist zealots ruling Iran for the past 30 years have undertaken a systematic campaign of endangering and destroying the cultural sites of pre-Islamic Iran , ignoring the numerous petitions and pleas of the Iranian people .
For one , blatantly rejecting the repeated appeals of individuals and organizations such as the International Committee to Save the Archeological Sites of Pasargad , the Islamic Republic proceeded with the construction of the Sivand Dam which went into operation on April 2007 by the order of the ruling Islamists ' point man , President Ahmadinejad .
What many experts have warned and feared has already come to pass .
The inevitable elevation of humidity from the Sivand Dam has given rise to massive invasion of Cyrus the Great Mausoleum by lichen and fungi .
Cracks have started to appear on the stonework of tomb of King Cyrus , humanity 's first author of the charter of human rights .
The building of the Sivand Dam by the Islamist government was launched under the pretext that it would be a boon for the farmers .
Impartial experts , including expert geologists from the University of Shiraz , have countered with evidence to the exact opposite outcome .
Farmers in the area had worked diligently for centuries and habilitated the originally salty soil .
Water from the new dam is bound to make it the farmers ' bane by returning the soil to salinity once again , experts warned .
In order to discredit those who protested against constructing the ruinous dam , the Islamic Republic 's Vice President Esfandiar Rahim Mashai , who ironically heads the state culture and heritage organization , has claimed that groups " opposing the Islamic Republic " are behind the protests .
Mr. Rahim - Mashai who was appointed as the director of ICHTHO after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was " elected " as the regime 's new president said in a press conference in March 2006 that he had never heard of the Sivand Dam or the Bolaghi Valley .
The Pasargad Heritage Foundation has filed a complaint against Mr. Mashai for a hearing on his intentional systematic endeavor to destroy ancient cultural treasures of the Iranian people .
The destructive effects of the Dam is also impacted the air quality of the area .
According to Amir - Teimur Khosravi , the Mayor of Pasargadae ,
" the level of humidity near the mausoleum of Cyrus the Great is so high that none of the Pasargadae 's residents have ever experienced it before .
There is constant flow of damp and humidity smells in the Pasargadae plains that are coming from Bolaghi Gorge .
In the Southwest section of the mausoleum , which is considered the entrance to the archaeological site , the subterranean waters have surfaced and caused cracks to appear on the stonework . "
Khosravi continued ,
" Pasargadae has always been renowned for its clean and pleasant weather , but now , as a result of high levels of humidity produced from [ the artificial lake behind ] the Sivand dam , the area suffers from a sultry condition . "
Referring to the gorge , " it is far from here , " said one of the government 's functionaries at the dam site , which is slowly filling up .
" There will be no damage . "
People in the provincial capital Shiraz -- renowned as being the capital of poets and beautiful roses , as well as for its imperial Persian ruins -- have a different opinion .
They say the project may increase humidity in the arid area near the city of Shiraz , which they believe could damage the limestone mausoleum of Cyrus the Great .
From its inception , the Islamic Republic has waged a systematic campaign of wiping out any and all cultural heritage and even joyous pre-Islamic festivals of the Iranian people : replacing Iranian 's traditional happy celebratory events such as Nowruz , Yalda , and many more with endless death - centered Islamic mourning .
The Islamists aim to obliterate the Persian antiquities as well as any vestiges of the pre-Islamic Iran .
They have put in charge inept puppets as archeology experts so that it would justify their terrorist action against Persian antiquities .
The illegitimate government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is a quisling foreign entity that has betrayed Iranian people , its tradition , its glorious pre-Islamic achievements , and is incessantly working against Iran 's national interest .
Iran , under the stranglehold and machinations of these parasites , has been transformed in less than three decades to the lead perpetrator of all that is abhorrent to humanity .
Although the Islamic Republic 's record speaks dismally for itself , there are numerous reasons for its relentless campaign of cultural genocide .
The Islamic regime 's decision to slowly destroy Cyrus the Great 's tomb is in part motivated by the realization that the people revere King Cyrus for the just laws he instituted as well as his emancipation of the Jews some 2500 years ago .
Hence , this benevolent king is despised by the Islamists for symbolizing what are traits truly Iranian and anathema to Islamic credo , as well as keeping the love of non-Islamic nationalism alive in the heart of the populace .
Under the guise of development , the Islamic Republic has launched a comprehensive program of obliterating any physical traces of Iran 's rich archeological sites .
A partial list of these acts is listed below .
* Sahand Dam in East Azerbaijan which will submerge the 6000 - year - old Kul Tepe site .
Archaeologists agree that over ten ancient sites in the region , some from the fifth millennium B.C. will be buried under the water , according to an official of the East Azerbaijan Province Cultural Heritage and Tourism Department .
* Alborz Dam in Mazandaran province , which caused irreversible damage to the cultural heritage of the eastern part of Mazandaran province .
* Karun Dam in Khuzestan province is submerging the ancient sites of the Izeh region .
* Mullah Sadra Dam to Drown 7000 Years of History .
" Mehr Ali Farsi is one of the most important archeological sites of Fars province .
Archeological excavations in this historical site could reveal many unknown facts about the pre-historic period of Fars province .
" Despite the fact that this historical site had been identified before the inundation of Mulla Sadra Dam , the authorities of the dam have neglected the necessity for carrying out excavations in this area and started the flooding of the dam in a very short time , " according to Azizollah Rezayi , head of archeology team in Mehr Ali Farsi historical site .
* Salman-e Farsi Dam was inundated in 2007 , without the CHTHO 's permission .
It flooded a 350 - hectare Sassanid city , which had been inhabited since the pre-Achaemenid era .
* Destruction of one of the biggest historical sites in the Chahar - Mahal Bakhtiari province by the Islamic Republic Ministry of Road and Transportation .
A local archaeologist who wished to remain anonymous for his safety said : " Israel should not be worried about the [ Islamic ] regime 's threat of wiping it off from the map ; it is we [ Iranians ] who should be worried , as the regime is determined to wipe us off of the map . "
He added " everyday this anti-Iranian regime is coming up with a new plot to destroy our heritage .
One day our heritage is being threatened by dam projects , the next it 's road constructions .
They claim these are development projects , but if this is the case why is our heritage being destroyed in the darkness of night and in secret -- and why do n't they sit down with the cultural authorities to find a solution to carry out their so - called development projects , and at the same time safeguard our national heritage ? "
* 45,000 years old Paleolithic site of Kaftarkhun , located in Iran 's Isfahan province , have been completely annihilated to build a horse racing course while the eastern parts of this ancient site have seen irreversible damage due to quarry blasting .
* 1000 - hectare area of a historical site belonging to Parthian dynastic era ( 248 BCE - 224CE ) in Khuzestan province has also fallen victim to developmental constructions of the Islamic regime 's Hamidieh Azad University in Hamidieh city .
* Tomb of Firuzan ( Abu - Lu'lu'ah ) in Kashan destroyed , in part to placate the Sunni Arabs .
This Persian hero killed the Islam 's third Caliph , Umar ibn al - Khattāb , avenging the death on thousands of Iranian by Omar 's Islamic aggressors .
The inanimate historical sites of the world are indeed living schools where invaluable lessons are held in their repositories .
Preserving , exploring and studying these sites tell a great deal about humanity 's past , its triumphs and defeat .
Destroying these sites , no matter where they are in the world is tantamount to the burning of libraries .
Only truly barbarians such as the bigoted Islamists fail to appreciate these treasures that belong to the entire human family .
It is the Islamists ' belief that any and all information , ideals and practices that fall outside of Islam are void and must be eliminated .
It is the imperative duty of all enlightened people to steadfastly counter the relentless monolithic Islamic culturcide taking place in Iran or wherever in the world the scourge of Islamism invades .
IN case you ’ve been packing the wood - paneled station wagon , the sheiks have spoken and here ’s what they ’ve said : the American road trip is dead .
I say , good riddance .
After all , who claimed the road trip had to be a great American rite of passage ?
Who claimed that the monotony of traveling thousands of miles at 80 miles per hour , hopped up on Big Macs and Cinnabons , led to enlightenment ?
Who said that breaking down in Big Bone , Ky. , with a car of screaming kids , or being attacked by locusts in Hays , Kan. , must be remembered as “ an adventure ” ?
And who claimed there was some poetic validity , some important American literary tradition based on guzzling gallon after gallon of unleaded petroleum with no care in the world for the environment ?
You want a road trip ?
Try Google Earth .
In the meantime , let me share a secret .
Our summer travel got downgraded from a road trip through Spain to a 15 - minute ferry ride to the coastal Maine island of Chebeague , where I ’m writing this .
My family and I have n’t been in a car all week .
We ’ve gone clamming and beachcombing ; we ’ve read books and played board games .
At night , the waves begin their gentle crashing , and the ocean becomes its own hypnotic country .
I ca n’t help but think of Emily Dickinson never leaving her house , how she saw multiplicity and wonder in a cobweb .
Maybe I ’ve discovered my own wonderland here .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama , who has come under attack by his presidential rivals for describing small - town voters as " bitter , " seems to be weathering the storm to this point as far as voters are concerned .
He maintains a 10 percentage point lead over Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination , 50 % to 40 % , according to the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
That 10 - point lead matches Obama 's best of the campaign , and even as the controversy has dominated the political airwaves , Obama 's support remained strong in tracking interviews conducted on Saturday and Sunday .
It is likely Clinton and Republican John McCain will continue to remind voters of the remarks , and the possibility remains that it could affect voters in the coming days , but so far they seem unaffected by the controversy .
Obama has now held a significant lead over Clinton in Democratic voters ' nomination preferences for the last eight days , averaging roughly an 8 - point lead , compared with the current 10 - point spread .
During this time , 50 % of Democratic voters have supported him on average , matching the latest figure for interviewing conducted April 11 - 13 .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
In the general election trial heat match up versus McCain , 46 % of registered voters prefer Obama , the same as in the past four days ' releases and equal to Obama 's high - water mark since Gallup began tracking general election preferences in March .
McCain is the choice of 44 % of registered voters , which is a percentage point better than in the prior three days ' releases .
The Clinton - McCain trial heat results are unchanged , with 46 % of registered voters favoring Clinton and 45 % McCain . -- Jeff Jones
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The Democratic nomination results are based on combined data from April 11 - 13 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 1,271 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
The general election results are based on combined data from April 9 - 13 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 4,415 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Full marks to those who keep a tight rein on their carbon footprint , but do n't relax just yet : water is the new carbon , and our engorged water footprints need to be scrutinised before the rivers really do run dry .
At the World Economic Forum in January , the UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , warned that water and food shortages would be the crises of 2008 .
Last week we watched the escalating food crisis reverberate around the globe .
Conflicts fuelled by water shortages may well be next , triggered by climate change , population growth and poor water management .
The phrase " water footprint " was coined to describe the embedded or " virtual " water in a food or industrial product – the real volume of water used to create that product .
It is difficult to avoid using products which have not been involved in a water - intensive process somewhere along the line , and the figures are staggering : it takes 1,760 litres to get one pint of milk out of a cow and into your fridge ; a kilogram of cheddar swallows up 5,000 litres .
There is also , of course , plenty of water embedded in everyday activities other than eating , such as washing , cooking and cleaning .
The average Brit splashes about 155 litres of water each day , compared with 20 litres for most people living in sub-Saharan Africa .
Water might flow freely from our taps , but our small island is not immune to global shortages .
Water is a limited commodity , and is becoming more expensive as its supply grows more difficult to guarantee .

How do we get through almost nine times more water each day than someone living in Africa ?
Thirsty Planet , a bottled water brand which donates part of its profits to the charity Pump Aid , challenged me to survive on 20 litres for 24 hours to find out .
I discovered pretty quickly that we waste the larger part of those 155 litres , by leaving the tap on while brushing our teeth , over - filling kettles ( this wastes electricity , too ) , luxuriating in hot baths filled to the brim , and running the dishwasher or washing machine half - empty .
These bad habits seemed easy to fix , though , and I was confident surviving on the 20 litres would prove a doddle .
My " preparatory techniques " ( you might call this cheating ) were to shower and wash my hair the evening before beginning the challenge , and to skip washing any clothes or dishes for the day .
When I wake up , I fill a measuring jug with one litre of water , which I use to wash in , and clean my teeth .
I boil about 250 ml for a cup of tea and drink a glass of water .
As the morning wears on I need to go to the toilet .
A single flush of a toilet consigns between six and 10 litres of clean water to the sewers , and I fear this is where I may come unstuck as the day progresses .
Instead , I duck out of the loo without flushing and substitute hand washing for a squirt of hand gel .
" If it 's yellow , let it mellow .
If it 's brown , flush it down , " advises Thirsty Planet on the toilet flushing issue .
I pretty much follow this rule in my own home anyway , but not at work or in someone else 's home .
No way .
As I buy my lunch from the office canteen , I do n't use any of my water allowance for cooking .
I factor in a couple of litres , hoping the salad I eat has been washed .
I have no way of knowing if it was given a quick rinse in a small tub of water or waved under a running tap , which gushes out five litres a minute .
Forget indulgent toilet flushing , the water " embedded " in all food items is the real culprit .
Growing a bag of mixed salad in Kenya , where a good proportion of the UK 's vegetables arrive from , uses about 300 litres of water .
That is before the leaves have been washed , processed and packed in the ready - to - use bags of which we 're so fond .
It takes between 2,000 and 5,000 litres of water to grow just 1kg of rice , 1,000 litres for 1kg of wheat , and 500 litres for 1 kg of potatoes .
Local water crises all over the world – remember last summer 's floods ?
– are already having a knock - on effect , affecting ecosystems and contributing to water scarcities .
Rising prices show that water is already an expensive commodity in the UK , and monitoring usage and installing a water meter could reduce your bills considerably .
Despite Britain 's reputation as a rain - sodden nation , hosepipe bans in the South - east have been a feature of recent summers .
Thirsty Planet raises money from the sale of its bottled water to support Pump Aid , which helps rural African communities dig wells and install water pumps .
A noble idea , yet bottled water such as Thirsty Planet and Harrogate Spa Water , both produced by Waterbrands , are part of the false economy of branded water itself .
Bottled water consumption has increased one thousandfold in the past 20 years and the global market is now worth about £ 25 bn annually .
Each year the world glugs down 180 billion litres of bottled water , two billion of those in the UK , where a litre costs about £ 1 , roughly the same as petrol .
Seven litres is wasted just to produce the bottle itself – but designer waters with unproven health benefits continue to sell well .
Bling H2O , for example , costs £ 20 , with a Swarovski crystal - studded bottle thrown in .
I 'm feeling rather good about the challenge as the day draws to a close , but at the eleventh hour , the toilet flush gets the better of me .
Stuck in a shop at 9 pm with just the manager , I use the toilet and am too ashamed not to flush , taking my consumption way above the prescribed 20 litres .
This flushing toilet trap illustrates why anyone living in a developed country will find it incredibly difficult to survive on 20 litres of water a day
In the 19th century , however , most British people did manage to exist on this amount .
Clean water was as inaccessible and unaffordable as it is today in sub-Saharan Africa .
This all changed with the public provision of clean water in 1852 .
Sanitation followed a few decades later , and deaths from cholera and other water - borne diseases and infections plummeted as a result .
Modern water and sanitation systems are built so that we cannot avoid flushing away tens of gallons of water every day .
Before going to bed I clean my face with cleanser and cotton wool to avoid using any more water .
Somewhat pointless considering irrigating cotton crops is one of the most water - intensive processes in farming .
The 155 litres of water we use for domestic and hygiene purposes each day is paltry compared with how much it takes to grow crops and get food on to our plates .
We produce twice as much food as we did in the 1970s , to keep pace with population growth , but we use three times as much water to do this .
Water is neither free nor unlimited .
If we rethink our attitudes to it now , we should be able to avoid every day turning into a 20 - litre challenge .

Researchers in Romania have created a way to transform bits and pieces of printed circuit boards from jettisoned computers into clean raw materials for consumer products , such as fuel and plastics .
Potentially toxic computer waste could instead wind up fueling your car one day .
A simple and efficient technique can recycle discarded circuit boards into environmentally friendly raw materials for use in fuel , plastic and other useful consumer products .
As electronics make their way everywhere around the world , heaps of outdated , unwanted devices are piling up in junkyards .
This is creating one of the world 's biggest environmental headaches .
Computers and other electronics are more hazardous than normal household trash , loaded as they are with toxic materials such as arsenic , mercury and lead or certain flame retardants .
In 2005 , the United States generated some 2.63 million tons of such garbage , and this amount is only expected to increase — " electronic waste " is the fastest growing part of our waste stream .
Now scientists in Romania and Turkey are seeking ways to remove toxic materials from electronics so these scrap materials can be safely recycled .
The researchers collected printed circuit boards from discarded computers .
They employed a special combination of catalysts , high temperatures and chemical filtration to destroy flame - retardant additives in the plastics .
This removed nearly all the toxic substances from the scraps , resulting in oils that could be safely used as fuel or raw materials called feedstocks for a wide range of consumer products , the researchers said .
" It is good work , " said chemical engineer William Hall at Coventry University in England , who did not participate in this study .
" The recycling of scrap printed circuit boards is becoming increasingly important because some of the metals they contain are becoming increasingly scarce . "
Hall noted that currently , scrap printed circuit boards can be processed in smelters , and this novel method will have to demonstrate its advantages over smelting if it is to succeed commercially .
The benefit of this new technique " is that as well as recovering the metal content of the printed circuit boards , you can also recover the valuable organic chemicals , " he told LiveScience .
" The biggest obstacle to development of this technology is the scaling - up of the process , " Hall added .
Researcher Cornelia Vasile at the Romanian Academy at Iasi and her colleagues will detail their findings in the May 21 issue of the journal Energy & Fuels .
They received funding from the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research .
Is McCain Sailing Into a Storm ?
The last couple of months have been springtime in paradise for Republicans : the loveliest of all possible seasons .
They have been watching two Democratic presidential candidates in an endless battle to destroy each other -- a process that does not appear to enhance the chance that the eventual nominee will win in November .
A recent Gallup poll shows John McCain leading both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in a head - to - head matchup .
All this before Republicans even begin publicizing the worst that can be said about either of two candidates whose alleged defects provide a supremely target - rich environment .
But it 's easy to let the individuals involved obscure larger factors that may prove more important .
In a hurricane , even handsome , well - built boats can end up underwater .
And right now , the GOP looks as though it may be sailing into a perfect storm .
Currently , 69 percent of Americans disapprove of the way President Bush is doing his job .
That is the highest disapproval rating since Gallup began polling 70 years ago -- higher than Lyndon Johnson during the Vietnam War , Richard Nixon during Watergate , or Jimmy Carter during the Iran hostage crisis .
Today , notes polling expert Karlyn Bowman of the American Enterprise Institute , more Americans think the country is on the wrong track than at any time since the late 1970s -- which set the stage for the Republican resurgence of 1980 , led by Ronald Reagan .
The sentiment is even more negative now than it was in 1992 , when the GOP lost the White House .
Some 63 percent see the Iraq war as a mistake .
Bush 's troubles have sent voters fleeing from his party .
In 2004 , 47 percent of Americans leaned toward the Democratic Party , with 44 percent leaning Republican -- a 3 - point difference .
Today , it 's 51 to 38 in favor of the Democrats -- a gap of 13 percentage points .
To win , McCain will have to pry away a lot of voters who currently find the GOP unappealing .
Obama ( or Clinton ) , by contrast , will have only to avoid alienating those who are already favorably inclined to a change .
Issue after issue also promises to hurt Republicans .
Among the topics creating the most anxiety are the economy , domestic matters like health care and immigration , and Iraq .
Of those , immigration is the only one that might not favor the Democrats .
Richard Norton Smith , a historian who has run the presidential libraries of Republicans Herbert Hoover , Dwight Eisenhower , Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan , is pessimistic about the party 's prospects .
He thinks the correct analogy is not 1988 but 1920 or 1952 -- when an unpopular war and an equally unpopular president spelled doom for the party in the White House .
He thinks 2008 is shaping up not only as a narrow defeat for the GOP but a decisive " repudiation . "
Many Republicans see Barack Obama as the natural heir of George McGovern -- an antiwar liberal with an avid but narrow base who is perfectly positioned to lose .
They are also reminded of Michael Dukakis and his difficulty connecting with white males and working - class voters .
But Smith sees a big difference :
In 1988 , when Dukakis lost , the outgoing Republican president was popular , with an approval rating above 50 percent .
Not so today .
Against trends like this , he strongly doubts that voters will put much weight on factors like Obama 's associations with radical preachers or his flag - free lapel .
Thanks to the Democratic contest , those matters have been fully aired , without fatal effect , and they are likely to sound stale and irrelevant by November .
In his view , the portents are all ominous for the Republican Party and its nominee .
" Why do you think the race started so early ?
Why do you think turnout has been so high ? " he asks .
" A desire to put this chapter behind us . "
The fallout is already apparent .
In recent months , Republicans have lost two special elections to fill seats that had been GOP strongholds .
Those shocks prompted former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to warn that come November , his party faces the prospect of " a real disaster . "
The bad news for Republicans is that objective factors are conspiring to produce a Democratic victory .
The good news ?
If the Democrats can't win this year , they may never .
The first line of Article II Section 1 of the US Constitution states , " The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . "
With these words , the office of the president was established .
Since 1789 and the election of George Washington , America 's first president , 44 individuals have served as the Chief Executive of the United States .
However , Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms which means that the next president of the United States will be number 46 .﻿ ﻿
The unamended Constitution mandated that a president would serve for four years .
However , nowhere did it state if there was to be a limit on the number of terms to which they could be elected .
However , President Washington set a precedent of only serving two terms which was followed until November 5 , 1940 when Franklin Roosevelt was elected for a third term .
He would go on to win a fourth before dying in office .
The 22nd Amendment was passed soon afterward that would limit presidents to only serving two terms or 10 years .﻿﻿

In humans and many other animals , males age faster and die earlier than females .
New research suggests this might happen because of intense competition over sex .
Scientists compared monogamous species with polygynous species , in which each male mates with many females .
Males in monogamous species , such as the barnacle goose or the dwarf mongoose , naturally compete less over females than ones in polygynous species , such as the red - winged blackbird or the savannah baboon .
After investigating about 20 different vertebrate species , researchers Tim Clutton - Brock and Kavita Isvaran at the University of Cambridge in England found the more polygynous a species was , the more likely their males were to age faster and die earlier than females .
The researchers explained that as competition among males for sex grows more intense , each male on average has less time to breed .
As such , there is no strong incentive to evolve longevity among males in such species .
Since men age faster and die earlier than women , these findings suggest that " at the time when current human physiology evolved , perhaps around the late Stone Age , polygynous breeding was the norm , " Clutton - Brock told LiveScience .
" Of course , this does n't provide any justification for polygyny or promiscuity now for males . "
Clutton - Brock and Isvaran detailed their findings online Oct. 17 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .

“ Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . ”
– George Santayana
On 9/11 , we were told “ this changes everything . ”
The terror attacks on New York and Washington were painted as one - of - a- kind events without historical parallel .
In reality , they were an all too familiar repeat performance .
Our meddling in the affairs of other nations had backfired upon us yet again .
“ Remember Pearl Harbor ! ” “ Remember the Lusitania ! ” “ Remember the Maine ! ” Each of these battle cries refers to very real events  and each refers to attacks ( or , in the case of the Maine , a tragic disaster of uncertain origin ) that would never have happened had America adhered to the wise counsel of Washington that “ the great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is , in extending our commercial relations , to have with them as little political connection as possible , ” and Jefferson advising “ peace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations  entangling alliances with none . ”
Osama bin Laden ’s “ declaration of war ” against the United States cited the following grievances : ( 1 ) occupation of Palestine and the blind American support of Israeli aggression ; ( 2 ) the sanctions upon Iraq , which cost the lives of half a million innocents ; ( 3 ) the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia .
We can believe what we want about mass murderer bin Laden ’s sincerity in invoking those grievances , but they resonated with the people of the Middle East and they allowed bin Laden to fund , recruit , train , and deploy an army of terrorists against America .
Is America to blame for the 9/11 attacks ?
No . Terrorists are responsible for their actions  and we are responsible for ours .
America must cease putting “ bad guys ” on its “ defense ” payroll to fight other “ bad guys . ”
When we finance and protect an Osama bin Laden , a Manuel Noriega , or a Saddam Hussein for our own purposes , we ’re likely to find him at our throats for someone else ’s purposes in the future .
America must forswear the killing of innocents and noncombatants , the torture of prisoners , and other atrocities in the name of “ war . ”
Such atrocities create more enemies than they kill .
They create new grievances , new wars , and yet more atrocities in kind .
America must cease attempting to police the world and solve its problems .
We ’ve got plenty of our own problems to solve .
They require our attention  attention that the rest of the world does n’t want .
Case in point : Iraq .
Our presence there has become an echo of Vietnam  damned if we stay , damned if we do n’t .
We ’ve destabilized the country so badly that there is no keeping it from chaos .
The only reasonable course open to us at this point in time is to bring our soldiers back alive , rather than sacrificing more of them to the hopeless cause of settling the centuries - old feuds of others .
I live in Texas , where fire ants abound .
Since I ’m sensitive to their bites , I have a great incentive to exterminate them .
But I do n’t go into my neighbors ’ yards to eradicate fire ants that might migrate to my yard .
It would be an impossible task to eliminate all the fire ants in my neighborhood .
Trying to tend my neighbors ’ yards as well as my own would distract me from the most important task of all  keeping my own yard free of the little varmints .
Driving fire ants from my neighbors ’ yards will only encourage them to come into mine .
Consequently , I treat my yard and my yard only .
When I go out , I wear shoes rather than sandals .
I focus on keeping my yard free of fire ants and arming myself with shoes to minimize damage from any that I miss .
Fighting terrorism is a lot like fighting fire ants .
We need to focus on keeping our country free of terrorists , rather than traipsing around the world trying to eradicate them in everybody else ’s yard .
When we invade other nations , such as Afghanistan and Iraq , we have fewer resources to stop the terrorists at home , and we desperately need those resources .
For example , the resources that have gone into “ protecting ” Europe and Japan could have gone into securing sites in America that were especially vulnerable to attack , improving the gathering of intelligence about potential threats and the transmission of information to potential victims , and training security forces to defend American territory rather than to invade other countries .
Instead , the government failed to act on information about the suspicious number of visa - holders from Saudi Arabia and Egypt taking flying lessons in the United States , and even more incredibly , banned pilots from bringing guns onto planes in July 2001 , publicly guaranteeing the safety of the hijackers .
Additionally , an immigration policy focused on limiting the number of Latino workers entering the country has overwhelmed the immigration service .
The service focuses on peaceful people , promoting the development of underground railroads and other means of entering the country illegally .
Tens of millions of people have become lawbreakers for either supporting or entering as illegal immigrants .
Such individuals have little willingness to cooperate with authorities investigating potential terrorist threats .
Indeed , their neighborhoods provide a place for terrorists to hide from authorities without attracting attention .
When immigration and visa policy is focused on screening people for communicable diseases and records of violence that constitute threats to others , honest people will gladly comply and enter through the front door , removing the financial benefits for people who currently provide the numerous back doors .
This will make it easier to focus on the people who are actually threatening the security of Americans .
Eliminating welfare entitlements and creating jobs by slashing government spending will insure that the influx of new immigrants will enhance , rather than detract from , America ’s economy .
Of course , no matter how hard we try , some terrorists are likely to get through , and we know it does n’t require many of them to cause substantial harm .
Fewer of them will try if we mind our own business , but we must n’t pretend the threat is nonexistent .
Thankfully , our Constitution is intended to protect our right to bear arms in our own self - defense .
That right should be immediately restored to airline personnel and acknowledged as a personal right of all Americans .
An armed populace is a far better deterrent to terror attacks than foreign military adventurism ever could be .
We do n’t hear about Israeli airline hijackings anymore because at least two people on each flight are undercover , armed sky marshals .
Since terrorists are few in number , an armed populace is , in essence , an army of the many prepared to take on the few .
Ending military intervention in other countries and government - to - government foreign aid that outrages large populations helps us promote free trade , which increases the benefits of peaceful relations between people .
We should n’t pretend that a pacifist approach is viable in the real world , but Switzerland has managed to avoid the quarrels of Europe for two centuries with a policy of armed neutrality .
Given our advantages in terms of both population and geography , such a policy is even more workable for the United States , but both the arms and the neutrality need to be in the equation .
With respect to military policy , our focus should be the defense of America .
Our troops cannot effectively defend our shores by guarding the 38th Parallel , patrolling the Mediterranean , or flying sorties over Kurdistan .
While we must naturally maintain the ability to project force “ over the horizon ” versus aggressors , our first line of defense is in keeping on our own side of that horizon  in our own yard  as a matter of course .
What should we have done after 9/11 ?
Clearly , we had not only the right but the responsibility to track down and punish the aggressors behind the attacks and destroy their ability to conduct further attacks .
We had the tools at hand to do so  the Rewards for Justice Program had previously been successful in bringing terrorists , including 1993 World Trade Center bombing architect , Ramzi Ahmed Yousef , to justice .
Bounties work , as we learned in our own history with the use of privateers and letters of marque and reprisal .
Instead , we invaded Afghanistan to pursue “ regime change ” and “ nation - building . ”
Nearly seven years later , the invasion has become an endless occupation , the new government we set up controls only 30 percent of the country , the Taliban menaces Pakistan  and al - Qaeda ’s leadership remains very much at large .
After that , we invaded Iraq to topple Saddam ’s Ba’athist regime  a regime that Osama bin Laden ranked second only to the U.S. as an enemy and a country in which al - Qaeda had no significant presence .
Five years later , we continue to expend blood and treasure trying to bring peace to a nation we ourselves tipped into chaos .
Our occupation provides the only remaining excuse for foreign al - Qaeda fighters to be tolerated by local populations .
Indeed , while Shi’ite and Kurdish populations have always opposed Sunni al - Qaeda , even the Sunnis are turning against foreign al - Qaeda forces in areas where the U.S. forces have gotten out of the way .
Let ’s get completely out of the way .
“ When will we ever learn ? ” is just as appropriate a refrain as it was in the 1960s .
I suggest we learn now and avoid the suffering that we will otherwise incur later .
Let ’s bring our young men and women home as soon as they can be safely evacuated from Iraq , from Europe , from Japan .
Our brave soldiers have volunteered to lay down their lives for us , asking only that we do n’t put them in harm ’s way unless absolutely necessary .
It ’s time to support our troops by bringing them back alive .
US general says he 's ready to go to war with Iraqi cleric Agence France - Presse

This A top US general on Sunday warned that the military would strike back after hardline Iraqi Shiite leader Moqtada al - Sadr threatened to launch a new uprising by his militia .
" I hope Moqtada al - Sadr continues to depress violence and not encourage it , " said Major General Rick Lynch , commander of US forces in central Iraq .
Lynch , whose area of control includes the Shiite provinces of Babil , Wasit , Karbala and Najaf , said his forces were ready to take on Sadr and his feared Mahdi Army militia if they choose to fight Iraqi and American forces .
" If Sadr and Jaish al - Mahdi ( Mahdi Army ) become very aggressive , we 've got enough combat power to take the fight to the enemy , " Lynch told a group of reporters from Western news networks .
Sadr , who has suspended the activities of his Mahdi Army militia since last August , threatened on Saturday to declare " open war " if a crackdown by Iraqi and US forces against his militiamen is not halted .
" I am giving my last warning and my word to the Iraqi government to take the path of peace and stop violence against its own people , otherwise it will be a government of destruction , " he said in a statement issued by his office in the holy city of Najaf .
" If it does not stop the militias that have infiltrated the government , then we will declare a war until liberation . "
Sadr also lashed out at the Iraqi government 's alliance with the US military .
" The occupation has made us the target of its planes , tanks , air strikes and snipers .
Without our support this government would not have been formed .
But with its alliance with the occupier it is not independent and sovereign as we would like it to be , " he said .
Soon after he made his statement , loudspeakers at mosques in Sadr 's Baghdad bastion Sadr City blared out a call to arms and urged residents to " fight the occupiers . "
Sadr launched two bloody uprisings from Najaf against US forces in 2004 in which hundreds of his militiamen were killed .
His fighters have been the target of attack by Iraqi and US forces since March 25 when Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ordered his security forces to launch assaults on Shiite militiamen in the southern city of Basra .
The battles spread to other Shiite areas , including Wasit province , under Lynch 's command , and Sadr City where they are still raging and where US forces have joined the fight .
Hundreds of people have been killed and scores wounded in the crackdown .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during a surprise visit to Baghdad 's Green Zone on Sunday gave a cautious response to latest developments .
" It 's been very difficult to get a read of what his motivations are and what his intentions are , " Rice told reporters before heading into talks with Maliki .
Iraqi security and medical officials said eight people were killed in fresh clashes in Sadr City overnight , while the US military said five people with weapons were killed in American air strikes and another two people were shot dead after reportedly opening fire on US forces .
Meanwhile witnesses reported many people leaving the area in a fresh exodus sparked by the fighting .
" The ball is now in the government 's court , " Salah al - Obeidi , spokesman for the Sadr movement , told AFP on Sunday .
" We wo n't accept any further procrastination , false promises and political hypocrisy , " Obeidi said .
" If the government continues on its course , Sadr alone will decide the next steps . "
The government has not immediately reacted to Sadr 's warnings , but acting Justice Minister Safa al - Safi said all arrests in Basra and in Baghdad are being carried out " in accordance with court orders . "
" Investigations related to those detained in Basra are legal and in accordance with human rights regulations , " the minister said in a statement .
" The security operations in Basra and other cities are an attempt to restore the sovereignty of the state and to impose the law . "

From a distance the bizarre structures sprouting from the high Alentejo plain in eastern Portugal resemble a field of mechanical sunflowers .
Each of the 2,520 giant solar panels is the size of a house and they are as technically sophisticated as a car .
Their reflective heads tilt to the sky at a permanent 45 degrees as they track the sun through 240 degrees every day .
The world 's largest solar photovoltaic farm , generating electricity straight from sunlight , is taking shape near Moura , a small town in a thinly populated and impoverished region which boasts the most sunshine per square metre a year in Europe .
When fully commissioned later this year , the £ 250 m farm set on abandoned state - owned land will be twice the size of any other similar project in the world , covering an area nearly twice the size of London 's Hyde park .
It is expected to supply 45 MW of electricity each year , enough to power 30,000 homes .
Portugal , without its own oil , coal or gas and with no expertise in nuclear power , is pitching to lead Europe 's clean - tech revolution with some of the most ambitious targets and timetables for renewables .
Its intention , the economics minister , Manuel Pinho , said , is to wean itself off oil and within a decade set up a low carbon economy in response to high oil prices and climate change .
" We have to reduce our dependence on oil and gas , " said Pinho .
" What seemed extravagant in 2004 when we decided to go for renewables now seems to have been a very good decision . "
He expects Portugal to generate 31 % of all its energy from clean sources by 2020 .
This means lifting its renewable electricity share from 20 % in 2005 to 60 % in 2020 , compared with Britain 's target of 15 % of all energy by 2020 .
Having passed its target for 2010 it could soon top the EU renewables league .
In less than three years , Portugal has trebled its hydropower capacity , quadrupled its wind power , and is investing in flagship wave and photovoltaic plants .
Encouraged by long - term guarantees of prices by the state , and not delayed by planning laws or government indecision , it has proved a success .
Firms are expected to invest £ 10bn in renewables by 2012 and up to £ 100bn by 2020 .
However , Portugal says it wants to develop a renewables industry to rival Denmark or Japan .
When the government invited companies for tenders to supply wind , solar and wave power , it demanded they work with manufacturing companies to establish clusters of industries .
This is a great success , say regional governments .
In northern Portugal , where the world 's biggest wind farm , with more than 130 turbines , is now being strung across the mountainous Spanish border , a German firm employs more than 1,200 people building 600 40 - metre- long fibreglass wind turbine blades a year .
The turbines are earmarked for Portuguese farms first , but orders are being taken from Britain and other countries .
Half the workforce are women who once worked in the declining textile industry .
It is Portuguese plans for wave power that are prompting the most interest in Europe .
The world 's first commercial wave farm is being assembled near Porto .
Three " sea snakes " , developed by the Edinburgh - based company Pelamis , will shortly be towed out to sea and will start pumping modest amounts of electricity into the grid later this year .
It is the start of a potentially giant global industry with Portuguese firm Enersis planning to invest more than £ 1bn in a series of farms that together would power 450,000 homes .
Pinho dismisses nuclear power .
" When you have a programme like this there is no need for nuclear power .
Wind and water are our nuclear power .
The relative price of renewables is now much lower , so the incentives are there to invest .
My advice to countries like the UK is to move as fast as they can to renewables .
With climate change and the increase in oil prices , renewables will become more and more important .
" Countries that do not invest in renewables will pay a high price in future .
The cost of inaction is very high indeed .
The perception that renewable energy is very expensive is changing every day as the oil price goes up . "
He added : " Energy and environment are the biggest challenge of our generation .
We need to develop a low - carbon model for the world economy .
The present situation is dangerous . "

Could be Banned from Doing Business in State for Five Years After Missing Recertification Deadline Prior to 2006 Election ...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/4/2008 , 3:19 pm PT
Yet another voting machine company --- a small - ish one , MicroVote --- may soon be out of business , or so it claims in response to a court decision in Indiana , where the judge has had the temerity to actually bother enforcing the rule of law and holding a voting machine company to an actual standard .
Go figure .
Of course , we 're broken hearted about it ...
A judge has thrown out a voting - machine company 's appeal of a 360 - thousand - dollar fine imposed by the secretary of state .
The Marion Circuit Court says MicroVote missed a filing deadline to challenge a fine for selling uncertified equipment .
The Indianapolis company did n't get its machines recertified until a week before the 2006 primary .
" We just ca n't tolerate vendors that have this lackadaisical attitude toward proper certification and say , ' Well , nothing bad really happened , so there 's no reason to go after us like this , ' " says Deputy Secretary of State Matt Tusing .
" We simply enforce the laws that are currently in place . "
MicroVote attorney John R. Price argues the decertification was n't MicroVote 's fault .
In 2005 , Congress required all voting - machine manufacturers to be recertified .
An administrative law judge recommended last week that MicroVote be banned from selling machines in Indiana for five years .
The Indiana Election Commission must decide whether to follow that recommendation , which Price warns would put the company out of business .
MicroVote supplies voting machines to 49 of Indiana 's 92 counties .
Not sure which law they refer to when they say that " In 2005 , Congress required all voting - machine manufacturers to be recertified . "
Are they talking about the Indiana state legislature ?
Or did the reporter just get it wrong here ?
Color us clueless , but too busy to dig deeper for the moment .
Your help comments are welcome if you know what the hell they 're referring to there .
Back in April of 2006 , as John Gideon had been covering the impending Train Wreck for The BRAD BLOG , he noted that the state had " found that MicroVote had installed software uncertified by both the fed and the state in voting machines of 47 Indiana counties . "
He further reported that counties found themselves in the unenviable position of having to choose between using uncertified software or otherwise ignoring both federal and state laws requiring a voting device for those with disabilities .
" Some counties are choosing to ignore state law and use the uncertified machines , " Gideon wrote at the time .
Google , MoveOn.org and other comrades in regulation have been calling for more government control of Internet service for several years now .
The good news is they 've just suffered a setback .
An agreement worked out recently between cable giant Comcast and BitTorrent , the creator of a popular file - sharing program , offers a private - sector alternative to " net neutrality " industrial policy .
Comcast gained villain status last year when the company tried to ease congestion on its network by slowing the transmission of high - bandwidth ...

A TEENAGE motorist was told to remove an England flag from his car by a police officer because it could be offensive to immigrants .
Ben Smith , 18 , was driving back home to Ingram Road in Melksham on Thursday evening after filling up with petrol , when the officer stopped him on a routine patrol .
He checked the tax disc and tyres on his Vauxhall Corsa but when he noticed the flag of St George on the parcel shelf he told Mr Smith to take it down .
Mr Smith , who works for G Plan Upholsterers on Hampton Park West , said : " He saw the flag and said it was racist towards immigrants and if I refused to take it down I would get a £ 30 fine .
" I laughed because I thought he was joking , but then I realised he was serious so I had to take it down straight away .
I thought it was silly - it 's my country and I want to show my support for my country . "
Mr Smith had recently installed new speakers in the parcel shelf of his car and wanted to cover them up so they did not get stolen .
He used the flag and laid it out flat on the shelf so it was not obscuring his view out of the rear window .
But it was only there a couple of days before he was stopped by the officer at about 9.30 pm close to Melksham Enterprise Park and made to take it down .
He said he is used to getting stopped by the police because he is a young male driver and is often mistaken for a boy racer ' .
But he thought it was " a bit strange " to be asked to take down the England flag when the officer found nothing else wrong with his car .
PC Dave Cooper , of Chippenham Road Policing Unit , said he had never come across an officer asking someone to remove an England flag from their car because it could be racist .
He added : " It all depends on the context of a stop .
If they are going past a lot of Polish people , for instance , and abusing them , then we possibly would ask them to take the flag down . "
He said there would be no police log of Mr Smith having been stopped with details of what was said to him , as there was nothing wrong with his car .
He added the officer could have been based anywhere around the county and just made an independent stop .

[ Update : This is a technical article on the causes of lag .
Â
If you want the article on measuring lag , then click here ]
Responsiveness is something that can make or break a game at first impression .
This is especially true in reviews where a game with poor responsiveness will be described as being “ sluggish ” , “ unresponsive ” , “ floaty ” or “ sloppy ” .
A better game might be referred to as “ tight ” or “ responsive ” .
There are several factors that contribute to perceived responsiveness .
This article looks at some of them from a programmer ’s perspective , and offers some routes to making your game more responsive .
RESPONSE LAG
Response lag is the delay between the player triggering an event , and the player getting feedback ( usually visual ) that the event has occurred .
If the delay is too long , then the game will feel unresponsive .
Several factors contribute to the length of this response lag .
If your game is unresponsive , it may well be the cumulative effects of four or five different factors .
Adjusting one factor alone may not make a perceptible difference , but addressing all the factors can lead to a noticeable improvement .
Players , and sometime even designers , cannot always put into words what they feel is wrong with a particular game ’s controls .
Often they will try to do something that requires some synchronization , but will fail , and they wo n’t be able to tell you “ the event happened 0.10 seconds after my input ” , instead they will just tell you that the game felt “ slow ” or “ not tight ” , or “ difficult ” .
Or they might not be able to tell you anything , and simply say the game sucked , without really understanding why it sucked .
Designers and programmers need to be aware of response lag , and the negative effect it has on a game , even if test players do not directly report it as a factor .
WHY LAG HAPPENS
To understand why lag occurs , you need to understand the sequence of events that occur from the time the user presses a button , to when the results appear on screen .
To understand this , we need to look at the main loop structure of the game .
The main loop performs two basic tasks : logic and rendering .
The “ logic ” portion of a main loop updates the game state ( the internal representation of the game objects and environment ) , while the “ rendering ” portion of the loop creates a frame that is displayed on the television .
At some point in the main loop ( usually at the start ) we also get input from the user .
This is sometimes considered a third task in the main loop , but it ’s also commonly a part of the logic task .
I ’ve kept it separate here because it ’s important to see in what order things happen
LISTING 1 – THE SIMPLEST MAIN LOOP
while ( 1 ) { Input ( ) ; Logic ( ) ; Rendering ( ) ; }
There are several ways a main loop can be structured .
The simplest is shown in listing 1 , where we simply alternate calling the logic and the rendering code .
It is assumed there is some frame synchronization in the call to Rendering ( ) , and that we are running at a fixed frame rate , usually 60 or 30 frames per second for an NTSC console game .
The main loop here is also only showing half the story .
The call to Rendering ( ) is doing the CPU side of the rendering task , which is iterating over the environment and the objects , culling , animating , sorting , setting up transforms , and building a display list for the GPU to execute .
The actual GPU rendering is performed after the CPU rendering , and usually is asynchronous , so while the main loop is processing the next frame , the GPU is still rendering the previous frame .
So where does the lag come in ?
Look at the sequence of events that occur from the user pressing a button to there being some feedback for pressing that button .
A the highest level , the user presses a button , the game logic reads that button press and updates the game state , the CPU render function sets up a frame with this new game state , then the GPU renders it , and finally this new frame is displayed on the television .
Figure 1 shows this in a more graphical manner .
Sometime in frame 1 , the player presses a button to fire his gun .
Since the input processing has already been done for that frame , this input is read in frame 2 .
Frame 2 updates the logic state based on this button press ( a shot is fired ) .
Also in frame 2 , the CPU side of rendering is performed with this new logic state .
Then on frame 3 , the GPU performs the actual rendering of this new logic state .
Finally at the start of frame 4 , the newly rendered frame is presented to the user by flipping the frame buffers .
So how long is the lag ?
It depends on how long a frame is ( where a “ frame ” here is a complete iteration of the main loop ) .
It takes up to three frames for the users input to be translated into visual feedback .
So if we are running at 30 frames per second , then the lag is 3/30th or 1/10th of a second .
If we are running at 60 frames per second , then the lag will be 3/60th or 1/20th of a second .
This illustrates a common misconception about the difference between 60 fps and 30 fps games .
Since the difference between these two frame rates is just 1/60th of a second , people assume that the difference in responsiveness will also be 1/60th .
In actual fact , going from 60 to 30 does not just add a vsync to your lag , it acts as a multiplier , doubling the length of the process pipeline that is responsible for lag .
In our ideal example in figure 1 , it adds 3/60ths of a second , not 1/60th .
If the event pipeline is longer , which it quite possible can be , then it can add even more .
Figure 1 actually illustrates the best possible sequence of events .
The button press event is translated into visual feedback via the shortest path possible .
We know this because we can clearly see the sequence of events .
As a programmer , being familiar with the order in which things happen is a vital part of understanding why thing act the way they do in the game .
It quite easy to introduce additional frames of lag ( meaning an extra 1/60th or 1/30th of a second delay ) , by not paying careful attention to the order in which things happen .
As a simple example , consider what would happen if we switched the order of the Logic ( ) and Rendering ( ) calls in our main loop .
Look at frame 2 of figure 1 , although the input is being read at the start of frame 2 , and affects the logic during frame 2 , the rendering is performed first , and so is using the logic state from frame 1 .
This introduces an extra frame of lag .
While this is a novice level mistake , it is still something you need to make absolutely sure is not happening .
Extra frames of lag can be introduced in a more subtle manner as a result of the order of operations within the game logic .
In out example we are firing a gun .
Now perhaps our engine is set up to increment the position of the objects in the world using a physics engine , and then handle events that are raised due to this update ( such as collision events ) .
So in this situation the sequence of input / logic looks like listing 2 .
LISTING 2 – PHYSICS UPDATE IS FOLLOWED BY EVENT HANDLING
void Logic ( ) { HandleInput ( ) ; UpdatePhysics ( ) ; HandleEvents ( ) ; }
Now event handling via messages is a very nice way of decoupling systems .
So a programmer might decide to use it for the player control events .
To fire a gun , the HandleInput ( ) function will fire an event telling the gun to fire .
The HandleEvents ( ) function will take this event and cause the gun to actually fire .
But because the physics update has already happened for this frame , the effect on the world state will not be incorporated until the next frame , hence introducing an extra frame of lag .
MORE LAG CAUSES
The lag can be extended even further by lower level action ordering .
Consider a “ jump ” – the feedback comes when the character actually moves .
To make something move in a game , you can either set the velocity directly , or you apply a force to it , either acceleration or , more likely , a momentary impulse .
The problem arises here if in your physics engine then positions are updated before the velocity change is applied ( a common situation in many introductory game programming tutorials ) .
In this case , although the velocity of the jumping object will be set on the same frame as the input event is handled , the object will not actually begin to move until the next time around the loop , on the next game frame , and so introduces an additional frame of lag .
Remember these are cumulative problems that can be difficult to discern in isolation , but the combined effect can make your game controls turn to mush .
Suppose you had made all three mistakes listed above : you do rendering before logic , you handle logic events after advancing the physics state , and you update position before velocity .
That ’s three additional full iteration of the main loop , in addition to the three you already have built in .
Six frames of lag between the player pressing a button , and seeing the result on screen .
At 60 frames per second that ’s 1/10th of a second , which is bad enough , but if the game is running at 30 frames per second , then the lag is DOUBLED to an unbearable 1/5th of a second , or 200 ms .
Other factors can contribute to lag , compounding even further the effects above .
Movement can be driven by animations , with velocity changes built into specific time points in an animation .
The obvious problem here is if the animator places the jump velocity impulse a fraction of a second into the animation , to better match the visuals .
It might look better , but it feels bad .
That ’s easily dealt with by making sure the velocity impulse is on the first frame of animation when immediate feedback is needed .
But then the question is : how does triggering an animation translate into actual movement ?
It ’s quite likely that animation updating is handled by the Render ( ) function , and so any events triggered by the animation will not be handled until the time around the loop , which adds another frame .
In addition , triggering an animation might not make it advance a frame until the next frame , delaying the event firing for a frame .
Our lag could potentially be increased from six to eight frames , which would be quite unplayable , even at 60 frames per second .
That ’s not the end of it either .
There are many ways in which extra frames of lag can be introduced .
You might be pipelining your physics on a separate thread ( or a physics processing unit ) .
You might be using triple buffering to smooth your frame rate .
You could be using abstract events that take a couple of passes through the system to resolve into real events .
You could be using a scripting language that adds an additional frame in the way it waits for an event .
It ’s quite possible to make you game logic incredibly flexible by abstracting various concepts of time and events , and yet while doing this you loose sight of exactly what is going on under the hood , making it far easier for additional frames of delay to creep in .
RESPONSIVENESS IS NOT REACTION TIME
On of the great misconceptions regarding responsiveness is that it is somehow connected to human reaction time .
Humans cannot physically react to a visual stimulus and then move their fingers in less than one tenth of a second , and peak reaction times vary from 0.15 seconds to 0.30 seconds , depending on how “ twitchy ” the gamer is .
Figures such as these are often brought up in discussion of game responsiveness , but the connection is specious .
It ’s not how fast you react to the game that is the issue ; it ’s how fast the game reacts to you .
The issue is not one of reaction times , but of synchronization .
In games such as Guitar Hero there are things coming towards you , and you have to hit the correct button at a very precise point in time , when the target object is within a particular region .
The player is anticipating the future event , and there is no reaction involved at all .
The problems of lack of responsiveness occur when the game does not react fast enough to the player , and the target object has moved beyond the target region by the time the event occurs .
The player presses the button at the correct point , and they do not expect the object to move even a few more pixels before it explodes .
But since objects generally move at least a few pixels per frame , having a few frames of lag can allow the object to drift past its target .
Many action games are based around this anticipation and button pressing .
In a skateboarding game you want to jump just before you hit the end of a rail .
In a shooter , you want to shoot the instant someone moves in front of your gun .
Again this is not reaction time , you will usually have seen the target at least half a second before you shoot it , probably more , and will be either moving the gun , or waiting for the target to move in front of the gun .
Because of the somewhat unintuitive nature of these problems , in order to create a responsive game , it is important that you fully understand the issues involved .
The most important thing is to be able to clearly describe the frame by frame path though your logic and rendering that the action a button being pressed will take in order to create visual feedback .
Once you have this , you can optimize it as close to the optimal pathway as possible .

But this is no normal wrestling match -- the contenders are diminutive humanoid robots built and controlled by participants in the twice - yearly Robo - One Championships .
In the featherweight division , “ Automo03 - Sandan ” -- a robot dressed in karate gear -- is no match for “ Leghorn , ” a chicken - like robot known for its vicious “ Chicken Chop ” martial art moves .
“ Japanese children have all been brought up watching animation and there is a lot of interest in robot battles , so this Robo - One competition is all about making this a reality , ” said Robo - One committee Chairman Terukazu Nishimura .
Japan ’s warrior robots come in all shapes .
From medieval princes to cubic robots , 112 of them entered the two - day tournament .
By Sunday , the final day , 45 remained standing among the heavyweights and featherweights .
In the lightweight division , South Korean robot Teakwon - V smashed his opponents with a quick jab , to the delight of his maker Jeon Young Sun , who took home the 1 million yen ( $ 10,000 ) division prize .
“ It is a good chance to see Japan ’s advanced robot technology , ” Jeon Young Sun , an engineer , told Reuters .
“ Some people say that South Korea ’s technology is unsatisfactory , but I would like to show ... that South Korea ’s robot technology is doing really well by continuing to participate in robot competitions and walking shoulder to shoulder with Japan ’s teams until we develop our technology and do even better , ” he said .
Japan , home to 40 percent of the world ’s robots , provides a fertile ground for amateur programmers , who invest serious money and energy into building the ideal robot out of server motors , cameras , sensors and wires .
Many electronics companies , on the other hand , have pulled the plug on cutting - edge robots for the consumer market because of high development costs .
For example , Sony Corp 6758.T has decided to stop production of its Aibo dog robot .
Naoki Maru , a 41 - year - old engineer and winner of the heavyweight division class , believes such reluctance gives amateurs an advantage over big corporations .
“ You see a lot of technological breakthroughs in these kind of fighting robots .
This competition , for example , happens twice a year , but every time we gather you witness here some incredible technological revolution in robotics , ” he said .
“ It ’s just great that in this field the ‘ hobbyists ’ develop and improve their robots faster than in the corporate world , ” he added .
Maru ’s “ King Kaiser ” fighting robot , controlled by his 12 - year - old son Kenta and 9 - year - old son Ryouma , went on to beat Jeon ’s ‘ Teakwon - V ’ robot in the All Class division that pits lightweights against heavyweights .

Chris Gupta Cool : Fridge Without Using Electricity !
This is Mohammed Bah Abba 's Pot - in - pot invention .
In northern Nigeria , where Mohammed is from , over 90 % of the villages have no electricity .
His invention , which he won a Rolex Award for ( and $ 100,000 ) , is a refrigerator than runs without electricity .
Here 's how it works .
You take a smaller pot and put it inside a larger pot .
Fill the space in between them with wet sand , and cover the top with a wet cloth .
When the water evaporates , it pulls the heat out with it , making the inside cold .
It 's a natural , cheap , easy - to - make refrigerator .
So , instead of perishable foods rotting after only three days , they can last up to three weeks .
Obviously , this has the potential to change their lives .
And it already has -- there are more girls attending school , for example , as their families no longer need them to sell food in the market .

Evaporative coolers like this are dependent on aridity for greatest cooling .
In an arid ( dry ) climate , placing a wet cloth over what you want to cool keeps the item 50 - 60 degrees farenheight , but anywhere that you get a chill from wearing a wet shirt will do .

I 'm shocked , that 's an ancient ' invention ' , it was NOT created by that man .
It 's great they 're using it / promoting it ... but they did not invent it .
Wow .
That last guy was angry .
This would sure be good enough for me !
But , I live in a cool temperate climate : would it work here ?
Also , how is it maintained ?
Do you just keep adding water to it ?
Is faster or slower evaporation more effective ?
I am going to make one and find out .
And why was that last guy so angry ?
Worried about greenwash and malaria and crappy electricity supplies .
Ok I get that .
Still , it would be a shame to underestimate the power of self - suffiency .
I would love to know more about the superior water based evaportative cooler Waldo used as a child .
RE : Waldo Hitcher :
It may seem silly , but it seems to me that this device , though simple , would in fact be very useful to share with countries such as Nigeria , where it was developed .
It seems simple to us , but unless you independently invent it , how are you supposed to know that putting a pot in another pot filled with wet sand will give you a refrigerating device ?
This publicity will hopefully give way to an educational movement on the technique , and it seems that it has become widely known if it 's been making an impact on girls going to school .
I did find the article vague on that point , though .
Also , the problem of water in Nigeria is not that there is n't enough of it ; it 's that there is n't enough potable water .
I 'm sure waste water , such as from washing , would be suitable in this application .
Furthermore , I do n't think it 's reasonable to expect that all Nigerians could afford more advanced solutions , such as the one you knew as a child .
The pot method seems primitive , but it 's better than the alternative , and affordable : a winning combination .
If I had a choice between my food spoiling and having to use a primitive refrigerator , well , I 'd take the pots .
Absolutely without taking anything away from this ingenious invention , note these : 1 ) In Iran , city of Yazd , evaporative cooling has been used for centuries to keep houses cool in scorching summers .
Google it but in short : tall air catchers , air entering underground water wells , losing heat , then entering homes ) .
Very organic .
Cranes love to nest on the tall wind catch towers .
2 ) Clay jars cooling drinking water by evaporative cooling since clay allows water to seep out through the clay wall thickness and the process of evaporation cools the water inside .
Do n't forget that in Muslim countries , the wind towers in their buildings provide free air conditioning .
I believe that this type of a ' fridge ' has been used in India for AGES .
Instead of keeping the smaller pot inside a larger pot , they dig the smaller pot inside sand itself .
The sand is then kept wet .
Works well under shade in sunny areas and in deserts .
These ideas have been in use since ages , i would assume this must have been the ealiest forms of cooling and lost its sheen as technology developed artifical and quicker methods for the process .
however thinking of it impacting a community in a profound manner so much so as to getting girls going back to school is an absurd co-relation .
what cant we look at in exoensive practical tools / equipemts which are in line with modernity and at the same time reduces the gap in technology between those have access to high end technology and them to those who dont .
but telling people to use this method as the perfect alternative to cooling / refrideration is tunnel vision .
i am sure developed and progressive nations have a better way of brining about education and provision amond the lesser developed and impoverished nations .
( for example electricity generated out windmills could power an electric fan to hasten the cooling process around the pots or a portable refriderator of this kind be made with some modern technology would be something we should look in to instead of sending people back in time only to go further back )
Great stuff , and glad to see people talking about things to help those in need .
So did this Nigerian guy patent his invention ?
He gonna get any money of people making them ?
Follow up question how cold does it get ?
Funny ha ha cold or " oh I can actually safely store my food without having diarrhea tomorrow " cold ?
Am I missing something here ?
That " invention " would not keep anything contained within it more than a few degrees cooler than the ambient outdoor temperature .
Evaporation in that arrangement is not going to do much at all .
So maybe the food goes from rotting in 3 days to rotting in 3.5 days .
Big deal .
Wow !
To think that the answer for a cheap refridgerator was here all the time . . .
Although , it does n't seem likely it would really keep it cool .
Huh , not much of an invention really .
Just a bucket of sand .
I spoke with a elderly missionary couple who had used a different , but equally interesting cooling device .
It consisted of two metal balls filled with some sort of refrigerant , maybe ammonia ?.
The two balls were connected by a small tube .
They would place one end in the cooking fire , which turned the refrigerant into a gas and forced it into the other ball .
Later , they would place that other ball in a " cool box " and as the refrigerant phase changed throughout the day back into the other ball , it took all the heat out of the cool box .
They were able to make ice even .
Same idea used in the Aussie outback ( although it was more a box draped in wet hessian ) called a Coolgardie Safe or Cooler till kero fridges became affordable .
lt 's things like this that show the ingenuity of mankind , unless of course he merely imported the idea from somewhere else .
If you have no cooling at all then this is an inexpensive step upward .
Do n't knock something that helps someone who has nothing .
its a great invention by the nigerian
Simple , easy , and who cares if it 's been for years in some other countries , it 's a great idea !
It 's Rolex 's money and they can do what they want
Hey , we are the manufacturer of cooler box in China , any interest , plz contact with me with my MSN or Email : xurrycn@hotmail.com
great idea .
If I show poor people that leave in extreamly hot places ( 100 + degrees ) how to apply this method of cooling and it makes their lives just a bit better GREAT !!!!
And when someday we 'll be ALL sitting in the dark without any electricity .
When you are wondering what to do with that gluttony of refrigerated food so it wo n't spoil before the electricity comes back on , remember this .
You moron 's believe the majority of the world 's population have modern conveniences , when in actually they live close to the situation this family does .
I studied and improved this concept substantially in my first design class with a few of my class mates .
It really turned out well , but I do n't know of how to let others implement our improvements .
http://rickywillems.myrpi.org/potinpot.html
I 'm appalled by all the negative comments .
Nobody is making any claim of this pot - in - pot being able to compete with modern gas or electric refrigerators when it comes to maintaining a constant ideal temperature .
And perhaps it is based on a principle known from ancient times , and not Abba 's own original idea , but the man did put two and two together , and what he came up with is a system that actually works for the people it is intended for .
People who have precious little money or food were heretofore unable to keep food fresh for any significant length of time , but thanks to Abba 's pot - in - pot system , shelf life of their food has been greatly extended .
Certainly a less - than - perfect refrigerator is much better than none at all , no ?
I would say the man deserves a great deal of credit and praise .
CHECK THIS OUT : " intermittent absorption refrigeration " does not use electricity .
originally invented / discovered by Ferdinand Carre in 1858 .
Adam Grosser recently got the thermodynamics unit at Stanford to analyse the concept and discovered that the standard refrigeration tables ( for ammonia ) were wrong .
With a design team from the UK , he designed and built a safe unit using low pressure , non -toxic coolants .
The current prototype : an 8 lb refrigeration unit is heated ( ie over a fire ) for 1 / 2 hour , then let cool for an hour , then inserted it into a large 3 gallon storage drum .
It keeps the drum at just above freezing for 24 plus hours .
They will cost 25 to 40 dollars , and can be used to preserve medicine as well as food , anywhere hot that lacks electricity .

p e a c e
Great idea .
It is crazy juts how ingenious yet simple some ideas can be .
Why not expand upon ideas like this that are eco friendly and use no electricity .
WOW , this is wonderful !!
They should use these here in america .
It could save us all a lot of money now that our country is in a recession .
what a fantastic invention nice
Note to haters in 2009 :
If you can't say something positive , then say nothing .
After this last storm in Houston , people with no transportation or cooler could have used this information because ice was unavailable .
Be glad for your blessings !
Yes , it is not ' new ' technology , but what is ?
If it works in the relevant climate it is good .
@ Doug - the missionary ball refrigerator that used ammonia ( R717 ) was probably a cousin of the ' Icyball ' kerosene powered refrigerator ( see Google ) and indeed all modern gas powered refrigerators .
For solar powered refrigeration ( and a closer relative of the missionary system ) see the ' ISAAC icemaker ' and its variants which also use an ebb -and - flow cycle .
VERY GOOD
This is very cool .
I want a giant one .
ha .
Really though , it 's awesome that its helped children be able to go to school .
In the '30s , the gas evaporator refrigerator used a pilot light to boil the liquid , it was condensed in the finned unit on top .
Substitute the gas pilot light with a convex ( dome ) Fresnel lens to boil the liquid using sunlight .
All else stays the same .
Painted white , it could sit in the sun to cool down during the daytime - made ice too .
This idea should be in public domain , as all parts are in use for other purposes .
Keep door closed during the night to preserve the refrigerated interior .
I learned to do this in the Boy Scouts in the early 90's .
We did it at summer camps to keep drinks cold .
I am not impressed .
How the hell did this guy win an award for this ?
This is such an old trick !
I heard of this before the Internet was even invented .
That 's what you have to do apparently .
" Invent " something that 's been around for hundreds or thousands of years and pretend that it was your design .
Pathetic .
While I think this is a great idea , it is also a pretty old idea and has been used for a long time .
Still , I have to admit , it 's very clever .
I love all things ecological / economical and recently looked into how refrigerators work and if it would be possible to make one without electricity ... came up with a similar idea to this , then found on the internet that it 's already existed in 3rd world countries for donkeys years !
Rock on I say !
Us westerners rely on electricity and fossil fuels far too much .
If only they would invent electricity - free computers , phones and internet I would give it up altogether ! :-D
Re : some of the more negative posts :
Just because we have electric fridges / ovens / technology in the west does not make us superior or more intellegent , it just makes us more dependant !
We use these appliances every day but how many of us would actually know how to make one from scratch out of raw materials ?
Stick one westerner , and one person from a so - called developing country on a desert island together , and who do you think would better know how to survive ?
If the power went out for a month all over the world , WE'D be the only ones running round in the dark in a panic searching for candles in the basement with meat going off in the " fridge " !
lol ;-)
Good idea whether passed on from earlier enertions or not !
In many areas of the world the temperature 10 feet below ground is a constant 55 degrees .
This has also been put to good use by many generaions .
Not entirely a new concept but it is a great idea and helpful to those in need .
May God Bless Mohammed Aba Nabba .
I 've modernized the Design .
And I 'll make it my lifes carreer .
I salute Prof. Mohammed Abbah for his wonderful pot - in - pot .

When superhero Tony Stark is n't donning his Iron Man armor to personally rough up villains , he 's pitching the U.S. military on new gadgets to fight the War on Terror .
" They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire , " Stark tells a group of military officers in the Iron Man film that opened last week .
" I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once . "
The Marvel comic book character 's suit embodies a futuristic technology that may enhance human capabilities in war , but the current battlefield belongs to a growing swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV ) and robots that could someday give even Iron Man a run for his money .
UAVs clocked more than 500,000 hours in the air by the beginning of 2008 , performing many of the tasks normally done by piloted aircraft .
" There 's a scene of Iron Man flying against [ F - 22 ]
Raptors , " said Peter Singer , Brookings Institute defense expert and author of the forthcoming book Wired for War .
Those are among the last generation of manned fighter jets . "
Someone still needs to develop and sell those manned or unmanned technologies , and that 's where Stark might be the new face of military contractors .
Private individuals and companies might not be as visible as UAVs soaring above the skies of Afghanistan and Iraq , yet their role has grown just as dramatically during the recent conflicts .
Howard Hughes , the original Halliburton Tony Stark , played by Robert Downey Jr. , is based partly on real - life wealthy industrialist Howard Hughes , who lent his eccentric genius and financial resources to oddball U.S. military efforts during World War II and the Cold War .
Hughes built and piloted many of his own aircraft , including the Hughes H - 1 Racer that he flew to set a transcontinental airspeed record in 1937 .
" He was really doing this sort of thing even before there was a military - industrial complex , " said Alex Roland , military historian at Duke University .
He compared Hughes to a " one-man Halliburton empire , " referring to one of the largest defense contractors currently working in Iraq .
The military - industrial complex really took off in the 1950s as the United States sought new weapons and technologies for its growing military , which gave Hughes and other military contractors a market to sell everything from helicopters to satellites .
Yet some Hughes projects contracted by the military simply fizzled .
The all - wood " Spruce Goose " remains the largest plane ever built ; it was meant to carry troops safely across the Atlantic during World War II , but was completed after the war and flew just once .
Another effort that foundered involved building a secret ship that could raise a sunken Soviet nuclear submarine from the bottom of the Pacific .
Such doomed investments were just one symptom of the troubles that plagued the early military - industrial complex .
A " revolving door " allowed military officers to join companies that they had just awarded defense contracts to , while private executives went to work for the Pentagon and funneled contracts back to their companies , Roland said .
He added that tightened regulations now prevent many of those earlier abuses of the system .
Cycles of military spending Still , those powerful interests combined with the cry of " how much is enough for defense ? " during the Cold War to make a seemingly irresistible call for bigger and pricier weapons , according to Roland .
And the military - industrial complex remains hungry today for increased funding .
Private companies are eager for contracts , the military looks for next - generation weapons , and some in Congress jockey for new defense - related jobs for their districts .
" That 's how Dad did it , that 's how America does it and it's worked out pretty well so far , " Stark says in the movie .
Roland observed that U.S. military spending has gone up and down in cycles largely unrelated to the constant pressure from the military - industrial complex , with spikes in 1940 , 1960 , 1980 and again during the Bush administration .
The trouble arises when the sense of national urgency that accompanies those spikes can lead to relaxed government oversight , just as millions of new defense dollars suddenly become available and companies rush in .
Such has been the case with the latest boost in military spending , Roland said .
However , there 's now the additional twist of reduced competition among contractors .
" From 1986 to 2006 , the number of Pentagon prime contractors competing on major defense programs went from twenty to six , " said Singer , the Brookings Institute defense expert .
" There 's often just two going at it , competing on both sides of [ contract ] bundles , so that they win no matter what . "
' Minimal competition '
That reduced competition among major contractors may contribute to problems of inefficiency , Singer said .
Budget overruns and delays for weapon systems appear to be the rule .
The Government Accountability Office found that 95 major defense systems exceeded their budgets by $ 295 billion collectively in a March 2008 report , including an upgraded version of the F - 22 Raptors that duel with Stark in Iron Man .
But even non-competitive , no - bid contracts are " perfectly legitimate under certain circumstances , " said James Jay Carafano , senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and retired U.S. Army Lt. Colonel .
The U.S. military awarded such contracts to get on a war footing quickly and invade Iraq .
Now that U.S. efforts have switched to providing long - term security and reconstruction , though , experts say contracts should be more competitive to boost efficiency .
Corruption and waste among contractors and local officials in Iraq caused the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction to deem the problem the " second insurgency " in 2007 , according to the Associated Press .
" There 's minimal competition with very few eyes and ears watching the contracting , " Singer noted .
" Should you be surprised to be billed for one hundred guys working on a site , if you never visited to see if there were even ten ? "
Singer blamed the government for acting like a " stupid client . "
Carafano agreed , adding that the sudden flood of military spending resulted in poorly defined contracts hastily given out .
" It 's not about greedy contractors , it 's not about backdoor deals , and it's not about politicians making sure certain companies get contracts , " Carafano said .
" It 's about the government not being a very good customer . "
Who is on the front lines ?
Whatever happens , no one questions that the United States could not fight a war now without outsourcing to military contractors .
" Do you always get value for your money ?
Not always , but generally , yes you do , " Carafano said .
" These wars would n't be possible without private sector support . "
That means military contractors have also expanded beyond just selling military hardware .
They now run supply lines , feed troops , build base camps , consult on strategy and even fight as private security forces .
" Companies do n't just build the weapons of war , they provide the personnel to use it , " Singer said .
" They provide the service side of war .
That 's a pretty historic shift . "
The change amounted to more than 180,000 Americans , Iraqis and other nationals working as private contractors in Iraq as of July 2007 , exceeding the 163,000 U.S. troops there at the time .
Some of those contractors necessarily carry guns in their line of work .
Movie audiences probably wo n't be troubled by Iron Man dealing out vigilante justice , but experts question how to hold military contractors accountable for their actions if things go badly .
Private individuals work in a murky area where no law seems to apply , leading to incidents such as the shooting of Iraqi civilians by guards working for the private military company Blackwater .
" Every human endeavor has bad apples , and that 's true whether you 're talking about the real world or a comic book world , " Singer said .
" But do you have a system in place to ensure that the bad apples are punished ? "
There 's no need to worry about Tony Stark , though .
He is , by cinematic definition , one of the good guys .

Are lasers weapons ?
In the movies , of course .
In warfare , they do everything from guiding bombs to earth to blasting targets in space .
And now handheld laser pointers have earned a place alongside guns in Australia ’s most populous state .
A new law proposed today by the premier of New South Wales declares possession of the handheld lasers a serious crime , punishable by up to 14 years in prison , depending on the device ’s power .
Weaker lasers could carry a $ 5,000 fine or 2 years in jail , and there would be exemptions only for teachers , construction crews and the scientists who point out the stars on planetarium ceilings .
Behind the harshness of the proposed ban is a nightmare scenario :
A passenger jet crashes after a pilot is blinded by a laser aimed at the cockpit by someone on the ground .
“ It is a gutless and cowardly act that could result in an horrific outcome , ” Premier Morris Iemma said , according to Reuters .
“ It only takes a fraction of a second for a pilot to become temporarily blinded and that could have catastrophic consequences . ”
The enemy now known as “ laser lunatics ” in Australia emerged in a string of incidents — mostly involving airline pilots , but also helicopters .
Earlier this month , a 23 - year - old man was sentenced to three years in prison for pointing his laser at another helicopter .
The judge echoed the dire viewpoint of today ’s officials , calling the crime “ a disaster in the making , ” The Associated Press said .
This all may sound vaguely familiar : the United States went through a similar fit in 2005 .
Then , the Federal Aviation Administration reported an astounding 287 cases of cockpits hit with laser beams , and the House of Representatives proposed a law against pointing the devices at planes , with fines up to $ 250,000 and prison terms up to five years .
But the proposed legislation , known as the Securing Aircraft Cockpits Against Lasers
Act of 2005 , stalled as the threat seemed to recede .
The aviation agency went on to create “ laser - free zones ” around airports , along with an application process for anyone who wants to stage a laser light show outdoors .
( Note to Vienna , Va. :
Make sure to file your papers 30 days before your brand new July 4th show . )
The stalling of the bill hardly stopped the authorities from pursuing suspected laser miscreants , however .
In January 2005 , federal authorities decided to “ make a point ” with David Banach of Parsippany , N.J. , as George James recounted in animated terms in The New York Times :
ON the face of it , the situation David Banach got himself into sounds like one of those off - the - wall plots from ” The Simpsons . ”
Homer orders this laser pen over the Internet and takes Lisa outside to flash it around the night sky .
It flashes on an aircraft .
They go into the house , and soon there is a banging on the door .
Homer opens it and — ” D’oh ! ” — there , in his front yard , are hordes of lawmen , including F.B.I. agents who arrest him for violation of the Patriot Act .
Homer gets flattened by John Ashcroft .
Mr. Banach faced up to 25 year in prison , but a judge decided a year later that two years ’ probation was enough punishment for “ a few moments of reckless action in an otherwise blameless life . ”
Today , those were precisely the moments that inspired Australian officials to drop their tolerance for lasers .

The world 's biggest oil company emerged bruised but victorious from a bust - up with the billionaire Rockefeller family today as an effort to foist green initiatives on ExxonMobil failed to capture wholehearted support from shareholders .
Preliminary figures suggested that 39.5 % of Exxon 's investors backed a motion demanding the appointment of an independent chairman to stimulate debate about global warming on the company 's board .
A resolution calling on Exxon to set limits on its operations ' greenhouse gas emissions won 30.9 % support , while a proposal to adopt a policy backing renewable energy only captured 27.4 % of shareholders ' votes .
The poll , at the company 's annual meeting in Dallas , demonstrated that a sizeable chunk of Exxon 's investor base is uncomfortable with the Texas - based company 's hardline attitude towards climate change and alternative energy .
But the environmental vote barely budged from last year 's level , in a disappointment to the Rockefellers who have since campaigned vigorously for change .
The family describes itself as Exxon 's longest standing shareholder – the company 's roots lie in the Standard Oil exploration empire which was founded by their ancestor , John D Rockefeller .
A smattering of protesters wielded banners outside the meeting in Dallas with slogans such as " people before profits " and " oil : the new black death " .
A small plane flew overhead urging a boycott of the company and police used bomb - sniffing dogs to heighten security .
Exxon 's chairman and chief executive , Rex Tillerson , assured critics that he took all of their contributions seriously and that he accepted that environmental attacks were delivered in good faith .
He insisted the company was awake to the challenge of climate change : " We have the same concern as people around the world – to provide the world with its energy needs while reducing harmful emissions . "
But Tillerson repeated Exxon 's mantra that the demand for energy is set to rise 40 % by 2030 – and that oil and gas will be needed to satisfy 60 % of this sum .
Arguing that wind , solar and biofuels lack technological scale , he said the way to make " meaningful environmental improvements " was to find more efficient ways of delivering existing fuels .
His remarks failed to satisfy a large contingent of environmental advocates .
One speaker , Stephen Viederman , accused Exxon 's directors of checking in their responsibilities as parents and grandparents at the boardroom door .
" Exxon is acting like a dinosaur in not adapting to a changing environment .
ExxonMobil - asaurus will disappear , " said Viederman .
A Franciscan friar from Milwaukee , Michael Crosby , quoted a German proverb , " it was always this way " , to sum up Exxon 's attitude .
" But it is n't always going to be this way and we know it , " said Father Crosby .
" Things are changing and we have to adapt in this company . "
Exxon 's assumptions of future energy consumption were questioned by members of the Rockefeller family who suggested that projected growth in demand from developing countries could not materialise if those nations face weather catastrophes from global warming .
Neva Rockefeller Goodwin , an economist , described Exxon 's approach as " significantly flawed " in failing to anticipate improvements in alternative fuels : " If energy technologies develop at the pace demonstrated by telecoms or the internet over past decades , they will seriously undermine Exxon 's assumptions in demand for petroleum . "
Exxon 's board stonewalled almost every question by simply referring shareholders to the company 's written responses .
A handful of speakers leapt to the board 's defence .
One investor , Ron Johnson , said his Exxon shares had risen 28 - fold in value since he bought them in 1979 and had helped to fund his two children through college .
" Some of our distinguished shareholder colleagues seem to have lost sight of why we hired you , " he told the board .
" That is , to make us money . "
Georgia Republican instructs House on proper Pledge of Allegiance technique David Edwards and Nick Juliano

No pause between ' one nation under god , ' lawmaker reminds A freshman Georgia Republican wanted to stress the importance of divine oversight of the US as he saw it portrayed in the Pledge of Allegiance .
Leading the pledge on the House floor Monday , Rep. Paul Broun lectured others in the chamber about the " correct way " of saying the pledge .
" There should not be a comma between ' one nation ' and ' under God , ' " Broun told his colleagues before beginning his rendition of a pause - free pledge .
It may seem a minor issue , but some have argued that saying the pledge as Broun prefers -- and as it was written when " under God " was inserted in 1954 -- implies a fealty to religion that is inappropriate in the US .
" Without a comma , the phrase indicates that the central characteristic of the United States as a political community is its subordination to God , " wrote history professor Matthew Dennis , after the Supreme Court rejected an attempt to strike " under God " as unconstitutional .
" In short , the political community is defined by its religious charge .
A pledge that states this becomes , in the words of the 9th Circuit , ' impermissible government endorsement of religion , ' functioning to ' enforce a religious orthodoxy of mono- theism . ' "
The pledge had no reference to a diety until 1954 , when Cold War fever saw its inclusion to separate Americans from " godless Communists . "
The Supreme Court dismissed a case arguing that the phrase violated the First Amendment 's guarantees of freedom of religion because the plaintiff had no standing to argue the case , not because of any inherent legal justification for the phrase .
A Broun spokesman even said there should be no pause to emphasize there is " no separation or implied separation between nation and God . "
So his House floor lesson may be more than just a penchant for details .
 As a Marine , clearly , hes had to face a lot more difficult challenges than instructing Members of Congress on the proper way of saying the Pledge of Allegiance ,  spokesman John Kennedy told Roll Call 's Heard on the Hill column .
 There is , in fact , no comma in that section .
So correctly , its said ,  One nation under [ God ] ,  no separation or implied separation between nation and God . 
A first - term lawmaker from the northeastern corner of Georgia , Broun 's House floor admonition was not his only attempt to insert God further into American life .
Last November , he supported a resolution honoring a group promoting the Ten Commandments .
" I commend the Ten Commandments Commission for their efforts to remind Americans that we are , in fact , ' one nation under God , ' " he said at the time .

Over the last several months , certain " inconsequential people " have been bothering , and harassing John Feal because of his associations with this movement .
They have pushed him to the point of saying things he does n't necessarily mean .
I have asked John for this clarification so there is no confusion as to where he stands .
- Jon
To the 9/11 Truth Movement :
Let me start by saying thank you for the years of support , compassion and dedication for the 9/11 responders you have helped .
With that being said , you have heard me say " I am not a truther , " and I 'm not .
However , that does not mean I do not support the truth movement .
To be a truther , I would have to be involved and committed 100 % like I am in running my foundation which helps yesterday 's heroes .
I have seen your cause grow immensely and you have gathered an army of great Americans who now share your beliefs .
That deserves a big congratulations .
I , however , have my reservations at this time to share my views any more then I already have .
But , if you look at my track record , in interviews with Luke or Dylan , you will see my subtle hints .
So yes , I strongly believe , as Jon Gold says , that elements within our government and the current administration are suspects for the crime of 9/11 .
Did they lie ?
Oh yes , I believe that 100 % .
There are sick and dying men and woman to prove that .
My energies are focused and spent on aiding these brave souls .
We all seek the truth , and we all seek what is best for this country .
However , we take different paths in searching and fighting for that common goal .
I have publicly called out many elected officials on my terms , and have marched to my own beat .
I have earned that right to do so .
I lost half a foot , and spent 11 weeks in a hospital bed .
So , they way I go about bringing out the truth , or disseminating information may not be the way others do , or the way you wish I did .
But I will continue to do so , like you all continue to go about your course of actions .
Whether we agree or disagree , that is totally irrelevant .
As with any relationship , we must learn that we will not all agree on everything , and in order for that relationship too last , we must learn that the closest thing to a perfect relationship , even with our disagreements , is to respect one another .

This article traces the history of peer review of scientific publications , plotting the development of the process from its inception to its present - day application .
We discuss the merits of peer review and its weaknesses , both perceived and real , as well as the practicalities of several major proposed changes to the system .
It is our hope that readers will gain a better appreciation of the complexities of the process and , when serving as reviewers themselves , will do so in a manner that will enhance the utility of the exercise .
We also propose the development of an international on - line training program for accreditation of potential referees .
scientific peer review has been defined as the evaluation of research findings for competence , significance , and originality by qualified experts ( 11 ) .
These peers act as sentinels on the road of scientific discovery and publication .
Their reviews attempt to ensure the quality of scientific information ( 49 ) , an act essential to reducing misinformation and confusion .
Although this process is now part and parcel of scientific publishing , it was not always thought to be necessary .
When the Journal des Scavans , the first collection of scientific essays , was introduced in 1665 by Denis de Sallo , there was no peer review process in place .
De Sallo's goal was to simply report the findings of others rather than guarantee their results ( 43 ) .
It was not until 1731 that the Royal Society of Edinburgh published Medical Essays and Observations , the first peer - reviewed collection of medical articles ( 43 ) .
In the first volume , the editor distributed the submitted essays for review to individuals he considered to be “ most versed in these matters ( 55 ) . ”
The Royal Society of Edinburgh recognized that the stamp of peer review did not necessarily mean the work was better than non-peer - reviewed publications .
The purpose of the journal was solely to disseminate creative and important ideas ; a disclaimer was provided stating that peer review did not guarantee truthfulness or accuracy .
As always , the submitting authors were ultimately responsible for the quality and veracity of their own research ( 43 ) .
The present - day peer review system evolved from this 18th century process .
However , there have been concerns raised about bias , fairness , unnecessary delay , and general ineffectiveness of the process .
Despite these shortcomings , peer review provides a formal opportunity for authors to gauge reaction to their work as well as allowing for the possible detection and subsequent correction of errors or flaws in logic prior to an article 's appearance in the public domain .
Thus , peer review infuses “ added value ” into a publication .
To better understand peer review , we examined the current process of peer review as well as its pros and cons and discuss proposed alternatives or modifications .
It is our hope that a thorough discussion of these issues will increase awareness of the nuances of peer review , thereby improving its utility and minimizing its weaknesses .
Development of Peer Review
The development of peer review was gradual and somewhat haphazard ( 12 ) .
Different editors employed varying styles of peer review .
For instance , the Lancet , pre-1976 , did not implement peer review as they considered it unimportant .
Some journals , such as the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) , sent their submissions through an internal review panel and , on rare occasions , would send manuscripts to outside experts ( 55 ) .
The British Medical Journal , however , sent every noneditorial submission to a recognized expert by at least 1893 ( 12 ) .
By the late 20th century , peer review became institutionalized and is currently utilized by most biomedical journals .
During this time , many journals embraced peer review in response to the increased specialization within each area of research and the increased competition among journals for manuscript submission ( 55 ) .
Over time , most researchers came to view peer review as the imprimatur for research articles .
The modern peer review system has evolved from its 18th century roots , and there is considerable variation in its application ( 28 , 40 ) .
In general , it now embodies a process of systematically distributing , evaluating , and reaching a consensus on the merits of submitted manuscripts as evidenced by publication acceptance or rejection .
The cornerstones of this process are the editors and expert reviewers ( 35 , 67 ) .
Editor and Reviewer Responsibilities
Editors and reviewers have ultimate authority over a manuscript 's fate , with editors primarily directing manuscript management and reviewers conducting manuscript assessment ( 38 ) .
Editors direct the process by selecting reviewers and communicating with authors and reviewers as well as by making the final decision on publication ( 61 ) .
Reviewers are selected based on their expertise and availability .
Editors seek to balance the needs of their readers to receive only the most relevant information while providing a level of manuscript evaluation to authors that promotes continued submission in the face of stringent acceptance criteria .
Expert reviewers focus on detecting technical and stylistic flaws within the manuscript , determining the novelty of the study , and making a recommendation of acceptance , rejection , or revision .
They examine technical attributes as well as scientific quality , clarity of presentation , and ethical validity .
Ideally , they do so in a manner consistent with ethical practices and journal guidelines ( 7 ) .
Reviewers donate substantial amounts of time and energy , frequently reviewing for multiple publications without remuneration ( 48 , 68 ) .
Reviewers must provide timely feedback to editors and , as consulted experts , are frequently the de facto determiner for manuscript publication acceptance or rejection ( 61 ) .
The motivation for reviewers and editors to participate in the peer review process has also evolved with time ( 37 , 43 ) .
In the beginning , reviewers and editors were motivated to contribute in return for prestige and fame .
Today , this reward continues , augmented with the additional motive of determining the quality and direction of research in a particular area ( 37 ) .
With widespread acceptance of peer review in the scientific community , manuscripts are not held in high esteem if they do not first pass through this process .
A Manuscript's Gauntlet
There are two key acceptance / rejection strata a manuscript must navigate following submission : the editorial level and the reviewer level ( 28 ) .
At first submission , editors can summarily reject a manuscript as inappropriate for their target audience or for a variety of other reasons .
Although statistics vary widely by journal , up to 10 % of manuscripts are rejected at this point ( 28 ) .
If the manuscript is deemed suitable by the editor , it advances to the expert reviewer stage .
The number of reviewers is typically limited , with journals averaging two reviewers per manuscript ( 67 ) .
The reviewer 's comments and recommendations are returned to the editor , who makes the decision to accept or reject the manuscript , often relying solely on the reviewers ' recommendations .
The manuscript can be accepted without revision , accepted with revision , or rejected .
If a revision is requested , there is no guarantee of acceptance , and the manuscript may be rejected again after revision .
Final acceptance / rejection rates for publication vary widely between scientific journals ; in some instances , manuscript rejection can be as high as 90 % ( 28 ) .
Assessing the Benefits of Peer Review
To assess the influence of peer review on manuscript quality , an attempt was made to quantitatively characterize changes to manuscripts submitted to the Annals of Internal Medicine by performing line - by - line comparisons of published articles with the submitted versions .
Substantive changes to manuscripts occurred in five major categories : too much information , too little information , inaccurate information , misplaced information , and structural problems ( 54 ) .
Another study of articles in the same journal measured manuscript quality using a 34 - question instrument ( 27 ) .
Forty - four blinded physicians and epidemiologists examined manuscripts using the questionnaire ; 97 % of questionnaire items indicated improvement after editing and peer review .
Four of the thirty - four items showed statistically significant improvement : discussion of limitations , acknowledgement and justification of generalizations , strength or tone of conclusions , and the use of confidence intervals .
Although reviewer perception of the overall quality of manuscripts did not change significantly , the objective measures probed by this questionnaire indicated otherwise .
While this study indicates that the process is effective , the reliability of the 34 - question instrument was low , and the study failed to differentiate between the effects of peer review and the effects of copy editing ( 27 ) .
Beyond the reviewers and readers of a paper , Wellen ( 66 ) reported that the majority of authors felt that their manuscript 's quality was enhanced after peer review .
Specifically , authors felt that manuscript content improved 37.2 % of the time , organization improved 22.6 % of the time , and conclusions were clearer 18.2 % of the time .
Assessing the Imperfections of Peer Review
Despite peer review 's acceptance within the research community , concerns have been raised about its overall effectiveness .
Criticisms directed at the peer review process include bias toward certain authors , inability to detect major flaws , unnecessary delays in publication , and inability to uncover corruption / scientific misconduct .
These concerns , especially the last , have weakened the scientific community 's faith in the review process ( 47 ) .
The most troublesome flaws in the peer review process are exposed by the increasingly frequent cases highlighting the inability of peer review to expose and minimize legal and ethical problems .
High - profile cases such as those discussed by Cantekin et al. ( 15 ) present a quagmire of issues including reviewer bias , reviewer conflict of interest , breach of confidentiality , disclosure of funding sources , intellectual property rights , and the proper venue for publication of dissenting viewpoints .
Peer Review and Bias
Bias may be defined as systematic prejudice that prevents the accurate and objective interpretation of scientific studies ( 57 ) .
Common perceived biases include those in status , gender , and research attitudes ( 47 ) .
For example , favoring prominent researchers from well - reputed institutions seemed to be confirmed by the much - cited study by Peters and Ceci ( 16 ) , which blinded reviewers to published papers from well - known research groups and found high rates of manuscript rejection based on scientific grounds .
However , a study conducted by the Journal of Pediatrics indicated that while there was an association between high institutional status and acceptance of brief reports , this relationship was not observed in the acceptance rates of regular articles ( 22 ) .
The presence of gender bias among reviewers also has been debated .
In 1990 , Lloyd ( 46 ) conducted an experiment in which she requested reviews of identical manuscripts with authors ' names that were obviously male or female .
In this relatively small cohort , female - authored manuscripts were accepted significantly more often by female reviewers ( 62 % ) than by male reviewers ( 21 % ) .
Male reviewers did not discriminate between male - or female - authored manuscripts in terms of acceptance rate ( 20–30 % ) .
Female reviewers were also significantly less likely to accept the male version of the paper ( 10 % ) compared with the female version ( 62 % ) .
Gilbert et al. ( 23 ) assessed gender bias at JAMA in a retrospective cohort study of 1,851 articles .
While gender differences in reviewer and editor practices were observed , there was no measurable effect of gender on the final recommendation for publication or on the ultimate acceptance of papers .
Interestingly , female editors had larger workloads and were more likely to reject manuscripts summarily .
When examining sexism in the peer review process as applied to funding , Grant et al. ( 28 ) found that peer - reviewed Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council grants were awarded to men and women at approximately the same rate .
The objectivity of editors and reviewers can also be jeopardized by ideological differences , avoidance of unconventional ideas , and conflicts of interest .
Reviewers may allow their beliefs to influence their reviews ( 32 ) .
For example , two papers differing only in their conclusions about the effects of maternal availability during childhood were created ( 32 ) .
The likelihood of acceptance or rejection depended largely on the reviewers ' views on the subject .
It has also been suggested that editors or reviewers look unfavorably upon manuscripts containing unconventional ideas .
Two often - cited examples are Hans Krebs ' description of the citric acid cycle and Barbara McClintock 's description of mobile gene elements , both of which were rejected by Nature ( 39 ) .
Both authors later won the Nobel Prize for their respective findings .
Avoidance of avant garde and controversial topics by reviewers and editors could hamper the advance of science .
Unconventional ideas can prevail over time when based on good science , but the peer review system can , and perhaps should , make that process challenging .
Another source of bias in peer review is conflict of interest .
By definition , a conflict of interest ( COI ) occurs when participants in the publication process have personal interests that could inappropriately influence their judgment , regardless of whether or not their judgment is actually affected ( 25 ) .
COIs arise from a variety of relationships including financial and personal considerations , intellectual passions , and academic competition .
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors has determined that of these , financial considerations are the most prevalent ( 21 , 36 ) .
These instances may involve employment , consultations , stock ownership , honoraria , expert testimony , and funding ( 42 ) .
Authors , reviewers , and editors may be less critical of manuscripts describing a method or product in which they hold personal interest , and companies may attempt to block publications that reflect negatively on their products ( 20 ) .
The rise in academia - industry relationships contributes to an environment in which editors or reviewers may behave in ways that increase their personal or financial gains ( 10 ) .
Editors and reviewers may be less critical of research from friends , collaborators , or scientists that agree with their beliefs or research .
The opposite can occur if a reviewer encounters a manuscript from an investigator who supports a competing idea or one that is personally disliked .
In some cases , reviewers or editors might benefit by delaying publication of data from another laboratory if they work on closely related topics .
Because of the secretive nature of the current peer review system in which reviewers ' identities are kept hidden from authors , COIs are difficult to detect .
Any conflicts must be reported by reviewers themselves .
In 2001 , at the Fourth International Conference on Peer Review in Biomedical Publication , Fiona Godlee of Biomed Central stated that in some cases , open ( i.e. , unblinded ) peer review has helped detect reviewers ' undisclosed competing interests ( 51 ) .
The British Medical Journal is currently utilizing a system of signed reviews , and the only “ adverse effects ” reported involved authors exposing reviewers ' COIs and some reviewers opting not to participate ( 50 ) .
Fraud and the Peer Review Process
A major perceived failure of the peer review system is its inability to detect fraud ( 1 , 30 , 31 ) .
Scientists and the general public expect a peer - reviewed publication to be free of dishonesty .
However , peer review cannot necessarily ensure that a paper is truthful .
It can only claim that it is worth publishing ( 19 ) .
The public disclosure of scientific transgressions by Korean stem cell biologist Wook Suk Hwang ( 33 ) , who falsely claimed to have created 11 human embryonic stem cell lines , highlighted the failures of peer review in detecting intentional misconduct .
In the case of Hwang , the fraud was wrought so skillfully that it is perhaps unfair to blame the reviewers for failure to detect it .
Unfortunately , blatant fraud passes through as well .
Jan Hendrick Schon was a prolific young researcher at Bell Laboratories , publishing 100 papers between 1998 and 2002 with virtually no assistance ( 45 ) .
Several of his papers had significant impact and were regarded as major breakthroughs in multiple areas of solid - state physics .
Readers later found that reviewers had failed to uncover gross anomalies , such as noise - free electrical data and identical data representing separate experiments in the same paper .
The fraud evaded both an internal peer review process at Bell Laboratories and the reviewers of high profile journals such as Nature and Science .
An in - depth inquiry by Bell Laboratories later identified 16 cases of scientific misconduct among 24 allegations raised ( 6 ) .
While this inquiry was admirable , the fact remains that this fraud was not caught by the reviewers , resulting in a loss of credibility for the scientific community as a whole .
Reviewers may benefit from a written cue to assess possibility of fraud ( e.g. , a question on the standard Review Form may read : “ There is no indication of fraudulent data in this manuscript : yes , no ” ) .
Outright fraud is likely very rare and therefore may not warrant implementation of systems to safeguard against it .
The vast majority of researchers do not purposefully create fraudulent data for publication .
Unfortunately , the identification by peer review of methodological and statistical shortcomings in manuscripts is also limited .
For example , in a 1998 experiment , eight weaknesses were introduced intentionally into a research article ( 26 ) .
The manuscript was sent to over 200 reviewers who , on average , identified only 2 of these weakness ( 26 ) .
Callaham et al. ( 14 ) also reported that reviewers could not spot two - thirds of the major errors introduced into a fake manuscript .
A “ white paper ” on the peer review process from the perspective of integrity has just been published ( 59 ) .
Many factors seem to contribute to these inadequacies in the peer review process , not the least of which are time limitations and reviewer burnout .
Reviewers sometimes base their judgments on cues that have only a weak relation to quality such as statistical significance , large sample size , complex procedures , so - called “ negative ” data , and obscure writing ( 3 ) .
Atkinson et al. ( 5 ) conducted an experiment to determine whether reviewers place too much emphasis on statistical significance .
They prepared three versions of a bogus manuscript where identical findings differed only by the degree of statistical significance .
The reviewers recommended rejection of the paper with nonsignificant findings three times as often as those with significant findings .
Although Atkinson et al. ( 5 ) criticize reviewers for being unduly influenced by minor or false cues , such as lack of statistical significance , they themselves do not acknowledge that nonsignificant results may negatively impact the novelty of an article , a critical assessment criterion for manuscript quality ( 7 , 8 ) .
Regardless , reviewers are expected to identify flaws , suggest improvements , assess novelty , and improve the quality of the manuscript instead of letting false cues hinder their better judgment ( 7 , 8 ) .
Obscure or complex writing on complicated procedures should not fool a reviewer into misjudging the scientific caliber of a manuscript ( 4 ) .
Unfortunately , these false cues and biases are common enough to warrant improvements in the conduct of peer review .
Delay Caused by Peer Review
Scientific research and peer review are costly and time consuming .
A year or more may pass before enough data are generated to warrant submitting one 's work for publication .
A manuscript is rarely accepted for publication after the initial submission .
Thus , authors invariably modify their manuscripts .
After these modifications , the author(s ) may resubmit the work and hope for a more favorable review .
In rapidly moving fields , scientists may allocate funds to a particular line of experiments only to be scooped .
This concern has been somewhat alleviated by the World Wide Web , as publication is expedited by its appearance online within hours or days of acceptance .
The Need for Peer Review
Despite the difficulties and flaws discussed above , the process of peer review serves an important role in scientific publication .
Abolishment of the review process would have significant repercussions .
One major consequence would be the lack of an opportunity to respond to criticisms raised by experts prior to publication .
In our opinion , this alone is sufficient reason to preserve peer review .
After initial publication , authors may not be motivated to clarify or substantiate certain aspects of their research .
In one study , the primary authors of three manuscripts responded to < 50 % of comments and criticisms in an open - review format ( 34 ) .
In another study conducted by the Medical Journal of Australia , only 7 of 56 manuscripts were modified in response to comments made by internet readers of accepted ( but not yet published ) manuscripts ( 9 ) .
Moreover , only 2 % of those reading posted manuscripts replied with specific comments .
This low rate of reader feedback may lead to inadequate scrutiny before a study 's findings become widely available to the scientific community .
The loss of the “ added value ” provided by formal peer review could be monumental .
In no arena is the danger of abolishing peer review greater than in clinical care .
With the increasing availability of primary research to the public , publication of articles that have not been properly scrutinized by experts could compromise the health and treatment of patients .
Some groups even advocate a second line of peer review to transition more appropriately scientific findings into clinical practice guidelines ( 29 ) .
Loss of peer review in this environment would undercut important patient safety protections .
Finally , the loss of a formalized peer review process may possibly increase the number of fraudulent studies .
While there is no significant research that speaks specifically to this issue , the loss of critical examination of a submitted manuscript by a group of experts would remove a deterrent to the submission of dubious publications .
In fact , Dr. Lawrence Altman , a science writer for the New York Times , states that , “ editors of the journals and many scientists consider the system 's expense and time consumption worthwhile in the belief that it weeds out shoddy work and methodological errors and blunts possible biases by scientific investigators ” ( 2 ) .
Changes to Peer Review
With peer review so ingrained in the publication process , it would be impractical , detrimental , and unwise to abolish it .
The past few decades have seen many proposed changes , with blinding , unmasking , and open review being the most prominent .
Before embarking on a discussion of these changes , a common vocabulary should be established .
Currently , in the most widely adopted form of peer review , reviewers of a manuscript are not blind to authors and their affiliations , although the reviewers ' identities are masked from authors and from other reviewers .
Blinding is then defined as the process of hiding the identity and affiliations of the authors of a manuscript .
Unmasking is defined as identifying the reviewers to the authors or to the other reviewers .
Reviewers can also sign their review , attaching their name or critique to a manuscript , making themselves known to the author .
In the literature , blinding and masking are often used interchangeably .
An “ open ” review process is one that allows a larger group of reviewers , generally described as the public , to comment upon and critique a manuscript that is already published , usually online .
This can be coupled with unmasking to create a completely transparent process .
We will discuss the purpose of these proposed modifications , perceived benefits , perceived difficulties , and relevant data and conclude with an analysis of possible modifications .
Blinding aims to remove reviewer bias from the peer review process .
It is a logical extension of the blinding process used in experimental design .
By removing the names and affiliations of the authors from a manuscript , any bias for or against an author or institution will be removed or reduced .
Theoretically , Nobel laureates from elite institutions and budding researchers from lesser - known schools will be treated equally .
Although this seems fair and logical , in practice it is very difficult to achieve complete blinding .
Data regarding blinding are somewhat conflicted .
McNutt et al. ( 52 ) studied the effect of blinding reviewers to author identity and found that the quality of reviews , as measured by the editors , was improved by blinding reviewers .
They also found that they were successful in blinding the reviewers 73 % of the time .
However , the improved quality of the reviews may have been due to the reviewers working more diligently because they were aware that they were involved in a research study .
When van Rooyen et al. ( 64 , 65 ) studied the effects of blinding and unmasking in a relatively large , randomly controlled trial , they found no significant differences in quality of reviews , recommendations for publication , or time taken to review the manuscript .
However , in their cohort , removing the authors ' details from the title page and acknowledgments led to successful blinding only 51.2 % of the time ( 65 ) .
Self - referential writing and small research fields were the most commonly given reasons for unsuccessful blinding .
A more rigorous study by Cho et al. ( 18 ) examining the success of blinding found that removing only the authors ' names and institutional affiliations was successful in blinding reviewers about 60 % of the time .
Interestingly , compared with the reviewers who were able to identify the authors despite blinding , those reviewers who were successfully blinded to authors spent less time conducting research , published less often , and had less experience reviewing , qualities that suggest inexperience or unfamiliarity with the research area .
In 1984 , the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise evaluated the responses of 222 authors ( 111 accepted and 111 rejected manuscripts ) on the blind review system ( 62 ) .
They found that the majority of authors favored the blind review system .
Notably , the authors indicated that their present and past status as an investigator at their current or previous location had little influence on the editorial decision .
Sidestepping the issue of successful blinding , Godlee et al. ( 26 ) modified a previously published article by intentionally introducing weaknesses and examined the effects of blinding reviewers or authors and the signing of reviews on the ability of a referee to detect errors .
They found no significant difference between the qualities of the reviews , as measured by the number of errors found , but found that blinded reviewers were more likely to recommend the weakened article be published .
However , the reviewers were not experts on the subject , and this fact could have confounded the results .
Although blinding manuscripts is difficult , removing identifying material from an abstract is relatively simpler as there are fewer concerns regarding self - referential citations .
Ross et al. ( 56 ) studied the effect of blinding on abstract acceptance to the American Heart Association 's annual research meeting .
They found that when reviewers were not blinded to authors ' identity , there was a bias for authors from American institutions , those from prestigious institutions , and authors from countries where English was the official language .
By blinding reviewers , these biases were significantly attenuated .
However , the review process for abstracts and manuscripts is very different .
Much like Ross ' work , a study conducted at the Journal of Pediatrics indicated an association between high institutional status and acceptance of brief reports .
However , this relationship was not observed for acceptance rates of major papers ( 22 ) .
Regardless , these results do suggest that blinding may be useful in reducing bias , at least in some circumstances .
Perhaps the truest test of the quality of an article lies in how often it is cited , a reasonable proxy for the impact of the paper on the scientific community .
A retrospective study ( 44 ) of 28 economic journals from 1984 to 1989 found that articles published in a blinded review process were cited more than articles published in a nonblinded review process .
However , interpreting this study is difficult because blinding success rates were unknown .
Although data regarding the effects of blinding are conflicted , the logic behind blinding appears solid .
While scientists strive to be objective , they are human .
Removing identifiers such as names and institutions should minimize the bias of interpersonal relationships .
The major negative aspect of blinding , as shown by Godlee et al. ( 26 ) , is that reviewers may be more likely to recommend publication of a poor quality manuscript when they are blinded .
To make the process of blinding more successful , appropriate procedural changes can abe made .
Authors should be directed to minimize self - referential writing , as it appears to be one of the most common reasons for unsuccessful blinding ( 65 ) .
It should be relatively straightforward to design software that can parse a text , highlight phrases that are self - referential ( such as “ we have shown ” ) , and alert an editor to a possible cause of unblinding .
Some journals have already assimilated blinding into their regular practices .
For example , the American Journal of Roentgenology uses author and referee blinding in reviewing its > 1,700 yearly submitted manuscripts ( http://www.ajronline.org/).
It should also be noted that blinding does not alleviate all types of publication bias .
Removing an author 's name cannot remove biases against unconventional methodology , radical new ideas , negative results , or results that contradict a reviewer 's viewpoints .
While blinding articles is a simple step that could be taken to reduce bias and slightly improve review quality , the literature does not suggest that it is required for quality review of manuscripts ( 22 ) .
Furthermore , more data are needed to determine whether or not blinding could have the unintended consequence of hiding conflicts of interest from reviewers .
Should a possible COI on the part of the authors be revealed to reviewers and if so when ?
Research by Chaudhry et al. ( 17 ) shows that a statement of competing interests leads readers to feel that an article is less interesting , important , relevant , valid , and believable than that same article without a COI statement .
As a growing number of researchers and institutions begin patenting intellectual property for future commercial applications , it is imperative that the scientific community address how COI statements should be handled in the peer review process .
The federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology has made a major step in this regard by releasing a white paper on COI ( http://opa.faseb.org/pdf/FASEB_COI_paper.pdf).
Unmasking identifies reviewers to the authors or to the other reviewers .
On the positive side , this would reduce the ability of reviewers to hide COIs and would increase the transparency of the entire process because reviewer identity would at least be known to another reviewer .
If reviews were signed , the reviewers would open themselves to criticism and likely conduct a more thorough review .
In some cases , reviewer COIs could be detected more easily .
On the other hand , unmasking or signing of reviews may also cause reviewers to be less critical of some works .
Older , more established authors could enact retribution on younger , less established reviewers who were perceived as being overly critical .
Thus , masking reviewers may serve to protect the reviewers and the process of review .
As mentioned earlier , van Rooyen et al. ( 64 , 65 ) studied the effects of unmasking the identity of a reviewer to their coreviewer .
Their group found no significant differences in the quality of reviews as assessed by editors .
In another study , the effects of unmasking reviewers to the authors of a manuscript was examined ( 63 ) .
Again , there were no significant differences in the quality of reviews .
However , reviewers were 12 % more likely to decline to review if the process were unmasked .
When surveying authors of manuscripts , 55 % were in favor of asking reviewers to sign , whereas only 26 % were against it ( with the rest being indifferent ) .
When Godlee et al. ( 26 ) studied the effect of having reviewers sign their names to reviews , there were no significant differences in the quality of reviews as assessed by their ability to detect errors in the manuscript .
However , in this study and in another unpublished pilot study , half of the reviewers declined to sign their name when asked to .
Another study showed that reviewers who signed their reviews were more courteous and constructive in their criticism , as assessed by editors ( 52 ) .
Manuscript authors observed no significant differences except that they perceived the signed reviews to be slightly fairer .
However , signers were more likely to recommend publication and rate the manuscript higher than nonsigners ( 52 ) .
A survey of reviewers for Medical Education found that while 73 % were not averse to signing their reviews , only a minority actually signed ( 60 ) .
First - time reviewers were also more likely to be unwilling or unsure of signing , possibly suggesting a lack of confidence in the quality of their reviews or fear of possible retribution due to a negative critique .
The data suggest that unmasking reviewers or having them sign their reviews has no beneficial effects in terms of quality or strength of the review .
It does , however , make reviewers more likely to decline to review a manuscript .
Although scientists may not have a problem with signing reviews in surveys , reviewers appear to prefer signing a review recommending publication ( 52 , 60 ) .
This adds credence to the idea that signed reviews correlate with positive reviews .
With that stated , more transparency in the review process may make authors feel better , but the lack of any measurable quality benefit and the increased difficulty in securing expert reviewers outweigh any perceived benefit .
An open review process serves two main functions : it makes research available immediately and it allows multiple people to comment upon a manuscript .
Proponents of this method state that open review will increase the quality of manuscripts , disseminate information faster , and reduce the burden on reviewers .
Currently , some journals have adopted or are experimenting with this method of review .
For example , Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics ( ACP ) uses an open two - stage review process in which a manuscript is made available online immediately , commented upon by designated reviewers and interested scientists , revised if needed , and then sent through a shorter , traditional review process ( 41 ) .
This open review process , while transparent , still allows reviewers to choose to be anonymous , with about two - thirds of the reviewers remaining hidden .
However , scientists choosing to comment on the paper during the first stage must sign their comments .
The editors of this journal report that , despite their low rejection rate of ∼ 20 % , they are ranked 12th of 169 journals in the combined areas of meteorology and atmospheric sciences and environmental sciences according to impact factor ( 41 ) .
This appears to support the argument that either higher quality manuscripts are submitted to a journal utilizing an open review process or that the process itself improves the manuscript significantly .
However , the appropriate experimental design has not been applied to test rigorously this supposition .
The journal Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence ( ETAI ) also divides the peer review process into two stages : a completely transparent reviewing stage and a refereeing stage ( 58 ) .
As soon as it is decided that the paper falls within the scope of ETAI 's readership , the manuscript is published electronically by an organization affiliated with ETAI .
This protects the authors from theft of their intellectual property .
There is at least a 3 - mo period during which members of the community can comment on the paper .
Unlike ACP , all commenters / reviewers must sign their comments .
These comments are then screened by an editor to ensure that they are relevant and pass a basic quality threshold .
After this discussion period , authors may revise the paper , and it can then be submitted to the referees , who decide whether or not the paper should be published with a simple pass / fail .
If it passes , the article is published in an issue of the journal .
If it fails , it remains published electronically , but the article is not published by the journal .
According to the general editor of ETAI , Erik Sandewall , authors report favorably on the process ( 58 ) .
Criticism , positive or negative , is welcome because it draws attention to the manuscript .
It is problematic , however , that two versions of basically the same work exist in the published record .
Both of these journals ( ACP and ETAI ) do not unmask the people who decide whether or not a paper is publication worthy .
They allow for signed comments and signed peer review , but they do not ask referees to cast open votes upon articles .
This does not remove any bias , perceived or real , by referees or editors .
Thus , these forms of open review , while alleviating delays and increasing transparency , will not attenuate perceptions of bias at the actual acceptance step of the process .
The Future of Peer Review
Well - organized forms of free information exchange exist today and may provide useful models for scientific publication .
Wikipedia , an online encyclopedia that allows individuals to submit and edit information on any topic of their choosing , offers an interesting case study on this topic .
Because entries in Wikipedia can be altered by anyone with access to the internet , one would reason that the information contained within it may lack a significant degree of accuracy .
However , it was found to have roughly the same percent accuracy as Encyclopedia Britannica , which employs a board of 14 editors , all of whom are considered experts in their respective fields ( 21 , 24 ) .
Biology Direct is another example of an alternative peer review system .
The system is faster than the conventional system : a paper is published once three editors agree to formally critique it .
Its transparency reveals COIs , because reviewers ' names and comments are published alongside the article .
This transparency allows readers to judge for themselves whether poor reviews were deserved .
It also enables authors to defend their work , because they can post rebuttals alongside the reviews .
Additionally , Biology Direct encourages controversial publications .
Therefore , Biology Direct is an example of an alternative to peer review that is currently being used to publish original biomedical research and may provide some clues about how to improve the conventional system of peer review ( http://www.biology-direct.com).
Ideally , a process that minimizes bias , promotes discussion , reduces time to publication , decreases variability in the peer review process , and increases overall quality of work without stifling new and radical ideas should be adopted .
At the very least , training of reviewers in the nuances of how to review a manuscript and provide useful critiques to both the authors and editors should be formally instituted for every journal .
Designing a structured , standardized training course for reviewers would define protocols for reviewing , proper criteria to apply , and common pitfalls to avoid .
Several journals , such as Annals of Emergency Medicine , the American Journal of Roentgenology , the American Journals of Physiology , and the British Medical Journal ( http://www.bmj.com/advice/peer_review/) have available training material for their reviewers ( 8 , 13 , 53 ) .
However , a simple training protocol will likely not be enough to ensure that reviews remain standardized and unbiased .
Mock papers at regular intervals can serve to easily assay the quality of reviews , and regular quizzes or newsletters can be used to reinforce important key points .
This relatively simple process would likely resolve many difficulties that are encountered by editors , reviewers , and authors .
Nonetheless , we propose that organizations of biomedical journal editors , like the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors or the Council of Science Editors , develop an on - line reviewer accreditation course , following the template already prepared by the British Medical Journal .
An attempt to design an ideal peer review process must accept a priori that manuscripts will vary in quality and impact .
However , instead of attempting to bury the lower end of the curve by rejecting manuscripts , the goal should be to shift the distribution toward higher quality manuscripts .
To this end , a hybrid open review process may be a solution .
Erik Sandewall , editor of ETAI , notes that the issue of intellectual property theft must be addressed in a true open - review process ( 58 ) .
However , most journals frown on republishing data that are already publicly available .
This problem can be sidestepped by limiting access to a manuscript to the entire cohort of reviewers and editors of a journal .
The entire group could comment on any article that piques their interest while a group of three to five reviewers assigned by an editor would provide a formal review .
Those choosing to comment should be allowed anonymity if they desire while the formal reviewers must always be allowed anonymity .
However , both comments and formal reviews should be available to all members of the reviewing group .
The formal review process should provide feedback in written format while also providing numeric scores to track reviewer scoring patterns .
Authors would be able to access and respond to comments and reviews of their manuscripts , with the handling editor moderating and ultimately adjudicating the decision .
This system will allow for helpful discourse in a relatively open format while providing referees anonymity to critique papers fully and without repercussion .
Authors will be able to discuss their papers in an open forum and directly interact with reviewers .
If so desired , editors may choose to strip the article of identifying content , such as names , institutions , and self - referential statements , to attempt to blind the manuscript to the reviewing board .
If blinding is desired , authors should be instructed to minimize self - referential text .
During the review process , the authors could be assigned aliases and have their comments reviewed to ensure that their identities are not revealed during the discussion .
While some manuscripts may not garner as many comments as others , editors may be able to assess manuscript importance based on interest raised during the publishing process as well as comments of reviewers .
Also , using a numeric scoring system will allow editors to decrease variability and clarify scoring criteria when a reviewer 's scores are consistent outliers .
It will allow editors to evaluate editorial board member participation , timeliness , and quality .
These simple changes would make the process more transparent to authors and hopefully increase the overall quality of published manuscripts .
American Journal of Physiology publications would be an ideal place to experiment with such a plan , because one or more of its journals can be used to field test a new review process .
Conclusions
The process of peer review is steeped in tradition .
In the realm of innovation and science , tradition operates on a day - to - day basis .
The current system of peer review is not perfect , and , while most scientists believe it is necessary , indeed , desirable , the core assumptions inherent in the process must be evaluated and adapted to the changing environment .
While research has examined modifications to the process , biases , and other flaws , perhaps the purpose of peer review and some key assumptions should be examined .
For example , should manuscript peer review emphasize the validity of the science or its merit ?
While peer review is often viewed as the gatekeeper to the realm of truth , a staff of editors and reviewers cannot make that distinction in a few months .
In terms of interesting assumptions overlooked , does the process of peer review require a true peer or expert in the field ?
Would unfettered publishing of findings lead to more efficient or faster progress in science ?
What does the stamp of peer review mean to the readers of the literature ?
We hope that this essay serves to incite discussion upon the peer review debate .

Academic and research groups signed a letter urging Bush to remain open to using the supplemental appropriations bill to fund scientific research and education .
Science groups want war cash
With Congress entangled in another tussle over funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , it ’s easy to miss the universities , tech companies and scientists lobbying for a relatively small pot of money to finance scientific research they say is critical to maintaining America ’s technological edge .
The coalition has mobilized corporate executives , college presidents and scientists to seek a $ 500 million boost in this year ’s wartime supplemental funding bill to restore cuts to the National Science Foundation and prevent hundreds of layoffs from the Department of Energy ’s Office of Science .

The situation was n’t always so grim .
Last year , Congress and the Bush administration supported an increase of at least $ 1.2 billion for the two groups and the National Institute of Standards and Technology .
But the pumped - up funding fell victim to the year - end budget battle between congressional Democrats and President Bush , and the groups saw little or no increases , said Tobin Smith , associate vice president of federal relations for the Association of American Universities .
“ Last year , unfortunately , when the money did n’t get included , the administration blamed Congress .
Congress blamed the administration , and the community is left asking , ‘ When are they going to work together to solve a problem everyone has said must be solved ? ’ ” Smith said .
To press their case , thousands of scientists and engineers from 25 scientific societies called their representatives , senators and the White House last month .
The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology estimated its members alone made more than 5,000 calls , Smith said .
Earlier , university presidents also pressed their case in Washington and have been actively engaging their local lawmakers .
The technology community also rallied its troops .
About 10 frustrated corporate executives descended on Capitol Hill during a Semiconductor Industry Association meeting in March , an association spokeswoman said .
The CEOs pressed lawmakers and senior administration officials to support research funding and to move other gridlocked issues such as overhauling the immigration system for highly skilled workers and permanently extending the research and development tax credit , the spokeswoman said .
“ The business community is becoming disenchanted and thinks these statements [ of support by Congress and the White House ] are mere lip service , and there ’s no sense of urgency to provide the funding to back up what everyone says is important , ” Smith said .
Stakeholders have focused their efforts largely on House leaders and members of the House Appropriations Committee , said Amy Burke , government relations director for Texas Instruments .
And they have worked to identify and mobilize companies , federal labs and universities in key lawmakers ’ home districts .
Burke pointed to a letter sent to House leaders from Reps. Bart Gordon ( D - Tenn . ) and Ralph Hall ( R - Texas ) — chairman and ranking member , respectively , of the House Science and Technology Committee — as well as 29 other representatives who urged new funding “ to prevent the permanent loss of hundreds of our nation ’s best scientists and engineers ... [ and ] restart research critical to American innovation and competitiveness . ”
Nearly 250 business , academic and research groups signed a similar letter , urging Bush to remain open to using the supplemental appropriations bill to fund scientific research and education .
If research is n’t funded in the supplemental , supporters worry that this fall ’s elections will sidetrack Congress from passing the 2009 appropriations by year ’s end , leaving them without critical funding into next year .
“ This has to get turned around now , ” said Barry Toiv , spokesman for the university association .
“ If it does n’t happen in the supplemental , we worry it wo n’t happen for a long time . ”
My husband and I were keen to move as we are newly retired , having found our dream home we have been unable to sell our current house for over 6 months with the local estate agent !
BMH have been amazing to sell so quickly and get cash .
Very pleased to now be settled into our bungalow on the coast and the headache of prolonged selling solved by BMH .

When we brought news of the Stage Rack , a dock for raw SATA hard drives , you were pleased .
But where the Stage Rack only offered only a lone USB connection and compatibility with 2.5 " and 3.5 " SATA drives , Brando's take on the same concept is a lot more accommodating , and costs only a few bucks more .
As well as being able to slot a bare hard drive straight in , the Multi-Function Dock is also a four slot card reader ( for just about any format going ) and a two - port USB hub .
It even has an eSATA - out port , so you could wire this directly into the nervous system of your computer , or maybe the back of your own brain .
In common with the Stage Rack , the dock requires you to pay a ridiculous $ 25 shipping charge , bring the price up to $ 80 .
But for its utility , and for the fact that this will de-clutter your embarrassingly messy desk , it might be worth it .

D.C. police will seal off entire neighborhoods , set up checkpoints and kick out strangers under a new program that D.C. officials hope will help them rescue the city from its out - of - control violence .
Under an executive order expected to be announced today , police Chief Cathy L. Lanier will have the authority to designate “ Neighborhood Safety Zones . ”
At least six officers will man cordons around those zones and demand identification from people coming in and out of them .
Anyone who does n’t live there , work there or have “ legitimate reason ” to be there will be sent away or face arrest , documents obtained by The Examiner show .
Lanier has been struggling to reverse D.C. ’s spiraling crime rate but has been forced by public outcry to scale back several initiatives including her “ All Hands on Deck ” weekends and plans for warrantless , door - to - door searches for drugs and guns .
Under today ’s proposal , the no-go zones will last up to 10 days , according to internal police documents .
Front - line officers are already being signed up for training on running the blue curtains .
Peter Nickles , the city ’s interim attorney general , said the quarantine would have “ a narrow focus . ”
“ This is a very targeted program that has been used in other cities , ” Nickles told The Examiner .
“ I ’m not worried about the constitutionality of it . ”

Like video games ?
Want to also solve puzzles for science ?
A new game , named Foldit , turns protein folding into a competitive sport .
Introductory levels teach the rules , which are the same laws of physics by which protein strands curl and twist into three - dimensional shapes – key for biological mysteries ranging from Alzheimer 's to vaccines .
After about 20 minutes of training , people feel like they 're playing a video game but are actually mouse - clicking in the name of medical science .
Screesnhot .
Courtesy : Fold.it
The game was developed by doctoral student Seth Cooper and postdoctoral researcher Adrien Treuille , both in computer science and engineering , working with Zoran Popovic , a UW associate professor of computer science and engineering ; David Baker , a UW professor of biochemistry and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator ; and David Salesin , a UW professor of computer science and engineering .
Professional game designers provided advice during the game 's creation .
" We 're hopefully going to change the way science is done , and who it 's done by , " said Popovic , who presented the project today at the Games for Health meeting in Baltimore .
" Our ultimate goal is to have ordinary people play the game and eventually be candidates for winning the Nobel Prize . "
Proteins , of which there are more than 100,000 different kinds in the human body , form every cell , make up the immune system and set the speed of chemical reactions .
We know many proteins ' genetic sequence , but do n't know how they fold up into complex shapes whose nooks and crannies play crucial biological roles .
Computer simulators calculate all possible protein shapes , but this is a mathematical problem so huge that all the computers in the world would take centuries to solve it .
In 2005 , Baker developed a project named Rosetta@home that taps into volunteers ' computer time all around the world .
But even 200,000 volunteers are n't enough .
" There are too many possibilities for the computer to go through every possible one , " Baker said .
" An approach like Rosetta@home does well on small proteins , but as the protein gets bigger and bigger it gets harder and harder , and the computers often fail .
" People , using their intuition , might be able to home in on the right answer much more quickly . "
Rosetta@home and Foldit both use the Rosetta protein - folding software .
Foldit is the first protein - folding project that asks volunteers for something other than unused processor cycles on their computers or Playstation machines .
Foldit also differs from recent human - computer interactive games that use humans ' ability to recognize images or interpret text .
Instead , Foldit capitalizes on people 's natural 3 - D problem - solving skills .
The intuitive skills that make someone good at playing Foldit are not necessarily the ones that make a top biologist .
Baker says his 13 - year - old son is faster at folding proteins than he is .
Others may be even faster .
" I imagine that there 's a 12 - year - old in Indonesia who can see all this in their head , " Baker says .
Eventually , the researchers hope to advance science by discovering protein - folding prodigies who have natural abilities to see proteins in 3 - D .
" Some people are just able to look at the game and in less than two minutes , get to the top score , " said Popovic .
" They can't even explain what they 're doing , but somehow they 're able to do it . "
The game looks like a 21st - century version of Tetris , with multicolored geometric snakes filling the screen .
A team that includes a half - dozen UW graduate and undergraduate students spent more than a year figuring out how to make the game both accurate and engaging .
They faced some special challenges that commercial game developers do n't encounter .
" We do n't know what the best result is , so we can't help people or hint people toward that goal , " Popovic explained .
The team also could n't arbitrarily decide to make one move worth 1,000 bonus points , since the score corresponds to the energy needed to hold the protein in that shape .
Almost 1,000 players have tested the system in recent weeks , playing informal challenges using proteins with known shapes .
Starting this week , however , the developers will open the game to the public and offer proteins of unknown shapes .
Also starting this week , Foldit gamers will face off against research groups around the world in a major protein - structure competition held every two years .
Beginning in the fall , Foldit problems will expand to involve creating new proteins that we might wish existed – enzymes that could break up toxic waste , for example , or that would absorb carbon dioxide from the air .
Computers alone cannot design a protein from scratch .
The game lets the computer help out when it's a simple optimization problem – the same way that computer solitaire sometimes moves the cards to clean up the table – letting the player concentrate on interesting moves .
Eventually , the researchers hope to present a medical nemesis , such as HIV or malaria , and challenge players to devise a protein with just the right shape to lock into the virus and deactivate it .
Winning protein designs will be synthesized in Baker 's lab and tested in petri dishes .
High - scoring players will be credited in scientific publications the way that top Rosetta@home contributors already are credited for their computer time .
" Long - term , I 'm hoping that we can get a significant fraction of the world 's population engaged in solving critical problems in world health , and doing it collaboratively and successfully through the game , " Baker said .
" We 're trying to use the brain power of people all around the world to advance biomedical research . "
Foldit includes elements of multiplayer games in which people can team up , chat with other players and create online profiles .
Over time the researchers will analyze people 's moves to see how the top players solve puzzles .
This information will be fed back into the game 's design so the game 's tools and format can evolve .
The research is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Microsoft Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc. , and through fellowships at Nvidia Corp. and Intel Corp .
May 20 , 2008  -- U.S. military personnel at Guantanamo Bay allegedly softened up detainees at the request of Chinese intelligence officials who had come to the island facility to interrogate the men -- or they allowed the Chinese to dole out the treatment themselves , according to claims in a new government report .
Buried in a Department of Justice report released Tuesday are new allegations about a 2002 arrangement between the United States and China , which allowed Chinese intelligence to visit Guantanamo and interrogate Chinese Uighurs held there .
According to the report by Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine , an FBI agent reported a detainee belonging to China 's ethnic Uighur minority and a Uighur translator told him Uighur detainees were kept awake for long periods , deprived of food and forced to endure cold for hours on end , just prior to questioning by Chinese interrogators .
Susan Manning , a lawyer who represents several Uighurs still held at Guantanamo , said Tuesday the allegations are all too familiar .
U.S. personnel " are engaging in abusive tactics on behalf of the Chinese , " she said Tuesday .
When Uighur detainees refused to talk to Chinese interrogators in 2002 , U.S. military personnel put them in solitary confinement as punishment , she said .
" Why are we doing China 's dirty work ? "
Manning said .
" Surely we 're better than that . "
An official authorized to speak on behalf of the Defense Department but who declined to be named confirmed it was Pentagon policy to allow officials from other countries to have access to interview their nationals at Guantanamo but declined to discuss the specifics alleged in the report .
According to Fine 's report , the FBI agent said the Uighur detainee told him that the night before his interrogation by Chinese officials , " he was awakened at 15 - minute intervals the entire night and into the next day . "
The detainee also allegedly said he was " exposed to low room temperatures for long periods of time and was deprived of at least one meal . "
" The agent stated that he understood that the treatment of the Uighur detainees was either carried out by the Chinese interrogators or was carried out by U.S. personnel at the behest of Chinese interrogators , " the report by the Department of Justice inspector general stated .
U.S. forces captured roughly three dozen Uighurs in eastern Afghanistan shortly after invading the country in October 2001 .
The men said they were working there to earn money for families back home and to evade the Chinese government , which is known for taking a harsh and uncompromising line with separatist Uighurs .
The U.S. State Department has found China to have suppressed the religious freedom of Uighurs , who are Muslim , and has accused the Chinese government of persecuting , even executing , those who advocate Uighur independence .
In 2006 , after the United States released five Uighurs from Guantanamo , China asked for them to be repatriated so they could be prosecuted as terrorists .
The United States declined to do so , out of concern they would not be treated humanely .
Instead they transferred the men to Albania , which was the only country out of 90 approached by the U.S. government who would take them .
The Pentagon says it is trying to release and resettle the majority of the 17 Uighurs who remain in Guantanamo , although it says it still considers them enemy combatants and a threat .

FORT WAYNE , Indiana ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama sought to convince Americans he is not elitist on Thursday as new polls showed his aura of inevitability has declined after weeks of negative headlines .
In an interview on NBC ’s “ Today Show , ” Obama said both his rivals , Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican John McCain , come from more privileged backgrounds than he did .
“ The irony is , I think it is fair to say that both Michelle and I grew up in much less privileged circumstances than either of my two potential opponents , ” said Obama .
A flap over racially charged rhetoric from his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , and Obama ’s comments that small - town Americans “ cling ” to guns and religion , appears to have taken a toll on the Illinois senator as he fights for the right to face McCain in the November election .
A New York Times / CBS
News poll found that 51 percent of Democratic primary voters say they expect Obama to win their party ’s nomination battle against New York Sen.
Clinton , down from 69 percent a month ago .
The poll said 48 percent of Democrats say he is the candidate with the best chance of defeating Arizona Sen.
McCain , down from 56 percent a month ago .
Similarly , a Pew Research Center poll found a tighter national race between Obama and Clinton , with him holding a 47 percent to 45 percent lead over Clinton , down from 10 points a month ago .
“ The tightening Democratic race reflects a modest but consistent decline in Obama ’s personal image rather than improved impressions of Clinton , ” the poll said .
Clinton , campaigning in Brownsburg , Indiana , tried to perpetuate the elitist label on Obama , pointing out his opposition to a proposal she supports , a temporary suspension of the federal tax on gasoline of 18.4 cents per gallon .
“ I find it frankly a little offensive that people who do n’t have to worry about filling up their gas tank or what they buy when they go to the supermarket , think that it ’s somehow illegitimate to provide relief for the millions and millions of Americans who are on the brink of losing their jobs , unable to keep up with their daily expenses , ” she said .
Still , Obama picked up an important endorsement in Indiana when former Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew announced he was switching support from Clinton to back Obama .
Andrew , DNC chairman when Bill Clinton was president , is a so - called superdelegate to the party ’s nominating convention this summer and as such can vote for the candidate of his choosing .
With Obama holding a small lead over Clinton in the race for committed delegates , superdelegates may ultimately decide the Democratic nominee .
Indiana is one of two states , along with North Carolina , holding nominating contests on Tuesday that could have an impact on the race if either candidate wins both of them .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Andrew said in a long letter explaining his switch that it was time to “ heal the rift in our party , ” end the lengthy nominating process and pick a candidate to face McCain .
“ While I was hopeful that a long , contested primary season would invigorate our party , the polls show that the tone and temperature of the race is now hurting us , ” Andrew wrote .
The Clinton campaign found reason for optimism from a Quinnipiac University poll that showed Clinton topping McCain in a hypothetical matchup in the battleground states of Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Clinton led McCain in those states from margins ranging from 8 points in Florida to 10 in Ohio and 14 in Pennsylvania , the poll found .
Obama beat McCain in Pennsylvania but was in a virtual tie with him in the other two states .
Democrats tried to use against McCain the fifth anniversary of Bush ’s speech declaring an end to major combat operations in Iraq , an event quickly followed by a rising Iraqi insurgency that has kept U.S. forces in Iraq to the frustration of Americans .
McCain , in Cleveland , defended his support for the current strategy in Iraq while denouncing the White House for putting a “ Mission Accomplished ” banner behind Bush on the USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1 , 2003 .
“ I thought it was wrong at the time .
I thought phrases like ‘ a few dead enders , ’ ‘ last throes , ’ all of those comments contributed over time to the frustration and sorrow of Americans , ” he told reporters .
There was good and bad for McCain in a Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll .
He was in a statistical dead heat with both Obama and Clinton , but the survey said overall support for Republicans in general had fallen and that 43 percent of Americans have “ major concerns ” that McCain will be too closely aligned with the agenda of President George W. Bush .

WASHINGTON–No one , not even the eventual candidate , knew it at the time .
His attendance at the rally was not even noted in his hometown newspaper .
But Barack Obama built the foundation for his win over Hillary Clinton on a blustery morning in Chicago on Oct. 2 , 2002 , and his words that day could also provide the foundation for his victory over John McCain this Nov. 4 .
" I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation of undetermined length , at undetermined cost , with undetermined consequences , '' the young Illinois state senator said .
" I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East and encourage the worst , rather than best , impulses of the Arab world , and strengthen the recruitment arm of Al Qaeda .
" I am not opposed to all wars .
I 'm opposed to dumb wars . ''
A week after the speech , Clinton voted to authorize the war and now Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee , is facing a Republican adversary who is staking much of his campaign on a promise that America will prevail in Iraq and who even tossed out an ill - advised thought that the U.S. could be there for 100 years .
With one speech that now looks prescient , Obama provided the clearest distinction between him and Clinton while parrying arguments that he lacked experience by pointing to the Iraq fiasco as the product of more experienced Washington insiders .
In essence , he made the argument of judgment over experience , even as former president Bill Clinton once dismissed Obama 's Iraq narrative as " the biggest fairy tale I have ever seen . ''
The Illinois senator has promised to remove U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months of taking office .
Obama will win in November because the grueling struggle against Hillary Clinton launches him into the presidential election battle - tested , confirming his self - analysis : " I may be skinny , but I 'm tough . ''
He has proved he can meet a crisis – most notably the comments by his former pastor , Rev. Jeremiah Wright – and deal with it forcefully .
He will also win by continuing to sell himself as the candidate of change , a decision his campaign team decided early was the message to take to a nation that is weary after years of George W. Bush .
He will go to an electorate that believes the war was badly mismanaged , was " sold ' ' to them on false pretences and continues to tarnish America 's reputation abroad .
It is a nation that is paying record high gas prices , is watching their home values plummet – if they were able to keep their homes – and feels it is falling behind .
He will be an embodiment of that change , a young African - American who will be 47 in August , running against a man who turns 72 that same month and seeks to be the oldest president ever elected .
Already , stark contrasts were drawn when the two men spoke back - to - back on national television Tuesday evening ; McCain , his delivery wooden and forced before a small gathering in Louisiana , Obama eloquent and inspiring before 17,000 inside a Minnesota arena , as 15,000 more listened outside .
Obama advisers look forward to the optics of the two side - by - side on a debate stage where the Democrats ' new era of politics will be on display without a word being spoken .
He enters the race with the gap between those who identify themselves as Democrats versus those who declare themselves Republicans at an all - time high .
He is running against a Republican brand so badly damaged that it 's toxic , but also against a nominee with a much higher approval rating than the party he represents .
So Obama will continually tell voters McCain is running for Bush 's third term .
" It 's not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 per cent , as he did in the Senate last year , '' Obama said this week .

" And it 's not change when he promises to continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians .
There are many words to describe John McCain 's attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bush 's policies as bipartisan and new .
But change is not one of them . ''
Obama will also win because he 'll convince Americans a new style of international diplomacy is needed , what he calls " tough , direct diplomacy , where the president of the United States is n't afraid to let any petty dictator know where America stands and what we stand for . ''
More than any factor , however , the Obama victory in November will be a product of an American electorate that knows it can make history by electing a black man , a victory that will transcend politics , become a seminal moment in the history of race relations in this country and change the way the rest of the world looks at the United States .

THE biggest gift President Bush has given his party this year was to keep his daughter ’s wedding nearly as private as Connie Corleone’s .
Now that his disapproval rating has reached the Nixon nadir of negativity , even a joyous familial ritual is n’t enough to make the country glad to see him .
The G.O.P.’s best hope would be for both the president and Dick Cheney to lock themselves in a closet until the morning after Election Day .
Republicans finally recognized the gravity of their situation three days after Jenna Bush took her vows in Crawford .
As Hillary Clinton romped in West Virginia , voters in Mississippi elected a Democrat in a Congressional district that went for Bush - Cheney by 25 percentage points just four years ago .
It ’s the third “ safe ” Republican House seat to fall in a special election since March .
Party leaders have been haplessly trying to identify possible remedies ever since .
It did n’t help that their recent stab at an Obamaesque national Congressional campaign slogan , “ The Change You Deserve , ” was humiliatingly identified as the advertising pitch for the anti-depressant Effexor .
( If they ’re going to go the pharmaceutical route , “ Viva Viagra ” might be more to the point . )
Yet for all the Republican self - flagellation , it ’s still not clear that the party even understands the particular dimensions of its latest defeat and its full implications for both Congressional races and John McCain in November .
The Mississippi election was actually a runoff , required by law after a preliminary vote left neither candidate with the required 50 percent .
In the last round , on April 22 , the Democrat , Travis Childers , beat the Republican , Greg Davis , 49 percent to 46 percent .
( The rest went to minor candidates . )
On Tuesday , that margin increased dramatically : the Republican remained at 46 percent while the Democrat jumped to 54 percent .
A trial is to begin here on Wednesday morning to determine whether a Jewish couple can deduct the cost of religious education for their five children , a tax benefit they say the federal government has granted to members of just one religion , the Church of Scientology .
The potential ramifications are huge , for a ruling in favor of the couple could affect the millions of Americans who send their children to religious schools of all types .
At stake is whether people of all religions can deduct the cost of religious education as a charitable gift , as Scientologists are allowed to do under an officially secret 1993 agreement with the Internal Revenue Service .
That agreement came despite a 1989 Supreme Court ruling denying tax deductions for money paid in fees set by the Church of Scientology for its '' auditing ' ' and '' training ' ' services .
The Supreme Court decision said the money did not qualify for the charitable gift deduction because it involved a fixed price and was akin to a fee for a service .
The couple , Michael and Marla Sklar of Los Angeles , originally took the I.R.S. to court after being denied $ 2,080 in 1993 deductions for religious education for their children .
They lost that case , in which Mr. Sklar , a tax accountant , represented himself at trial .
The couple appealed , and three judges on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled against them two years ago .
But one judge also took the unusual step of suggesting further litigation that would better define the issues .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain is attempting to reassure Americans that “ I detest war ” even as he strongly backs the current U.S. war strategy in Iraq .
McCain and his aides point to his past as a Vietnam prisoner of war as evidence that he is well aware of the sacrifices involved in war and not eager to get the United States involved in more conflicts if elected in November .
“ Somebody who understands war , understands the military and has foreign policy and diplomatic experience is the best person to avoid war , ” said McCain senior adviser Charlie Black .
“ McCain is the last guy who wants to go to war and he knows all the other steps to do to avoid it . ”
At a time when his Democratic rivals are promising a way out of Iraq , McCain is adhering to a long - held view that the United States is in a war against radical Islamic extremists and that a central battle in that conflict is in Iraq .
He says the United States must stay in Iraq to help democracy take hold in the Middle East and remain there in some fashion in the years ahead as peacekeepers , much like U.S. troops have done in South Korea and Japan for decades .
Now that a troop increase in Iraq that he had recommended has improved security , more Americans are with him and willing to be more patient , he believes .
“ A significant number of Americans believe we should come home with honor , not with disgrace and genocide , ” he told reporters on his campaign bus recently .
McCain speaks aggressively against Iran for its influence in Iraq and for what he says is its attempt to build a nuclear weapon despite a U.S. National Intelligence Estimate ’s conclusion late last year that Iran had put its bid to develop an atomic bomb on hold in 2003 .
EMBOLDENED DEMOCRATS
All this has emboldened Democratic critics eager to take the White House after eight years of Republican rule under President George W. Bush .
A liberal radio talk show host who spoke at a fundraiser for Democratic candidate Barack Obama in North Dakota earlier this month , Ed Schultz , was castigated by the McCain campaign for referring to the Arizona senator as a “ warmonger . ”
Obama distanced himself from Schultz but then came West Virginia Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller , who drew a condemnation and apologized after telling The Charleston Gazette :
“ McCain was a fighter pilot , who dropped laser - guided missiles from 35,000 feet .
He was long gone when they hit .
What happened when they ( the missiles ) get to the ground ?
He does n’t know .
You have to care about the lives of people .
McCain never gets into those issues , ” Rockefeller said .
Democrats also accuse McCain of being blinded by Iraq , missing the threat posed by Islamic extremists in Afghanistan .
McCain argues that Obama and Democrat Hillary Clinton are promising a “ reckless ” pullout from Iraq , a pledge he says they would never be able to keep once they face the realities .
That is a view not shared by all his Republican colleagues in the Senate .
“ I think what people want a sense of is what the end is going to look like , ” Tennessee Republican Sen .
Bob Corker told the top U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , when Petraeus gave an update on the war last week .

In addition , former Secretary of State Colin Powell told ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” that the current U.S. course is unsustainable , that major troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan will have to be scaled back by the next president .
Merle Black , a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta , said McCain ’s stance on the Iraq war would be a central point of debate in the months leading up to the November election against either Illinois Sen. Obama or New York Sen. Clinton .
“ I think he will be defending the Iraq policy and talking about how he was in favor of the surge , but I think he ’ll put that in the context of really being opposed to the war and wanting to get out as soon as possible , ” Black said .
On a tour earlier this month to places important to his life , McCain spent a long time during a speech in Jacksonville , Florida , talking about the perils of war .
“ I detest war , ” he said .
“ It might not be the worst thing to befall human beings , but it is wretched beyond all description ...
Only a fool or a fraud sentimentalizes the merciless reality of war . ”

Cluster bombs are to remain part of the armoury available to British forces despite renewed calls for a ban , government officials made clear yesterday .
Campaigners presented David Miliband , the foreign secretary , with more than 30,000 signatures yesterday demanding a ban on all cluster bombs ahead of an international treaty conference outlawing the weapons in Dublin next month .
They were accompanied by Lords Ramsbotham , Elton and Hannay , respectively a former general , Conservative minister , and diplomat .
Cluster munitions scatter " bomblets " over a wide area .
Many do not immediately explode , killing and maiming civilians long after the conflict has ended .
Simon Conway , a former soldier and director of Landmine Action , a campaigning group , said yesterday Miliband had reacted positively to their demands .
However , officials at the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence later made clear that the government had no intention of giving up two kinds of modern cluster weapons in its possession .
They are the M85 , an Israeli - designed artillery weapon whose " bomblets " are designed to self - destruct , and the CRV7 weapon system on British Apache helicopters .
British forces used the M85 in Basra during the invasion of Iraq .
They were also used by Israeli forces in Lebanon in 2006 , who fired the largest number of cluster weapons ever recorded during the 72 - hours between a UN - sponsored halt to the fighting and the start of a ceasefire , MPs were told earlier this year .
Cluster weapons caused more than 200 civilian casualties in the year after the Lebanon ceasefire , and also caused more civilian casualties in Iraq in 2003 and Kosovo in 1999 than any other weapon system .
The MoD said that the British M85 had made a " direct contribution to saving the lives of UK service personnel " .
It said a single CRV7 weapon had less than 10 " bomblets " .
However , the MOD figure refers to the number of sub-munitions in just one rocket pod ; an Apache can carry a total of 684 sub-munitions in its cluster weapons , Conway said .
This is the final chapter in a series I have been running on my evolving understanding of 4+1 view architectural descriptions .
This time around I am covering scenarios , and other things that might end up in an architectural description .
We have already established the set of components in our architecture , and the functional interfaces to external systems .
We have drawn links between components , but not really elaborated on where responsibilities lie between a given pairing of linked components .
Scenarios
The scenarios view seems to be the most flexible of the views , and seems to capture " other " .
I think I am sticking fairly closely to the Architectural Blueprints definition when I use this view primarily to convey behaviours of components and internal interfaces .
I have been using collaboration diagrams showing component interactions in arrangements that roughly correlate to the Process View presentation .
As with other views I have generally tried to align things to the Logical View classification , and attempted to come up with one or more scenarios for each logical function .
Recording of sales is a fairly straightforward transfer of Sales Records from Web Browser to the Sales Manager Component .
Financial Transactions pertaining to these records are submitted to the General Ledger for further analysis .
It is possible that we could talk more about the user interface than I have in this diagram .
We could talk about how the browser navigates to the page that lets them enter the Sales Records .
I have deliberately kept things fairly simple here , trying to focus on clarifying roles within the architecture rather than getting too tied up in the detail of various interfaces involved .
Even my method invocations do n't look right from a UML perspective .
They are really more along the lines of data flows , and I do n't expect a literal analogue to exist for any of these method invocations .
Another way to approach the Scenarios View would be to take things back up a notch .
Use cases may better capture the end user 's intent , whether they be UML - style use cases or more general Systems Engineering - style use cases .
I think there is a lot of flexibility in this area , which makes things difficult to nail down .
I share the experience of how I have been approaching my specific problem domain , and hope that it leads to some useful light - bulbs going off in someone else 's head .
The Stocktake scenario is instructive because it tells us that Inventory Manager is directly involved in the stocktake procedure .
It is not an idle bystander that accepts a bulk update at the end of the stocktake .
The Stocktake GUI starts the process by marking all stock as outstanding .
One by one items are ticked off from the list until the remainder must be considered shrinkage .
This means that only one stocktake can be going on at a time , and that the work of stocktake might be undone if someone starts the procedure again .
On the other hand , it means that a crash in the stocktake GUI wo n't lose us our current stocktake state .
Does this division of responsibility strike the right balance ?
That 's what this design process is intended to make us ask ourselves .
We decomposed the Shares function more than most others , and this gives us an opportunity to see how a diagram with many components might work .
Note that I have more arrows now than I have labels against those arrows .
I have been using a convention that continuing arrows carry the same data as the last one unless indicated otherwise .
In this diagram we have the Buy or Sell Record moving about essentially untouched until it gets to General Ledger Export .
Only then is it converted into a Financial Transaction for recording in the General Ledger .
I find it interesting to pinpoint components that have little to do with altering the content that passes through them .
From a REST / web perspective we might apply the End to End principle here .
Not only should the interim components not modify the data passing through them , they should generally not try to understand the data more than necessary either .
If communication is in the form of documents , they should ignore but pass on attributes and elements even if they do n't understand them .
Take care to clean documents up at system boundaries in order to be able to assign blame , but otherwise try to keep things free and easy .
Even the document clean - up should ideally be done by free standing document firewalls that are easy to reconfigure as the architecture evolves .
I have n't included all of the images this time around .
If you would like to look at the whole ( but still limited ) set of diagrams I put together , point your StarUML here .
The Rest
Clearly 4+1 is not the whole story .
There are levels of detail beyond what I have covered in my examples this time around , including interface control documentation and module design specifications .
There are also a great deal of additional details that may accompany an architectural description to support design decisions made or to provide more detail .
Perhaps the most obvious gap in the 4+1 as applied at this level is a lack of data models for logical entities , for configuration data , and for interfaces .
These data models can be extremely useful , and the earlier you have a stab at them the less likely you 'll have multiple teams misunderstanding each other .
Other gaps include objectives for the decomposition , rationale for choices made , descriptions of how the architecture would change if current assumptions and constraints were to change , and a host of other detail .
Any one of these could lead you down the path of discussing something to the point where you stop and say to yourself " Hang on .
That does n't make sense .
What if ... " .
Those moments are half the reason to put an architectural description together , and some of the value of the document can be measured in how many " oops " es are caught as compared to the effort you put into the document .
The other side of the document is obviously to steer the ship and record consensus decisions .
Communicating the reasons for the current set of design decisions and the set of alternatives considered can therefore be crucial in the maintenance of the document over the project lifetime .
In the end , everything on the project is linked .
From schedule to team structure to components to the list of change requests against those components .
If you start modelling you might just end up modelling the whole world .
Depending on the scale of the project it might be worth going that far .
If you are working on something smaller you should be doing the minimum and assessing the rewards for taking any further steps with the document set .
Conclusion
I come from a fairly heavy - weight process end of the industry .
It involves a Systems Engineering approach that has foundations in things like defense projects .
The kinds of descriptions I have been talking about may not suit everyone , or perhaps even anyone .
However , I hope they will make some of us take a step back and be aware of what we as a whole are building from time to time .
Again I am not an expert , and I hope my lack of expertise is not a hindrance or false signpost to the gentle reader .
I am a software guy who has been walking a path lately between traditional software experience and the experience of those around me working on various projects .
I 'll now return you to your usual programming of REST Architecture , and everything that goes with it .

Today offers another update in the on - going student loan drama .
The current situation is a sort of consequence of the excessive profit scandals from earlier in the decade , and the more recent freezing of credit and capital markets related to consumer debt .
As these problems converged , the lenders are finding a need to drastically reduce risk and maximize returns .
Since the Congressional reaction to the high profits was to put lower subsidies and interest rates on federally backed loans , this is forcing the student loan companies to rate schools and consider their track record of producing graduates who can afford to pay back their debts .
From a pure risk management point of view , this leads to a necessary calculus about tuition and returns .
The cost of a specific college should be proportionate to the amount of money a student can expect to earn after completing the degree .
It makes sense to attend Harvard or Yale if you can be reasonably sure that you ’ll make more money than if you attended a different , lesser - known school .
Citibank has taken this line of thinking further and identified entire categories of colleges that return a poor salary relative to their costs , and the biggest losers are : community colleges , private for - profit colleges , and less traditional institutions .
Some lenders are indentifying specific schools to cut from their lending lists .
This ca n’t be fun for the administrators , teachers , and students .
Some students are currently being notified that the loans they ’ve been using wo n’t be available next academic year , and the fallout could mean declining enrollment at targeted colleges as soon as 2008 .
Institutions with their own debt obligations may have a hard time meeting those costs without cutting other expenses , such as instructors , building expansion or renovation , etc …
The downward spiral of the economy seems to show no end .
We would all like more money for college , or medicine , or public safety , or a cleaner world – but we ’ve reached a point where more money in the system just causes prices to go up .
Honestly , I do n’t know a simple solution to the larger financial problem other than sucking it up and finding new ways to provide goods and services at cheaper costs .
Fewer things can be bought with debt , so maybe instead of trying to save the student loan system we should be thinking of ways to send students to school while paying for it up front .

Definitive Guide : The Primal Blueprint
Build the Healthiest Possible Body with the Primal Blueprint
I get emails every day from people who are changing their lives for the better by following the guidelines I outline on this site .
But many are looking for more of what the Primal Blueprint has to offer .
That is to say , they want a comprehensive break down of the elements that make up the Blueprint ; a Primal primer if you will .
In coming weeks I will be going into detail – anthropological evidence , modern research , etc. – regarding this health philosophy , but I first want to offer up this summary of the Blueprint .
I think it is a good starting point for what is to come .
In this extended article you will find the basic building blocks needed to discover the Primal side of your life .
What does this mean ?
It means learning and understanding what it means to be human .
It means using this knowledge to help you make important lifestyle choices .
It means modeling your life after your ancestors in order to promote optimal health and wellness .
And , most importantly , it means taking control of your body and mind .
If this article intrigues you be on the look out for a much more thorough explanation of how we can learn from our past to shape and mold our future .
My basic premise is this :
The Primal Blueprint is a set of simple instructions ( the blueprint ) that allows you to control how your genes express themselves in order to build the strongest , leanest , healthiest body possible , taking clues from evolutionary biology ( that ’s the primal part ) .
Sometimes we get so lost in the science of human biology we just ca n’t see the forest for the trees .
We overlook the simplicity and ease with which we could all be achieving exceptional health and fitness .
Living in modern society is extremely complex .
With daily mind - boggling achievements made in science , technology and medicine , and with an ever - expanding knowledge base that increasingly grows more esoteric and niche , it is no wonder that we often look for complicated scientific solutions to problems that really only require simple answers .
One of the best examples is the huge – and expensive – race to identify all the new possible genetic variances ( or SNPs ) within the human genome that might predispose some of us to certain health conditions .
Hardly a week goes by without a new announcement of the discovery of a so - called “ defective ” gene that increases someone or some group ’s risk of being obese , of getting cancer , of developing type 2 diabetes or arthritis .
The net effect of all these announcements and the sensationalized news headlines is that many of us have become accustomed to blaming our health conditions on our unlucky inheritance of these “ defective ” genes .
As if it were n’t enough to abdicate responsibility here , we then cross our fingers and close our eyes and hope that the scientists can create pharmaceutical “ answers ” to our particular condition before it ’s too late .
In most cases a few lifestyle adjustments are all that are needed to address all but the most serious of these genetic variations .
Yes , I agree that some serious genetic diseases exist which are best treated with modern , truly life - saving drugs , but for the vast majority of the minor genetic variations that exist throughout the human genome , the real deciding factor as to whether or not a particular gene will be expressed in a particular manner , if at all , comes down to what you eat , how you move , what kind of air you breathe , what you think – in other words your environment .
Big Pharma ( CW ) does n’t want us to believe that most of our ills can be so easily solved , and so billions of dollars are being spent to unlock the so - called secrets of the genome .
Meanwhile , the real secrets – and solutions – are contained within the DNA of every single one of our cells .
The essence of the Primal Blueprint is this :
Most of life is really much simpler than modern medicine and science would like to have you believe .
You can have a tremendous impact on how your genes express themselves , simply by providing your cells the right environments .
All you need is a basic understanding of how your body works and a simple philosophical roadmap you can use to find answers to just about any questions of health and fitness – whether it involves personal choices or lifestyle adjustments or whether medical intervention might be appropriate .
With this simple strategy , you will forever be able to examine or evaluate any food choice , any form of exercise or any other behavior in the context of how it impacts your genes !
Even if you decide to opt for a “ bad choice ” , at least you ’ll know why it ’s bad …
You may already have a pretty fair understanding of how the human genome evolved to exactly where it is today ( or 10,000 years ago , to be more precise ) based on the environmental and behavioral factors under which our ancestors lived through natural selection .
Tens of thousands of anthropologists , evolutionary biologists , paleontologists , geneticists and others have worked for over 100 years to piece together a fairly detailed picture of all the elements that helped influence our development as a species .
Ironically though , when we examine all of the many environmental influences and behaviors that shaped our genome , we arrive at a very simple list of general things our early ancestors did to become what and who they were and which allowed them to pass 99.9 % of those genes down to us .
In essence , this list is the original “ Primal Blueprint ” since it provided the only set of behaviors they knew – the exact behaviors that enabled then to shape their bodies into healthy , robust , happy beings .
The Original Primal Blueprint® – The Rules of Living 10,000 Years Ago :
1 . Eat lots of animals , insects and plants .
This is the basic description of everything our ancestors ate to get the protein , fats , carbohydrates , vitamins , minerals , antioxidants , phenols , fiber , water and other nutrients necessary to sustain life .
But it was a huge list of individual foods – some anthropologists say it may have been 200 or 300 food choices at a time depending upon the geographic area .
The net result was a dietary “ breakdown ” of fat , protein and carbohydrate that was far different from what Conventional Wisdom considers optimum today .
This diet provided all the necessary fuel and building blocks that , along with specific exercise , prompted their genes to create strong muscles , enabled them to expend lots of energy each day moving about , to maintain healthy immune systems , to evolve larger brains and to raise healthy children .
They ate sporadically , too .
When food was plentiful , they ate more than they needed ( and stored the excess as fat ) .
When times were scarce , they survived on fat stores .
This random or “ non-linear ” eating pattern kept their bodies in a constant state of preparedness .
2 . Move around a lot at a slow pace .
We know that our ancestors spent an average of several hours each day moving about at what today ’s exercise physiologists might describe as a “ low level aerobic pace . ”
They hunted , gathered , foraged , wandered , scouted , migrated , climbed and crawled .
This low level of activity prompted their genes to build a stronger capillary ( blood vessel ) network to fuel each muscle cell , to be able to store some excess food as fat , but also to be readily able to convert the stored fat back into energy .
Of course , they did all this without the benefit of paved sidewalks or comfortable shoes .
Because every footfall landed at a different angle , every muscle , tendon and ligament worked and became stronger together in balance .
Note that they did NOT go out and “ jog ” at 80 % of their MAX Heart Rate for long periods of time as Conventional Wisdom suggests today !
3 . Lift heavy things .
The women carried their babies much of the time ( hey , no babysitters in those days ) , as well as bundles of firewood , or whatever they had gathered , foraged or scavenged .
The men carried heavy spears or other tools , they dragged heavy carcasses of animals they had hunted , and they moved large boulders or logs to build shelters .
They also lifted themselves into trees or up onto higher ground when escaping from danger or to scout a new route .
The biochemical signals created by these very brief but intense muscle contractions generated a slight surge in growth hormone and a reduction in myostatin gene expression , prompting an increase in muscle size and power ; particularly fast twitch fibers .
4 . Run really fast every once in a while .
In a world where danger lurked around every corner , your ability to run was a strong indicator of whether you would live long enough to pass your genes down to the next generation .
( Note to Nietzsche : That which did n’t kill Grok made him stronger ) .
Avoiding a charging beast to save your life , or surging forward to catch a different beast for dinner , the net effect was still survival .
A combination of the hormonal events that occurred simultaneously and the resultant gene expression within fast twitch muscle made sure that the next time this happened Grok could sprint a little faster .
5 . Get lots of sleep .
Our ancestors got plenty of sleep .
Even after the discovery of fire , it was n’t as if they stayed up all night partying .
From sunset to sunrise it was safer to huddle together and rest .
Long days of hunting and gathering and otherwise working hard for every bite of food also required sufficient time to repair and recover .
Studies of modern hunter - gatherers suggest it was n’t necessarily always an uninterrupted nine or ten hours , either .
It ’s likely that they slept together as families or as small tribes , keeping a watch out for predators , breast - feeding the baby or just dozing in and out throughout the night .
Growth hormone and melatonin were the major hormonal players .
Of course , the occasional afternoon nap was also available when the urge hit , with no guilt about what else they really should have been doing .
6. Play .
Just like in modern times , all work and no play made Grok a dull boy .
Hunter - gatherers have always generally worked fewer hours and have had more leisure time than the average 40 - hour - plus American worker .
Once the day ’s catch was complete or the roots , shoots , nuts and berries had been gathered , our ancestors spent hours involved in various forms of social interaction that we might categorize today as “ play . ”
Young males would chase each other around and wrestle , vying for a place higher up in the tribe social strata .
The males might also practice spear - or rock - throwing for accuracy or chase small animals just for sport .
Young females might spend time grooming each other .
To the extent that play was considered enjoyable , the net effect was to solidify social bonds and to prompt the release of endorphins ( feel - good brain chemicals ) and to mitigate any lingering stress effects of life - threatening situations .
7 . Get some sunlight every day .
Cavemen were n’t really men ( or women ) who lived their lives in caves all the time .
Most of the day , they were in the great outdoors pursuing their various survival tasks .
Regular exposure to sun provided lots of vitamin D , an all - important vitamin which they could not easily obtain from food and which their bodies could not manufacture without direct sunlight .
8. Avoid trauma .
Our ancestors required an acute sense of self - preservation matched with a keen sense of observation .
Always scanning , smelling , listening to the surroundings , on the watch for danger , aware of what immediate action needed to be taken , whether it was running from a saber - tooth tiger , dodging a falling rock , eluding a poisonous snake , or just avoiding a careless footfall .
Remember that a twisted knee or a broken ankle could spell death to anyone who could n’t run away from danger .
In fact , it was probably trauma ( or a brief careless lapse in judgment ) that was most responsible for the low average life expectancy of our ancestors , despite their otherwise robust good health .
Avoid trauma and there was a very good chance you could live to be 60 or 70 – and be extremely healthy and fit .
Modern day hunter gatherers maintain strength and health often well into their 80s .
9. Avoid poisonous things .
Man ’s ability to exploit almost every corner of this earth was partly predicated on his ability to consume vastly different types of plant and animal life .
But moving into a new environment and trying new foods posed a danger that the new food might contain potent toxins .
Luckily , our liver and kidneys evolved to handle most brushes with novel - but - slightly - poisonous plant matter – at least to keep us alive anyway if the stomach did n’t regurgitate it first .
Our keen senses of smell and taste also helped us sort out the good from the bad .
The reason we have a sweet tooth today ( dammit ) is probably an evolved response to an almost universal truth in the plant world that just about anything that tastes sweet is safe to eat .
10 .
Use your mind .
Obviously , one of the most important things that separate man from all other animals is his intellectual ability .
The rapid increase in the size of our brains over just a few thousand generations is the combined result of a high - fat , high protein diet ( see rule # 1 ) and a continued reliance on complex thought – working the brain out just like a muscle .
Hunter gatherers all around the world have developed language , tools and superior hunting methods independently .
The fact that some have n’t entered the industrial age does n’t mean they do n’t possess the same ability to process information rapidly and effectively ( try living in a jungle where you need to catalog thousands of different plant and animal species , knowing which can kill you and which can sustain you ) .
That ’s it .
That ’s the full – albeit general – list of behaviors that shaped our current genome ( OK , I left out the sex part because that kind of goes without saying .
On the other hand , having sex with your partner IS a natural part of the Primal Blueprint .
I ’ll cover it in a future post ) …
If there ’s any doubt on your part about whether or not we should emulate our ancestors ’ behavior ( but in a context of a modern world ) let ’s at least agree that we are looking to achieve some very similar benefits .
Certainly , we all want to be :
Healthy
Ideally , we ’d never want to be sick .
We ’d want to be in the best possible health all of the time .
Energetic
We ’d want to have lots of energy to do all the fun things life has to offer and not feel like we are dragging at any point during the day .
Happy
No one wants to be depressed or miserable .
It ’s no way to go through life .
We want a reason to get out of bed every day and take on all the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead .
Lean
We ’d want to be in a metabolically balanced state where we burn off our excess or stored fat , where we find a point at which we have enough fat to be healthy , but we rarely ( or never ) store any more additional fat .
Strong
Let ’s face it : we ’d want muscles that not only look great in a bathing suit , but that serve us well in allowing us to move , to play , and to stay balanced throughout that movement .
That means well - balanced strength with proportional muscles .
Bright
We ’d want full access to our mental faculties , to be bright and alert , creative , focused when appropriate , able to recall all the great memories , etc .
Productive
We ’d certainly want to feel as if we are contributing to ourselves , our family and society .
We know from evolutionary biology that our ancestors exemplified all the above healthy traits ( as I will detail later ) .
Those may or may not have been their stated goals , but those attributes certainly allowed them to survive the rigors of a hostile environment and be in a position to pass their traits along to the next generation , and finally , to us .
Now , understanding that everything we do , eat , think and breathe can affect our 10,000 - year - old genes , how does that Original Primal Blueprint compare to what we might have to do today to achieve robust good health , a well - sculpted body , a strong immune system , boundless energy and an increase in productivity – all the goals we are after ?
Ironically , it ’s almost the exact same thing .
The Modern Primal Blueprint® – The Rules of Living Today :
1 . Eat lots of animals , insects and plants .
Focus on quality sources of protein ( all forms of meat , fowl , fish ) , lots of colorful vegetables , some select fruits ( mostly berries ) , and healthy fats ( nuts , avocados , olive oil ) .
Observe portion control ( calorie distribution ) week to week more than meal to meal .
Eliminate grains , sugars , trans - and hydrogenated fats from your diet .

2 . Move around a lot at a slow pace .
Do some form of low level aerobic activity 2 - 5 hours a week , whether it is walking , hiking , easy bike riding or swimming .
Ideally , and when possible , find time to go barefoot or wear as little foot support as possible .
Low - level activity is necessary ( especially if you find yourself chained to a desk every day ) .
The combined effect will be an increase in capillary perfusion , fat - burning and overall integration of muscle strength and flexibility .

3 . Lift heavy things .
Go to the gym and lift weights for 30 - 45 minutes , 2 - 3 times a week .
Focus on movements that involve the entire body and in wider ranges of motion – not just on isolating body parts .
Emulate the movements of our ancestors : jumping , squatting , lunging , pushing , pulling , twisting , etc .
This will stimulate your genes to increase muscle strength and power , increase bone density , improve insulin sensitivity , stimulate growth hormone secretion , and consume stored body fat .

4 . Run really fast every once in a while .
Do some form of intense anaerobic sprint bursts several times a week .
This could be as simple as six or eight ( or more ) short sprints up a hill , on the grass , at the beach … or repeated intense sessions on a bicycle ( stationary , road or mountain bike ) .
These short bursts also increase HGH release ( HGH is actually released in proportion to the intensity ( not the duration ) of the exercise ) .

5 . Get lots of sleep .
Get plenty of quality sleep .
Our lives are so hectic and full of things to do after the sun goes down that it ’s often difficult to get enough sleep .
Yet sleep is one of the most important factors in maintaining good health , vibrant energy and a strong immune system .

7 . Get some sunlight every day .
Contrary to the “ Common Wisdom ” dispensed by dermatologists ( who suggest you shun the sun ) , the Primal Blueprint would insist that you get some direct sunlight every day .
Certainly not so much that you come close to burning , but definitely enough to prompt your body to make the all - important vitamin D and to support the mood - lifting benefits .
A slight tan is a good indicator that you have maintained adequate Vitamin D levels .
Natural sunlight also has a powerful mood - elevating effect , which can enhance productivity at work and in inter-personal interactions .

8. Avoid trauma .
Eliminate self - destructive behaviors .
These concepts are self evident to most people ( wear seat belts , do n’t smoke or do drugs , do n’t dive into shallow water ) yet so many of us live our lives oblivious to impending danger .
Develop a keen sense of awareness of your surroundings .

9. Avoid poisonous things .
Avoid exposure to chemical toxins in your food ( pesticides , herbicides , chemicals , etc ) and on your skin .
But also try to avoid the hidden poisons in foods like sugars , grains , processed foods , trans and hydrogenated fats , and mercury in certain fish .

10 .
Use your mind .
Exercise your brain daily as our ancestors did .
Be inventive , creative , and aware .
If your work is not stimulating ( or even if it is ) , find time to read , write , play an instrument and interact socially .

As with the Original Primal Blueprint , this list is very general , designed simply to allow you to understand that everything our ancestors did can benefit us as well .
Except that we can do it having fun , enjoying every aspect of the lifestyle and without worrying about our survival !
In future blog posts ( and to a much greater extent in my book ) I will be going into much more detail as to how and why these behaviors work and exactly what foods to eat , what exercises to do and how to otherwise find ways to allow your genes to recreate you in the healthiest , fittest way possible .

When Vincent van Gogh was thirty - one years old , in the fall of 1883 , he travelled to the bleak moors of northern Holland and stayed at a tavern in the village of Stuifzand .
The local countryside was hardly inhabited then — “ Locus Deserta Atque ob Multos Paludes Invia , ” an old map called it : “ A deserted and impenetrable place of many swamps ” — but a few farmers and former convicts had managed to carve a living from it .
They dug peat , brewed illegal gin , and placed poles across the marshes to navigate by .
Any squatter who could keep his chimney smoking for a full year earned title to the land he cleared .
There is little record of what happened to van Gogh in Stuifzand — whether he got lost in the marshes or traded sketches for shots at the bar .
When I visited the village , the locals mentioned him merely to illustrate an even greater national obsession : height .
At the old tavern , which is now a private home , I was shown the tiny alcove where the painter probably slept .
“ It looks like it would fit only a child , ” J. W. Drukker , the current owner , told me .
Then he and his wife , Joke ( a common Dutch name , they explained , pronounced “ Yoh - keh ” ) , led me down the hall , to a sequence of pencil marks on a doorjamb .
“ My son , he is two metres , ” Joke told me , pointing to the topmost mark , six and a half feet from the floor .
“ His feet ” — she held her hands about eighteen inches apart — “ for waterskiing . ”
Joke herself is six feet one , with blond tresses and shoulders like a Valkyrie .
Drukker is six feet two .
The Netherlands , as any European can tell you , has become a land of giants .
In a century ’s time , the Dutch have gone from being among the smallest people in Europe to the largest in the world .
The men now average six feet one — seven inches taller than in van Gogh ’s day — and the women five feet eight .
The national organization of tall people , Klub Lange Mensen , has considerable lobbying power .
From Rotterdam to Eindhoven , ceilings have had to be lifted , furniture redesigned , lintels raised to keep foreheads from smacking them .
Many hotels now offer twenty - centimetre bed extensions , and ambulances on occasion must keep their back doors open , to allow for patients ’ legs .
“ We will not go through the ceiling , ” the pediatrician Hans van Wieringen assured me , after summarizing national height surveys that he had coördinated .
“ But it is possible that we will grow another ten centimetres . ”
Walking along the canals of Amsterdam and Delft , I had an odd sensation of drowning — not because the crowds were so thick but because I could n’t lift my head above them .
I ’m five feet ten and a half — about an inch taller than the average in the United States — but , like most men I know , I tend to round the number up .
Tall men , a series of studies has shown , benefit from a significant bias .
They get married sooner , get promoted quicker , and earn higher wages .
According to one recent study , the average six - foot worker earns a hundred and sixty - six thousand dollars more , over a thirty - year period , than his five - foot - five - inch counterpart — about eight hundred dollars more per inch per year .
Short men are unlucky in politics ( only five of forty - three Presidents have been shorter than average ) and unluckier in love .
A survey of some six thousand adolescents in the nineteen - sixties showed that the tallest boys were the first to get dates .
The only ones more successful were those who got to choose their own clothes .
Like many biases , this one has a certain basis in fact .
Over the past thirty years , a new breed of “ anthropometric historians ” has tracked how populations around the world have changed in stature .
Height , they ’ve concluded , is a kind of biological shorthand : a composite code for all the factors that make up a society ’s well - being .
Height variations within a population are largely genetic , but height variations between populations are mostly environmental , anthropometric history suggests .
If Joe is taller than Jack , it ’s probably because his parents are taller .
But if the average Norwegian is taller than the average Nigerian it ’s because Norwegians live healthier lives .
That ’s why the United Nations now uses height to monitor nutrition in developing countries .
In our height lies the tale of our birth and upbringing , of our social class , daily diet , and health - care coverage .
In our height lies our history .
Ifirst heard of anthropometric history from John Komlos — the pope of the field , as one of his colleagues described him .
Komlos , who is a professor at the University of Munich , has the look of an Old World tailor — sharp eyes , receding hairline , bottlebrush mustache — and the scholarly instincts of a born scavenger .
For twenty years , he has rummaged through archives on both sides of the Atlantic , gathering hundreds of thousands of height records in search of trends that others may have missed .
In his way , Komlos was born to do such research .
He stands five inches shy of six feet , and he blames much of the gap on history .
His parents were Hungarian Jews who lived in Budapest during the Second World War .
In 1944 , when his mother was pregnant with him , the Nazis took control of the city and the Russians were poised for a counterattack .
“ The bombardment started almost simultaneously with my birth , ” Komlos told me .
( His English is perfect , aside from a few oddly flattened vowels , but he speaks with an exaggerated drawl , as if he had learned the language by watching old Westerns . )
His parents managed to get to a bombed - out hospital , using fake identity papers , and to take the baby back safely to the family hideout .
But there was little food , and Komlos cried incessantly .
One relative told his mother to throw the baby outside , since he was n’t going to make it anyway .
The Hungarian Communists took over the city in 1948 , but Komlos ’s diet improved only slightly .
During the war , his father , Herbert , had spent months in a Hungarian forced - labor battalion outside Stalingrad , returning on foot when the Russians broke the German siege , in the winter of 1943 .
After the war , Herbert Komlos was imprisoned again , this time by the Communists .
“ They trumped up some charges because they said he was middle - class , ” Komlos said .
“ He was working odd jobs at the time and had only a fourth - grade education . ”
When the Hungarian revolution came , in 1956 , Herbert supported it .
A month later , when it failed , he packed up his family and fled for America .
Biologists say that we achieve our stature in three spurts : the first in infancy , the second between the ages of six and eight , the last in adolescence .
Any decent diet can send us sprouting at these ages , but take away any one of forty - five or fifty essential nutrients and the body stops growing .
( “ Iodine deficiency alone can knock off ten centimetres and fifteen I.Q. points , ” one nutritionist told me . )
Komlos was twelve years old when he left Hungary , and he had been malnourished most of his life .
His first growth spurt had been cut short ; his second was hardly more successful .
But if heights have obsessed him over the last twenty years it ’s because of what happened next , in his adolescence .
When Komlos and his parents arrived in Chicago , in the winter of 1956 , America was a land of almost mythical abundance .
For more than two centuries , its people had been so healthy and so prosperous that they towered above the rest of the world — about four inches above the Dutch , for example , for most of the nineteenth century .
To Komlos , raised on the black bread and thin broth of Communist Hungary , Chicago ’s all - you - can - eat restaurants were astonishing .
“ I was just amazed that these things existed , ” he says .
But he found the restaurants not nearly as impressive as the giants who fed there .
There is a rueful tone to his nostalgia .
His father arrived with no money , no English , and no marketable skills , Komlos says .
For a year , he worked in a factory , making belts , for a dollar an hour .
When it was clear that he would never be promoted , he quit and started his own business , making leather watchbands at home .
In Hungary , there had always been a market for handmade goods , but Chicago stores were full of cheap imports .
To compete with Hong Kong , Herbert Komlos had to work sixteen hours a day while his wife worked ten , and John put in twenty - five hours on the weekend .
They ate better than in the old country , but only a little .
“ Everyone has a story like mine , if they were born with my religion in my part of the world , ” Komlos says .
And those experiences are spelled out in their bodies .
Komlos now knows that he arrived in America at a pivotal point in its history .
Over the next fifty years , by most indicators dear to economists , the country remained the richest in the world .
But by another set of numbers — longevity and income inequality — it began to lag behind Northern Europe and Japan .
It ’s this shift that fascinates Komlos , and that emerges so vividly in his height data .
One evening last winter , Komlos and I were walking by the U.S.O. office at the Philadelphia airport , when he stopped to watch a batch of Coast Guard recruits who were shipping out to Cape May , New Jersey .
“ Look at that , ” he said .
“ Hardly any of them is six feet tall . ”
Komlos had to catch an 8 p.m. red -eye to Munich , but he could n’t resist taking this group ’s measure .
Standing at a discreet distance , he slowly sized up each man as if with a pair of calipers .
“ Amazing , ” he said .
“ The average German soldier is a hundred and seventy - nine centimetres — about five foot ten and a half .
These guys are more like me . ”
For centuries , he explained , governments have kept careful records of their soldiers ’ heights , providing a baseline against which modern populations are compared .
( Records for women are much more scarce , but they tend to follow the same trends . )
Looking down these rows of men , four abreast , Komlos could see the shadowy ranks of their ancestors lined up behind them , from West Point cadets and Citadel graduates to Union soldiers , Revolutionary War soldiers , and fighters in the French and Indian War .
If you were to stretch a string from the head of the earliest soldier in that row to the head of the most recent recruit , you might expect it to trace an ascending line .
Humans are an ever - improving species , the old evolution charts tell us ; each generation is smarter , sleeker , and taller than the last .
Yet in Northern Europe over the past twelve hundred years human stature has followed a U - shaped curve : from a high around 800 A.D. , to a low sometime in the seventeenth century , and back up again .
Charlemagne was well over six feet ; the soldiers who stormed the Bastille a millennium later averaged five feet and weighed a hundred pounds .
“ They did n’t look like Errol Flynn and Alan Hale , ” the economist Robert Fogel told me .
“ They looked like thirteen - year - old girls . ”
Fogel , who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1993 , is the man most responsible for Komlos ’s interest in height .
In the fall of 1982 , when Komlos was working on a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Chicago ( he had earlier earned a Ph.D. in history there ) , Fogel gave a lecture on stature that Komlos attended .
Most historians , if they thought about height at all , tended to assume that it was tied to income .
The more people earn , the better they eat ; the better they eat , the taller they grow .
“ Men grow taller and faster the wealthier their country , ” the French hygienist and statistician Louis - René Villermé wrote in 1829 .
“ In other words , misery . . . produces short people . ”
Fogel knew it was n’t that simple .
In 1974 , he and Stanley Engerman published an exhaustive study of slave economics entitled “ Time on the Cross . ”
Historians had long insisted that slavery was not only inhuman ; it was bad business — hungry , brutalized workers made the poorest of farmers .
Fogel and Engerman found nearly the opposite to be true : Southern plantations were almost thirty - five per cent more efficient than Northern farms , their analysis showed .
Slavery was a cruel and inhuman system , but more so psychologically than physically : to get the most work from their slaves , planters fed and housed them nearly as well as free Northern farmers could feed and house themselves .
“ Time on the Cross ” was greeted with uncommon fury in academia — one reviewer consigned it “ to the outermost ring of the scholar ’s hell . ”
Yet each point that critics blew apart left a scattering of uncomfortable facts behind it .
The most dramatic example came from a graduate student of Fogel ’s , Richard Steckel , who is now at Ohio State .
Steckel decided to verify his mentor ’s claims by looking at the slaves ’ body measurements .
He went through more than ten thousand slave manifests — shipboard records kept by traders in the colonies — until he had the heights of some fifty thousand slaves ; then he averaged them out by age and sex .
The results were startling : adult slaves , Steckel found , were nearly as tall as free whites , and three to five inches taller than the average Africans of the time .

Did you know that the same ultra- fast , ultra - intense laser ( UUL ) that can blast individual cancer cells without harming any good cells in the vicinity can also be used to fuse metal to bone ?
A new laser lab at the University of Missouri has been built to test the awesome power of this system , whose pulses last just one quadrillionth of a second , known in street terminology as a " femtosecond . "
Here 's why the American Dental Association , the American Cancer Society and the Pentagon would be equally interested in this developing technology :
This image was lost some time after publication , but you can still view it here

The key characteristic of the femtosecond laser is the fact that it uniquely can hit its target without burning anything in the surrounding areas .
According to Robert Tzou , head researcher and chairman of the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering , this could mean the end of nasty chemotherapy :
" If we have a way to use the lasers to kill cancer cells without even touching the surrounding healthy cells , that is a tremendous benefit to the patient .
Basically , the patient leaves the clinic immediately after treatment with no side effects or damage .
The high precision and high efficiency of the UUL allows for immediate results . "

In surgery and in dentistry , the super accuracy of the laser can be utilized to reduce the collateral damage currently made by incisions and cavity drilling .

X - Men fans will be happy to hear that the laser can also be used to fuse metal dust to bone , " sintering " metal powder locally with just enough heat , but without the need for molten metal .
Says researcher Yuwen Zhang :
" With the laser , we can melt a very thin strip around titanium micro- and nanoparticles and ultimately control the porosity of the bridge connecting the bone and the alloy .
The procedure allows the particles to bond strongly , conforming to the two different surfaces . "

In case you doubt that metallicized bones might have military application , Zhang and some of his colleagues have just received a DoD grant to poke around in precisely that arena .

The helicopter crew spotted the aircraft earlier this month A police helicopter crew has spotted what is described as an unusual aircraft in the Vale of Glamorgan .
The helicopter was above St Athan , which is home to an RAF base and close to Cardiff International Airport .
But three - man crew could not capture any images before the object vanished over the Bristol Channel on 8 June .
South Wales Police said the helicopter did not give chase and described the crew as very experienced .
The sighting has been reported for investigation .
The helicopter was hovering in the sky at 0040 BST above the base , waiting to land .
A police spokesperson said : " The crew are very experienced and responded in a professional manner in relation to what they saw .
" In today 's skies , there are a wide variety of aircrafts which come in a range of different shapes and sizes and in all probability , this sighting has just confirmed that one of these was in the area at the relevant time , " the spokesperson added .
A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said it had heard nothing about the incident .
" But it is certainly not advisable for police helicopters to go chasing what they think are UFOs , " the spokesperson said .
Cardiff International Airport said air traffic control provided a service to the police helicopter to ensure it had appropriate air space , including allowing it space to return to RAF St Athan to refuel .
Meanwhile , a Cardiff pensioner says he also saw something " peculiar with lots of flashing lights " on the same day .
George Withrington , of St Mellons , said he reported the sighting to police and was given an incident number .
The ex-RAF glider pilot said he was sitting in his garden reading a book on 8 June when he spotted the object at around 1620hrs .
Picture based on Richard Foxhall 's sketch for his book " I was looking at an aeroplane overhead when I spotted this thing was in the corner of my eye .
" It shifted direction very quickly , in the blink of an eye .
" I looked at it for quite a while , i was watching it for at least 10 minutes .
It flew off towards the east , towards Newport . "
Author Richard Foxhall , who lives in the Nantlle Valley , Gwynedd , has written a book about his experience of seeing a UFO in 1996 .
Mr Foxhall has called for the report into the Vale of Glamorgan sighting to be made open to the public .
" The helicopter crew , who are experienced , saw something which was in the air space around Cardiff International Airport and St Athan air base .
" If this was Heathrow there would be an inquiry , " he added .
Mr Foxhall said he saw a low - flying object over Tal -y - Mignedd in Snowdonia over the May bank holiday weekend , 12 years ago .
He was returning home at around 2030 BST and saw an object similar to " nothing he had seen before " .
Mr Foxhall contacted all local airports , RAF Valley and checked with the authorities and found no flight records had been logged .

What are these ?
" There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life , ” Jesse Jackson once told an audience , “ than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery — then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved . ”
" It was probably good I did n’t [ renew ] , because there are an awful lot of other citizens " who had the same problem , Mell ( 33rd ) said after the Police and Fire Committee approved an amendment to the gun registration ordinance .
The change would allow those whose registration lapsed to renew at a slightly higher fee .
Ald. Richard Mell got a City Council committee to approve a change to a Chicago law on his behalf Wednesday , but argued it would benefit thousands of other city residents who , like him , simply failed to renew their gun licenses .
Re-registration of the guns would have to occur within 4 months of passage of the ordinance by the full City Council , which could come as soon as next Wednesday .
Mell , a hunter and gun collector , sought the change after he forgot to renew his registrations and was told he could not do so because the deadline had passed .
The alderman said Wednesday Tuesday he was " inundated " with calls from " law - abiding citizens " in the same predicament .
Former Illinois Atty .
General Roland Burris called him to say he was storing a gun in Decatur because he forgot to renew his registration , Mell said .
The engraved shotgun was given to Burris by Illinois State Police when Burris left office , the alderman added .
Committee Chairman Ald. Isaac Carothers ( 29th ) , meanwhile , said he expected another amendment to be drafted that would allow retired police officers to register newly purchased handguns .
Federal law allow allows retired officers to carry concealed weapons , but city ordinance allows them to only re-register their old service revolvers , not new weapons .
Ordinary residents are not allowed to own handguns in Chicago .
Aldermen said a case before the U.S. Supreme Court they that could be decided in July could overturn local gun control laws across the nation .
Also considered by the committee was a proposal by Ald. Ed Burke ( 14th ) to require anyone convicted of a felony gun offense to be listed for 4 years on a city registry that would be maintained by the Police Department , as is done in New York .
Unlike New York , Chicago ’s registry would be open to anyone ’s review on the Web .
The committee delayed action on Burke ’s proposal after ordering Police Department officials to come back with precise estimates of how much more manpower it would take to maintain and enforce the registry .

David Robinson , Harlan Yu , Bill Zeller , and I have a new paper about how to use infotech to make government more transparent .
We make specific suggestions , some of them counter - intuitive , about how to make this happen .
The final version of our paper will appear in the Fall issue of the Yale Journal of Law and Technology .
The best way to summarize it is to quote the introduction :
If the next Presidential administration really wants to embrace the potential of Internet - enabled government transparency , it should follow a counter - intuitive but ultimately compelling strategy : reduce the federal role in presenting important government information to citizens .
Today , government bodies consider their own websites to be a higher priority than technical infrastructures that open up their data for others to use .
We argue that this understanding is a mistake .
It would be preferable for government to understand providing reusable data , rather than providing websites , as the core of its online publishing responsibility .
In the current Presidential cycle , all three candidates have indicated that they think the federal government could make better use of the Internet .
Barack Obama ’s platform explicitly endorses “ making government data available online in universally accessible formats . ”
Hillary Clinton , meanwhile , remarked that she wants to see much more government information online .
John McCain , although expressing excitement about the Internet , has allowed that he would like to delegate the issue , possible to a vice - president .
But the situation to which these candidates are responding – the wide gap between the exciting uses of Internet technology by private parties , on the one hand , and the government ’s lagging technical infrastructure on the other – is not new .
The federal government has shown itself consistently unable to keep pace with the fast - evolving power of the Internet .
In order for public data to benefit from the same innovation and dynamism that characterize private parties ’ use of the Internet , the federal government must reimagine its role as an information provider .
Rather than struggling , as it currently does , to design sites that meet each end - user need , it should focus on creating a simple , reliable and publicly accessible infrastructure that “ exposes ” the underlying data .
Private actors , either nonprofit or commercial , are better suited to deliver government information to citizens and can constantly create and reshape the tools individuals use to find and leverage public data .
The best way to ensure that the government allows private parties to compete on equal terms in the provision of government data is to require that federal websites themselves use the same open systems for accessing the underlying data as they make available to the public at large .
Our approach follows the engineering principle of separating data from interaction , which is commonly used in constructing websites .
Government must provide data , but we argue that websites that provide interactive access for the public can best be built by private parties .
This approach is especially important given recent advances in interaction , which go far beyond merely offering data for viewing , to offer services such as advanced search , automated content analysis , cross-indexing with other data sources , and data visualization tools .
These tools are promising but it is far from obvious how best to combine them to maximize the public value of government data .
Given this uncertainty , the best policy is not to hope government will choose the one best way , but to rely on private parties with their vibrant marketplace of engineering ideas to discover what works .
As Wal - Mart switches to the MP3 music format and redesigns its music store , it leaves behind Microsoft 's digital rights management technology , which prevented the songs it sold from being played on iPods .
The company has also ditched Sony / BMG and Warner Music Group , for now anyway , probably due to licensing squabbles about the terms of the transition to unprotected music .
Digital Music
News points out that " Downloads from Sony BMG and Warner Music Group artists are now unavailable at Wal - Mart 's online music store , " but we were able to find 304 Neil Diamond songs ( Diamond is featured on the front of Sony / BMG's website ) .
Diamond appears to be something of an exception , however .
Every other Sony / BMG or Warner Music Group artist we searched for in Wal - Mart 's MP3 store was either unavailable or only represented by a smattering of random compilation tracks .
Most likely , this is a temporary situation that will be resolved byadditional mingling by bean counters at both companies , but one wonderswhether Wal - Mart and its customers would have been better served bywaiting until all of its ducks were in a row and then announcing acomprehensive DRM - free store on the level of Amazon MP3 .
As things stand now , you can't even use all of the features on thesite without resorting to Internet Explorer and the store only workswith Windows despite the fact that MP3s play on Macintosh and Linux machines .
Note to Wal - Mart : build productsbefore launching them .

He may help reduce your stress levels
Researchers looked at nearly 4,500 adults and found that cat ownership was related to a 40 % lower risk of suffering a fatal heart attack .
The team speculated that having a cat may reduce stress and anxiety , and so protect against cardiovascular disease .
The findings of the study were unveiled at the International Stroke Conference .
The study , led by Professor Adnan Qureshi at the University of Minnesota , suggested that even those who no longer owned a cat benefited from these protective effects .
But specifically , some 3.4 % of those who owned a cat during the duration of the study died from a heart attack , compared with 5.8 % of those who did not .
The benefits held true even after the researchers adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure , diabetes , smoking and high cholesterol .
However the authors warned against impulsive cat purchases .
They said while cats may indeed have a calming effect , it was unclear whether the kind of people who opted for a cat in the first place may have a lower risk of heart attack .
This study did not examine the advantages of having a dog , although previous research has suggested this too may have health benefits above and beyond taking them for walks .
The Pet Health Council notes " there is an increasing amount of research proving that contact with animals can bring real physiological and psychological benefits including reducing stress , helping to prevent illness and allergies , lowering blood pressure , aiding recovery and boosting fitness levels .
" Research has also shown that pet owners make fewer annual visits to the doctors than non pet owners proving the saying , ' a pet all day keeps the doctor away ' . "
' Is Google Making Us Stupid ? ' was the provocative title of a recent article in the US journal The Atlantic .
Its author was Nicholas Carr , a prominent blogger and one of the internet 's more distinguished contrarians .
' Over the past few years , ' he writes , ' I 've had an uncomfortable sense that someone , or something , has been tinkering with my brain , remapping the neural circuitry , reprogramming the memory .
My mind is n't going - so far as I can tell - but it 's changing .
I 'm not thinking the way I used to think . '
He feels this most strongly , he says , when he 's reading .
' Immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy .
My mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument , and I 'd spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose .
That 's rarely the case any more .
Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages .
I get fidgety , lose the thread , begin looking for something else to do .
I feel as if I 'm always dragging my wayward brain back to the text .
The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle . '
His diagnosis is that he 's been spending too much time online .
His complaint is not really against Google - it 's against the network as a whole .
' What the net seems to be doing , ' he writes , 'is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation .
My mind now expects to take in information the way the net distributes it : in a swiftly moving stream of particles .
Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words .
Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski . '
To judge from the volume of commentary that has followed his article , Carr has touched a nerve .
He was ' flooded with emails and blog posts from people saying that my struggles with deep reading and concentration mirror their own experiences ' .
Various über - bloggers such as Andrew Sullivan , Jon Udell and Bill Thompson took up the theme , adding their own twists .
And prominent newspaper columnists such as Leonard Pitts ( Miami Herald ) and Margaret Wente ( Toronto Globe & Mail ) also revealed their private fears that addiction to cyberspace , and online media generally were , in fact , rotting their brains .
What 's surprising in a way is that people should be surprised by this .
The web , after all , was designed by a chap ( Tim Berners - Lee ) who was motivated to do it because he had a poor memory for some things .
Add powerful search engines to what he created and you effectively have a global memory - prosthesis .
Who won the Ascot Gold Cup in 1904 ?
Google will find it in a flash - and remind you that the race that year was run on 16 June , which is also the day in which all the action takes place in James Joyce 's Ulysses .
What was the name of Joyce 's father ?
A quick Google search turns up the DNB entry , which reveals all .
And what was the name of the woman who proved to be Parnell 's downfall ?
Ah yes , here it is : Kitty O'Shea ... and so it goes on .
The combination of powerful search facilities with the web 's facilitation of associative linking is what is eroding Carr 's powers of concentration .
It implicitly assigns an ever - decreasing priority to the ability to remember things in favour of the ability to search efficiently .
And Carr is not the first to bemoan this development .
In 1994 , for example , Sven Birkerts published The Gutenberg Elegies with the subtitle The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age , a passionate defence of reading and print culture and an attack on electronic media , including the internet .
' What is the place of reading , and of the reading sensibility , in our culture as it has become ? ' he asked .
His answer , in a word , was ' shrinking ' due to the penetration of electronic media into every level and moment of our lives .
But people have worried about this since ... well ... the Greeks .
In the Phaedrus , Socrates tells how the Egyptian god Theuth tried to sell his invention - writing - to King Thamus as 'an accomplishment which will improve both the wisdom and the memory of the Egyptians .
I have discovered a sure receipt [ recipe ] for memory and wisdom . '
To which the shrewd old king replied that ' the discoverer of an art is not the best judge of the good or harm which will accrue to those who practise it ...
Those who acquire writing will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful ...
What you have discovered is a receipt for recollection , not for memory . '
In other words , technology giveth ; and technology taketh away .
Now , who was it who said that ...?

Post readers .
We really , really appreciate the hat tip from HP here at the little blog on the prairie .
Thank you !

Update # 3 : And welcome to everybody here from Andrew Sullivan 's Daily Dish and MyDD . [ end update ]
We knew the National Republican Congressional Committee , its chair Tom Cole , and House minority leader John Boehner were not enjoying Congress like they used to when they had control back in 2006 .
And their get - up - and - go had diminished to procedural games and time chewing motions to adjourn .
Their gloom was so bad last week , the caucus by and large voted against Motherhood , as the WaPo reported .
Nonetheless , we were alarmed by the slogan for the minority caucus 's re-branding campaign , for it directly -- though probably inadvertently -- addresses the depressed opportunities House Republicans might be feeling of late .
In the New York Times article , House G.O.P. Adopts Change
Theme , we learn :
It looks like Republicans will counter the Democratic push for change from the years of the Bush administration with their own pledge to deliver , drum roll please , “ the change you deserve . ”
The first element of the party agenda developed over the past few months by the leadership and select party members will focus on family issues .
“ Through our “ Change You Deserve ” message and through our “ American Families Agenda , ” House Republicans will continue our efforts to speak directly to an American public looking for leaders who will offer real solutions for the challenges they confront every day , ” said the memo prepared for lawmakers .
We think the slogan will only heighten the public 's perception that the House Republican caucus needs help .
After all , Americans have heard that slogan time and again .
Unfortunately , it was n't pimped for political discourse , but to market an anti-depressant .
According to Wikipedia , the prescription drug " Venlafaxine is used primarily for the treatment of depression , generalized anxiety disorder , social anxiety disorder , and panic disorder in adults . "
The brand name version , Effexor , is sold by Wyeth , which marketed it using the slogan , " The Change You Deserve™ . "
According to a December 2007 Alternet article , Are You One of Big Pharma 's Lab Animals ? , the drug company 's ad agency came up with this marketing slant :
Wyeth 's ad agency serenaded the nation with the message in its " The Change You Deserve™ " campaign that , if we were not enjoying things the way we used to do , if we were lacking in what agencies used to call get - up - and - go , it was time to go on the antidepressant Effexor .
" The Change You Deserve™ " was trademarked by Wyeth , so we 're wondering if that will be a problem for the NRCC , regardless of the unfortunate analogy between its political fortunes and the genuine suffering that plagues people experiencing depression .
Evidence of trademark and the analogy are found in this promotional text sponsored by Wyeth :
The Change You Deserve™
Are these symptoms of depression interfering with your life ?
Not involved with family and friends the way you used to be ?
Low energy , fatigue ?
Not motivated to do the things you once looked forward to doing ?
Not feeling as good as you used to ?
If you 're experiencing symptoms of depression and you 're not where you want to be , talk to your doctor about your treatment options .
Learn more about a treatment option that may help you get back to your life again .
We do n't intend to make light of depression or any mental illness , for we 've known far too many people who have suffered from them ; MN - 03 Republican congressman Jim Ramstad can retire with well - earned pride for his work on getting the Wellstone Mental Health Parity Act passed .
Nonetheless , using a well - known shrug drug 's advertising slogan for rebranding is unfortunate at best .
A Freudian slip ?
Self - sabotage ?
Who knows .
Somehow , we doubt the slogan for a red pill with " W " on it will help the GOP much in November .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold futures rallied to a close near $ 929 an ounce on Wednesday , with weakness in the U.S. dollar and soaring oil prices taking the metal 's total price gain to more than 7 % in five sessions .
" Clearly the gold market is riding on the waves of momentum generated from the ailing U.S. dollar and from extremely strong oil markets , among other driving forces , " said Peter Spina , an analyst at GoldSeek.com .
" There remains very good potential for gold to revive the powerful bull market momentum from earlier this year , which could carry it significantly higher in the coming weeks . "
“ ' Oil is obviously leading gold and if the historical gold vs. oil ratio ever returns , we could see gold as high as $ 1,500 . ' ” — Peter Grandich , Grandich Letter
Gold for June delivery gained $ 8.40 to close at $ 928.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
It climbed as high as $ 931 in the regular trading session .
As of Wednesday , the contract has logged a gain of $ 62.10 since the May 14 close at $ 866.50 .
" Oil is obviously leading gold and if the historical gold vs. oil ratio ever returns , we could see gold as high as $ 1,500 , " said Peter Grandich , editor of the Grandich Letter .
Gold 's appeal as an inflation hedge was boosted by the surge in oil prices , which broke through another key level on Wednesday , this time topping $ 130 a barrel on the familiar fears that supplies can't keep up with growing demand from emerging markets .
See Futures Movers .
Oil domination
" If ever there was an oil - dominated trading day , today was it as far as gold was concerned , " said Jon Nadler , a senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers .
" Trading focus remains on just how far up the value scale crude oil can be pushed by speculators before either demand simply dries up or a global recession is triggered , " he said in emailed comments .
" There 's an inevitable correction in oil but after a short while , we should see money plow back in as oil , food and water shortages are going to make these commodities in high demand for years to come , " Grandich said in emailed comments .
Spina also said there 's likely to be a decline in the oil price .
Part of the short - term risk / reward equation is " a sizeable pullback in the oil price as short - term gains appear overextended , " he said in emailed comments .
And , as for the U.S. dollar , " prospects on the whole remain bleak and any short - term rebounds will be met with heavy selling , " he said .
On the currency markets Wednesday , the dollar fell against most of its major counterparts , with the dollar index dropping to 71.91 from 72.459 in late North American trading Tuesday .
Dollar weakness typically benefits dollar - denominated commodities , such as gold and crude oil , because it makes them cheaper for holders of other major currencies .
See Currencies .
An official summary of the Federal Open Market Committee 's April 30 meeting reinforced belief that the central bank has paused its rate - cutting cycle and clearly remains worried about inflation and growth .
Immediately after the news , the dollar had little reaction , while June gold edged higher in electronic trading , but remained below $ 930 .
Short - term trends in oil or the dollar could " inflict some damage into [ gold 's ] renewed and growing momentum , " said Spina .
But " until the reversal in these pro-gold trends , I would be quite afraid to stand in front of this golden bull . "
“ ' Gold is riding on oil 's coattails , although it lacks the requisite internal fundamentals as we saw in yesterday 's World Gold Council report . ' ” — Jon Nadler , Kitco Bullion Dealers
Silver prices climbed along with gold to close at its highest level since April 17 .
July silver gained 33 cents , or 1.9 % , to finish at $ 18.05 an ounce .
July platinum rose $ 73.20 , or 3.4 % , to close at $ 2,221 an ounce , June palladium tacked on $ 12.95 to end at $ 463.20 an ounce and July copper fell 3.55 cents to $ 3.7445 a pound .
The SPDR Gold Trust GLD , +0.84 % closed up 1.2 % at $ 91.96 and the iShares Silver Trust ETF SLV , +2.18 % rose 2.1 % to end at $ 178.60 .
The Market Vectors - Gold Miners ETF GDX , +1.28 % fell by 0.2 % to close at $ 48.63 .
The World Gold Council said Tuesday that demand for gold exchange - traded funds doubled from the first quarter of last year , but demand for the precious metal in terms of tonnage dropped 16 % to its lowest quarterly figure in five years .

" Gold is riding on oil 's coattails , although it lacks the requisite internal fundamentals as we saw in yesterday 's World Gold Council report , " said Kitco 's Nadler .

Listen to the MP3 audio version of this commentary .
British Prime Minister Tony Blair apologized for doing " too little " in response to the Irish Potato Famine of the 19th century that killed one million people and brought about the emigration of millions more .
But in fact , the English government was guilty of doing too much .
Blair 's statement draws attention to the question of what caused the famine .
Up to now , the popular theory is that the Irish were promiscuous , slothful , and excessively dependent on the potato .
As a result they died by the hundreds of thousands when a blight appeared and ruined their food source , in the midst of one of the fastest economic growth periods in human history .
Was the Potato Famine an ecological accident , as historians usually say ?
Like most famines , it had little to do with declines in food production as such .
Adam Smith was right that " bad seasons " cause " dearth , " but " the violence of well - intentioned governments " can convert " dearth into famine . "
In fact , the most glaring cause of the famine was not a plant disease , but England 's long - running political hegemony over Ireland .
The English conquered Ireland , several times , and took ownership of vast agricultural territory .
Large chunks of land were given to Englishmen .
These landowners in turn hired farmers to manage their holdings .
The managers then rented small plots to the local population in return for labor and cash crops .
Competition for land resulted in high rents and smaller plots , thereby squeezing the Irish to subsistence and providing a large financial drain on the economy .
Land tenancy can be efficient , but the Irish had no rights to the land they worked or to any improvements they might make .
Only in areas dominated by Protestants did tenant farmers have any rights over their capital improvements .
With the landlords largely residing in England , there was no one to conduct systematic capital improvements .
The Irish suffered from many famines under English rule .
Like a boxer with both arms tied behind his back , the Irish could only stand and absorb blow after blow .
It took the " many circumstances " of English policy to create the knockout punch and ultimate answer to the Irish question .
Free - market economist J.B.
Say was quick to note that the system of absentee landlords was deplorable .
He accurately diagnosed this cause and grimly predicted the disastrous results that did follow .
He sadly relayed the suggestion of a member of Parliament that the seas swallow up the Island of Erin for a period long enough to destroy everything on it .
The Malthusian law of population is sometimes used to explain away English guilt .
Here the Irish were viewed as a promiscuous bunch that married young and had too many children .
Malthus himself considered the Irish situation as hopeless .
The Irish then paid for their sins via the starvation and disease that the famine wrought .
Were the Irish such a promiscuous bunch ?
The population of Ireland was high and the island had become densely populated after union with Great Britain in 1801 .
Part of this population growth can be attributed to basic economic development as population was also increasing rapidly in England and elsewhere in Europe .
In fact , the Irish population was only growing slightly faster than the English population and was starting from a much smaller base .
But why was it growing faster ?
The answer lies in the fact that England had placed Ireland in an unusual position as the breadbasket for the Industrial Revolution .
The British Corn Laws were designed to protect local grain farmers from foreign competition .
In 1801 , these laws were extended to Ireland .
The laws not only kept prices high ; they protected against falling prices in years of plenty .
The main beneficiaries of this protectionism were the English absentee landlords of Ireland , not the Irish .
The Irish people were able to grow large quantities of nutritious potatoes that they fed their families and animals .
Landlords benefited from the fact that the potato did not deplete the soil and allowed a larger percentage of the estate to be devoted to grain crops for export to England .
Higher prices encouraged the cultivation of new lands and the more intense use of existing farmlands .
A primary input into this increased production was the Irish peasant who was in most cases nothing more than a landless serf .
Likewise , the population growth rate did slow in response to reduced levels of protectionism in the decade prior to the Famine .
This artificial stimulus to the Irish population was secure with English landlords in control of Parliament .
However , English manufacturers and laborers supported free trade and grew as a political force .
With the agitation of the Anti-Corn Law League , the Whigs and Tories agreed in 1845 to reduce protectionist tariffs and the Corn Laws altogether by 1849 .
The price of wheat plummeted in 1847 ( " corn " being British for grains , especially wheat , the prime grain protected under the Corn Laws ) , falling to a 67 - year low .
Repeal drastically impacted the capital value of farmland in Ireland and reduced the demand for labor as Irish lands converted from grain production to pasture .
It should be clear that while free trade did bring about these changes , the blame for both stimulating prefamine population growth and the subsequent depopulation ( the Irish population did not recover until 1951 and net emigration did not end until 1996 ) rests with English protectionism and the Corn Laws .
These price shocks made a population decline inevitable .
As emigration became a viable option , many Irish decided to take the long and dangerous journey to the New World rather than the ferryboat to the factories of England .
Let us now take a look at the so - called laissez - faire approach that the English applied to the famine and for which Tony Blair apologized .
This is important because it forms the backbone of the case that the free market cannot address famine and crisis ( also that the IMF and FEMA are all the more necessary today ) .
Far from allowing the market to work , England launched a massive program of government intervention , consisting mainly of building workhouses , most completed just prior to the onset of the Famine .
Earlier , the Irish Poor Inquiry had rejected the workhouse as a solution to poverty .
In the report , Archbishop Whately — attacked today for his free - market stand — argued that the solution to poverty is investment and charity , but these " radical " findings were rejected by the English who threw out the report and appointed George Nicholls to write a new one .
The workhouses , an early version of New Deal make - work programs , only made the problem of poverty worse .
A system of extensive public works required heavy taxation on the local economy .
The English officials directed money away from projects that would increase productivity and agricultural output into useless road building .
Most of these roads began nowhere and ended nowhere .
Worse yet , the policy established by Sir Charles Trevelyan to pay below - market wages , which you can well imagine were pretty low , meant that workers earned less in food than the caloric energy they typically expended in working on the roads .
The British government opened soup kitchens in 1847 and these were somewhat successful because they mimicked private charity and provided nutrition without requiring caloric exertion or significant tax increases .
But the kitchens were quickly ended .
Next came a return of the workhouses , but again they could not solve the problem of poverty and hunger .
In the summer of 1847 , the government raised taxes , a truly callous act .
In addition to the fundamental failure of the government programs , workhouses , public works , and soup kitchens tended to concentrate the people into larger groups and tighter quarters .
This allowed the main killer of the Famine — disease — to do its evil work .
Fewer Irish people had died in the numerous past famines ; indeed , the potato blight did not severely afflict most of Europe .
What was different in Ireland in the 1840s ?
The Irish Poor Law crowded out private charity .
In previous famines , the Irish and English people had provided extensive charity .
But why donate when the taxpayer was taking care of the situation ?
The English people were heavily taxed to pay for massive welfare programs .
The Irish taxpayer was in no position to provide additional charity .
Reports concerning English policy towards genuine charity are hard to ignore .
One account had the people of Massachusetts sending a ship of grain to Ireland that English authorities placed in storage claiming that it would disturb trade .
Another report has the British government appealing to the Sultan of Turkey to reduce his donation from £ 10,000 to £ 1,000 in order not to embarrass Queen Victoria who had only pledged £ 1,000 to relief .
Other factors played a role .
The Bank Act of 1844 precipitated a financial crisis created by a contraction of money as a more restrictive credit policy replaced a loose one .
Taken together these factors support John Mitchel 's accusation that " the Almighty sent the potato blight but the English created the Famine . "
Did the English create the Famine on purpose ?
This was after all an age of revolution , and the Irish were suspected of plotting yet another revolt .
The " Irish Question " was of major importance and many Englishmen agreed with Trevelyan that God had sent the blight and Famine .
Ultimately , the question of blame is not as important as the question of cause .
Even more importantly , the Famine is a source of great economic errors , such as the claim that famines are the fault of the market and free trade , and that starvation results from laissez - faire policy .
Even Karl Marx was heavily influenced by events happening in Ireland as he wrote in London .
Ireland was swept away by the economic forces that emanated from one of the most powerful and aggressive states the world had ever known .
It suffered not from a fungus ( which English scientists insisted was just excessive dampness ) but from conquest , theft , bondage , protectionism , government welfare , public works , and inflation .
As an American , I am hardly one to consider Mr. Blair 's apology .
However , if the apology had been for causing the Famine and for the welfare policies that made it so deadly , it would have much more to recommend it .

When I walked into your store that fateful Tuesday , I expected only to find a smattering of half - decent titles tucked back there amongst the used 360 games .
Instead I found you , surrounded by a beam of light , halfway between Assassin 's Creed and Call of Duty 3 .
Your gorgeous dark hair was radiant in contrast with the rainbow of colors on the deluxe Bioshock behind you .
The Game of the Year held no interest for me when I saw you look up and smile , even though both could hold me in Rapture .
You commanded the register when it was my turn to check out with the Orange Box .
Yes , I was finally getting to play Portal .
Lucky me , you said with the cutest smile .
Lucky me , I thought , and then knew you had the Portal to my heart .
I could care less if the cake is a lie , I 'd still want to share it with you .
Oh GameStop Girl , how you make my heart meter skip a beat .
If you were being held captive in a mountain fortress by a ruthless mutant mafia gangboss and I had to fight my way through 16 levels of fire - breathing undead ninjas with swords the size of small ponies , I would find a way , even if , after every level , a small man continued to taunt me by saying that you were in another castle .
EVEN IF .
So , yes , GameStop Girl , I want to kill robotic zombie terrorists with you .
You can even have the deluxe shotgun with explosive scattershot .
I 'll just use this knife over here .
I 'll do anything for you , just for the small , slightest chance that someday - someday - you and me could be a Wii .
The fake file claims to be an mp3 of Girls Aloud Almost 500,000 people have been caught out by a booby - trapped media file , says security firm McAfee .
The fake file poses as a music track , short video or movie and has been widely seeded on file - sharing networks to snare victims .
McAfee said the fake media file outbreak was the largest it had seen for about three years .
Those running the fake file get bombarded with pop-up ads and risk compromising the safety of their PC .
The fake file or trojan has been widely distributed on the eDonkey and Limewire file - sharing networks .
The file has many names and is written in different languages to trick people into downloading it .
The titles make the file appear to be music tracks , pornography and full versions of popular movies .
Anyone downloading the trojan and trying to run it is asked to install a codec that will play the supposed media .
FAKE FILE TITLES girls aloud st trinnians .mp3 changing times earth wind .mp3 heartbroken fast t2 ft jodie.
mp3 meet bambi in kings harem.mp3 paralyized by you .mp3 pull over levert.mp3
Instead of playing the media , running the file installs a bundle of adware that plagues a user with pop-ups .
Included in the bundle is an MP3 media player that will only play the tracks included with it .
McAfee said seeing such a large outbreak was rare because hi-tech criminals typically prefer to target their malicious creations to keep numbers manageable and to avoid detection .
In the last seven days McAfee said the trojan had been found on more than 500,000 of the PCs that notify the company when a malicious file is downloaded .
It added that , so far , only 10 % seem to have gone as far as to install the fake codec and be plagued with pop-ups .
Other security companies have seen the trojan but not in such large numbers as McAfee .
Only those using Windows are vulnerable to the malicious program .
McAfee urged users to update their security software and to be wary when using file - sharing networks .

There are so many different types of comedy movies that any list like this is going to have its fans and huge detractors .
What is hard to deny is when an individual actor puts one such a strong showing that the comedy succeeds on their shoulders alone .
So this list is of ten of the best comedic performances to remember , performances where the star or stars made the comedy what it was .
10 Shaun of the Dead 2004
Simon Pegg plays the leading role of Shaun , a normally average man , on the verge of being a loser , who is likable and easy to relate to .
From the start , Pegg ’s personality dominates this great horror / satire / comedy .
From the opening scene with his groggy waking up moan to his interaction with his flat mates , Pegg ’s performance is commanding , and he consistently steals the scene .
This is a fantastic movie , and I can’t imagine any other actor being able to pull this character off to the same level .
9 Office Space 1999
Ron Livingston plays a fan favorite in character Peter Gibbons .
A hero to many an overworked cubicle white collar worker , Livingston ’s portrayal of the hypnotized do n’t care you ca n’t push me around worker helps this film by making every understated joke hilarious , adding depth to every punch line .
By not going over the top , by just being normal , Livingston has a gravitas in this film that you usually do n’t get from a hero who says I just do n’t want to do anything .
If he had messed up this character even a little , this movie would n’t have worked at all .
8 Happy Gilmore 1996
Adam Sandler makes this film .
This may have been one of his best roles , and probably his best comedy .
This character of Happy Gilmore is intense , strange , and has that edge that makes him crude yet likable , rebellious and a little scary .
That touch of instability is what makes him work , and this is a popular comedy that does n’t work with anyone other than Adam Sandler — something that ca n’t be said about most of his other films .
7 Ace Ventura , Pet Detective 1994
A lot of people will argue with the statement I ’m about to make , but this was a really dumb movie .
Still , Ace Ventura is an extremely original character , and this movie has a lot of fans for only one reason : Jim Carrey .
Jim Carrey took his slapstick physical comedy to its most extreme levels in this movie , and love him or hate him , the role is an unforgettable performance .
6 The Naked Gun 1988
Leslie Nielsen is known for a series of these films , but I really do believe the first one was by far and away the best , since in later movies they kept dumbing his character down more and more .
The physical humor and timing of gags were at their funniest here , before a lot of imitators dumbed these types of movies down .
While I do n’t care for any of the sequels , Leslie Nielsen ’s performance here made this movie , and the franchise of sequels to follow .
5 Babes in Toyland 1934
I remember as a kid watching this Laurel & Hardy movie during the holidays and loving it .
Years later I worried it would n’t hold up , but I should have known better .
Babes in Toyland is Laurel & Hardy at their slapstick best .
Every expression , every line , every gag is a joy in this film , and no other duo could pull off the movie the way these two could .
4 The Big Lebowski 1998
This film has the distinct honor of having two actors who gave amazing , memorable , comedic performances .
While everyone knows Jeff Bridges was absolutely amazing as The Dude , and his acting of that character is one of the best comedic performances ever , in my opinion it ’s only the second best of the movie .
John Goodman as Vietnam veteran and hilariously dysfunctional person Walter Sobchak takes the cake .
From pulling a gun at a bowling alley because he was over the line , to jumping out of a car with an Uzi , to not watching the wind while scattering the ashes : everything has to go back to ‘ Nam , and this character gives the movie and extra boost that makes it extraordinary .
3 Napoleon Dynamite 2004
I have never seen a movie so affected by the generation gap as this one .
If you ’re 30 and younger , you generally love it .
If you ’re older , you generally hate it .
John Heder is amazing as the dorky but likable Napoleon Dynamite , coming out as one of the most original characters .
He nails the performance , and carries this film on his back .
I just ca n’t imagine this movie being anything but a flop without Heder ’s fantastic comedic acting and great portrayal of the poor American dorks .
Alas , this movie brought back memories of high school .
I feel the pain .
2 The Jerk 1979
This movie more than any other allowed Steve Martin to display his acting skills in an understated , yet hilarious comedic performance .
It may not have been his best movie , but as far as one actor carrying a film , this is Steve Martin putting in a great performance of timing and self - deprecating humor .
The end scene especially is one that has me laughing so hard tears roll down my face , and I just ca n’t believe he pulled it off .
As a singular performance , Steve Martin was amazing in this one .
1 Animal House 1978
This movie is full of great characters , but John Belushi may hand in the best comedic acting job in history with this incredible performance .
Every time Belushi is on screen he is the focus of attention , from his great rants about Germans bombing Pearl Harbor , to the famous ladder scene , Bluto is an unforgettable character who is charismatic , hilarious , and intense .
Without him , this is just another forgotten college comedy .
With him , this is one of the all time classic comedy films .

For a charity auction a few years back , the photographer Patrick Demarchelier donated a private portrait session .
The lot sold , for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars , to the wife of a very rich man .
It was her wish to pose on the couple ’s yacht .
“ I call her , I say , ‘ I come to your yacht at sunset , I take your picture , ’ ” Demarchelier recalled not long ago .
He took a dinghy to the larger boat , where he was greeted by the woman , who , to his surprise , was not wearing any clothes .
“ I want a picture that will excite my husband , ” she said .
Capturing such an image , by Demarchelier ’s reckoning , proved to be difficult .
“ I can not take good picture , ” he said .
“ Short legs , so much done to her face it was flat . ”
Demarchelier finished the sitting and wondered what to do .
Eventually , he picked up the phone : “ I call Pascal .
‘ Make her legs long ! ’ ”
Pascal Dangin is the premier retoucher of fashion photographs .
Art directors and admen call him when they want someone who looks less than great to look great , someone who looks great to look amazing , or someone who looks amazing already — whether by dint of DNA or M** ·A· ** C — to look , as is the mode , superhuman .
( Christy Turlington , for the record , needs the least help . )
In the March issue of Vogue Dangin tweaked a hundred and forty - four images : a hundred and seven advertisements ( Estée Lauder , Gucci , Dior , etc. ) , thirty - six fashion pictures , and the cover , featuring Drew Barrymore .
To keep track of his clients , he assigns three - letter rubrics , like airport codes .
Click on the current - jobs menu on his computer : AFR ( Air France ) , AMX ( American Express ) , BAL ( Balenciaga ) , DSN ( Disney ) , LUV ( Louis Vuitton ) , TFY ( Tiffany & Co. ) , VIC ( Victoria ’s Secret ) .
Vanity Fair , W , Harper ’s Bazaar , Allure , French Vogue , Italian Vogue , V , and the Times Magazine , among others , also use Dangin .
Many photographers , including Annie Leibovitz , Steven Meisel , Craig McDean , Mario Sorrenti , Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin , and Philip - Lorca diCorcia , rarely work with anyone else .
Around thirty celebrities keep him on retainer , in order to insure that any portrait of them that appears in any outlet passes through his shop , to be scrubbed of crow ’s - feet and stray hairs .
Dangin ’s company , Box Studios , has eighty employees and occupies a four - story warehouse in the meatpacking district .
“ I have Patrick ! ” an assistant to Miranda Priestly , the editor of Runway , exclaims in “ The Devil Wears Prada , ” but her real - life counterparts probably log as much time speed - dialling Pascal .
Dangin is , by all accounts , an adept plumper of breasts and shrinker of pores .
Using the principles of anatomy and perspective , he is able to smooth a blemish or a blip ( “ anomalies , ” he calls them ) with a painterly subtlety .
Dennis Freedman , the creative director of W , said , “ He has this ability to make moves in someone ’s facial structure or body .
I ’ll look at someone , and I ’ll think , Can we redefine the cheek ?
Can we , you know , change a little bit the outline of the face to bring definition ?
He , on the other hand , will say , ‘ No , no , no , it ’s her neck . ’
He will see it in a way that the majority of people do n’t see it . ”
Dangin salvaged a recent project at W by making a minute adjustment to the angle of a shoulder blade .
The obvious way to characterize Dangin , as a human
Oxy pad , is a reductive one — any art student with a Mac can wipe out a zit .
His success lies , rather , in his ability to marry technical prowess to an aesthetic sensibility : his clients are paying for his eye , and his mind , as much as for his hand .
Those who work with Dangin describe him as a sort of photo whisperer , able to coax possibilities , palettes , and shadings out of pictures that even the person who shot them may not have imagined possible .
To construct Annie Leibovitz ’s elaborate tableaux — the “ Sopranos ” ads , for example — he takes apart dozens of separate pictures and puts them back together so that the seams do n’t show .
( Misaligned windows are a particular peeve . )
He has been known to work for days tinting a field of grass what he considers the most expressive shade of green .
“ Most green grass that has been electronically enhanced , you know , you look at it and you get a headache , ” Dangin said recently .
He prefers a muted hue — “ much redder , almost brown in a way ” — that is meant to recall the multilayered green of Kodachrome film .
Photograph by Patrick Demarchelier , New York City , Tuesday , April 29 , 2008 .
As renowned as Dangin is in fashion and photographic circles , his work , with its whiff of black magic , is not often discussed outside of them .
( He is not , for instance , credited in magazines . )
His hold on the business derives from the pervasive belief that he possesses some ineffable , savantlike sympathy for the soul of a picture , along with the vision ( and maybe the ego ) of its creator .
“ Just by the fact that he works with you , you think you ’re good , ” Leibovitz said .
“ If he works with you a lot , maybe you think , Well , maybe I ’m worthwhile . ”
His job description is enigmatic .
People I asked about him invariably resorted to metaphor : he is a translator , an interpreter , a conductor , a ballet dancer articulating choreographed steps .
These analogies , though , do n’t account for pursuits that , while probably contributing less to Dangin ’s income than wrinkle extermination does , occupy more of his time and intellect .
He has become a master printer , “ digitally remastering ” old negatives and producing fine - art prints for exhibition .
“ When I see a print , I could probably tell you if it was a Pascal print , ” Charlotte Cotton , the head of photography at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , said .
“ It ’s immaculate , and there ’s a kind of richness to the pixellation .
It feels like you could almost sink your finger into it . ”
Books are another love : he is the publisher of SteidlDangin , an imprint of lush art volumes — for instance , a collection of a thousand Philip - Lorca diCorcia Polaroids .
A tinkerer and an autodidact , who started out as a hairdresser , Dangin brings to mind , actually , a building superintendent : he knows how to do a lot of jobs , and those he does n’t he figures out through trial and error .
He is , more than anything , the consigliere for a generation of photographers uncomfortable with , or uninterested in , the details of digital technology .
According to Cotton , “ Pascal is actually an unwritten author of what is leading the newest areas of contemporary image - making . ”
His digital brushstrokes can be as deliberate as Jasper Johns ’s or John Currin ’s are on canvas , but they are not as consistent — part of Dangin ’s skill lies in being able to channel the style , and the fancy , of whatever photographer he is collaborating with .
In the spring of 2004 , the Prada campaign , shot by Steven Meisel , had a retro , vacationy look — tie - dyed cardigans , hairbands , sailboat prints .
Using a Photoshop tool called a smudge brush , Dangin applied extra color to every pixel , giving the pictures — hard and flat , at the outset — a dreamy , impressionistic texture , as if they had been wrought in oil and chalk .
The walls of the third - floor meeting room at Dangin ’s headquarters , on West Fourteenth Street , hold magnets in the manner of a refrigerator door .
One afternoon in November , grease pencils , in the colors of the rainbow , were stuck , by magnets , to one wall .
Nearby , several of Dangin ’s assistants were hanging a blueprint — a scaled rendition of the Petit Palais museum , in Paris , where , in September , Patrick Demarchelier will have a retrospective .
Dangin was designing the exhibit , from the pictures ( many of which he would retouch ) and their frames down to the traffic - flow patterns of the museumgoers who would look at them .
Dangin would do all of the printing .
He was also publishing a companion monograph .
" We returned to find that the chap who owned it had bumped it onto his own land and had taken a rather drastic step of using a petrol - fuelled angle grinder to cut it in half .
He managed to set fire to it at the same time .
Thanks to Auto - Tune , T - Pain ’s vocal hooks can sound delirious .

Tourists black out reflective retinas in snapshots before printing them , and millions of people refer to strangers they ’ve never spoken to as friends , because they ’ve connected through a social - networking platform .
The transition from living in the stubborn physical world to managing a life that is split between platforms , where the ability to change aspects of your identity ( at least digitally ) is always an option , is becoming more common .
It should come as no surprise , then , that singers sometimes choose to correct recorded flaws in pitch with modern software , like Antares ’s Auto - Tune .
Andy Hildebrand , Auto - Tune ’s inventor , spent eighteen years in a field called seismic data exploration , a branch of the oil industry .
He worked in signal processing , using audio to map the earth ’s subsurface .
His technique involved a mathematical model called autocorrelation .
The layers below the earth ’s surface could be mapped by sending sound waves — dynamite charges work nicely in unpopulated areas — into the earth and then recording their reflections with a geophone .
As it happened , autocorrelation could detect pitch as well as oil , and Hildebrand , who had taken some music courses , turned his engineering skills toward pop .
Most of the time , Auto - Tune is used imperceptibly , to correct flat or sharp notes .
The New York producer Tom Beaujour , who records rock bands that sound nothing like contemporary R. & B. or pop , says that it gets used , in one way or another , in almost every session that he works on .
Often , it solves logistical problems : an artist has left the studio and has no opportunity to return just to re-sing one or two off notes .
But pitch correction has also taken on a second life , as an effect .
You ’ve probably heard it , most recently on the No. 1 song in the country , Lil Wayne ’s lazy , mildly naughty rap “ Lollipop . ”
Auto - Tune , properly torqued up , is the rare edit that calls attention to itself .
Auto - Tune software detects pitch , and when a vocal is routed through Auto - Tune , and a setting called “ retune speed ” is set to zero , warbling begins .
This , roughly , is what happens : Auto - Tune locates the pitch of a recorded vocal , and moves that recorded information to the nearest “ correct ” note in a scale , which is selected by the user .
With the speed set to zero , unnaturally rapid corrections eliminate portamento , the musical term for the slide between two pitches .
Portamento is a natural aspect of speaking and singing , central to making people sound like people .
A nonmusical example of portamento would be “ up - speak , ” a verbal tic common in some people under thirty .
( Can you imagine the end of every sentence rising in pitch ?
Like a question ? )
Processed at zero speed , Auto - Tune turns the lolling curves of the human voice into a zigzag of right - angled steps .
These steps may represent “ perfect ” pitches , but when sung pitches alternate too quickly the result sounds unnatural , a fluttering that is described by some engineers as “ the gerbil ” and by others as “ robotic . ”
The first popular example of Auto - Tune ’s distorting effect was Cher ’s 1998 hit “ Believe , ” produced by Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling .
During the first verse , Auto - Tune makes the phrase “ I ca n’t break through ” wobble so much that it ’s hard to discern .
More successful is the gentler variation in the following line , “ so sad that you ’re leaving , ” which highlights the software ’s strength .
Auto - Tune can produce a controlled version of losing control , hinting at various histrionic stations of the human voice — crying , sighing , laughing — without troubling the singer .
It is notable that “ Believe ” ’s big chorus — “ Do you believe in life after love ? ” — is delivered ( mostly ) in a full , human - sounding voice , with no robotic modifications .
You can only feel so bad for a robot .
Before “ Believe , ” Auto - Tune was a closely held producers ’ secret .
( “ They did n’t want to be known to manipulate the pitch of sound , ” Hildebrand says . )
After “ Believe , ” radical pitch alteration showed up repeatedly — in , among other places , a chunk of Madonna ’s “ Music ” album , from 2000 , Jamaican dancehall singles , and pop hits like JoJo ’s “ Too Little Too Late , ” which uses a human - to - robot ratio very similar to that of “ Believe . ”
In the manual accompanying Auto - Tune ’s fifth - release version , the zero speed setting is described as “ the Cher Effect . ”
No one has used Auto - Tune ’s zero speed setting more consistently and successfully than the R. & B. singer T - Pain .
Born Faheem Najm , in Tallahassee , he has become such a common guest on pop records that in a single week last year he was featured on four singles in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 chart , including the No. 1 song , Chris Brown ’s “ Kiss Kiss . ”
In the same way that the dry , flat drum sounds in Fleetwood Mac ’s “ Rumours ” will forever say “ mid- seventies , ” T - Pain and Auto - Tune will forever remind people of the late aughts .
T- Pain , who is currently working on his third album , “ Thr33 Ringz , ” spoke to me on the phone from his studio in Miami .
He first heard the Auto - Tune effect on a song by Jennifer Lopez — he does n’t remember which one — and borrowed it for a mixtape appearance in 2003 .
He says it ’s no trade secret that he uses Auto - Tune with the retune speed set to zero , and likes to recall a time he spent selling fish out of a truck with his father in Tallahassee : “ My dad said , ‘ They can know what you ’re using , but they ’ll never know how to use it .
They can see that we ’re using salt and pepper . ’ ”
The Auto - Tuned T - Pain is rarely a mopey presence .
In his hands , the program becomes pop music ’s rose - colored glasses , or a balloon ’s worth of helium inhaled .
His vocals hang , flickering , and suggest not a technological intervention but a chemical one .
His vocal hooks sound delirious , not desperate .
Someone once asked Hildebrand if Auto - Tune was evil .
He responded , “ Well , my wife wears makeup .
Is that evil ? ”
Evil may be overstating the case , but makeup is an apt analogy : there is nothing natural about recorded music .
Whether the engineer merely tweaks a few bum notes or makes a singer tootle like Robby the Robot , recorded music is still a composite of sounds that may or may not have happened in real time .
An effect is always achieved , and not necessarily the one intended .
Are n’t some of the most entertaining and fruitful sounds in pop—distortion , whammy bars , scratching — the result of glorious abuse of the tools ?
At this late date , it ’s hard to see how the invisible use of tools could imply an inauthentic product , as if a layer of manipulation were standing between the audience and an unsullied object .
In reality , the unsullied object is the Sasquatch of music .
Even a purely live recording is a distortion and paraphrasing of an acoustic event .
Sir George Martin , via e-mail , wrote to me about his work with John Lennon , one of the most famously processed voices in pop history .
“ It ’s true that John was never satisfied with the sound of his voice , ” Martin explained .
“ He failed to realize that what he heard came through the bones of his body and was not his true sound .
He was always looking for perfection , and in his imagination his voice was always superior to the sound of anything on tape . ”
To paraphrase , what we hear on Beatles records is Lennon ’s imagination .
T - Pain ’s deployment of Auto - Tune is a similar assertion of self , no different in kind from the older , more traditional tricks of tape - splicing , double - tracking the voice , and adding a little reverb .
When I asked T - Pain if he could ever forgo Auto - Tune , he said , “ I got a song on my album about my kids .
I ai n’t use it on that one . ” ♦
BALLA , India ( Reuters ) - Five armed men burst into the small room and courtyard at dawn , just as 21 - year - old , 22 - week pregnant , Sunita was drying her face on a towel .
The bodies of Sunita Devi ( L ) , 21 , and her partner Jasbir Singh , 22 , lie on the ground after they were killed by villagers in an " honour killing " in Ballah village in the northern Indian state of Haryana May 9 , 2008 .
Growing economic opportunities for young people and lower castes in Haryana have made " love marriages " more common , experts say , and the violent repression of them has risen in tandem as upper caste Jat men fight to hold on to power , status and property .

They punched and kicked her stomach as she called out for her sleeping boyfriend “ Jassa ” , 22 - year - old Jasbir Singh , witnesses said .
When he woke , both were dragged into waiting cars , driven away and strangled .
Their bodies , half - stripped , were laid out on the dirt outside Sunita ’s father ’s house for all to see , a sign that the family ’s “ honor ” had been restored by her cold - blooded murder .
A week later , the village of Balla , just a couple of hours drive from India ’s capital New Delhi , stands united behind the act , proud , defiant almost to a man .
Among the Jat caste of the conservative northern state of Haryana , it is taboo for a man and woman of the same village to marry .
Although the couple were not related , they were seen in this deeply traditional society as brother and sister .
“ From society ’s point of view , this is a very good thing , ” said 62 - year - old farmer Balwan Arya , sitting smoking a hookah in the shade of a tree in a square with other elders from the village council or panchayat .
“ We have removed the blot . ”
Growing economic opportunities for young people and lower castes in Haryana have made “ love marriages ” more common , experts say , and the violent repression of them has risen in tandem as upper caste Jat men fight to hold on to power , status and property .
Sunita ’s father Om Prakash has confessed to murdering his pregnant daughter and her boyfriend , police told Reuters .
An uncle and two cousins were among four others arrested .
But in Balla many people believe the father confessed merely to underline that he supported his daughter ’s killing , to satisfy honor and protect the real culprits among his family or village .
At their house , Sunita ’s mother did not emerge to talk .
Instead , a young man on a motorbike tried to intimidate the Reuters team into leaving .
It turned out he was another of Sunita ’s cousins , his father and brother held by police .
“ We are not ashamed of it , absolutely not , we have the honor of doing the village proud , ” he said .
“ We would not have had a face to show if we had not done this .
It was the act of ‘ real men ’ . ”
THE POWER OF UPPER CASTE MEN
The relatively prosperous northern state of Haryana is one of India ’s most conservative when it comes to caste , marriage and the role of women .
Deeply patriarchal , caste purity is paramount and marriages are arranged to sustain the status quo .
Men and women are still murdered across the villages of northern India for daring to marry outside their caste , but in Haryana the practice is widespread , and widely supported .
Here , women veil their faces with scarves in public .
The illegal abortion of female fetuses is common , the ratio of women to men in Haryana just 861 to 1,000 , the lowest in the country .
Anyone who transgresses social codes , by marrying across caste boundaries or within the same village , is liable to meet the same fate as Sunita and Jasbir .
Many such murders are never reported , hardly any result in prosecution , says Professor Javeed Alam , chairman of the Indian Council of Social Science Research .
“ People from the same village are treated as siblings in Haryana , ” he said .
“ So this is treated as incest . ”
Without any law to prohibit this kind of marriage , “ the only way you can punish it is by taking the law into your own hands .
People believe people who commit incest should be killed ” .
Nor do politicians ever renounce the practice , Alam added , because if they did , “ they would not win elections ” .

And the legalization of property rights for women in 1956 made love marriages within a village even more dangerous for this elite , as daughters living close to home could in theory claim a part of the family land , sociologist Prem Chowdhry says .
CHILDHOOD SWEETHEARTS
Sunita and Jasbir , sweethearts in the same class at school , had little chance .
When he left school a couple of years before her to become an photographer ’s apprentice , he would often hang around at the school gates to collect her .
She was married off to another man , but left her husband to elope with Jasbir a year - and - a - half ago , and while the families tried to keep them apart , they realized it was a losing battle .
“ They were madly in love even to the last day , ” said Jasbir ’s 16 - year - old sister - in - law Lalita in the house where they lived in Machhroli village , around 35 km ( 20 miles ) by road from Balla .
To make matters worse , Jasbir was from a lower sub-caste , and she was pregnant outside marriage .
Sunita ’s parents in Balla found themselves virtually ostracized .
“ Nobody would drink water in our house , ” Sunita ’s mother Roshni is reported to have said .
“ My daughter ’s action made us aliens in our own land .
But we have managed to redeem our honor .
She paid for her ill - gotten action . ”
But among Jasbir ’s family , split between Machhroli and Balla , grief is mixed with fear .
“ Why are you talking to the media ? ” shouted a female family member at one point .
“ This will only bring more trouble . ”
At the small police post in Balla , a constable admitted the case was unlikely to ever reach prosecution , with the village putting enormous pressure on the police , and especially Jasbir ’s family , to quietly drop the case .
“ We are being pressurized into reaching an agreement , a compromise , without even being given time to grieve , ” said Jasbir ’s 25 - year - old sister Neelam .
“ We have been told that if we do n’t compromise , we will suffer the same fate . ”
In the narrow alleyway outside their tiny house , women wailed in grief .
A few hundred yards away , the panchayat sat in quiet self - satisfaction .
“ The people who have done this should get an award for it , ” said 48 - year - old Satvir Singh .
“ This was a murder of morality . ”

It ’s a delicate dance , and John McCain is ‘ liable to break a hip ’
Update :
This post has been updated , expanded , and broken down by category .
Long - time readers know that I ’ve been emphasizing John McCain ’s dozens of major policy flip - flops for months now , hoping that this would a ) catch on as a campaign issue ; and b ) undermine McCain ’s unearned reputation for principled stands on the issues .
I ’m beginning to think that maybe , just maybe , the criticism is taking root .
Consider yesterday ’s “ Cafferty File ” on CNN :
For those who ca n’t watch clips online , Jack Cafferty noted some of McCain more glaring recent reversals , adding , “ If John McCain does n’t stop changing his position on the issues , he threatens to make John Kerry look like an amateur .
In order for McCain to win in November , he has to appeal to both the traditional Republican base and to Independents .
Dana Milbank , in The Washington Post says that ’s a delicate dance .
And if McCain ’s not careful , ‘he ’s liable to break a hip . ’
Of course , any doctor will tell you a broken hip can be very difficult to recover from . ”
The past couple of weeks have been especially difficult when it comes to McCain flip - flops .
* McCain supported the drilling moratorium ; now he ’s against it .
* McCain strongly opposes a windfall - tax on oil company profits .
Three weeks earlier , he was perfectly comfortable with the idea .
* McCain thought Bush ’s warrantless - wiretap program circumvented the law ; now he believes the opposite .
* McCain defended “ privatizing ” Social Security .
Now he says he ’s against privatization ( though he actually still supports it . )
Wait , I ’m not done with the last two weeks yet … .
* McCain wanted to change the Republican Party platform to protect abortion rights in cases of rape and incest .
Now he does n’t .
* McCain thought the estate tax was perfectly fair .
Now he believes the opposite .
* He opposed indefinite detention of terrorist suspects .
When the Supreme Court reached the same conclusion , he called it “ one of the worst decisions in the history of this country . ”
* McCain said he would “ not impose a litmus test on any nominee . ”
He used to promise the opposite .
And these come after these other reversals from April and May :
* McCain believes the telecoms should be forced to explain their role in the administration ’s warrantless surveillance program as a condition for retroactive immunity .
He used to believe the opposite .
* McCain supported storing spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada .
Now he believes the opposite .
* McCain supported moving “ towards normalization of relations ” with Cuba .
Now he believes the opposite .
* McCain believed the U.S. should engage in diplomacy with Hamas .
Now he believes the opposite .
* McCain believed the U.S. should engage in diplomacy with Syria .
Now he believes the opposite .
* He argued the NRA should not have a role in the Republican Party ’s policy making .
Now he believes the opposite .
* McCain supported his own lobbying - reform legislation from 1997 .
Now he does n’t .
* He wanted political support from radical televangelists like John Hagee and Rod Parsley .
Now he does n’t .
* McCain supported the Lieberman / Warner legislation to combat global warming .
Now he does n’t .
And these are the flip - flops I ’ve noticed earlier :
* McCain pledged in February 2008 that he would not , under any circumstances , raise taxes .
Specifically , McCain was asked if he is a “ ‘ read my lips ’ candidate , no new taxes , no matter what ? ” referring to George H.W. Bush ’s 1988 pledge .
“ No new taxes , ” McCain responded .
Two weeks later , McCain said , “ I ’m not making a ‘ read my lips ’ statement , in that I will not raise taxes . ”
* McCain is both for and against a “ rogue state rollback ” as a focus of his foreign policy vision .
* McCain says he considered and did not consider joining John Kerry ’s Democratic ticket in 2004 .
* In 1998 , he championed raising cigarette taxes to fund programs to cut underage smoking , insisting that it would prevent illnesses and provide resources for public health programs .
Now , McCain opposes a $ 0.61 - per - pack tax increase , wo n’t commit to supporting a regulation bill he ’s co-sponsoring , and has hired Philip Morris ’ former lobbyist as his senior campaign adviser .
* McCain has changed his economic worldview on multiple occasions .
* McCain has changed his mind about a long - term U.S. military presence in Iraq on multiple occasions .
* McCain is both for and against attacking Barack Obama over his former pastor at his former church .
* McCain believes Americans are both better and worse off than they were before Bush took office .
* McCain is both for and against earmarks for Arizona .
* McCain believes his endorsement from radical televangelist John Hagee was both a good and bad idea .
* McCain ’s first mortgage plan was premised on the notion that homeowners facing foreclosure should n’t be “ rewarded ” for acting “ irresponsibly . ”
His second mortgage plan took largely the opposite position .
* McCain vowed , if elected , to balance the federal budget by the end of his first term .
Soon after , he decided he would no longer even try to reach that goal .
* In February 2008 , McCain reversed course on prohibiting waterboarding .

In 2007 , after receiving “ feedback ” on the proposal , McCain told far - right activist groups that he opposes his own measure .

We will win it easily . ”
Four years later , McCain said he knew all along that the war in Iraq war was “ probably going to be long and hard and tough . ”

In December 2003 , McCain praised the same strategy as “ a mission accomplished . ”

Confronted with the inconsistencies in McCain ’s record in March , the senator ’s aides told the New York Times that the senator “ has evolved rather than switched positions in his 25 - year career . ”
That ’s a perfectly sensible spin — when a politician holds one position , and then , for apparently political reasons , decides to embrace the polar opposite position , it ’s only natural for his or her aides to say the politician ’s position has “ evolved . ”
But in McCain ’s case , the spin is wholly unfulfilling .
First , McCain sells himself as a pol who never sways with the wind , and whose willingness to be consistent in the face of pressure is proof of his character .
Second , Republicans have spent the last four years or so making policy reversals the single most serious political crime in presidential politics .
The dreaded “ flip - flop ” is , according to the GOP , the latest cardinal sin for someone seeking national office .
And if we ’re playing by Republican rules , McCain ’s “ evolutions ” should be a fairly serious problem .
I ’m beginning to think they might be .
Ms. Sandberg - Cook asked whether Mr. Gieg would want treatment if he was found to have cancer .
If not , why go through a biopsy , which might further weaken his voice ?
Or risk anesthesia , which could accelerate her husband ’s dementia ?
“ Those are the very questions on my mind , too , ” Ms. Gieg replied .
The Giegs took their time , opted for no further tests or treatment , and Charley came back to the retirement community to die .
Such decisions are not made lightly , and not without debate , especially in an aging society .
Many in their 80s and 90s  and their boomer children  want to pull out all the stops to stay alive , and doctors get paid for doing a procedure , not discussing whether it should be done .
The costliest patients  the elderly with chronic illnesses  are the only group with universal health coverage under Medicare , leading to huge federal expenditures that experts agree are unsustainable as boomers age .
Most of that money is spent at certain academic medical centers , which offer the most advanced tests , the newest remedies , the most renowned specialists .
According to the Dartmouth Health Atlas , which ranks hospitals on the cost and quantity of medical care to elderly patients , New York University Medical Center in Manhattan , for instance , spends $ 105,000 on an elderly patient with multiple chronic conditions during the last two years of life ; U.C.L.A. Medical Center spends $ 94,000 .
By contrast , the Mayo Clinic ’s main teaching hospital in Rochester , Minn. , spends $ 53 , 432 .
The chief medical officer at U.C.L.A. , Dr. Tom Rosenthal , said that aggressive treatment for the elderly at acute care hospitals can be “ inhumane , ” and that once a patient and family were drawn into that system , “ it ’s really hard to pull back from it . ”
“ The culture has a built - in bias that everything that can be done will be done , ” Dr. Rosenthal said , adding that the pace of a hospital also discourages “ real heart - to - heart discussions . ”
Beginning that conversation earlier , as they do at Kendal , he said , “ sounds like fundamentally the right way to practice . ”
OSLO ( Reuters ) - A slowdown of deforestation from the Amazon to the Congo basin could generate billions of dollars every year for developing nations as part of a U.N. scheme to fight climate change , a study showed on Monday .

Burning of forests by farmers clearing land accounts for 20 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions .
A 190 - nation U.N. climate conference agreed in Bali , Indonesia , in December to work on ways to reward countries for slowing deforestation .
“ Even with quite conservative assumptions , you can generate substantial amounts of money and emissions reductions , ” said Johannes Ebeling of EcoSecurities in Oxford , England , of a study with Mai Yasue at the University of British Columbia in Canada .
They said a 10 percent decline in the rate of tropical forest loss could generate annual carbon finance for developing nations of between 1.5 billion and 9.1 billion euros ( $ 2.4 to $ 14.30 billion ) assuming carbon prices of 5 to 30 euros a tonne .
Such curbs would represent about 300 million tonnes of avoided carbon dioxide emissions a year -- about the amount of heat - trapping gases , mainly from burning fossil fuels , emitted by Turkey , or half the total of France .
The United Nations wants reduced emissions from deforestation to be part of a new long - term climate treaty beyond 2012 to help avert more droughts , heatwaves , outbreaks of disease and rising seas .
Ebeling told Reuters that any credits for avoided deforestation would have to be matched by tough restrictions elsewhere , for instance forcing coal - fired power plants or cement factories to pay for right to emit carbon dioxide .
BRAZIL
The study , published in the British journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B , said there were big challenges in designing a fair system .
So far , most focus in the U.N. debate had been on rewarding countries with high deforestation rates -- such as Brazil and Ecuador -- for slowing the losses .
But nations such as Guyana or Suriname , which have maintained high forest cover , or others like Costa Rica and Chile , which have slowed or reversed deforestation , would gain little .
There were also problems such as judging the rate of deforestation or creating controls to ensure that protecting one forest does not lead to logging or clearance of another .
And some poor countries that could benefit -- such as Liberia or Myanmar -- may simply lack controls needed to regulate land use .
Still , Ebeling said he was optimistic a system could be worked out because of a widening political willingness to address deforestation as part of a new treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol beyond 2013 .

( Corrects name of aid group in para 15 to International SOS from SOS International )
BANGKOK , May 12 ( Reuters ) -
A furious rescue worker accused Myanmar 's military junta on Monday of crimes against humanity for refusing to give visas to aid officials desperate to enter the country to help the 1.5 million survivors of Cyclone Nargis .
" They say they will call , but it 's always wait , wait , wait , " Pierre Fouillant of the Comite de Secours Internationaux , a French disaster rescue agency , told Reuters after being turned away from the former Burma 's embassy in the Thai capital .
" I 've never seen delays like this , never , " said Fouillant , a veteran of 10 humanitarian disasters .
" It 's a crime against humanity .
It should be against the law .
It 's like they are taking a gun and shooting their own people . "
Like dozens of others , Fouillant applied on Thursday for a business visa , his only option since the military - ruled and isolated southeast Asian nation has no such thing as an " emergency aid worker " visa .
The embassy was closed on Friday for a Thai holiday , and on Saturday and Sunday .
It opened as normal on Monday morning .
At least 100,000 people are thought to have died in the May 2 cyclone and storm surge in the Irrawaddy delta , a death toll that could rise dramatically if survivors do not get access to food , clean water and medicine in the next few days , experts say .
Reuters witnesses on the edges of the disaster zone say towns and villages are being swamped by huge numbers of cyclone refugees and cannot cope .
There is virtually no government assistance and food is running out .
Some residents say they are afraid the desperate evacuees will be forced to turn to looting .
FRUSTRATION
Against this backdrop , small groups of rescue workers are having to wait outside the iron - spiked , grey walls of the embassy compound in Bangkok while their leaders and local visa agents try to see if their applications have got anywhere .
" It is very frustrating , " said Australian firefighter Craig Allan , who dropped everything at home to get to Bangkok and apply for a visa on Thursday .
His agency , part of Baptist World Aid , is called " Rescue 24 " as it is meant to be able to put a team on the ground within 24 hours of any disaster anywhere in the world .
In this case , it might be 24 days , he joked bleakly .
The U.N. said its top representative in Myanmar had flown to Naypyidaw , the generals ' new capital , on Monday to hand over in person a list of 60 " critical " U.N. and relief agency staff .
Despite this , U.N. officials said none of its staff in Bangkok had received any visas on Monday .
They also said foreign staff inside the country were prevented from leaving Yangon .
" There are limits , if not bans , on staff going to the delta , " Terje Skavdal of the U.N. 's humanitarian arm told reporters .
Patrick Michaudel , a French employee of medical services firm International SOS , with clinics in Yangon , was almost in tears as he left the embassy after a fruitless week - long visa wait .
When he got to the front of the queue , Michaudel was elated to see his passport open on the desk with a visa inside .
He could only watch in horror as a female official then carefully peeled the visa sticker out of his passport and crudely covered up the partial stamp on the passport page with liquid paper .
" No reason , no reason .
She just peeled it out , " he said , with a shrug of the shoulders .
" I 've had enough of this .
I 'm going home . "

All the talk about the bad oil bubble obscures the potentially good bubble still inflating in the realm of alternative energy .
Wind turbine installations more than doubled last year .
Ethanol production capacity will nearly double once all the plants under construction are completed .
Investors have given SunPower , a solar panel spinoff from Cypress Semiconductor , a market value much larger than that of its former parent .
Such exuberance is characteristic of bubbles that periodically inflate .
Some , like the one we ’ve had in housing , end in losses and Congressional investigations .
Others , like the dot - com boom , leave behind something useful .
During a bubble , investment is spurred by technological progress and new economic assumptions  in this case about the price of oil , climate change and the desire to curb carbon emissions .
Government does its part by using subsidies and the tax code to encourage the new industry .
Just as in the 19th century the federal government offered land grants to inspire a railroad boom , Congress today is pushing an alternative energy boom by mandating ethanol use and giving generous tax credits for solar and wind - based energy .
The investment has already led to more efficient solar panels , wind turbines and storage batteries .
Many of the new alternative energy companies will fail .
But that ’s when the fun will begin .
Think about what happened after the dot - com bust .
The commercial infrastructure laid down in the 1990s  fiber - optic cables , servers , payment systems  was put to use by new companies like Google , YouTube and Facebook .
For 2007 , the Top 10 exporters of finished gasoline to the U.S. in million barrels were :
I actually started on this post about a year ago , and forgot about it until recently .
Here I provide 2007 numbers on the sources for oil and gasoline imports into the U.S. , courtesy of the Energy Information Administration .
1. United Kingdom 25.147 million barrels ( total for the year )
2. U.S. Virgin Islands 23.590
3. France 11.209
4. Canada 10.605
5. Netherlands 10.518
6. Norway 8.406

Europeans have a higher per capita demand for diesel .
Since you get diesel and gasoline from the refining process , they can get rid of their excess gasoline by sending it to the U.S.
That helps keep gasoline prices in check , but obviously does nothing for diesel prices .
Take a look at recent diesel prices to see what gasoline prices might look like if not for the imports .
For 2007 , our Top 10 exporters of crude oil to the U.S. in million barrels were :
1. Canada 680.533 million barrels ( total for the year )
2. Saudi Arabia 530.245
3. Mexico 514.48
4. Venezuela 419.841
5. Nigeria 394.856
6. Angola 181.215
7. Iraq 177.009
8. Algeria 161.755
9. Ecuador 72.138
10 . Kuwait 64.306

If you compare to the list for gasoline imports , Canada is the only country common to both lists ( although " OPEC Countries " in total came in at # 10 on the gasoline list ) .
Any surprises on that list ?
I am surprised to see Ecuador in the Top 10 .
I would have thought Brazil would have come in higher than Ecuador ( Brazil was 11th ) .
Also note that Mexico and Saudia Arabia swapped places in 2007 - and this situation is likely to be permanent .
Total OPEC imports in 2007 were 1.97 billion barrels .
Total non-OPEC imports were 1.69 billion barrels .
Consider how dependent we are on oil , how oil prices have run up , and the resulting massive transfer of wealth out of the U.S. and into other countries .
This is a big reason that I am pessimistic about the U.S. economy recovering any time soon .
A lot of discretionary income is disappearing from American pockets and ending up flowing into the hands of oil exporters .
An obvious solution is to do more business with these oil producers , and offer them something of value that will pull more of that money back .
I am also basing many of my personal finance decisions based on the premise that this trend will continue .
Despite evidence of mental retardation , Mississippi executes inmate by lethal injection
By Kate Randall
22 May 2008
Earl Wesley Berry was executed Wednesday evening at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman .
His lethal injection was administered at around 6 p.m. local time after all last - minute appeals for a stay had been exhausted .
Berry ’s attorney provided evidence to state courts that he was mentally retarded , which would have rendered his execution unconstitutional , but he was denied an evidentiary hearing on procedural grounds .
The US Supreme Court denied his attorneys ’ request for a stay on Wednesday afternoon .
Justice Antonin Scalia , and then the full court , denied the request for a stay , clearing the way for Berry ’s execution .
He was the second prisoner executed since the US Supreme Court ruled April 16 in a case brought by two Kentucky death row inmates that the lethal injection procedure does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment as banned by the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution .
Georgia inmate William Earl Lund was executed on May 6 , putting an end to an effective seven - month moratorium on executions in the US awaiting the outcome of the Kentucky case .
Earl Berry , 49 , was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1987 beating death of Mary Bounds in north Mississippi .
Earl ’s brother James , who first alerted authorities that his brother might be connected to the crime , recalled later , “ They said if I told what I knew , they would n’t even ask for the death penalty .
But they did . ”
Berry confessed to the crime and refused a plea deal that would have given him life in prison .
He was sentenced to death on October 28 , 1988 after a jury trial .
The 1988 death sentence was overturned by the state Supreme Court , which found fault with the instructions given to the jury .
At a re-sentencing hearing in June 1992 , the defense presented evidence from a neuro - psychologist about Earl Berry ’s low intellectual functioning and possible brain damage .
A psychologist also testified that Berry suffered from paranoid schizophrenia .
In his inflammatory closing statement to the jury , the prosecutor called for vengeance for Berry ’s victim , who had been a “ faithful member of the First Baptist Church , a member of the choir , taught Sunday school . ”
Urging them to vote for the death penalty , he said that “ it ’s authorized by Mississippi , and it ’s been authorized by scriptural law for a long time . ”
The jury voted for the death penalty .
In a divided ruling , the US Supreme Court ruled in June 2002 in Atkins v. Virginia that execution of the mentally retarded is unconstitutional .
In 2004 in Chase v. State , the Mississippi Supreme Court laid down the criteria for determining which state inmates sentenced to death before the high court ruling should receive an evidentiary hearing on the basis of a mental retardation claim .
To qualify , a condemned prisoner must provide an affidavit from a mental health expert showing an IQ of 75 or lower , and that “ there is a reasonable basis to believe that , upon further testing , the defendant will be found to be mentally retarded . ”
For reasons that are not clear , Berry ’s public defenders at the time did not include such an affidavit with their claim of his retardation .
In August 2004 , the state Supreme Court denied him an evidentiary hearing on the basis of this legal technicality .
In a statement on Wednesday , Amnesty International said that there was “ significant evidence that Earl Wesley Berry may have mental retardation ” and called on Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour to halt his execution .
“ In 2002 , the Supreme Court banned the execution of people with mental retardation , yet Berry has been denied a hearing because a lawyer missed a deadline , ” the human rights organization stated .
“ Life and death can not hinge on simple technicalities . ”
The governor said Monday he would not grant clemency .
There was ample evidence to suggest that Earl Berry suffered from mental retardation .
In an April 2008 affidavit filed by his new attorneys , a psychologist with expertise in mental retardation concluded that Berry had an IQ of 75 or lower and / or “ significantly sub - average intellectual functioning ” and determined that “ to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty that further testing will demonstrate that Mr. Berry meets the criteria established by the American Psychiatric Association and the American Association on Mental Retardation to be classified as mentally retarded . ”
The affidavit also noted that when Berry , then 25 , was discharged from a Mississippi Department of Corrections prison hospital in April 1985 following an apparent suicide attempt , he received a final diagnosis of “ suicidal gestures / mentally retarded . ”
Other affidavits from relatives and acquaintances described his slow development as a child and childhood head injuries .
His mother , Velma Berry , said doctors told her he had the skill of a 7 - year - old .
He was never able to live independently and Mrs. Berry said he attempted suicide six or seven times .
His attorneys had appealed to the Supreme Court for a stay both on the basis of Berry ’s mental retardation as well as the unconstitutionality of Mississippi ’s lethal injection procedure .
Mississippi state courts and the Fifth US Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans had previously ruled against him on both counts .
Jim Craig , one of Berry ’s attorneys , stated Tuesday , “ The Mississippi protocol for lethal injections does not provide the same safeguards as the [ Kentucky ] process . ”
He said his client was asking the high court “ to review the facts of the Mississippi protocol for lethal injections to ensure that it provides adequate safeguards against low doses of anaesthetic and other issues that would cause excruciating pain and a torturous death . ”
Critics of the three - drug lethal injection procedure argue that if the first chemical , sodium thiopental , is mal - administered , the prisoner may not be rendered unconscious , meaning the prisoner can be subject to excruciating pain when the other two chemicals are injected : pancuronium bromide , which paralyzes muscle movement , and potassium chloride , which induces cardiac arrest .
The Death Penalty Information Center lists 28 known incidents of botched lethal injections .
In refusing to stay the execution on the basis of Mississippi ’s protocol , it appears that the high court will be unwilling to hear or rule in favor in cases arguing the unconstitutionality of the lethal - injection procedure on a state - by - state basis .
While Earl Berry ’s challenge on the basis of his mental retardation was rejected by the state on the basis of a technicality , in a cynical twist a federal judge was able to look the other way when the technical violation was on the prosecution ’s side .
Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood failed to respond to lethal - injection challenges filed by four death row inmates .
The four had filed their challenges along with Earl Berry in October 2007 .
The judge dismissed Berry as a plaintiff in the case , but the attorney general never responded to the others .
In documents filed in US District Court in Greenville , Attorney General Jim Hood admits to the error , but claimed it was due to his office ’s preoccupation with appeals by Earl Berry .
On May 5 , US District Judge Allen Pepper found Hood and his office in default for failure to defend the state against the plaintiffs ’ claim .
Last Friday , however , Judge Pepper dismissed the default order , saying Hood ’s inaction “ appears to be more of an issue of irresponsible behavior than it does willful disregard . ”
On Monday , the four inmates ’ attorneys said they would agree to the dismissal of the default judgment if Berry ’s challenge to the lethal - injection procedure were heard along with the others .
Such a move would have necessitated staying Berry ’s execution and an agreement from the attorney general to put scheduling of all executions on hold pending the outcome of the challenge .
Judge Pepper ’s lifting of the default order has enabled the executions to proceed on course .
Earl Wesley Berry was the 1,101st inmate put to death in the US since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976 .
Last October , he had eaten his last meal and was just 17 minutes from execution when he was granted a last - minute stay on the basis of the Kentucky case .
Tonight , May 22 , the state of Georgia is scheduled to send condemned inmate Samuel David Crowe to his death .
Through the end of October , a total of 20 other executions are planned in Virginia , Texas , South Carolina , Oklahoma , Florida and Louisiana .
As expected , last month ’s ruling by the Supreme Court has opened the way for re-starting the assembly - line of sanctioned state killings , a practice banned and condemned by the overwhelming majority of industrialized countries , including all of the European Union .

ET .
Jean Lemire Dahlman , a rancher and National Democratic committeewoman from Forsyth , Montana told RAW STORY that she will give Sen .
Obama her superdelegate vote and explained why discounting much of the argument Sen.
Clinton has been using to continue her campaign .
A local newspaper interview published in April said that Dahlman would endorse Obama but she told us this was her formal endorsement of the Illinois senator .
 When you re in college and you read Platos Philosopher King , you think , yeah , thats what I want in a leader ; someone who can lead and unite us and I m not sure Hillary can , " Dahlman said .
" Shes smart .
Shes capable , but I dont think she can unite us and thats why Im giving Barack Obama my superdelegate vote . "
Dahlman said , " When I told the Obama campaign back in April that I would endorse him , I was n't sure if it was or it was n't distributed .
I did n't read any newspaper stories about it or see it on the news websites and we do n't have a television . "
The Dahlmans live on a sprawling ranch outside the rural town of Forsyth in a village called Rosebud .
Tucked away in the southeastern part of Montana near the Wyoming border and the Yellowstone River , Rosebud is not far from where Lt. Col.
George Armstrong Custer camped before his ultimate defeat at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 .
Dahlman is predicting a similar defeat for Sen.
Clinton should she stay in the race by the time Montana Democrats vote in the last primary of the season June 3 .
" There 's no ' white working voter ' problem for Barack here , " Dahlman continued .
" Yesterday , I was at the post office and I asked a retired welder - a union guy - if he was going to Billings tomorrow to see Bill [ Clinton ] and he said he did n't think he should since he 's going to vote for Barack .
And another guy - a young electrician - told me that he 's supporting Barack and working hard for him .
The people I see on the street are all white and they have no problem voting for a man whose father is black .
It 's what he stands for - he 's authentic , he is n't pandering and he 's telling us the truth - that 's why people here are voting for him and that 's why he 'll win Montana . "
There are 8 Montana superdelegates .
Two have already endorsed Obama and Ms. Dahlman 's vote brings his total to three .
None has yet endorsed Sen. Clinton .
" I care about health care insurance , the economy , and the war in Iraq and I also want a person who is unafraid to go against the grain , even when it 's unpopular , " Dahlman added .
" I do n't give a dime about [ Sen. Clinton ] gas roll - back plan .
It 's not going to do us any good in the long run and when Obama came out against that - that 's what I 'm looking for .
Nonsense issues like the gas roll - back or wearing an American flag pin on your lapel .
He [ Barack ] keeps tells the people the truth . "
Dahlman said she was hesitant to make her vote public on a news website even though she had told several active Democrats which direction she was leaning saying .
" I just do n't want to influence anyone 's vote because there is so much enthusiasm for our primary , " she said .
" I want everyone to vote their conscience but as a superdelegate I also get to vote that way , too . "
She also added , " Oh , and I have friends who are hardcore Hillary backers and I did n't want to offend them .
I want to be a National [ Democratic ] committeewoman again .
This is a small town . "
Correction :
The first edition of this article stated Sen .
Obama 's total committed superdelegate count in Montana was four .
The total is three with Ms. Dahlman 's vote .
The world of motorsports was shocked by a report of a video tape which surfaced , allegedly showing FIA president Max Mosley participating in a bizarre sadomasochistic orgy .
The reports emanate from British tabloid News of the World , but have been spreading rapidly across mainstream media and the motoring press .
The video reportedly depicts Mosley engaging the services of five prostitutes in London to stage a perverse reenactment of a Nazi concentration camp in which Mosley plays both victim and oppressor , alternately receiving lashes from a dominatrix and barking orders in German to the prostitutes dressed in pseudo - Auschwitz uniforms .
The son of infamous wartime British fascist leader Oswald Mosley , who married Max 's mother Diana in the presence of Adolf Hitler at a ceremony in the home of Nazi arch - propagandist Joseph Goebbels , Mosley had tried to help resuscitate his father 's fascist political career before leaving politics for the world of motor racing .
Meanwhile Mosley 's closest allies include former Ferrari chief Jean Todt ( the son of a Holocaust survivor ) and Jewish business mogul Bernie Ecclestone , who has publicly come to Mosley 's defense .
Mosley is reportedly considering pursuing legal action against News of the World , while sources suggest the World Council of the FIA may be preparing a vote of no confidence in Mosley 's leadership .
In the meantime it 's business as usual for Mosley , who is heading to Bahrain to preside over the grand prix there next weekend .

The military plan to ‘ clandestinely ’ put bloggers on the payroll
For quite a while , the debate over blogs in the Defense Department was over whether U.S. troops should be allowed to have them at all .
On the one hand , some officials were concerned about security breaches , with troops inadvertently sharing compromising information online .
On the other , some saw blogs as a morale - boosting outlet for the troops .
But as Noah Shachtman explained in an interesting report yesterday , a study was written for U.S. Special Operations Command that took an entirely different approach to online communication , which included the suggestion of possibly “ clandestinely recruiting or hiring prominent bloggers . ”
“ Hiring a block of bloggers to verbally attack a specific person or promote a specific message may be worth considering , ” write the report ’s co-authors , James Kinniburgh and Dororthy Denning … .
Denning , a professor at Naval Postgraduate School , adds in an e-mail , “ I got some positive feedback from people who read the article , but I do n’t know if it led to anything . ”
The report introduces the military audience to the “ blogging phenomenon , ” and lays out a number of ways in which the armed forces — specifically , the military ’s public affairs , information operations , and psychological operations units — might use the sites to their advantage .
The Kinniburgh / Denning report was quite provocative , suggesting paying prominent bloggers to address “ entrenched inequalities , ” presumably in the media .
The study did , however , note the downsides of such a plan : “ People do not like to be deceived , and the price of being exposed is lost credibility and trust . ”
Now , it ’s worth emphasizing that there ’s no apparent evidence that the Pentagon actually put any prominent bloggers on the payroll .
A spokesperson for U.S. Special Operations Command told Shachtman that the Kinniburgh / Denning report was merely an academic exercise : “ The comments are not ‘ actionable ’ , merely thought provoking . ”
As far as I know , prominent bloggers who toe the administration ’s line on Iraq policy are doing so for ideological reasons , not financial ones .
But having said all of that , is it really that surprising officials would consider a proposal to put bloggers on the Pentagon ’s payroll ?
Sure , it ’s offensive on a certain level to imagine the Defense Department using our tax dollars to co-opt bloggers for propaganda purposes .
But given the Bush administration ’s track record , I ’d almost be surprised if officials did n’t consider a proposal to put bloggers on the Pentagon ’s payroll .
After all , the administration ’s track record is quite breathtaking .
We ’ve seen propagandistic efforts over …
Titled “ The Sands Are Blowing Toward a Democratic Iraq , ” an article written this week for publication in the Iraqi press was scornful of outsiders ’ pessimism about the country ’s future .
“ Western press and frequently those self - styled ‘ objective ’ observers of Iraq are often critics of how we , the people of Iraq , are proceeding down the path in determining what is best for our nation , ” the article began .
Quoting the Prophet Muhammad , it pleaded for unity and nonviolence .
But far from being the heartfelt opinion of an Iraqi writer , as its language implied , the article was prepared by the United States military as part of a multimillion - dollar covert campaign to plant paid propaganda in the Iraqi news media and pay friendly Iraqi journalists monthly stipends , military contractors and officials said .
… and over …
Federal investigators probing the Education Department ’s public relations contracts have found a pattern of deals in which advocacy organizations received grants totaling nearly $ 4.7 million to promote Bush administration education priorities in newspaper columns and brochures , but did n’t disclose that they received taxpayer funds , as required by law .
… and over again .
Under the Bush administration , the federal government has aggressively used a well - established tool of public relations : the prepackaged , ready - to - serve news report that major corporations have long distributed to TV stations to pitch everything from headache remedies to auto insurance .
In all , at least 20 federal agencies , including the Defense Department and the Census Bureau , have made and distributed hundreds of television news segments in the past four years , records and interviews show .
Many were subsequently broadcast on local stations across the country without any acknowledgement of the government ’s role in their production .
This winter , Washington has been roiled by revelations that a handful of columnists wrote in support of administration policies without disclosing they had accepted payments from the government .
But the administration ’s efforts to generate positive news coverage have been considerably more pervasive than previously known .
At the same time , records and interviews suggest widespread complicity or negligence by television stations , given industry ethics standards that discourage the broadcast of prepackaged news segments from any outside group without revealing the source .
The Pentagon considered a plan to pay bloggers to get the administration ’s message out ?
Of course it did .
Share prices around the world fell sharply today and the dollar plunged as shockwaves from the collapse of US investment bank Bear Stearns swept through financial markets .
Wall Street opened almost 200 points lower this afternoon , at 11,760.67 .
There was a brief respite later with the Dow Jones index briefly moving into positive territory .
By 5 pm , however , it was back in the red with a loss of 87 points , at 11,870 .
The FTSE 100 closed 217.3 points down , or 3.9 % , at 5,414.4 - its lowest since November 2005 .
There were sharp falls throughout the rest of Europe and in Asia the Nikkei 225 ended the day down 3.7 % at 11,787.51 , its lowest level in two - and - a - half years .
Banking shares were particularly hard hit , with billions of pounds slashed from their stock market value .
HBOS closed down more than 12 % .
Alliance & Leicester , Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays also suffered sharp falls .
The Bank of England moved to stabilise the markets this morning , offering £ 5bn of three - day funds in a move designed to bring overnight interest rates down .
Banks scrambled for the cash , asking for nearly five times more than was on offer .
The BoE said that along with other central banks it was " closely monitoring market conditions " .
Shares in investment bank Lehman Brothers , which has been the subject of intense rumours in recent weeks , plunged more than 25 % and there were sharp losses for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs - all are due to report results this week .
The $ 2 - a - share JP Morgan takeover of Bear Stearns was put together rapidly over the weekend , with the US authorities keen to tie up a deal before the Asian markets opened .
The US Federal Reserve took emergency action on Sunday , cutting its discount rate - the rate at which banks lend to each other - by a quarter of a point .
It also said it would set up a new lending facility for investment banks - something it has not done since the Great Depression in the 1930s .
US president George Bush attempted to reassure the markets this afternoon , saying that the Fed had taken " strong and decisive " action .
" In the long run our economy 's going to be fine .
Right now we 're dealing with a difficult situation . "
But the Fed 's actions failed to reassure the markets and traders remained in a state of near - panic , with many fearing that Bear Stearns will not be the last casualty of the credit crunch that has gripped the global financial system since last August .
In London , leading City figures said the scale of the crisis was virtually unprecedented : " It does scare me , " said veteran trader Terry Smith , chief executive of specialist inter - bank broker Tullett Prebon .
" I have been working in finance in the City and worldwide for 34 years and I have never seen anything like this , " Smith told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
" I do n't think anybody alive has seen events of this seriousness and magnitude affecting the financial markets . "
He doubts that lowering interest rates will have any real effect : " High interest rates did n't cause this problem , so lowering interest rates is n't going to solve it .
It is hard to see exactly what tools the authorities do have . "
Russell Jones , head of fixed income and currencies global research at RBC Capital Markets , said the markets are " in uncharted waters , at least in the modern day context " .
The Fed 's activities over the last fortnight imply that a number of systemic risks are crystalising - " and this in turn implies a need for an extraordinary response , " he said .
" If the US financial system is in as much trouble as it seems , it is a global problem and will require a global policy response . "
The dollar extended its recent heavy losses , falling to around ¥ 95.72 at one stage , the lowest level against the Japanese currency since August 1995 .
Sterling was one of the few currencies to fall against the ailing dollar today , dropping to around 2.0024 and reflecting the prospect of aggressive UK rate cuts .
In its statement on the emergency funding , the Bank of England said the action was being taken " in response to conditions in the short - term money markets this morning , " and said it would continue to act to ensure that the overnight rate is close to Bank rate .
Philip Shaw at Investec said the £ 5 bn represents a " substantial sum " in what is the Bank of England 's first " fine - tune " exercise since the Northern Rock crisis .
" Clearly the BoE is sufficiently concerned about the tightness of shortdated cash to take substantial action to add liquidity , " he said .
" However despite the size of the add , the initial response from UK interbank markets has been one of disappointment , in the sense that it is insufficient . "
The situation is " very serious " he said , and " represents a new and unwanted twist to the credit squeeze " .
Money markets moved to price in even more interest rate cuts than already expected from central banks .
UK rate futures are now pricing in a whole percentage point of base rate cuts by year - end .
In the US , traders fully expect tomorrow 's policy meeting to conclude with a whole percentage point cut in one fell swoop .
Some even expect the move before the Fed 's scheduled meeting .
Meanwhile gold , a traditional safe haven in times of turmoil , jumped by more than 3 % , hitting a new record of $ 1,030.80 an ounce .
Oil , reflecting the plunging dollar , spiked to a new peak of $ 111.80 .
Both later fell back , however , amid a sell - off of commodities on growing concerns over the state of the US economy .
Open Letter to WPFW : Gary Null ’s Hazardous Broadcast
Lee Phillips
Bobby Hill
Program Director

General Manager
pinchback_ron@wpfw.org
Dear Sirs : *
I frequently tune to WPFW in search of the real jazz , as that ’s the only place on the dial in the DC area where it can be found , and I am grateful for it .
On several recent occasions , however , I accidentally came across a program by Gary Null in which he broadcasts medical advice .
Most recently , I listened for a half hour , during which he did little but complain about his show having been cut to two days per week by the station .
I do n’t know how long this rant went on , but in my opinion WPFW has taken a step in the right direction .
In fact , I think that allowing this program to continue to be broadcast at all is a disservice to your listeners and puts the station at risk .
Just the week before I caught Null ’s interminable complaint about his schedule reduction , I heard him casually recommend ingesting 15,000 mg of vitamin C per day .
This is an extremely high dosage of this substance , far beyond any established safe dose .
A summary of research provided by the Mayo Clinic , for example , notes Upper limit of intake ( UL ) :
Should not exceed 2000 mg / day and warns that High doses of vitamin C have been associated with multiple adverse effects , particularly at doses greater than 2000 mg / day .
An article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , reviewing the dosing safety of vitamins C and E , concludes that As safety guidance , tolerable upper intake levels have been established by the Food and Nutrition Board , Institute of Medicine , at [ … ] 2000 mg for vitamin C in adults .
So Mr. Null ’s advice is clearly irresponsible and puts any listeners who take him seriously potentially at risk of serious health consequences .
I realize he refers to himself as Doctor Null , and likes to decorate his name with a Ph.D. , but his degree turns out to be as bogus as the M.S. that he sometimes puts after his name on publications .
I understand that Gary Null raises a great deal of money for WPFW and Pacifica , and that his broadcast is a kind of infomercial that he uses to steer listeners to his commercial website and vast array of products for sale .
But I ca n’t believe that anyone who cares about the wellbeing of WPFW ’s listeners and the reputation of the station would think that this is a good deal , after being informed of the dangerous and irresponsible content of what Mr. Null disseminates .
The vitamin C advice is not the worst of it .
You need merely to look at Gary Null ’s website to see that he is actively engaged in promoting the dangerous idea that AIDS is not caused by a sexually transmitted virus but by such things as malnutrition .
This borders on the insane .
Do n’t you worry that your listeners might trust you and , by extension , trust the voices they hear on your radio station ?
That some of these listeners might , after hearing what this man has to say about AIDS , think that they need not practice safe sex as long as they eat well ?
Would you feel any responsibility if some of these listeners contracted AIDS because they believed Gary Null ?
I appreciate that WPFW is committed to free speech and a diversity of viewpoints .
But you also decide who gets on the air and who does not .
I ’m sure you would not give a regular , extended platform to someone who advocates violence , oppression , or wars of conquest .
And maybe you are under the impression that Mr. Null has some sort of medical or nutritional qualifications ( he does not ) , and that he provides only benign advice about exercise and eating vegetables .
It might be that you did n’t know that Mr. Null ’s advice is likely to lead to health problems , lack of competent treatment of disease , and the spread of AIDS , if it is followed .
I would merely like to suggest that you look into these things yourselves and decide whether continuing to allow Gary Null to use WPFW to advertise his business is respectful of your listeners , or is morally defensible .
Sincerely ,
Dr. Lee Phillips
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- High - flying tech stocks crashed .
The roaring housing market crumbled .
And oil , rest assured , will follow the same path down .
Not everyone agrees .
In an echo of our most recent market frenzies , some experts pronounce that the " world has changed , " and that the demand spikes , supply disruptions , and government bungling we face now will saddle us with a future of $ 4 , $ 5 or even $ 10 a gallon gasoline .
But if you stick to basic economics , it 's clear that the only question is when - not if - prices will succumb .
The oil bulls are correct in their explanations of why prices have jumped , to a record $ 138.54 a barrel on Friday .
It 's indisputable that worldwide demand has surged , chiefly driven by strong growth in China , India and the Middle East .
It 's also true that most of the world 's reserves are controlled by governments in places like Russia and Venezuela that mismanage production , thus curtailing supply growth .
But rather than forming a permanent new plateau for prices - as the bulls contend - those forces are causing a classically unstable market that 's destined for a steep fall .
What do you think :
Is $ 4 - a - gallon case here to stay ?
In a normal oil market , the cost of producing the last , most expensive barrel of oil needed to satisfy worldwide demand sets the price for every barrel the world over .
Other auction commodity markets work much the same way .
So even if Saudi Arabia produces at $ 4 a barrel , if the final , multi-millionth barrel required to heat houses and run cars costs $ 50 , and is produced , for argument 's sake , at a flagging field in West Texas , the world price is $ 50 .
That 's what economists call the equilibrium price :
It 's where the price that customers are willing to pay meets the production cost , including a cushion , naturally , for profit or " the cost of capital . "
But today , the sudden surge in demand and the production bottlenecks have thrown the market radically out of balance .
Almost exactly the same thing happened in the housing market .
And both housing and oil supply react to a surge in demand with a long lag .
In housing , the lag is caused by restrictive zoning and development laws , especially in coastal markets like California and Florida .
So when the economy roared back in 2002 and 2003 , builders could n't turn out homes fast enough for buyers armed with those cheap mortgages .
As a result , prices spiked .
They no longer bore any relation to the actual cost of buying and improving land , or constructing and marketing a new house ( at some reasonable profit margin ) .
Instead , frenzied buyers were setting the price .
Because builders were reaping huge windfall profits , they rushed to buy and develop land .
And sure enough , those new houses were ready just as buyers were retreating to the sidelines because they could no longer afford to buy a home .
That vast overhang of unsold homes is what 's driving down prices today .
The story is much the same with oil , with a twist .
A big swath of the market is n't really paying that $ 125 a barrel number you hear about seemingly every hour .
In China , India and the Middle East , governments are heavily subsidizing oil for their consumers and corporations , leading to rampant over - consumption - and driving up prices even more .
But sooner or later the world wo n't keep paying those prices :
Eventually , the price must fall back to the cost of that last barrel to clear the market .
So what does that barrel cost today ?
According to Stephen Brown , an economist at the Dallas Federal Reserve , that final barrel costs just $ 50 to produce .
And when the price is $ 125 , the incentive to pour out more oil , like homebuilders ' incentive to build more two years ago , is irresistible .
It takes a while to develop new supplies of oil , but the signs of a surge are already in place .
Shale oil costing around $ 70 a barrel is now being produced in the Dakotas .
Tar sands are attracting investment in Canada , also at around $ 70 .
New technology could soon minimize the pollution caused by producing oil from our super - plentiful supplies of coal .
" History suggests that when there 's this much money to be made , new supplies do get developed , " says Brown .
That 's just the supply side of the equation .
Demand should start to decline as well , albeit gradually .
" Historically , the oil market has under - anticipated the amount of conservation brought on by high prices , " says Brown .
Sales of big cars are collapsing ; Americans are cutting down on driving .
The airlines are scaling back flights .
We 've learned another important lesson from the housing market :
The longer prices stay stratospheric , the worse the eventual crash - simply because the higher the prices and bigger the profit margins , the bigger the incentive to over - produce .
It 's even possible that , a few years hence , we could see a sustained period of plentiful oil supplies and low prices , meaning $ 50 or below .
A similar scenario occurred following the price explosion in the 1970s and early 1980s .
The price spike caused the world to cut back sharply on oil consumption .
By the mid-80s , oil prices had fallen from almost $ 40 to around $ 15 .
They remained extremely low for two decades .
It 's impossible to predict how the adjustment this time will take shape , just as it was in housing .
There the surge in supply came in places the experts swore there was " no supply , " and would n't be any .
Builders found a way to extend vast tracts of homes into California 's Inland Empire and Central Valley , and even build " in- fill " projects near the densely - populated coasts .
An earlier bubble is also instructive .
In the early 1980s silver prices jumped from $ 10 to $ 50 on the theory that the world was facing a permanent shortage of silver .
Suddenly ads appeared asking homeowners to bring their tea sets and jewelry to Holiday Inns for a big price .
Silver supplies poured from seemingly nowhere , out of America 's cupboards , of all places .
And so it will be with oil .
We do n't know where the new abundance will come from , from shale , or tar sands or coal or an OPEC desperate to regain market share .
We just know that it will appear .
With prices like these , it always does .
Is Tully right ?

The Art of Deception : Polygraph Lie Detection
By Michael Lawrence Langan , M.D .
I 'd swear to it on my very soul , If I lie , may I fall down cold . "
- Rubin and Cherise
( Hunter / Garcia )
The accuracy of polygraphic lie detection is slightly above chance .
Nevertheless , State and local police departments and law enforcement agencies across the United States are devoted proponents of this unscientific and specious device .
In addition , the American public seems to lend an implicit credence to the " lie detector " as evinced by its ubiquitous use on television crime shows and in " whodunit " literature .
It is given overt attributions of credibility on tabloid type talk shows and news shows .
For example , in the highly publicized case of Tonya Harding a reporter stated , not with removed objectivity but with sardonic grin and mocking emphasis , that the accused had failed two polygraph tests .
The implied assumption is that if the person has failed the polygraph test , then therefore he or she is guilty regardless of other evidence .
Bottom line .
Culpa ex machina .
End of story .
Lie detection by the polygraph is based on the premise that the act of telling a lie causes specific , universal , and reproducible physiological responses as manifested by the autonomic nervous system .
( Saxe , 1991 ) These physiological responses , which are largely outside the influence of voluntary control , are then measured by the polygraph instrument .
The polygraph itself is simplistic in design .
It consists of several devices which are attached to the subject to record blood pressure , pulse , respiration , and galvanic skin response ( which is related to perspiration ) .
The results are then recorded on a moving paper by a " kymograph . "
Hence any change of one of the autonomic nervous system variables will be recorded on the paper as a change from baseline .
The polygraph examiner then interprets the tracing .
A characteristic change from baseline on a relevant question is interpreted as a lie .
In fact , the polygraph test does measure autonomic nervous system activity .
The role of the autonomic nervous system with its sympathetic and parasympathetic branches is well defined within the field of medicine , and was well described by the French physician Claude Bernard over a century ago .
The primary role of the autonomic nervous system is to maintain bodily homeostasis to allow the individual to exist in a changing environment .
Simplistically described , the autonomic nervous system is a part of the peripheral nervous system which consists of a variety of outgoing nerve pathways that regulate important physiological functions generally outside of voluntary and conscious control .
Thus , respiration , body temperature , heart rate , digestion , sweating , and blood pressure are all , partly or entirely , regulated by the autonomic nervous system .
It is divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic branches which have contrasting functions in terms of effect .
The sympathetic branch increases heart rate , respiratory rate , blood pressure , and perspiration .
It is active at all times but varies with the constantly changing environment , and is especially active during rage or fright and prepares the body for the so called " fight or flight " phenomenon .
Many of these reactions are caused by the release of epinephrine .
The parasympathetic nervous system , on the other hand , is primarily involved with conservation and restoration .
It is the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system that the polygraph measures in terms of its activity .
Thus , from a medical perspective it is entirely valid that the polygraph will accurately measure sympathetic nervous system activity with its instrumentation .
The false assumption of the polygraph test is that dishonesty is the sole cause of sympathetic arousal during a polygraph examination .
Deception is a cognitive phenomenon that cannot be measured .
Indeed , throughout the entire history of medicine there has not been a single scientific study that demonstrated evidence that a cognitive phenomenon ( such as love , hatred , truth , altruism , jealousy ) could be measured .
Since , in the complex realm of truth and deception , there is no known physiological response that correlates with lying , then there is no validity to the test .
Although the act of lying can elicit fear and anxiety via the sympathetic nervous system , so can multiple other confounding and complex emotional factors including stress , embarrassment , anger , and fear .
" Deception itself cannot be measured directly . "
( Steinbrook , 1992 ) In addition , each individual differs in autonomic lability .
Some people stay calm with a gun at their head .
While others get autonomically excited , with heart thumping and palms sweating at simply shaking someone 's hand .
In reality , the examination itself is inherently designed to elicit fear and anxiety .
It is an interrogation .
If this fear and anxiety are recorded on a relevant question , then you have failed that question according to the polygraph " experts . "
The polygraph technique begins with a pre-test .
After a sixth - grade level lecture on the nervous system and a proclamation of the test 's infallibility , the examiner will go over all of the questions that have been formulated .
These questions consist of control questions , relevant questions , and irrelevant questions .
The subject will then be attached to the polygraph equipment and the formal testing begins .
The most crucial questions on the polygraph examination , or " Control Question Test , " are the control questions and relevant questions .
The control questions are garnered from the suspect by asking him an innocuous question which could not be truthfully denied .
For example , " Have you ever thought of hurting someone ? " or " Have you ever lied to anyone ? "
The responses to the control questions will elicit some degree of autonomic activity which can then serve as a baseline for which to compare subsequent questions .
The relevant questions pertain to the actual investigation at hand .
The magnitude of responses to relevant questions and control questions as compared with the irrelevant questions is then interpreted , in a non-blinded manner , by the examiner .
The assumption is , that if you are prevaricating , the relevant questions will cause a greater response than the control questions .
So if the question " Have you ever been late for an appointment ? " ( control question ) elicits less of an emotive response on the polygraph equipment than " Did you murder and rape your girlfriend ? " ( relevant question ) you have failed the test .
And , according to the American Polygraph Association ( APA ) you are lying .
Assuming the subject is innocent , it is fairly obvious that he would respond with more emotional autonomic activity to a question regarding a recently deceased loved one than he would an inquiry about punctuality .
Obvious to everyone , that is , but the APA .
The APA is a professional organization for polygraph examiners who have complete faith in the accuracy of the test .
They have their own trade journal Polygraph in which they report scientifically worthless studies and brandish anecdotes of the wonders of their trade .
The majority of these members can pride themselves on completing a 6 week to 6 month post - high school training course in the art of polygraphy .
They have no formal training in medicine , psychology , physiology , or behavior ; the very disciplines on which the testing is based .
The majority of them cater to the legal system wherein their economic livelihood depends .
Since they are primarily paid to identify guilty suspects , motivational factors may play a part in their eagerness to find the guilty suspect .
( Kleinmuntz , 1987 )
The accuracy of any test is determined by that test 's sensitivity ( ability to find a positive ) and specificity ( ability to find a negative ) .
A polygraph examiner will ardently tell you that the exam has somewhere in the neighborhood of a 95 % sensitivity rate .
This means that if 100 guilty suspects are given a polygraph exam , 95 of them will be detected through the test .
Only five of the 100 will be a false negative and not be detected by this miraculous method .
Likewise they will claim a similar specificity rate , and state that if you are telling the truth then you have almost a 100 % chance of being cleared by the test .
John Reid , the inventor of the Control Question Test claimed 99 % accuracy .
( Reid and Inbau , 1977 )
This is clearly not accurate .
The polygraph was not subjected to much critical and scientific investigation until the last two decades .
( Saxe , et al. , 1983 ) Since this time there have been a number of studies of sound scientific design and methodology which clearly refute the high specificity and sensitivity that polygraph advocates claim .
These studies have appeared in reputable peer - reviewed journals and not trade publications .
Horvath , for example , reported a sensitivity of 76 percent and a specificity of 52 percent .
( Horvath , 1977 ) This means that out of 100 liars 76 of them will be detected by the polygraph .
What is astonishing though is the specificity of 52 percent .
This means that out of 100 people who are not lying , 52 will be identified as telling the truth while 48 of the honest individuals will be branded as liars .
The odds are similar to that of a coin toss which would have a specificity of 50 percent .
Barland and Raskin 's study actually demonstrated a specificity of 45 % .
Worse than a coin toss .
( Barland and Raskin , 1976 ) Multiple other studies have shown similar results .
( Brett , et al. , 1986 , Kleinmuntz and Szucko , 1984 , Lykken , 1984 ) .
The polygraph examiner likens his " skill " to that of the radiologist reading a chest X - Ray or a cardiologist interpreting an EKG .
( Barefoot , 1974 )
This analogy is not only ridiculous but , in fact , if a medical test had a similar sensitivity and specificity to that of the polygraph examination it would simply not be used in the field of medicine .
They will cite the fact that the polygraph has been used in the United States for greater than 70 years as if longevity is directly related to validity .
They will state that they have personally administered hundreds or thousands of these tests , and have almost never been wrong , as if total number of tests given constitutes accuracy .
They are so convinced of the accuracy of the polygraph that they regard opponents of polygraphy as communists and do - nothing professors .
( Arther , 1986 ) It does n't occur to them that someone with a Ph.D. and years of research experience , in the very subjects they ignorantly dabble in , may know something more than they do .
It is astounding that the criminal justice system has institutionalized and perpetuated a so called " technology " that lacks scientific evidence and is in fact rejected by the scientific community .
It is as ludicrous as procuring the so called " love meter " machine from the amusement park which measures galvanic skin response and placing it in the courtroom .
But in a backward legal system which has been known to use psychics to help with unsolved murders and has allowed the mentally retarded to serve as jurors , it is not entirely surprising .
The tool is useful to them , however , in that 25 to 50 percent of examinees will , under the tense psychological pressure of the exam , confess to the misdeed at hand .
( Lykken , 1981 , Lykken , 1991 ) Persuaded that they have been proven dishonest by " scientific " means they give up hope .
It is usual for the polygraph examiner to interrogate the subject who has failed the test .
They will state that there is no way now to deny the objective guilt demonstrated by this impartial and unbiased scientific device , and that the only available option is to confess .
The assessment by the polygrapher is genuinely convincing because , sadly , he believes it himself .
Thus the instrument is clearly useful as a confession inducing device .
One wonders , over the past 70 years , how many false confessions have been obtained in this way from innocent persons .
In summary , the polygraph is a ludicrous implementation of pseudo - science at its worst .
The members of the APA are non-scientists practicing science , and the consequences are often dire .
Lykken reports the cases of three men who were convicted of murder largely due to the polygraph examiner 's testimony that in their " expert opinion " they had failed the test .
All three were subsequently found to be innocent .
( Lykken , 1991 ) Polygraph examiners ignore such cases or rationalize that they are due to the rare incompetence of some examiners .
The continued use of polygraphic lie detection has the potential to cause much harm to those who are judged dishonest by its results .
The specificity and sensitivity are not dissimilar to that of a coin toss .
Innocent suspects have about a 50/50 chance .
One failure is all it takes to ruin your life .
Since the 1923 Federal Court decision of Frye vs United States ( 293 F 1013 [ DC Cir 1923 ] ) , polygraph evidence has not been admissible in federal court cases because there was deemed a lack of scientific validity to the test .
This travesty however is still used widely by the state court system .
Furedy characterizes the continued use of polygraphy as a serious " social disease . "
( Furedy , 1987 ) State laws regarding abuse of the polygraph must change , and it is time for the medical and scientific communities to educate lawmakers and policy makers about the true validity of this perversion of science .
It must be forever banished to the same realm of parapsychology as the Ouija Board , phrenology , and palmistry .
The relatively conservative American Medical Association 's Council on Scientific Affairs recommended that the polygraph not be used in pre-employment screening and security clearance .
( Council on Scientific Affairs , 1986 )
It is time to extend this recommendation across the board , and put the greater than 3000 anachronistic polygraph examiners in the United States out of business .
Meanwhile , if you are asked to take a polygraph test -- do n't do it .
Those involved in the criminal justice system , including lawyers , are largely uneducated in the realm of scientific scrutiny and experimental methodology .
They may not separate science and pseudo - science , and erroneously believe that the polygraph is an accurate scientific instrument .
Their interactions are with polygraph examiners who proselytize its use , and they have little or no interaction with scientists , psychologists , and physicians who refute its use .
Refuse to take the test and educate them .
Cite the Frye doctrine , go to the medical library , copy the scientific articles which belie its validity , and present them to whomever requested you to take the test .
State that the principles and assumptions underlying polygraphy are not supported by our understanding of psychology , neurology , and physiology .
Then put the burden of proof on their heads .
Tell them to present you with scientific evidence that corroborates the validity of the test .
There is simply no rational basis for a machine to detect liars .

The Huffington Post just appointed former RIAA CEO Hilary Rosen as its new political director .
Rosen presided over the RIAA 's total and utter failure to come to grips with the Internet , the period in which the record industry rejected every single overture of money in exchange for licenses to its catalog from venture - backed P2P companies , choosing litigation over cash , and leading to a world in which the majority of music consumption online is illegal and does n't give a dime to the record industry .
Nevertheless , Rosen is also an old - time political hack , epitomising the wing of the Democratic party that has progressive politics on every issue except the Internet : they 're all for freedom , except for when it comes to that magic wire that delivers freedom of the press , freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in one package .
As far as that wire goes , one Police Academy or Brittney Spears download is grounds for termination of access to the net ( and confiscation of every cent you can lay claim to ) .
But Rosen , 50 , has had a long career in politics that spans beyond her 17 years at the RIAA , and it's her network of contacts and know - how that Huffington wants to tap into as The Huffington Post grows .
" Hilary really knows Washington and its political players intimately , and everyone on [ The Huffington Post 's ] team in Washington loves her , " said Arianna Huffington in an interview .

Chinese children are often named after virtues or events .
More than 4,000 children in China have been given the name Aoyun , meaning Olympic Games , in the past 15 years .
The rise in popularity of the name is seen as a sign of support for the Games being staged in August in Beijing .
Officials in charge of identity cards say that more than 92 % of the 4,104 registered Aoyuns are boys .
It is not uncommon for Chinese children to be given names of common events and popular slogans - such as Defend China , Build the Nation and Space Travel .
There are 290,798 registered Civilisations .
The first surge in Aoyuns came in 1992 , when China applied to host to the 2000 Games .
About 680 Aoyuns were registered at the time .
In 2002 another 553 Aoyuns were named , after China was chosen to host the 2008 Games .
The BBC's Chinese service says that in recent weeks babies have also been given names such as Hope for Sichuan , to show solidarity with earthquake victims .

The image shows the changes in light output over time of the first - discovered pulsating carbon white dwarf star .
Credit : K. Williams / T. Jones / McDonald Obs
University of Texas at Austin astronomers Michael H. Montgomery and Kurtis A. Williams , along with graduate student Steven DeGennaro , have predicted and confirmed the existence of a new type of variable star , with the help of the 2.1 - meter Otto Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory .
The discovery is announced in today 's issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Called a " pulsating carbon white dwarf , " this is the first new class of variable white dwarf star discovered in more than 25 years .
Because the overwhelming majority of stars in the universe -- including the sun-- will end their lives as white dwarfs , studying the pulsations ( i.e. , variations in light output ) of these newly discovered examples gives astronomers a window on an important end point in the lives of most stars .
A white dwarf star is the leftover remnant of a sun- like star that has burned all of the nuclear fuel in its core .
It is extremely dense , packing half to 1.5 times the sun 's mass into a volume about the size of Earth .
Until recently , there were thought to be two main types of white dwarfs : those with an outer layer of hydrogen ( about 80 percent of white dwarfs ) , and those with an outer layer of helium , whose hydrogen shells have somehow been stripped away ( the other 20 percent ) .
Last year , University of Arizona astronomers Patrick Dufour and James Liebert discovered a third type of white dwarf star .
For reasons that are not understood , these " hot carbon white dwarfs " have had both their hydrogen and helium shells stripped off , leaving their carbon layer exposed .
Astronomers suspect that these could be among the most massive white dwarfs of all , the remnants of stars slightly too small to end their lives in a supernova explosion .
After these new carbon white dwarfs were announced , Montgomery calculated that pulsations in these stars were possible .
Pulsating stars are of interest to astronomers because the changes in their light output can reveal what goes on in their interiors -- similar to the way geologists study seismic waves from earthquakes to understand what goes on in Earth 's interior .
In fact , this type of star - study is called " asteroseismology . "
So , Montgomery and Williams ' team began a systematic study of carbon white dwarfs with the Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory , looking for pulsators .
DeGennaro discovered that a star about 800 light - years away in the constellation Ursa Major , called SDSS J142625.71+575218.3 , fits the bill .
Its light intensity varies regularly by nearly two percent about every eight minutes .
" The discovery that one of these stars is pulsating is remarkably important , " said NSF astronomer Michael Briley .
" This will allow us to probe the white dwarf 's interior , which in turn should help us solve the riddle of where the carbon white dwarfs come from and what happens to their hydrogen and helium . "
The star lies about ten degrees east northeast of Mizar , the middle star in the handle of the Big Dipper .
This white dwarf has about the same mass as our Sun , but its diameter is smaller than Earth's .
The star has a temperature of 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit ( 19,500 C ) , and is only 1/600th as bright as the Sun .
None of the other stars in their sample were found to pulsate .
Given the masses and temperatures of the stars in their sample , SDSS J142625.71+575218.3 is the only one expected to pulsate , based on Montgomery 's calculations .
The astronomers speculate that the pulsations are caused by changes in the star 's carbon outer envelope as the star cools down from its formation as a hot white dwarf .
The ionized carbon atoms in the star 's outer layers return to a neutral state , triggering the pulsations .
There is a chance that the star 's variations might have another cause .
Further study is needed , the astronomers say .
Either way , studying these stars will shed light on the unknown process that strips away their surface layers of hydrogen and helium to lay bare their carbon interiors .

Since January , the Clintons have pummeled Barack Obama with racially tinged comments and questions about his character .
Hillary Clinton has questioned why he did n’t walk out on the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. ; why he “ denounced ” but did n’t “ reject ” Louis Farrakhan ; and whether he is too chummy with the former radical Bill Ayers .
She chastised his characterization of white working - class voters as being highfalutin and chided him for not agreeing to a street - fight - style debate .
Bill Clinton has called Obama ’s stance on the war a fairy tale , dismissed an early primary win as mere Jesse Jackson redux and recently claimed that Obama was playing the race card against him .
Some of this is valid , the result of Obama ’s own missteps , but some of it is baffling .
The rhetoric appears to be trafficking in old fears and historic stereotypes .
The unspoken ( and confusing ) characterization of Obama is that he ’s militant yet cowardly ; uppity yet too cool for school .
Mr Mugabe 's honorary knighthood was conferred on him during a state visit Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe 's honorary Knighthood has been annulled by the Queen .
Mr Mugabe , condemned over violence ahead of a presidential run-off election , was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1994 .
That was withdrawn earlier , as Gordon Brown announced " intensified sanctions " and a cricket tour was called off .
And former South African leader Nelson Mandela spoke in London of a " tragic failure of leadership " in Zimbabwe .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has faced calls in the Commons for Mr Mugabe 's honorary Knighthood to be withdrawn - most recently from Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg .
Human rights
But the government has been wary of playing into President Mugabe 's claims that Africa is under siege from Britain - the former colonial power .
However amid international condemnation of the planned presidential run-off vote on Friday , despite the withdrawal of the opposition because of violence and intimidation , the honour was withdrawn amid several new punitive measures .
It is important that we use even symbolic measures to underline our disgust at what Mugabe and his henchmen are now doing in Zimbabwe
Nick Clegg
Liberal Democrats A Foreign
Office spokesman said they would continue to focus on improving life for ordinary Zimbabweans but added : " We can no longer justify an individual who is responsible for a consistent campaign of human rights violations and the disregard for the democratic process retaining an honour . "
He added : " His actions have proved beyond all argument that he is not worthy to retain this honour . "
' Wholly inappropriate ' Mr Mugabe was appointed as an honorary Knight Grand Cross in the Order of Bath during his state visit to the UK in 1994 .
The Foreign Office said conditions in Zimbabwe were then " very different " .
Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg told the BBC : " It is symbolic but it is important that we use even symbolic measures to underline our disgust at what Mugabe and his henchmen are now doing in Zimbabwe .
He agreed that Mr Mugabe would " laugh it off " but said : " That is no reason not to do it .
I think it is wholly inappropriate for a knighthood to be retained by someone who is behaving with such unforgivable brutality . "
Please turn on JavaScript .

For the Conservatives , William Hague said his party had also called for the knighthood to be withdrawn , adding : " A knighthood is one of the highest honours an individual in the United Kingdom can achieve .
" The brutality he has shown to his own people and the disaster he brought upon his own country made Robert Mugabe utterly unworthy of this honour . "
Later former South African president Nelson Mandela , who has previously been silent about Mr Mugabe 's regime , briefly addressed the issue in a speech at a dinner in London to mark his 90th birthday .
Cricket tour cancelled
He said : " We watch with sadness the continuing tragedy in Darfur .
Nearer to home we have seen the outbreak of violence against fellow Africans in our own country and the tragic failure of leadership in our neighbouring Zimbabwe . "
Meanwhile the England and Wales Cricket Board has announced it has cancelled Zimbabwe 's 2009 tour , saying it shared government concerns about the " deteriorating situation and lack of human rights in Zimbabwe " .
And Mr Brown announced the government was preparing " intensified sanctions " , including travel and financial restrictions , against " the criminal cabal " trying to keep Mr Mugabe in power .
Conservative leader David Cameron urged a full visa ban for Mr Mugabe and his officials , during exchanges with Mr Brown at prime minister 's questions .
Mr Cameron said there was " universal anger " over the " stolen election " results and urged businesses and individuals who had any dealings with the president 's regime to examine their conscience .
Mr Brown agreed that businesses should " look at their involvement " in the troubled nation .
" I believe the whole world has woken up to the evils that are going on in Zimbabwe , " he said .
" What we want to see is an end to the violence and a peaceful transition in Zimbabwe - that 's why the efforts of the African Union are so important . "

Ms Woodcock said the FDA believed the contamination was deliberate
America 's drugs watchdog believes that Chinese - made ingredients for a blood - thinning drug may have been deliberately contaminated .
The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) said earlier that a chemical contaminant had been found in some batches of the drug heparin .
It has linked the contaminant to hundreds of severe allergic reactions and dozens of deaths across the US .
An FDA director said when and how the toxin had been introduced was unclear .
" FDA 's working hypothesis is that this was intentional contamination , but this is not yet proven , " Director of the FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Janet Woodcock told a congressional hearing .
Heparin is used in kidney dialysis and in some types of surgery to prevent blood clots .
' Deliberate scheme '
The contaminated stocks were made by Baxter International , using China - based suppliers .
According to the FDA , a chemical called oversulphated chondroitin sulphate has been found in supplies in 13 countries .
Baxter International Chief Executive Robert Parkinson said the company was " alarmed that one of our products was used in what appears to have been a deliberate scheme to adulterate a life - saving medication " .
The company has recalled the heparin and imports from the Chinese supplier have been blocked .
Chinese officials have acknowledged the presence of the contaminant .
But they say it is not to blame for the allergic reactions or deaths , citing a lack of incidents in more than 10 other countries which have received the same contaminated stocks .
The above - quoted e-mail forward reproduces passages taken from Barack Obama ’s two books — Dreams from My Father ( 1995 ) and The Audacity of Hope — ( 2006 ) with the presumed intent of presenting Obama as a self - declared racist .
However , these cherry - picked statements are all presented devoid of context , and some of them are either significantly reworded from the originals or outright fabrications .
Below we have identified and reproduced the relevant passages in which these statements appear , with their fuller context :
“ I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction . ”
This statement is a rewording of a passage from page 261 of The Audacity of Hope , in which Barack Obama wrote of the importance of not allowing inflamed public opinion to result in innocent members of immigrant groups being stripped of their rights , denied their due as American citizens , or placed into confinement , as was done with Japanese - American U.S. citizens during World War II .
The original contains no specific mention of “ Muslims ” — Obama was referring to the importance of standing up for and protecting the rights of all immigrants who have become U.S. citizens , and someone altered the wording of the passage to give it a different meaning :
In the wake of 9/11 , my meetings with Arab and Pakistani Americans , for example , have a more urgent quality , for the stories of detentions and FBI questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging .
They have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly ; they need specific reassurances that their citizenship really means something , that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II , and that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction .
“ I ceased to advertise my mother ’s race at the age of 12 or 13 , when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites . ”
This statement comes from the introduction to Dreams from My Father ( p. xv ) , as part of a passage in which Barack Obama spoke of the difficulties of growing up as the child of mixed - race parents .
The statement is actually a portion of a parenthetical remark Obama used to explain that people who did not know him well were often surprised to find that he was the child of mixed - raced parents ( because he looked black , and he no longer made a point of gratuitously mentioning that his mother was white ) :
[ W ] hat strikes me most when I think about the story of my family is a running strain of innocence , an innocence that seems unimaginable , even by the measures of childhood .
My wife ’s cousin , only six years old , has already lost such innocence .
A few weeks ago he reported to his parents that some of his first grade classmates had refused to play with him because of his dark , unblemished skin .
Obviously his parents , born and raised in Chicago and Gary , lost their own innocence long ago , and although they are n’t bitter — the two of them being as strong and proud and resourceful as any parents I know — one hears the pain in their voices as they begin to have second thoughts about having moved out of the city into a mostly white suburb , a move they made to protect their son from the possibility of being caught in a gang shooting and the certainty of attending an underfunded school .
They know too much , we have all seen too much , to take my parents ’ brief union — a black man and a white woman , an African and an American — at face value .
When people who do n’t know me well , black or white , discover my background ( and it is usually a discovery , for I ceased to advertise my mother ’s race at the age of twelve or thirteen , when I began to suspect I was ingratiating myself to whites ) , I see the split - second adjustments they have to make , the searching of my eyes for some telltale sign .
They no longer know who I am .
“ I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother ’s race . ”
No such sentence ( nor anything close to it ) appears anywhere in either Dreams from My Father or The Audacity of Hope .
This statement was taken from a March 2007 article about Barack Obama , and they are not Obama ’s own words but rather those of the article ’s author ( recast in the first person ) :
In reality , Obama provides a disturbing test of the best - case scenario of whether America can indeed move beyond race .
He inherited his father ’s penetrating intelligence ; was raised mostly by his loving liberal white grandparents in multiracial , laid - back Hawaii , where America ’s normal race rules never applied ; and received a superb private school education .
And yet , at least through age 33 when he wrote Dreams from My Father , he found solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against his mother ’s race .
“ There was something about him that made me wary , a little too sure of himself , maybe .
And white . ”
This statement comes from page 142 of Dreams from My Father , as part of a passage in which Barack Obama described being interviewed by a man named Marty Kaufman ( a pseudonym for Jerry Kellman ) for a position as a community organizer in Chicago .
Kaufman was specifically looking for a black man to work with him , because he himself was white and needed someone to help him appeal to both sides in a racially polarized city .
The statement reproduced above creates a false impression by eliding the ending to the final sentence , in which Obama makes reference ( in his expression of misgivings ) to Kaufman ’s whiteness being a problem , because Kaufman himself had said it was a problem :
I had all but given up on organizing when I received a call from Marty Kaufman .
He explained that he ’d started an organizing drive in Chicago and was looking to hire a trainee .
He ’d be in New York the following week and suggested that we meet at a coffee shop on Lexington .
His appearance did n’t inspire much confidence .
He was a white man of medium height wearing a rumpled suit over a pudgy frame .
His face was heavy with two - day - old whiskers ; behind a pair of thick , wire - rimmed glasses , his eyes seemed set in a perpetual squint .
As he rose from the booth to shake my hand , he spilled some tea on his shirt …
He ordered more hot water and told me about himself .
He was Jewish , in his late thirties , had been reared in New York .
He had started organizing in the sixties with the student protests , and ended up staying with it for fifteen years .
Farmers in Nebraska .
Blacks in Philadelphia .
Mexicans in Chicago .
Now he was trying to pull urban blacks and suburban whites together around a plan to save manufacturing jobs in metropolitan Chicago .
He needed somebody to work with him , he said .
Somebody black .
He offered to start me off at ten thousand dollars the first year , with a two - thousand - dollar travel allowance to buy a car ; the salary would go up if things worked out .
After he was gone , I took the long way home , along the East River promenade , and tried to figure out what to make of the man .
He was smart , I decided .
He seemed committed to his work .
Still , there was something about him that made me wary .
A little too sure of himself , maybe .
And white — he ’d said himself that that was a problem .
“ It remained necessary to prove which side you were on , to show your loyalty to the black masses , to strike out and name names . ”
This sentence appears on page 101 of Dreams from My Father , as part of a long passage in which Barack Obama talked about his time at Occidental College in Los Angeles .
It was another expression of a theme touched on in many other sections of the book — the difficulties of being expected to associate oneself with a particular racial heritage , especially for those who came from multiracial backgrounds — prompted by the example of a girl named Joyce , one of Obama ’s classmates :
She was a good - looking woman , Joyce was with her green eyes and honey skin and pouty lips .
We lived in the same dorm my freshman year , and all the brothers were after her .
One day I asked her if she was going to the Black Students ’ Association meeting .
She looked at me funny , then started shaking her head like a baby who does n’t want what it sees on the spoon .
“ I ’m not black , ” Joyce said .
“ I ’m multiracial . ”
Then she started telling me about her father , who happened to be Italian and was the sweetest man in the world ; and her mother , who happened to be part African and part French and part Native American and part something else .
“ Why should I have to choose between them ? ” she asked me .
Her voice cracked , and I thought she was going to cry .
“ It ’s not white people who are making me choose .
Maybe it used to be that way , but now they ’re willing to treat me like a person .
No — it ’s black people who always have to make everything racial .
They ’re the ones making me choose .
They ’re the ones who are telling me that I ca n’t be who I am … ” They , they , they .
That was the problem with people like Joyce .
They talked about the richness of their multicultural heritage and it sounded real good , until you noticed that they avoided black people …
To avoid being mistaken for a sellout , I chose my friends carefully .
The more politically active black students .
The foreign students .
The Chicanos .
The Marxist professors and structural feminists and punk - rock performance poets .
We smoked cigarettes and wore leather jackets .
At night , in the dorms , we discussed neocolonialism , Franz Fanon , Eurocentrism , and patriarchy .
When we ground out our cigarettes in the hallway carpet or set our stereos so loud that the walls began to shake , we were resisting bourgeois society ’s stifling conventions .
We were n’t indifferent or careless or insecure .
We were alienated .
But this strategy alone could n’t provide the distance I wanted , from Joyce or my past .
After all , there were thousands of so - called campus radicals , most of them white and tenured and happily tolerant .
No , it remained necessary to prove which side you were on , to show your loyalty to the black masses , to strike out and name names .
“ I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates did n’t speak to my own .
It was into my father ’s image , the black man , son of Africa , that I ’d packed all the attributes I sought in myself , the attributes of Martin and Malcolm , DuBois and Mandela . ”
This statement is a rewording ( further changing an intended meaning already obscured by a lack of context ) of material from page 220 of Dreams from My Father .
The material appeared as part of a passage in which Barack Obama described his profound disappointment in learning ( from information provided by his half - sister , Auma ) that the lofty image he had held all his life of his role model , his biological father ( a man he barely knew ) , was a flawed and idealized one .
Dutch artist Henk Hofstra ( who ’s Blue Road we featured in April of last year ) is back with a new environmental art project called ‘ Art Eggcident ’ in Leeuwarden , a city in the north of the Netherlands .
Yesterday , several large eggs ( each 100 feet wide ) were spread on th Zaailand , one of the largest city squares in the Netherlands .
‘ The eggs ’ will remain in Leeuwarden for the next six months .
McCain claims he voted against an MLK holiday because of ignorance about " the issue " , as if he needed position papers and highly paid lobbyists to explain to him what Dr. Martin Luther King meant to our nation .
Still , even his claimed ignorance on the topic strains credibility .
Perhaps because it just is n't true .
Check out what he said about his POW captors in a 1987 interview with USA Today :
" They never gave us any meaningful news , " McCain said .
" They told us the day that Martin Luther King was shot , they told us the day that Bobby Kennedy was shot , but they never bothered to tell us about the moon shot .
So it was certainly selected news . "
McCain claims ignorance about MLK because his state did n't have black people , but he knew .
His captors told him about it .
The issue is n't one of " I did n't know about the issue " , but one of " MLK ai n't shit " .
What else could it be ?
It 's clear as day , especially considering that as late as 1987 , McCain did n't consider the assassination of Martin Luther King " meaningful " .
A sentiment , I 'm sure , shared with his good friends Trent Lott and George Allen .
News Flash : Celebrity Rehab is Getting Fuzzy
Aerosmith rockerwants the world to know that when he checked into a rehab facility recently it was n't for all of the obvious reasons .
He has a bad foot and the pain has been traumatic .
He is not the first to set the record straight about rehab .
We heard earlier this week that 's stint in rehab was not about substance abuse but was depression related .
Tyler said :
The doctors told me the pain in my feet could be corrected but it would require a few surgeries over time .
The ' foot repair ' pain was intense , greater than I 'd anticipated .
The months of rehabilitative care and the painful strain of physical therapy were traumatic .
I really needed a safe environment to recuperate where I could shut off my phone and get back on my feet .
Make no mistake , Aerosmith has no plans to stop rocking .
There 's a new album to record , then another tour . "
The statement follows reports that the 60 - year - old singer was being treated instead for substance abuse .
Some may question when rehab facilities began broadening their scope and others might even wonder if these celebrities are in denial about substance abuse issues .
Check out Kirsten Dunst 's rehab statement here .
The program “ is so much of a failure that it ’s really unbelievable , ” said Daniel M. Shlufman , president of the FCMC Mortgage Corporation in Clifton , N.J. Mr. Shlufman likened Congress ’s effort to “ coming up with a vaccine to a terrible disease , and then not giving it to people , or making it too expensive . ”
Under the new rules , a sizable number of jumbo loan would be treated by the mortgage industry in the same way as smaller conventional loans .
This change  raising the ceiling for loans backed by government - sponsored housing finance agencies to nearly $ 730,000 in the nation ’s costliest locations  was intended to bring rates down for more borrowers and stimulate the lending that is needed to get the economy moving again .
The goal of making most of these jumbo loans accessible was aimed not at helping subprime borrowers , those people with spotty credit histories .
Rather , it was meant for borrowers with good credit and ample down payments , but who wanted to buy a house or refinance a home loan in the costliest housing markets , like New York , San Francisco , Anchorage , Baltimore , Edwards , Colo. , and Jackson , Wyo .
In such markets , a two - bedroom home can easily cost more than $ 1 million .
But the real concern over this program ’s failure goes beyond people seeking million - dollar homes .
The danger , economists say , is in how a wave of foreclosures and rising inventory of homes for sale will deepen and prolong the economic downturn started by the subprime mortgage crisis .
In 2007 , around 14 percent of new loans were jumbos , compared with 8 percent for subprime and 48 percent for traditional conforming loans , according to Inside Mortgage Finance , a newsletter that tracks mortgage activity .
OTTAWA–It 's not the long - sought cure for the common cold but a 17 - year - old Ottawa high school student won a national science competition today by developing a novel way of identifying and perhaps even fighting flu infections .
Maria Merziotis , a Grade 12 student at Hillcrest High School , won a $ 5,000 first prize and a chance to take her discovery to an international competition in San Diego next month .
A team of three Toronto Grade 10 students , Jonathan Schneider , Josh Alman and Norman Yau from the University of Toronto School , won the $ 4,000 second prize for identifying genes that help a plant thrive in salty soil .
They will also go to San Diego .
Vandana Rawal , a 15 - year - old from Montreal 's Centennial Regional High School , won third place and $ 3,000 for discovering a human gene variation that may help in dealing with bipolar disorder .
Health Canada is already looking at Merziotis 's work , which offers a new way of identifying , and perhaps even fighting different influenza strains .
The flu virus attacks human cells by binding to a compound called sialic acid , or sialyllactose , on the cell surface .
Merziotis synthesized a floating form of the acid , which dupes the virus with an alternative attachment site .
She said her process can help with both diagnosis and treatment .
" It can be used to detect what strain of influenza is responsible for a specific infection , " she said .
" It can differentiate between human and avian strains .
" It may also be possible to interfere with the infection process by administering the floating sialyllactose through injection , nasal spray or lungs with a pump .
The flu virus would attach to the artificial receptor rather than the human cell . "
The teens were competing in the Sanofi - Aventis BioTalent Challenge , a competition jointly sponsored two leading drug companies , the National Research Council and several other government agencies .
" The students in this competition represent some of the brightest young scientists in Canada , " said Roman Szumski , vice - president of life sciences at the NRC .
The Toronto team 's work with the plant gene offers insights into developing crops resistant to salty soils .
Rawal 's work found a human gene variation which may explain why lithium is effective for some but not all bipolar patients .
The competition , now in its 15th year , involved 14 regional winners , both individuals and teams , from across the country .
Their projects ranged from an investigation of the role that mercury - polluted snow may play in northern community cancer rates , to methods of improving the survival of frozen stem cells and a study of herbal medicines .

The justice ministry said the ruling was about dishonesty , not religion
France 's ruling UMP party has opposed a French court 's decision to annul a marriage between two Muslims because the wife lied about being a virgin .
The Lille court 's decision has also angered feminists who say it amounts to a fatwa against women 's liberty .
The court granted the man 's request for an annulment after ruling that he had been tricked into a marriage .
His partner 's virginity was a determining factor in his decision to wed her , it ruled .
Feminists angered
It is understood that the husband , an engineer in his thirties , married the trainee nurse in the summer of 2006 , having been assured by her that she had never previously had a boyfriend .
The Conservative UMP party - which is calling on the Justice Minister to overturn the ruling - said the decision was totally unacceptable and was incompatible with France 's secular principles .
But a justice ministry spokesman insisted the court 's decision was not based on religion or morality but on the French civil code under which a marriage can be annulled if a spouse has lied about an " essential quality " of the relationship .
Feminist groups said they were ashamed to see the ruling adding it would allow men legally to reject women on the grounds they were not virgins .
As if there were n't enough creepy crawly robots out there already , a team of researchers from Stanford University have now let loose this little number , which they hope will one day be showing off its rock - climbing skills on Mars .
Dubbed Capuchin , the bot is a follow - up to the Lemur robot built by the same team , and promises to climb walls some 40 times faster than that earlier model .
To do that , the researchers apparently did n't make any major mechanical changes , but rather employed a more advanced computer program that guides the bot 's every move .
More specifically , as NewScientist reports , the software uses a sophisticated load - balancing system , which distributes the bot 's weight equally to its arms and legs and improves its stability when climbing .
As you can see for yourself in the video after the break , that appears to work remarkably well , although we still would n't trust it to be a partner on your next rock - climbing expedition .

Summary
Confidential memo from Maj. Gen. Kelly , commander of US forces in western Iraq ( MNF - W , or Multi- National Force — West ) , written in late February 2008 .
Privately verified by Wikileaks staff and not denied or contradicted by MNF - W when questioned by UPI 's national security editor , Shaun Waterman .
Typed up version follows :
MNF -W COMMANDER'S COMMENTS
I spent the entire day inspecting the Fallujah city jail .
I found the conditions there to be exactly ( unbelivable over crowding , total lack of anything approaching even minimal levels of hygiene for human beings , no food , little water , no ventilation ) to those described in the recent ( 18 February ) FOX news artickle by Michael Totten entitled the " Dungeon of Fallujah " .
When queried the iraqis and marines present throughout my inspection as to why these conditions existed , three conditions were universaly cited as problems in Fallujah as well as the rest of Anbar .
First , there is zero support from the government for any of the jails in Anbar .
No funds , food or medical support has been provided from any ministry .
Second , the police that run Anbar 's jails are the same personnel responsable for investigating crimes .
These jailer / investigators are undermanned and more often than not spend most of their time out begging and scavenging for food than investigating crimes .
( It is unlikely the prisoners will eat today ) .
Third , Anbar lacks trained Iraqi correctional officers ( ICOS ) to run the jails in Anbar .
The development and employment of trained ICOS would enable the IP to focus on criminal investigation rather then jail supervision .
I believe the Iraqi police are doing the best they can , and they literally begged me on humanitarian , moral and religious grounds to help them help the prisoners by somehow moving the government to action .
We need to go to general quarters on this issue right now .
There are four areas that MNF - W needs immediate support with to correst these deficiencies .
First , GOI must provide funfing support to provide care for Iraqi prisoners in Iraqi custody in Anbar .
To state that the current system is broken would erroneously imply that there is a system in place to be broken .
Most jails in Anbar have a mixed prisoner population of pre-trial prisoners and post - trial convicted prisoners .
The ministry of Justice the latter .
Since the Anbar jail population is mixed of interior and the ministry of Justice ( MOJ ) .
Second , Anbar needs ICO trainers to establish an ICO course in Anbar to develop and employ that capability province wide .
Third , Anbar lacks a director general of MOJ for the province .
Anbar needs one appointed and working in Anbar as soon as possible .
Fourth , Iraqi security force funds ( ISFF ) must be made available to upgrade a majority of the correctional facilities within Anbar to comply with basic international standarts of care for prisoners .
One of the main goals of MNF - W is to successfully transition the IP from a security force to a professional law enforcement force .
The Iraqi police will ultimately be the ones whose shoulders the burden of winning or losing the fight will be carried .
To date , little attention has been paid to the Iraqi corrections system in Anbar and its current discrepancies will prevent the IP from becoming a professional law enforcement force unless immediate and significant support is provided .
As I understand it the coalition has absolutely no authority to direct what goes on in these " facilities " , and when we have intervened recently in other jails with the same conditions we have been criticized for not making the Iraqis solve their own problems .
The conditions in these jails are so bad that I think we need to either take a TF - 134 approach and that is to do the right thing in terms of caring for the prisoners even with our own dollars , or release them .

Just last Thursday Bloomberg ran a story that pointed out that the Saudi royal family is rooting for John McCain to win in Novermber .
The article quotes Carnegie Middle East Center scholar Mai Yamani as saying the following :
He [ John McCain ] would keep the troops in Iraq , and that is their [ the Saudi government ] main worry , that the U.S. may withdraw or minimize its presence .
The article also points out the fact that McCain has had a 25 - year relationship with Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan who is the former Saudi ambassador to the U.S. Bloomberg quoted McCain as saying he knew Prince Bandar " very well . "
After reading this article it became apparent that McCain 's ties to Prince Bandar bin Sultan and his endorsement by the Saudis should be used against him by democrats and the Obama campaign .
Democrats should point out that McCain has been endorsed by a government that has connections with Hamas .
For instance , in September 2003 , one of Hamas ' senior leaders Khalid Meshaal personally met with the Crown Prince Abdullah at a Hamas fundraiser .
The New York Times quoted Meshaal thanking the Saudis for " continuing to send aid to the people [ Palestinians ] through the civilian and popular channels , despite all the American pressures exerted on them . "
In 2006 , Khalid Meshaal again met with the Saudi royal family again after Hamas had won over the Palestinian parliament .
The result of the meeting was a continued commitment to fund the Palestinian Authority even though it would now be controlled , in part , by Hamas .
If the tables were turned we would all be inundated with talking heads telling us that McCain had been endorsed by a state sponsor of terror and that he had a 25 - year relationship with that terrorist government .
Then , we would be asked questions like , is McCain anti-American ?
Is McCain a manchurian candidate ?
So , what are the democrats waiting for ?
They need to hit McCain on this and they need to hit him on this now .
The democrats need to start asking the American people whether or not they can trust a man who has had a 25 year relationship with a state sponsor of terrorism .
At the same time , the democrats need to point out that the bin Ladens and Hamas have extensive ties to the royal family .
Lastly , the Saudi connection would be a good argument to use against Bush and McCain as they have both engaged the Saudi royal family in direct talks without any preconditions even though they seem to have connections to the worst enemy of Israel 's on the planet .
The safeguarding agency will provide a single point for checking staff
More than one in four adults in England will have to register with child protection authorities next year , under an expanded safeguarding scheme .
Anyone working or volunteering with young people will have to register .
The government says 11.3 million people will be on a database , with registration costing £ 64 per person .
But employers giving work experience to secondary school students will not be compelled to register their staff , says the government 's consultation response .
The Independent Safeguarding Authority ( ISA ) , which will launch in October 2009 , will provide a single agency for vetting the suitability of staff who might work with or help young people .
Paper rounds
Setting up the system will cost £ 84 m says the government - with annual running costs expected to be £ 47 m , as details of people on the register , such as changes of job or vetting status , will have to be kept up to date .
The adult population of England is about 40 million , including about 9.5 million retired people .
It is proposed that more than a quarter will have to be included on this protection list .
There will be more adults on this vetting list than the total number of under - 18 year olds in the country .
It is expected that this will become the most extensive database of its kind anywhere in the world , including staff in education , training , health , sport , leisure and any businesses or venues where staff regularly come into contact with those under 18 .
But the government 's response to the consultation for the ISA will allow some exemptions .
Employers will not have to register all staff who work with under - 16s in the workplace - such as newsagents who employ youngsters for paper rounds .
There will also be no compulsion to register staff who come into contact with work experience students - such as those taking the forthcoming Diploma .
" Work experience organisers will want - as they do now - to agree appropriate safeguarding measures with the employer which may include ISA checks , " says the government 's response .
However voluntary staff , such as people supporting charities or school governors or helpers , will have to register if they come into contact with children .
But for such adult volunteers the fee will be waived .
Soham murders
This database , administered with support from private sector companies , will hold information on these registered individuals , which can be used by employers wanting to know if applicants are suitable for jobs working with young people .
This will have to be updated , with employers promised information if the status of an employees changes - such as being barred following a conviction .
The safeguarding authority , set up in response to the Soham murders in 2002 , will use criminal record checks and lists of adults barred from working with children to assess suitability .
There are currently about 8,000 offenders banned from working with children .
From October 2009 , anyone applying for jobs working with or helping young people , will have to apply for registration - and employers or charities working with children and vulnerable adults cannot recruit workers who are not registered .
It will become an offence for anyone barred from working with children to apply for such a job - and there will be penalties for employers who fail to check on the registration of applicants .
From 2010 , those already employed in jobs or in a voluntary capacity , with or without CRB checks , will be obliged to register .
The government 's response to consultation only applies to England , but the scheme will be extended to Wales and Northern Ireland .

Transcending Language Bias in Scriptable Applications
Posted 24 Sep 2002 at 20:36 UTC by beppu
Most people agree that scriptability in an application is a good thing .
However , there is a problem that rears its head over and over again .
The problem is that people tend to show a strong loyalty to their scripting language of choice .
For example , if someone likes Perl , chances are their scriptable application will support just Perl , and all the Ruby , Python , Tcl , Scheme , etc. fans are left out in the cold .
What many people do n't realize is that it does n't have to be this way .
This article will compare and contrast the approaches to scriptability taken by Emacs , Vim , and the GIMP , discussing their individual strengths and weaknesses .
Each one of these programs supports multiple scripting languages to varying degrees , but the implementation strategies are worlds apart .
The GIMP , in particular , has an elegant approach that allows for C , Scheme , Perl , and Python code to interoperate in an unprecedented way .
So powerful is the GIMP 's approach that it might be a good idea to generalize it , and make it available to the programming community at large .
This article was originally published in the 8/2002 issue of Linux Magazine .
Comparing Different Strategies for Adding Scripting to an Application
Throughout the lifetime of this Power Tools column , scripting has been a recurring theme .
It was definitely not planned to be this way , but the fact that every single article to date has had something to do with scripting is not a detail that should be overlooked .
Could it be that the ability to script an application is what sets it above the rest ?
Many programs are merely used , but when a program is scriptable , you can start teaching it to perform complex actions that it could n't do before .
Being scriptable also means that the work of extending a program can be distributed and delegated .
In a culture of openness such as the one most Unix users participate in , this results in a very creative and communal building process that blurs the line between user and programmer .
For these reasons and many more , adding scripting to an application is a very powerful act .
However , the way scripting is implemented in an application is not a very standardized process .
Although the concept is not new , it has only recently come into vogue , and because of that , programmers in a rush to make their programs scriptable often do n't research the prior art .
Driven by their biases for this language or that , they limit their audience to those who have biases similar to their own .
For example , a programmer 's favorite language might be Python , so they make their application scriptable in Python only .
This may not seem that harmful to some , but consider what could happen if these biases could be transcended ?
We could learn a lot by studying other cultures , so let 's try to do that now .
Elisp - centric Emacs
Emacs has been around for so long , there 's a good chance that it 's older than you are .
Its long life is a tribute to its forward - looking design which deliberately included the ability to be extended by writing programs in a dialect of Lisp called Elisp .
Over the years , quite a few I < applications > have been built on top of Emacs using Elisp , and an active community of users and programmers has developed around this text editor .
Why was Lisp chosen , though ?
RMS ( Richard M. Stallman ) , the original author of Emacs , explains his rationale in an old interview by Linuxcare : Linuxcare :
How did you come to choose LISP as the EMACS engine ?
Richard : LISP is the most powerful programming language , and if you want an interpreter , LISP is the best .
None of the other languages come anywhere near LISP in their power .
The most exciting things about LISP are read , eval , and print .
If you look at other languages , they have no equivalent for any of those .
And there 's more , but space is limited in this column .
In all seriousness , though , if you want to learn more about why Lisp is a powerful programming language , go find the Linuxcare interview with RMS and read it .
RMS does a good job of explaining the unique feature that sets Lisp apart from all other programming languages .
Relatively speaking , Lisp does not seem as powerful as it used to be , because abstractions like garbage collection and lexical closures are becoming readily available to programmers in the mainstream .
However , it 's sobering to think that we are just now becoming able to appreciate what Lisp had decades ago .
Therefore , considering the timeframe in which Emacs was implemented , Lisp was an excellent choice .
Also , in an essay titled , " Why you should not use Tcl " , RMS retells a very important lesson that was learned while implementing Emacs .
The principal lesson of Emacs is that a language for extensions should not be a mere " extension language " .
It should be a real programming language , designed for writing and maintaining substantial programs .
Because people will want to do that !
By " real " , RMS means that a programming language should support a mature set of abstractions that allow the programmer to implement programs beautifully rather than in a contrived way .
Lisp satisfies this criteria .
However , Lisp is not without its faults .
To people who have their first programming experience using a language like Basic or JavaScript , Lisp looks really weird .
Right off the bat , there 's a social barrier that Lisp must overcome .
To partially solve this , John Tobey tried to bring Perl to Emacs .
His perl module , called Emacs : : EPL , creates a bridge between Emacs ' Elisp interpeter and Perl .
However , to anyone who has used this module , it is clear that Perl is a second - class citizen here .
For one thing , the Perl interpreter is executed as a subprocess , and interprocess communications between between the two is accomplished via pipes .
Secondly , you still need to have a good understanding of Lisp in order to use Emacs : : EPL -- Perl alone is not enough .
The bottom line is that Emacs was never meant to be programmed in anything other than Lisp , and this decision has had ramifications on just how extensible Emacs could be .
Vim and Diversity in Scripting
Vi is the other text editor in Unix land , and the philosophy embodied by vi and its derivatives is diametrically opposed to much of what Emacs stands for .
Where Emacs is big , vi is small .
Where Emacs tries to do everything by itself , vi focuses on the core task of text editing , and if you wanted to do a complex text manipulation , the use of Unix pipes and filters is encouraged .
Where Emacs prefers a modeless style of editing , vi makes very explicit uses of modes ( such as insert mode and command mode ) .
In fact , this is one of vi's defining characterstics which sets it apart from almost every other editor in existence .
Suffice it to say , Emacs and vi are very different from each other .
However , scripting has added an interesting twist to this story .
The most popular editor in the vi family is Vim , and it gained the ability to be scriptable in the late 1990s .
It 's funny , because vi users used to scoff at Emacs users for implementing all kinds of functionality not directly related to the task of text editing .
For example , some Vim users might see Emacs ' built - in psychotherapist ( accessible via M-x doctor ) and feel a strange combination of amusement and disgust .
They think the multiple mail and news clients that come bundled with Emacs are blasphemous .
" Emacs is n't a text editor ; it 's an operating system ! "
What would these same people do if they found out that Tetris had been implemented on top of Vim ?
Then , what if they found out that there was a project called VINE that aims to make it possible for Vim to handle all one 's mail , news and calendaring needs ?
In light of this , people who use Vim need to ask themselves whether Vim and Emacs are as philosophically different as they once believed .
Of course , significant differences in the scripting models exist .
For one thing , Vim's APIs are very minimal compared to Emacs ' .
On the other hand , Vim can support many scripting languages simultaneously .
In addition to its own scripting language , called Vim Script , it can also be extended using Tcl , Perl , Python , and Ruby .
This lets you extend Vim in a language that fits your personality , which is great in theory .
However , in practice , Vim 's approach is not quite perfect .
Although the problems are partially technical , the social issues are much more significant .
For one thing , it is very rare for someone to compile their Vim with support for more than one scripting language at a time .
It 's totally possible to do it , but people tend to show an amazing loyalty to their scripting language of choice .
Unfortunately , this means that if a useful extension were created using Vim's Ruby interface but you only compiled in support for Vim's Perl interface , you 'd be out of luck .
This is such a serious problem that people who write extensions for Vim opt to use Vim Script instead of the more powerful alternatives , because this way they can be sure that their extension can be used as widely as possible .
To improve this situation , extension writers need to be assured that any given scripting language that Vim supports will be enabled in a majority of Vim installations .
Automatically , some of you scream , " BLOAT ! , " but you'd be surprised how small the impact of enabling Tcl , Python , Perl , and Ruby in a single vim binary actually is .
Start - up time is not noticeably different , because the interpreters are started up on - demand rather than all at once in the beginning .
File size is up by 60KB , and memory usage can be counted in 2 ways .
If you count shared libraries , the memory consumption is up by 720 KB , but if you do n't then it 's only up by 180KB .
It 's not that much by today 's standards .
( See The Efficiency of Vim for details . )
And remember , this is for enabling 4 additional interpreters .
If the benefits are judged to outweigh the costs , all the interpreters could be enabled by default in the configure script .
Then , in a few years , extension authors could feel a lot more freedom to use the language they really want to use .
Perhaps this should be a TODO item for Vim 7 .
After all , what good is supporting multiple scripting languages if hardly anyone uses them ?
Scripting in Vim also suffers from a variation on the same problem Emacs had when Emacs : : EPL attempted to add Perl support .
In Vim 's case , the problem is that Vim Script has access to certain capabilities of Vim that neither the Tcl , Perl , Python , nor Ruby interfaces have direct access to , thus relegating these languages to 2nd class citizenship .
What this means is that anyone who wants to create a non-trivial extension to Vim will have to know some Vim Script .
This is n't that bad in practice , but it is not ideal , either .
It is only mentioned here , because people should be aware that the GIMP has solved this problem in a very convincing fashion .
The GIMP and the Genius of the PDB
The GIMP ( GNU Image Manipulation Program ) is a free Photoshop clone that has put into question a lot of stereotypes about what Unix programs could and could not do .
In addition to proving that it was realistic for a Unix program to be heavily graphical , one of its most touted features was its scriptability .
At first , the GIMP could only be scripted in Scheme , but mature interfaces for Perl and Python have since been developed .
What 's more impressive is that all the extension languages stand on a level playing field .
Therefore , although Scheme was first , it does not have any special benefits over Perl or Python .
What makes this possible is the PDB ( Procedural Database ) .
Like its name implies , it is a database of procedures ( or functions ) .
A large portion of it is devoted to keeping track of C functions from libgimp .
However , any scripting language that the GIMP supports can register its own functions in the PDB .
Combine this with the ability of any of the supported languages to execute a function from this database , and you have the ultimate in interoperability .
For example , a script written in Python can execute any function from the PDB regardless of whether it was written in C , Scheme , Python , or even Perl , and it 's not at all contrived .
Due to the good taste of the people who wrote the Scheme , Perl , and Python interfaces , calling a function from the PDB looks just like you 're calling a native function !
( See Listing 1 . ) [ LISTING 1 - Scheme , Perl , Python , and C Working Together ]
# Try this in the Gimp - Python Console. def peace ( ) : # Scheme pdb.script_fu_sphere( " 100 " , # radius " 45.0 " , # lighting angle FALSE , # shadow ?
( 255 , 255 , 255 ) , # background color ( 192 , 0 , 0 ) ) # sphere color # Perl img = pdb.perl_fu_yinyang ( 256 , # width 256 , # height TRUE , # insert eyes ?
FALSE , # eyes are images ? " " , # top eye filename " " , # bottom eye filename TRUE ) # anti-aliasing ?
# Python pdb.python_fu_sphere( 100 , # radius 45.0 , # lighting angle FALSE , # shadow ?
( 255 , 255 , 255 ) , # background color ( 0 , 0 , 192 ) ) # sphere color # C function from libgimp pdb.gimp_display_new( img ) peace ( )
This is probably one of the most important innovations in interoperability to come around in a while , and it 's unfortunate that not many people are aware of it .
The Future of Scripting
We , as users and programmers , have to ask ourselves what we want in terms of scripting support .
Hopefully , you have come to understand that extensibility is good and that having the potential to be extended in more than one language can be even better if done right .
Also , what is right is not just a technical question but a social one as well .
Some of you may think that implementing something like the PDB may require too much work , but remember that we work in a world of Free Software .
What if the PDB could be separated from the GIMP , and then generalized and documented to the point where it could be distributed independently ?
Then every programmer who wanted to add scripting support to his or her C/C++ application could just reuse this modular component and have a solid foundation for supporting multiple scripting languages right from the start .
If implemented , there is no question that the long - term benefits would be positive .
The only question is how positive .

Object Model , posted 24 Sep 2002 at 23:07 UTC by nymia » ( Master )
This is an interesting article .
Keeping the API of an application callable from the implementation of the grammar would probably lead to more variety of scripting languages .
The GIMP example above shows the API has been designed to accomodate more than one , though .
The interesting part is the PDB which can store and execute more than one language .
Putting the PDB as a standard for scripting will definitely solve a lot of interface issues , though .
Especially the part where one app written by an entirely independent group can suddenly become available for other non-related apps .
But this is what CORBA is all about , is n't it ?
... that 's exactly why I 've been working on it the whole time ! :-)
It 's also what XPLC is all about .
Currently , you have to describe interfaces ( which are not unlike a group of function registered in the PDB ) manually in C++ , which kind of restricts it , but the goal is that any and all interfaces are to be available in any of the language bindings , without having to generate separate bindings for the functions ( making the interface available for one language makes it available for all ) .
And all of this without the overhead of CORBA ( the minimally required part of XPLC is an 8 k shared library that only the application needs to link with .
The " full " thing is a 22 k shared library .
Having the lowest possible overhead is one of the main goals of the project .
Language based systems , posted 25 Sep 2002 at 01:30 UTC by mslicker » ( Journeyer )
For those familer with language based systems , scripting is a rather clumsy approximation of what is native to these systems .
In language based systems , an " application " is just a definition in the language .
A library is just a collection of definitions .
Writing modular code , it is possible to recombine definitions in new ways , creating new applications specific to a particular task .
You mention Lisp and Smalltalk in your article .
There have been systems based on each .
Forth is important to mention .
With Forth , the system and language are so tightly integrated that " Forth " commonly refers to both the system and the language .
The future of scripting I believe is in the past .
Language based systems have long existed , but have not come to widespread use .
Perhaps people think there is more power with the muli-language aproach .
From my experience a single expressive ubiquitous language is far more powerful than the multi-language approach currently in practice .
mslicker : the point of the article seems to be basically : 1 ) no group of random people will agree on the ' best ' language , and people do n't like changing languages .
2 ) , exposing all the internal interfaces of an application is good .
3 ) it 's really good when you can have access to all of the internals in the language of your choice .
4 ) gimp takes an approach like this .
supporting more than one language is a matter of convienence : it allows people to use whatever language they 're already familar with instead of having to learn whatever language the author of a program likes .
it is intended to lower the barrier for users to customize applications .
in general , making an application out of nice logically complete modules is just good design .
in some ways you can think of it as expressing the application in a C like language with application - specific built - in functions .
in fact i can readily think of several applications which use a scripting language to implement the high level functionality in terms of primitives in libraries ( written in C generally for speed ) .
generally though you want a scripting interface not to build an entirely new application , but just to change a few things or add a feature to an existing application .
the point is though , that choice of language is to make it more convienent for folks to customise applications , because people will disagree on what a ' single expressive ubiquitous language ' is .

A natural question to ask is why these ostensibly `better ' systems have n't come to widespread use .
In the context of scripting , the answer seems quite clear :
The whole point of scripting languages is to allow people to extend functionality in a quick - and - dirty manner .
Allowing different languages to be used means not only that a script - writer can work in a language he 's familiar with , but that he can immediately leverage on any code libraries for that language .
If one needs to spend 10 years to learn an esoteric language just so that he can write that filter plug - in for his mail client , even when all the code 's already there in CPAN , then I think it defeats the whole purpose of scripting .
2 . ( Actually I have another idea .
The " Unix philosophy " is to write programs which can be joined together by piping on stdin and stdout .
Unfortunately this technique is becoming less and less popular , mainly due to the overhead needed for piping .
Will it be feasible / worthwhile to use nefarious techniques to speed up the piping mechanism , to achieve extensibility ? )
Runtime compatibility , posted 25 Sep 2002 at 11:16 UTC by jonkare » ( Journeyer )
This is a fascinating approach .
However , I 'd like to raise the issue of runtime compatibility .
Most scripting languages include some form of automatic memory management , typically garbage collection or reference counting .
They 're all different , although a number use the Boehm conservative collector .
There 's no problem if the user enables only one extension language - but then he can't use scripts made elsewhere in other languages .
But if two runtimes with two different memory management systems are enabled , what can then happen ?
I do n't know the details , but I would personally fear the worst .
There is a big advantage of limiting the number of languages used in integrated applications like Emacs :
It makes them easier debug and extend .
For example , if you want to see the differences between the CVS versions of a C++ file , you use many different Emacs packages , the version control interface ( VC ) , the difference and merge tool ( ediff ) and the C++ mode ( cc- mode ) .
These again may be based on other packages , but ignore that for now .
If there is a problem , say a bug or a missing feature in the interactin you want to remidy , you may have to study and perohaps extend the code for any or all of these packages .
To do that today , you have to learn a one or two languages , namely Emacs Lisp and C ( if the problem goes really deep ) .
But imagine Emacs had supported plug in languages , and these packages had been written in Python , Perl and TCL .
In that case , you would have to learn up to 5 languages ( the three above , as well as C and Emacs Lisp ) to fully understand the interaction .
For applications where extensions rarely interact , it may be an advantage to support a choice of languages .
But for integrated applications this just raise the bar for new developers unreasonable , as he will have to learn all the supported languages .

tk writes : Perhaps a natural question , but not useful a one .
What comes into widespread in computing is the result of economic forces ( why do so many use Windows ? ) , or unknown forces ( why did C become so popular ? ) .
If it really takes 10 years to learn the general purpose language , then there is really something wrong with that language .
I would expect a general purpose language to take more time than a language used for scripting .
As abraham points out the barier is much lower when there is only one language to learn .
Take a typical Unix environment , there are several languages you must learn to be productive in this environment .
Unless you really want to get in over your head , these languages are fixed and must be dealt with .
In my experience scripting can not be done in a " quick - and - dirty manner " .
In fact this is probably the main reason I 've never scripted any application , the barrier is much to high .
You must learn the details of these quite expansive applications and how this functionality maps onto the scripting language of your choice .
And you must do this for each application for each scripting language .
In a language based system , the skills you learn are continually reused for every task you might want to perform .
As far as the effort expended goes , a language based system makes far better use of your time .

Piping is quite limited .
It really does n't make sense at all for interactive applications , that is why you do n't see it 's use .
Instead far more horrible methods are used for interactive Unix applications .

So give me PDB , liberally licensed ( at least the LGPL ) .
If this was a separate package that did the bulk of heavy - lifting to make Python , Perl ( 5 & 6 ) , and Scheme available to a scriptable application , I might use it .
It still would be a ./ configure option , so one could fall back to the native scripting language if looking for a lighterweight implementation .
I stand in the middle with XPLC .
You only need to understand the interfaces , which it will be possible to have output in the language of your choice ( still missing an IDL ) .
So in a sense , XPLC acts as the " single expressive ubiquitous language " .
At the same time , those interfaces can be implemented in different languages .
So people will disagree on the single language to use , but that 's okay too .
Where XPLC breaks down is if you need to delve in the innards of each of the components ( following abraham 's comment about Emacs extensions ) , the components might be written in whatever language their author fancied !
Touchee ! , posted 26 Sep 2002 at 07:48 UTC by shlomif » ( Master )
I wanted to write such an article myself .
I do hope someone will take initiative and form a common extensibility layers with various languages as plug-ins .
Of course , some languages are very different which makes it very hard .
For instance , in Tcl , strings are null - terminated , which is a very bad decision .
I draw people 's attention to the set of perl modules under the Inline heirarchy .
I 've used the C and Tcl interfaces before now to create language - agnostic applications in perl , and I 'm fairly sure the Python one is also useable ( although I 've never used it ) .
It 's simple , effective , and powerful .

It is a proverb world leaders might do well to bear in mind as their impoverished populations struggle with food costs driven ever higher by record oil prices , weather and speculators trading in local market places and on global futures exchanges .
Anger over high food and fuel costs has spawned a rash of violent unrest across the globe in the past six months .
From the deserts of Mauritania to steamy Mozambique on Africa ’s Indian Ocean coast , people have taken to the streets .
There have been “ tortilla riots ” in Mexico , villagers have clashed with police in eastern India and hundreds of Muslims have marched for lower food prices in Indonesia .
Governments have introduced price controls and export caps or cut custom duties to appease the people who vote for them , but on streets across Africa , those voters want them to do more .
Sub -Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable : most people survive on less than $ 2 a day in countries prone to droughts and floods where agricultural processes are still often rudimentary .
For African households , even a small rise in the price of food can be devastating when meals are a family ’s main expense .
“ People have been driven to destruction because they no longer know what to do or who to talk to , ” said Ousmane Sanou , a trader in Patte d’Oie , one of the areas worst hit by February riots in Burkina Faso ’s capital , Ouagadougou .
“ They understand it ’s the only way to get the government to change things .
Prices must come down -- otherwise we ’re heading for a catastrophe . ”
Over 300 people were arrested in some of the worst violence for years in normally calm , landlocked Burkina , prompting the government to suspend custom duties on staple food imports for three months -- measures some other countries have also taken .
But unions have threatened to call a general strike in April unless prices fall further .
Anger over rising prices also fuelled violence in Mauritania late last year .
And at least six people were killed when taxi drivers in Mozambique rioted over fuel prices in February .
In Senegal , police raided a private television station last Sunday after it repeatedly transmitted images of police beating demonstrators with electrified batons and firing tear gas during an illegal protest over high food prices in the capital Dakar .
The poor country on Africa ’s west coast witnessed the worst rioting in more than a decade last year , as hundreds of youths smashed windows and burned tires in anger at high prices and government efforts to clear away street traders .
MARKET FORCES
The U.N. World Food Programme ( WFP ) says staple food prices in some parts of Africa have risen by 40 percent or more in six months .
And this on a continent where malnutrition rates in some areas regularly top emergency levels even in an average year .
Food inflation in Africa is 2.8 percentage points higher than headline inflation , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said this month .
In South Africa last week , central bank Governor Tito Mboweni warned consumers to “ tighten their belts ” as the targeted inflation measure reached a five - year high at 9.4 percent year - on - year in February , from 8.8 percent in January .
Already , consumer spending has slowed sharply , and confidence levels are at multi- year lows -- all this on top of chronic energy shortages in Africa ’s biggest economy .
In Cameroon , a taxi drivers ’ strike over rising fuel costs -- caused by many of the same factors pumping up food prices -- triggered widespread rioting exacerbated by anger over the cost of food , high unemployment and plans by President Paul Biya to change the constitution to extend his 25 - year rule .
Government ministers said around 25 to 40 people were killed , although a human rights group put the toll at over 100 .
The rising food prices have affected both Africa ’s small middle - class , like consumers in resource - rich South Africa , and poorer people like Sanou , the trader in Ouagadougou .
While famines like those witnessed in the 1980s are less common now thanks to aid and development programmes , there is the risk of a return to chronic inflation which could threaten the relative economic stability achieved by many African states .
“ We are frustrated .
We are disgruntled , ” said Jean - Martin Tsafack , a 32 - year - old law graduate who sells imported second - hand clothes in Cameroon ’s capital Yaounde .
“ Some of us have become hawkers , others truck pushers ( barrow boys ) .
Many girls who were my classmates in university have now become prostitutes just to have something to eat .
Life is becoming unbearable , ” he said .
GLOBAL ISSUES
There are several reasons for the spiraling cost of living .
Record oil prices driven by strong demand and insecurity in major production areas have pushed up fuel pump costs , making anything that has to be transported to market more expensive .
Rising consumption of livestock fodder and other foods by fast - expanding China and India , and the use of land and crops for biofuels have boosted demand .
Erratic weather , perhaps due to climate change , has trimmed harvests in some growing regions .
Meanwhile , investment funds and other speculators have bet on prices to continue up in a self - fulfilling cycle .

Across the world , governments are facing the consequences .
Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo asked Vietnam earlier this year to guarantee Manila up to 1.5 million tonnes of annual supply of rice because of fears that shortages later this year could spell political trouble for her .
Indonesia , where President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is expected to seek a second term in office next year , has unveiled new measures to stem rising prices , targeting palm oil - based cooking oil , wheat flour , rice and soybeans .
And in just one example from Latin America , Peru said last week it would give away food to its poorest citizens and set up a fund to absorb high oil prices -- this as President Alan Garcia ’s approval rating has fallen to below 30 percent .
POLITICAL RISK
In Africa , countries like Mauritania , which imports 70 percent of its food , have been among the worst affected .
“ I ca n’t take it any more .
I ’ve stopped eating a meal in the evening , ” said Ami Gandega , 36 , a civil servant in the capital Nouakchott .
The government suspended import tax on cereals last year and is bolstering village grain stores with subsidized stocks -- but aid workers believe this is not enough .
The WFP fears Mauritanian families will not only have to ration what they eat , but also cut back on education spending , sell livestock , or even send children to work or beg to survive .
“ Inflation of staples is really out of control .
We ’ve never seen this before , ” said WFP representative Gian Carlo Cirri .
“ If we do n’t react now , this summer will be full of danger . ”
WFP has forecast a “ perfect storm ” of woes for its operations : it is faced with a $ 500 million funding shortfall purely due to rising costs of buying and distributing food , even before taking into account greater need for aid now .
And that need is ever growing .
Last week , 40 aid agencies urged the world to focus attention on Somalia ’s “ catastrophic ” humanitarian crisis where hundreds of thousands of people are suffering from war , drought and food shortages .
Some humanitarian workers fear the growing furor over rising prices could even encourage traders to hoard stocks .
Government reaction -- through cuts in duties or subsidies -- may slow down real economic adjustment to higher prices , such as encouraging local farmers to grow more .
But they help cushion the blow for governments and the poor .
“ There are very few governments , especially in this region , that are going to be strong enough to be able to encourage that normal economic incentive to come through over the course of time , ” said Standard Chartered Africa research head Razia Khan .
“ Any measures to allow the price of imported food to be reflected at the consumer level will be very rapidly reversed . ”
So more and more governments in Africa may opt for food aid , especially subsidies , as recommended by donors like the IMF .
Perhaps , at the back of their minds , they will remember Liberian President William Tolbert , who was stabbed to death in 1980 in a crisis sparked by riots over a rice price increase .

The headset works in a similar way to voice recognition , in that it must first be calibrated using Emotiv 's software to recognise patterns in the user 's electrical brain impulses , which are used to perform 30 preset actions .
When the player performs those same thoughts in the game the software knows to associate them with the correct action , such as rotate object or push object .
" If you look at the way we communicate with machines up to this day , it 's always in a conscious form , so whether you turn on and off the light or you program software you always consciously tell a machine to perform a task for you , " Emotiv CEO and co-founder Nam Do said in an interview from the company 's Pyrmont offices .
" But the communication among ourselves is much more interesting because we have non-conscious communications , so we read body language , we read facial expressions and we also have feelings and emotions which differentiate us from machines .
" Our vision for the next generation of man-machine interface is it 's not going to be limited to just conscious [ interaction ] . "
While the headset will work in a very limited sense with existing titles , Do said the major game developers and publishers were designing a number of their upcoming titles to take full advantage of the technology .
For instance , an in - game avatar would be able to mimic the human player 's facial expressions - smiles , winks , grimaces , and so on - in real time , and other non-human characters in the game could respond to these .
" If you shoot somebody and you 're smiling , the non-player character can turn around and say to you , ' What are you laughing at ?
You just killed that dude , ' " Do said .
The headset could also detect the players ' emotions - whether they 're bored , angry , engaged , happy , stressed , etc - and adjust difficulty levels , in - game music and the game environment accordingly .
Characters could also react to a player 's emotional cues .
In horror - themed games , enemies could intelligently select the perfect time to startle a player based on how they feel , rather than having opponents in the same positions every time a mission is reloaded .
But the most powerful aspect of the EPOC is its ability to detect thoughts .
Players can just think about performing actions , such as lifting or pushing objects or making them disappear , and have the game act accordingly without the need to push any keys or buttons .
All of these features have been publicly demonstrated to thousands at gaming conferences using a role playing game developed by Emotiv .
It will be included for free with the headset and was trialled in Sydney by smh.com.au .
Do , who came to Australia from Vietnam in 1995 on a university scholarship , said his intention was not to replace the keyboard or traditional game controller ; he simple wanted to add another layer to the experience .
" You can still move around using your joystick , using your keypad , using your mouse and keyboard , just like a normal game , but there is a lot of activity that we take to another level by adding a headset - such as being able to levitate an object by thinking about it , " he said .
Do said the company was first concentrating on the larger US market - which has about 9 million hardcore gamers - but was working with Australian resellers and distributors to launch the product here .
Regardless , Australians would be able to order the headset online from US retailers or from Emotiv itself .
" We 're working very hard to get the headset to other markets at least by online ordering , " Do said .
He said that , while the company was initially focused on gaming , the technology had applications in any situations where humans interacted with machines , such as in medicine and robotics .
Further , market research companies and even Hollywood studios were tapping Emotiv 's technology to measure reactions from focus groups .
Emotiv spent two years developing its technology in Sydney before moving its headquarters to San Francisco , the home of Silicon Valley , in 2005 .
It employs about 50 staff - neurologists , biomedical scientists , mathematicians , engineers - but its entire research team is still based in Sydney .
Moving to the US , Do said , meant Emotiv was " closer to all the action , all the [ big gaming ] companies , all the clients and also access to money , because , as a start - up company , money is always one of the key considerations " .
He said Emotiv had been approached by numerous suitors keen to acquire the company , but wanted to first see how far the technology could grow .
Emotiv has also had meetings with the major game console makers about licensing the technology to them for future products .
In addition to Do , Emotiv was founded by 1998 Young Australian of the Year Tan Le ; Neil Weste , a neuroscientist who sold his chip manufacturing company Radiata Communications to Cisco in 2000 for $ US295 million ; and Allan Snyder , the director of the University of Sydney 's Centre for the Mind and winner of the 2001 Marconi Prize .
The four founders self - funded the initial $ 1 million needed to start the company but have since raised $ US14.5 million in series A funding .
It is now in the process of raising series B funding .
Biscuits Biscuits we all love them do n't we .
But what exactly is a biscuit ?
Biscuit comes from the french meaning twice - cooked but do n't let that put you off , as the french do n't really have a clue about making decent biscuits .
Those dreadful Petit Beurre things that they knock out are really nasty .
They sound like they are going to be really nice , like some sort of little buttery thing , but they 're not .
I 've seen some where they put a big slab of chocolate on the top in an attempt to make them nice but it was all a bit wrong .
Taxonomy of biscuits Cakes Usually easily distinguished from biscuits by their sheer size however individual cakes can be a bit tricker , for instance the macaroon .
Also the Jaffa Cake despite having the word cake in its name can confuse some people .
Crackers Crackers are aimed at savory use such as cheese and crackers , however you sometimes get those hovis sweetmeal digestives , I do n't know why , in big boxes of crackers , which is obviously confusing .
Generally you would n't want to dunk one in your tea .
Chocolate covered Half way between biscuits and chocolate bars , are the chocolate covered biscuits .
A bit of a grey area but this is where we encounter individual foil wraps , and strange quasi cake , biscuit hybrids like the Waggon Wheel .
Also the home of the Jacobs Club biscuit , although this is a sad shadow of its former self thanks to the French again .
Chocolate Bars
The Kit Kat is a good example of the transitional phase from chocolate covered to full chocolate bars like the picnic .
How to spot biscuits
They come in packets
They have two sides
You could dunk them in tea Entry level
They come in clear cellophane wrappers
They are n't so nice that you could eat a whole packet
They are homogeneous Mid range Anything with a currant , or some sort of fruit in it
Twin layer affair with some sort of cream up the middle
Wrapper has pictures on it .
Some sort of USP Luxury
Any thing with chocolate on top .
May be in a cardboard box FAQ Q. Are Jaffa cakes biscuits .
A . No , no the 're not .
Apart from being called cakes they obviously have a sponge base .
Granted they appear to be some kind of luxury biscuit being chocolate covered and shipping in a box .
Q. Why are ' Nice ' biscuits called that ?
A. I do n't know because they are possibly one of the nastiest biscuits ever , perhaps its sarcasm .
Also if you are new to this site and are about to email me saying " Actually its because they are named after the town in the south of France " do n't .
They 're not from there , nobody there has ever heard of them .
Hop on an Easyjet flight get yourself down there and ask around , you 'll get even blanker Gallic looks than usual .
Back when they were invented Huntley and Palmer were knocking out over 450 sorts of biscuits , so naming new sorts of biscuits was probably a matter of just going through the phone book or index in the atlas .
Anyhow I do n't like them .
Q. Whats the best biscuit ever ?
A . Well I would have to say the Abbey Crunch , see my page on this ground breaking oat based biscuit .
Q. Can something that is individually wrapped be biscuit .
A . Its pushing it is n't it .
Q. Whats the story with pink wafers ?
A . Well they have dropped out of fashion , and rightly so as they are unpleasant at best .
Wafers in general have had to move up into chocolate covered jobs like the Tunnocks wafer , or chocolate bars like the Kit Kat
“ Building new coal - fired power plants is ill conceived , ” said James E. Hansen , a leading climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
“ Given our knowledge about what needs to be done to stabilize climate , this plan is like barging into a war without having a plan for how it should be conducted , even though information is available .
Image Italys Civitavecchia power plant is converting from oil to coal .
Credit ... Marco Di Lauro for The New York Times
“ We need a moratorium on coal now , ” he added , “ with phase - out of existing plants over the next two decades . ”
Coal ’s Advantages
Enel and many other electricity companies say they have little choice but to build coal plants to replace aging infrastructure , particularly in countries like Italy and Germany that have banned the building of nuclear power plants .
Fuel costs have risen 151 percent since 1996 , and Italians pay the highest electricity costs in Europe .
In terms of cost and energy security , coal has all the advantages , its proponents argue .
Coal reserves will last for 200 years , rather than 50 years for gas and oil .
Coal is relatively cheap compared with oil and natural gas , although coal prices have tripled in the past few years .
More important , dozens of countries export coal  there is not a coal cartel  so there is more room to negotiate prices .
“ In order to get over oil , which is getting more and more expensive , our plan is to convert all oil plants to coal using clean - coal technologies , ” said Gianfilippo Mancini , Enel ’s chief of generation and energy management .
“ This will be the cleanest coal plant in Europe .
We are hoping to prove that it will be possible to make sustainable and environmentally friendly use of coal . ”
“ Clean coal ” is a term coined by the industry decades ago , referring to its efforts to reduce local pollution .
Using new technology , clean coal plants sharply reduced the number of sooty particles spewed into the air , as well as gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide .
The technology has minimal effect on carbon emissions .
In fact , the technology that the industry is counting on to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that add to global warning  carbon capture and storage  is not now commercially available .
No one knows if it is feasible on a large , cost - effective scale .
Like lots and lots of people , I ’ve been following this year ’s election very closely .
I ’m not into sports , so this is about the closest to it I get .
And , like an avid sports fan , I ’m transfixed by the stats : the numbers that tell how the teams are doing .
Here ’s how CNN shows it ( as of 5/12/09 ) :
Very pretty .
Lots of smiling faces and exciting vertical lines .
Unfortunately , for all those pixels , there ’s a hell of a lot of chartjunk .
It ’s enough to drive a Tufte - fanboy like me crazy .
Lets focus on just the actual chart part of the image :
See anything missing ?
I ’ll give you a hint .
This is showing the status of the democratic candidate race .
Do n’t races usually have finish lines ?
For all we can tell , Obama and Clinton are neck and neck ( argh , graphical pun not intended ) … somewhere … in the middle of the race .
But that is n’t the case at all .
Let ’s see if we can improve it a bit :
This actually shows the status of the race relative to the finish line .
As you can see , the finish line is looming but Obama and Clinton are still pretty close .
Clinton has about 89 % of the votes that Obama has so far .
But actually , I still do n’t think this is the best we can do .
The way I look at it , the accumulated votes are n’t as important as the remaining votes needed .
It ’s distance from the finish line that matters .
If you ’re running a 500 meter sprint and you ’re 20 meters behind your opponent 100 meters in , you ’ve still got 400 meters to catch up .
If you ’re 20 meters behind and 40 from the finish line , it ’s over .
It ’s the relative remaining distance that matters .
Let ’s focus on that :
Now things do n’t look so close .
Now lets see what the upcoming races can hope to do :
Now it becomes obvious how much of a challenge Clinton has ahead of her .
A hamster was taken into custody after walking into Cheltenham police station .
The brown and white rodent which handed itself into Police Community Support Officer Kevin Rees is not thought to have committed any crime , police said .
The pet was taken in by officers before being driven to a local animal shelter on Tuesday evening .
Its owners now have seven days to bail the rodent out .
Police believe the hamster lives in the Churchdown area .
If it is not claimed within seven days it will be re-homed .
A Gloucestershire Constabulary spokesman said the owners are asked to contact police or the Cheltenham animal centre .
This week on Musical Geek Friday - a song about The Day the Routers Died !
This song is written and performed live at the 55th RIPE Meeting by Gary Feldman ( scroll down for a video of him performing it live ) .
RIPE ( Réseaux IP Européens ) is a collaborative forum open to all parties interested in wide area IP networks in Europe and beyond .
The objective of RIPE is to ensure the administrative and technical coordination necessary to enable the operation of a pan-European IP network .
A RIPE Meeting is a five - day event where Internet service providers , network operators and other interested parties from Europe and the surrounding regions gather .
RIPE Meetings are open to everyone and provide an excellent opportunity for attendees to discuss Internet policy .
The song is about a problem that the current IP v4 address space is running out of IP addresses ( read about the problem here ) .
IP v4 address space can hold just 4'294'967'296 ( 232 ) addresses .
The song suggests that we all move to IP v6 address space which can hold 2128 addresses .
That many addresses will never run out .
Here it is !

Here are the lyrics of The Day the Routers Died song :
a long long time ago i can still remember when my laptop could connect elsewhere and i tell you all there was a day the network card i threw away had a purpose - and it worked for you and me ... but 18 years completely wasted with each address we 've aggregated the tables overflowing the traffic just stopped flowing ... and now we 're bearing all the scars and all my traceroutes showing stars ... the packets would travel faster in cars ... the day ... the routers died ...
Chorus ( ALL !!!!!) so bye bye , folks at RIPE 55 be persuaded to upgrade it or your network will die IP v6 just makes me let out a sigh but I s'pose we 'd better give it a try I suppose we 'd better give it a try now did you write an RFC that dictated how we all should be did we listen like we should that day now you back at RIPE fifty - four where we heard the same things months before and the people knew they'd have to change their ways ... and we - knew that all the ISPs could be - future proof for centuries but that was then not now spent too much time playing WoW ooh there was time we sat on IRC making jokes on how this day would be now there 's no more use for TCP the day the routers died ...
Chorus ( chime in now ) so bye bye , folks at RIPE 55 be persuaded to upgrade it or your network will die IP v6 just makes me let out a sigh but I s'pose we 'd better give it a try I suppose we 'd better give it a try I remember those old days I mourn sitting in my room , downloading porn yeah that 's how it used to be ... when the packets flowed from A to B via routers that could talk IP
There was data ... that could be exchanged between you and me ... oh but - I could see you all ignore the fact - we'd fill up IP v4 but we all lost the nerve and we got what we deserved !
and while ... we threw our network kit away and wished we'd heard the things they say put all our lives in disarray the day ... the routers died ...
Chorus ( those silent will be shot ) so bye bye , folks at RIPE 55 be persuaded to upgrade it or your network will die IP v6 just makes me let out a sigh but I s'pose we 'd better give it a try I suppose we 'd better give it a try saw a man with whom I used to peer asked him to rescue my career he just sighed and turned away ...
I went down to the net cafe that I used to visit everyday but the man there said I might as well just leave ... and now we 've all lost our purpose .. my cisco shares completely worthless ... no future meetings for me at the Hotel Krasnapolsky and the men that make us push and push like Geoff Huston and Randy Bush should 've listened to what they told us ...
The day ... the routers ... died Chorus ( time to lose your voice ) bye bye , folks at RIPE 55 be persuaded to upgrade it or your network will die IP v6 just makes me let out a sigh but I spose we 'd better give it a try I suppose we 'd better give it a try
I also found a live video of Gary performing the song live at RIPE 55 :
Btw , the Internet died once in 1997 .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A 49 - year - old Missouri woman accused of pretending to be a love - struck teenage boy on MySpace and drove a 13 - year - old girl to suicide with cruel messages was indicted on Thursday on federal charges .
A screen grab of MySpace.com .
REUTERS/www.myspace.com
Prosecutors say Lori Drew and others created the fake MySpace persona of a 16 - year - old boy to woo neighbour Megan Meier for several weeks , then abruptly ended the relationship and said the world would be better off without her .
Meier ’s 2006 suicide by hanging , just hours after she read those final messages , made worldwide headlines and prompted calls for social networking sites like MySpace to crack down on cyber - bullying .
“ This adult woman allegedly used the Internet to target a young teenage girl , with horrendous ramifications , ” U.S. Attorney Thomas O’Brien said in announcing the indictment in Los Angeles , where MySpace is based .
“ Any adult who uses the Internet or a social gathering Web site to bully or harass another person , particularly a young teenage girl , needs to realize that their actions can have serious consequences , ” O’Brien said .
Experts said the indictment , which was handed down in Los Angeles after Missouri authorities declined to prosecute Drew , was a first of its kind and could stretch the bounds of the federal statute on which it was based .
“ We are in uncharted waters here , ” University of Southern California law professor and former federal prosecutor Rebecca Lonergan told Reuters .
“ This case is unprecedented and it ’s also a very aggressive charging decision . ”
Lonergan said Drew was charged with accessing a protected computer to obtain information , a statute typically used against defendants who hack into government computers .
“ While I think most people agree that it merits punishment to harass a young girl to the point where she commits suicide , it ’s not clear that this conduct is covered by this federal statute , ” she said .
A FICTIONAL BOY
Prosecutors say Drew , mother of a teenage girl who had a falling out with Meier , and several others created a profile for the fictional “ Josh Evans , ” using the picture of an unwitting teenage boy .
They then contacted Meier , who lived four doors away in O’Fallon , Missouri , through MySpace as “ Josh ” and spent several weeks flirting with her before ending the relationship on October 15 , 2006 .
Several hours after the final message , Meier , who had argued with her mother over the relationship , hanged herself in the closet of her bedroom in a St. Louis suburb , still unaware that “ Josh ” did not exist .
The indictment charges that after Meier killed herself , Drew had the phoney MySpace account deleted and warned a girl who knew about it that she should “ keep her mouth shut . ”
After the incident became widely known , the Drew family was shunned by members of the community , targeted for abuse on the Internet and their small advertising business was vandalized .
Drew , who faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison if she is convicted on all of the charges , was expected to surrender to authorities in Missouri .
The One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project , which developed the low - cost XO education laptop for developing countries , has revealed plans for its next - generation mobile computing device .
The new system , which will have a clamshell form - factor with two 16:9 touch - screen displays and no hardware keyboard , is expected to sell for $ 75 per unit and will be available in 2010 .
That 's the hope , at least .
The reality is likely to be quite different , given the project 's troubled history .
OLPC has suffered from a multitude of serious setbacks and has had difficulty managing the development and rollout of its XO laptop .
The cost of the XO climbed to $ 188 from the initial target of $ 100 and OLPC complains that sales have been disappointingly slow .
The organization attempted to sell XO units in North America through the Give 1 Get 1 program in order to offset some of the production costs , but the effort was undermined by serious shipping and deployment problems .
The XO keyboard , which is said to be susceptible to hardware failure , has prompted a dubious patent infringement lawsuit by a Nigerian company .
The organization itself is also fracturing internally as key contributors take sides in a bitter dispute over the direction of the OLPC software platform .
This battle has led to the departure of several important participants .
OLPC 's former security director lashed out at the organization last week and revealed that it has absolutely no deployment infrastructure in place at all to facilitate the XO rollout .
Those problems will hopefully be worked out by the time OLPC 2.0 is launched .
OLPC founder Nicholas Negroponte says that the clamshell design of the new laptop is modeled after a book .
It will be smaller and lighter than the XO and can also be opened up completely flat to provide a single continuous touch - screen surface .
Like the XO , it will use former OLPC CTO Mary Lou Jepsen 's unique dual - mode display which is readable under direct sunlight .
Jepsen left OLPC earlier this year to found her own company with the intention of commercializing the display technology .
She indicated at the time that she was working with OLPC on a new project — a $ 75 laptop .
The new OLPC hardware model announced today is likely what she was referring to .
Negroponte 's announcement of a next - generation product seems extremely premature in the face of all of the severe problems faced by OLPC and its current product .
Without proper deployment infrastructure to handle the XO , there 's a very real question of whether the organization will last long enough to push out a second product .

( CNN ) -- French parachutist Michel Fournier vowed Tuesday to try again to launch a record - breaking skydive in August , hours after a " freak " accident over Canada aborted his second attempt to do so .
Michel Fournier tests his equipment a few days before his attempt to break four world records .
" I 'm not about to give up , " the 64 - year - old adventurer said of his shot at setting a world record for the highest jump and fastest , longest free fall by a man riding a balloon .
Tuesday 's attempt was thwarted when an electrical charge broke the cable connecting the balloon to the gondola , causing it to slip away from his ground crew and rise into the Saskatchewan skies over North Battleford .
" The question is , why was it electrically activated ? " said Michel Chevalet , a balloon expert working on Fournier 's technical team .
He suggested that static electricity may have been to blame but that it had been an unforeseen possibility .
" Unexpected freak accidents do happen , " he said .
Watch report on Michel Fournier 's failed free - fall quest »
Fournier said the failure came as a blow .
" It was like having a hammer over the head , " he said .
Watch Fournier talk about trying again »
The former paratrooper had hoped his " Big Jump " would start 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) above the Earth 's surface .
But his hopes dissipated over the Canadian prairie shortly after 5 a.m. ( 7 a.m. ET ) , when the balloon took off before his capsule could be attached .
Still clad in his bright yellow pressure suit , a visibly frustrated Fournier waved away cameras after his balloon 's abrupt departure .
It drifted back to the ground about 40 km away .
Fournier says he spent nearly 12.7 million euros ( $ 20 million ) on his quest , a risky endeavor that French authorities refused to allow him to attempt over France .
Canadian authorities approved the mission over the town of North Battleford , in sparsely populated Saskatchewan .
The town 's mayor , Julian Sadlowski , said Monday 's failure was " a disappointment . "
" I thought this was going to be the day that we saw history made in the Battlefords , " he said .
Balloon trouble also doomed Fournier 's effort to break the record in 2003 .
Fournier holds the French record for the highest parachute jump at 12,000 meters ( 40,000 feet ) .
He says his next chance is in August because that is when the jet stream will next be favorable .
The " Big Jump " will collect data that will help astronauts and others survive at high altitudes , he says .
Fournier estimated that Tuesday 's failed effort cost him and his sponsors about 600,000 euros ( $ 946,000 ) .

THE idea of “ open source ” software is familiar to many computer users .
Enthusiasts get together on the internet to create a new program , and as well as giving it away , they also make available its source code — the software 's underlying blueprint .
This allows other people to make additions and improvements , and those are made available , in turn , to anyone who is interested .
You do not have to be a programmer to benefit from the open - source model : many people use the Linux operating system or Firefox web - browser , for example , both of which have been developed in this way .
Now the same approach is being applied to hardware , albeit in a modified form .
The open - source model cannot be directly carried over to hardware , because software can be duplicated and distributed at almost no cost , whereas physical objects cannot .
Modifying source code and then distributing a new , improved version of a program is much easier than improving and sharing the design of , say , an open - source motorbike .
Some day , perhaps , fabricating machines will be able to transform digital specifications ( software ) into physical objects ( hardware ) , which will no doubt lead to a vibrant trade in specifications , some of which will be paid for , and some of which will be open - source .
But until that day , the term “ open - source hardware ” is being used in a narrower sense .
It refers to an emerging class of electronic devices , for which the specifications have been made public , so that enthusiasts can suggest refinements , write and share software improvements , and even build their own devices from scratch .
This is not as daft as it sounds .
Even if all the details needed to build something are available , few people will have the tools or the inclination to do so .
A good example is the OSD , a “ media fridge ” made by Neuros Technology of Chicago which acts as a repository of video from DVDs , camcorders , cable boxes and so on .
Neuros made the OSD 's technical specifications available , and a group of users then wrote software to add a new feature that many users had requested : the ability to stream video from the OSD to another device across the internet .
To access this new feature , users simply had to download a software patch .
“ It 's harder for my device to get antiquated , ” says Aaron Crum , an OSD user , “ and I do n't have to buy another $ 200 device next year . ”
This opens the way to a new model for product development , suggests Seth Talley , the owner of a Chumby , another open - source device .
“ The destiny of the product has been turned over to the user base , ” he says .
“ You 're talking the wisdom of crowds with the control of the corporation . ”
Companies , for their part , say an open approach can help them get to market quickly with products that give customers what they want — without the need for market research .
Such advantages , they say , outweigh the drawbacks of exposing what are usually seen as corporate secrets .
The origins of open
In some ways , open - source hardware is a throwback to the 1970s and 1980s , when early computers were sold in kits or shipped with schematic diagrams to make it easier for users to customise them .
But the open - hardware trend has been reborn in recent years , thanks to the rise of the internet and the success of open - source software .
Some enthusiasts point to 2005 as a crucial year : that was when work began on devices such as the RepRap ( a rapid - prototyping machine that will , its makers hope , be able to replicate itself ) and the TuxPhone , an open , Linux - powered mobile - phone .
It was also when Sun Microsystems , a computer - maker , decided to publish the specifications of one of its microprocessors , the UltraSPARC T1 .
The open - source hardware trend is now growing fast , says Adrian Bowyer , a mechanical engineer at the University of Bath and the inventor of the RepRap .
Now companies , and not just internet - based enthusiasts , are embracing the open - source hardware model .
Neuros is one example ; another is OpenMoko , based in Taipei , which has an open - source mobile - phone operating system and a mobile phone , the Neo1973 .
Chumby Industries , based in San Diego , has the Chumby — a sort of computerised cushion with wireless internet access and a small touch - screen , which can be reprogrammed as an alarm clock , weather station , photo album and so on .
There can be limits to open - hardware companies ' openness .
Gumstix , which sells tiny computers to put into other devices , publishes the hardware specifications of all its products except for its motherboards .
“ The motherboard is our intellectual property — we have a secret sauce to make that , ” says Gordon Kruberg , the firm 's chief executive .
“ My philosophy is : I really like to publish as much as I can , but my gut feeling is that this is what we want to keep this in - house . ”
Some firms publish just enough information about their hardware for it to be reprogrammed , but not replicated .
This is the approach of iRobot , the maker of the Roomba robotic vacuum - cleaner , based in Bedford , Massachusetts , for example .
Enthusiasts enjoy tinkering , and other users like being able to upgrade their devices with new software .
But what is in it for companies ?
One advantage is being able to draw upon the expertise of their users .
“ We get a question that has stumped our developers for days and we push it public and get a suggestion within five minutes , ” says Sean Moss - Pultz , OpenMoko 's founder and chief executive .
Even so , making a business out of open hardware is a notion that baffles many people .
“ They wonder how you 're going to make money with it , ” says Mitch Altman , president and chief technology officer at Cornfield Electronics in San Francisco .
It makes the TV - B - Gone , an impish gadget for turning off televisions ( whether or not they belong to you ) , and also sells kits for consumers who want to build their own .
Open - hardware business models are difficult to understand , because by turning users into product developers , they turn tradition on its head , says Eric von Hippel , professor of innovation at the MIT Sloan School of Management in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and the author of “ Democratizing Innovation ” .
That makes it necessary for companies to consider the users ' motivations too , he says .
“ The users have a built - in business model — they build to satisfy themselves , ” he says .
“ The business model is ‘ I can get stuff for myself , I can get a better design and I can benefit . '
The innovation is paid for within the activity itself . ”

As well as tapping a valuable new source of ideas , an open approach can also lead to savings in market research , as users act as focus groups , indicating what new features they would like ( and then helping to develop them ) .
An early model of OpenMoko 's phone had no Wi-Fi , for example , because Wi-Fi chips were expensive and the firm could not find a chipmaker willing to go along with its open approach .
But once OpenMoko posted its plans and schematics online , enthusiasts told the company that they really wanted the Wi-Fi function — and then found a chipmaker willing to supply a chip and to go along with OpenMoko 's unusual model .
Going open - source may also help to keep customers .
“ Once you 've opened the guts of a machine , you 're a much more loyal customer , ” says Mr Talley , who got a Chumby for Christmas .
Sun says the primary advantage of open - sourcing the designs of its processor chips is an elusive marketing boost to its other products , such as server computers .
“ It builds a community that will buy our hardware , ” says Sridhar Vajapey , who runs Sun 's OpenSPARC program .
“ Is Sun making money on open - source hardware ?
Absolutely .
We can't measure it directly , but we do know the vector is going in the right direction . ”
An alternative approach is to make money from something other than the hardware .
Chumby Industries , for instance , expects to make most of its revenue by piping advertising to its devices .
“ It 's a traditional media model , only with user control , ” says Steve Tomlin , the firm 's founder and chief executive .
Difficult to open
But open - source hardware poses difficulties , too .
In addition to publishing all the software code for a device , for example , makers of open - source hardware generally reveal the physical information needed to build a device , including schematics , materials and dimensions .
This is not something manufacturers normally do , and takes time and effort .
Supplying open - source hardware is necessarily , therefore , more time - consuming and complex .
“ It ca n't be as simple as open - source software , ” says Peter Semmelhack , the founder of Bug Labs , a company based in New York that sells open - source hardware modules to put into other devices .
“ It has chips , schematics and things coming from many sources . ”
And suppliers of those many parts are not always interested in going open source , which further complicates matters .
OpenMoko tries to use chips with open specifications , says Mr Moss - Pultz , though some chipmakers are reluctant to play along .
“ It 's like they 're taking their pants off in public , ” he says .
Working with a zealous open - source community can be like negotiating with a stampede .
“ Too much feedback makes it so you can't work any more , ” says Mr Moss - Pultz .
A company can easily lose focus when it is deluged with unprofitable and obscure ideas from fervent users .
“ In open - source hardware there is a great deal of flexibility , ” says Joe Born , the chief executive of Neuros .
“ But at the same time , that can be more rope to hang yourself with . ”
Another worry is that by sharing plans for future products online , along with schematics and software , firms may jeopardise sales of existing products , says Mr Kruberg .
And even if open - source enthusiasts like your product , are they representative of the wider public ?
Open devices “ tend to be geared more toward technology - oriented people , with products you might not see at Best Buy , ” notes Lance Lavery , a systems administrator and self - proclaimed “ uber - geek ” who owns a Chumby .
As James Staten , an analyst at Forrester Research puts it : “ Consumers do n't tinker . ”
So open - source hardware could turn out to be an obscure niche .
But Dr von Hippel disagrees .
Even those who do not tinker can benefit from the work of those who do , just as ordinary consumers can still use Firefox without having to know anything about programming .
Mainstream consumers will benefit from open hardware , he says , “ by having a wider choice . ”
The analogy with software is informative in another way , too .
Open - source software has resulted in new products such as Linux and Firefox , but it has also been embraced by many big names in the computer industry , such as IBM , Sun and Hewlett - Packard .
Even Microsoft , the company that has been most vociferous in its opposition to the open - source model , has lately conceded that in some situations , at least , it has merit .
All of which suggests that open - source hardware will really start to make a difference when big hardware makers and consumer - electronics firms begin to embrace the idea .
“ It 's a new day for consumer electronics , ” says Chumby 's Mr Tomlin .
“ The community makes suggestions and shares hacks .
And we do n't try to sue our innovators .
We make heroes of them . ”

The 2008 presidential race must be an incredibly welcome development for President Bush and his White House .
That ’s because the American body politic can only really focus on one thing at a time , and so there ’s little time for anything else aside from the madcap antics of of Gilligan , the Skipper , the Millionaire and his wife , the Movie Star , the Professor and Mary Ann …and the rest .
Some liberal blogs and right - wing talk radio are lined up in circular firing squads , and the op - ed columnists have trained their fire on Hillary ’s lonely teardrops or Barack ’s Church of the Poison Mind .
While no one was looking , the economy nosedived , gas prices have soared , the war in Iraq is as unpopular as ever and Osama bin Laden is still on the loose .
And so while none of us were paying attention , our 43rd president just hit a major milestone .
George W. Bush is now the most unpopular president in recorded American history .
( h/t Atrios )
Worse than Richard Nixon in the days before he resigned in disgrace during Watergate , worse than Jimmy Carter during the Iran hostage crisis , much worse than Bill Clinton when he was impeached .
Just as Roger Bannister raced through what once seemed the unreachable 4 - minute mile , Bush has burst through a barrier once also thought impossible , below the 20 - percent mark .
Check this out :
George W. Bush ’s overall job approval rating has dropped to a new low in American Research Group polling as 78 % of Americans say that the national economy is getting worse according to the latest survey from the American Research Group .
Among all Americans , 19 % approve of the way Bush is handling his job as president and 77 % disapprove .
When it comes to Bush ’s handling of the economy , 14 % approve and 79 % disapprove .
Among Americans registered to vote , 18 % approve of the way Bush is handling his job as president and 78 % disapprove .
That is just mind - blowing .
How does it compare to other presidents ?
There ’s no comparison .
Nixon , as he was hounded out of office in August 1974 , never dipped below the mid-20s .
Here ’s a pretty good compilation of poll numbers from Roper .
To summarize the highlights :
Clinton low : 36 percent , May 1993 ( early missteps like Zoe Baird )
George H.W. Bush low : 29 percent , August 1992 ( recession )
Reagan low : 35 percent , January 1983 ( recession )
Carter low : 28 percent , July 1979 ( high gas prices )
Ford low : 37 percent , January 1975 ( economy , Nixon pardon )
Nixon low : 23 percent , January 1974 ( Watergate )
Johnson low : 35 percent , August 1968 ( Vietnam )
Lowest ever ?
That would be Harry Truman during the Korean War , in February 1952 , at 22 percent .
And so now George W. Bush has shattered a record that has stood for 55 long years , and there ’s not any one reason .
It ’s everything , although I suspect that liberals would more likely say Iraq and torture , conservatives would say immigration and runaway spending , and everyone would now say the economy .
It takes more than unpopularity to become the worst president ever , but this may be the straw that broke the camel ’s back on that front .
It should remind us all what the 2008 election is all about , and it ’s not about Hillary ’s wardrobe or an off - the - cuff remark or who is the Second Coming of Ronald Reagan .
It ’s only about who can undo the damage of the last eight years .
It ’s amazing so many people wanted such a difficult task .

Washington , D.C. - Privacy rights and the rule of law took a serious blow today when the House of Representatives passed blanket retroactive immunity for phone companies that participated in the president 's warrantless surveillance program .
The FISA Amendments Act , H.R. 6304 , which House Leadership rushed to the floor today after its introduction yesterday , passed by a vote of 293 to 129 .
The Senate is expected to vote on the bill next week .
The bill was touted as a bipartisan " compromise " on the issues of electronic surveillance and immunity .
But in fact it requires dismissal of lawsuits against companies like AT&T that participated in the program as long as the companies received a piece of paper from the government indicating that the surveillance had been authorized by the president and was determined to be lawful .
" Immunity for telecom giants that secretly assisted in the NSA 's warrantless surveillance undermines the rule of law and the privacy of every American , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" Congress should let the courts do their job instead of helping the administration and the phone companies avoid accountability for a half decade of illegal domestic spying .
If this legislation passes the Senate and is signed into law , the American people will have lost their last best chance to discover the true scope of the president 's wiretapping program and to determine whether or not the law was broken . "
" We are deeply disappointed that the House Leadership , which was so courageous in its previous opposition to telecom immunity , caved to the Administration 's fear - mongering and put this seriously flawed legislation on the floor for a vote , " said Bankston .
" We look to leaders in the Senate who value the rule of law to stand up and strongly oppose this blanket immunity for telecom lawbreakers , and in particular urge Senator Barack Obama to lead his party in rejecting this false compromise . "
EFF is representing the plaintiffs in Hepting v. AT&T , a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of the millions of AT&T customers whose private domestic communications and communications records were illegally handed over to the National Security Agency ( NSA ) .
EFF has been appointed co-coordinating counsel for all 47 of the outstanding lawsuits concerning the government 's warrantless surveillance program .

While I ’d been following Fallout - but - in - fallout - of - Roman - Empire indie-RPG Age of Decadence ’s development at a comfortable distance , its world collided with Rock Paper Shotgun when Walker posted a little combat teaser the team behind this indie-RPG had released .
The thread exploded with readers rejecting its turn - based formality , and then there was a counter - reaction to that .
It basically turned into a debate about what the RPG should be in the modern age , and so when outspoken Lead Designer Vince D Weller started chatting behind the scenes , we decided an interview may be a worthwhile thing .
The results are a slowburn towards something incendiary .
Vince is angry at many things , from the industry to the modern RPG , from the expectations of audiences to… many things .
In fact , it ’s somewhat appropriate for a man who steadfastedly believes in multiple - possibilities in the role - playing game , that there ’s multiple targets for his ire .
In fact , there ’s a good chance that Vince is angry with you , specifically , but his J’accuse ranges further than that .
Fireworks are lit beneath the cut .
RPS : Big one first – why ?
Deciding to throw yourself into an indie - game requires a certain sort of mind .
Trying to make an enormous multi- pathed RPG from pretty - much scratch … well , that ’s another .
There ’s not many things as demanding , in terms of content you have to make , game in the world .
Why you doing it ?
Vince D. Weller : A long time ago I reluctantly installed my first RPG and the concept instantly hooked me up .
Ever since then I was an avid and passionate RPG fan .
The problem with being a passionate fan of a dying genre is that waiting periods between games worth playing become longer and longer , creating a lot more free time than a gamer knows what to do with .
Some people start drinking , I decided to amuse myself shaping some ideas I ’ve had into a game .
In the best role - playing traditions a few similarly minded folks had noticed my efforts and joined me on my quest , forming a party and Iron Tower Studio .
So , why are we doing it ?
For the same reason a writer decides to share a story with the world and an artist picks up a brush and starts painting a naked woman .
As for “ why RPGs ? ” , it ’s a genre we like , understand ( read as “ analyzed to death ” ) , and care about the most .
RPS : Following from that , care to tell us a bit about your basic background .
Who are you ?
Who is the team ?
How did you get together ?
Vince : I use the name Vince , because my contract does n’t allow me to manage other businesses openly .
Besides , my colleagues would n’t understand it …
I ’m a Vice President , Sales & Marketing of a well - known Canadian company .
I ’m 37 years old and I clearly failed at that growing up thing that everyone ’s raving about .
Nick ’s our programmer .
He ’s about to graduate from a university ( Computer Science and Math ) .
He wrote an isometric 2D engine as his first year project , won several math Olympiads ( he thinks that math is fun ) , and scored a full scholarship .
Nick ’s godlike programming powahz and dedication made a lot of things I could only dream of possible .
Oscar is the artist .
His job is to make the game look pretty .
Oscar is mostly known for his work with Oblivion mods , including the most popular Oblivion Overhaul mod , and his Civ 4 mods .
Firaxis even used Oscar ’s work in the Civ 4 expansion , which scored higher on his “ personal achievements ” chart than his MBA degree .
The rest of the team includes a modeler , an animator , and a professional composer who did some work for several Russian games .
RPS : That ’s an interesting position – is it a bit like living a secret life ?
By day , mild - mannered VP of Sales & Marketting .
By Night … Vince , all powerful Indie RPG designer ?
Is it difficult to keep the two parts fully demarcated in your head ?
Vince :
No different than having any other hobby .
I know people who put a lot more effort into playing golf or drinking every day .
RPS : Well , RPS put a lot of effort into drinking every day .
Er …. well , linking back to the first question , when observing your actions , part of me thinks you ’re driven by a sense of necessity .
No - one else is making the game you want to play , so we may as well go and bloody well do it yourselves .
Is that a right impression ?
Vince : Not really .
There is a huge difference between making games and playing them .
It ’s not like I can finish the game , install it , and go “ Finally !
A game I want to play ! ” .
We are making it because we believe we have some good ideas that are worth sharing with people .
Considering the interest the game has generated worldwide – from many publishing offers to Future France distributing our video on their magazines ’ cover CD , I ’d say that our ideas were met with interest .
RPS : That ’s not quite what I meant .
I mean , clearly , doing a game and playing one is a different thing .
But … well , a comparison .
Bands form making music they ’d like to hear in the world , despite the fact they can never appreciate their band like they could if they were listeners … they feel the need to make their music come into existence , because there SHOULD be music like theirs in the world .
I was wondering if it was at all like that for you guys .
That there should be a game like yours , that there is n’t enough annoys the hell out of you , so you have to do it your bloody selves .
Does that make sense ?
Vince : I humbly disagree , but you get a point for persistence .
Even if everyone was making games like AoD , we would have still tried to make one and hope that it would stand out .
Not because there should be a game like this , but because we really like to share our ideas with the gaming world .
I have no idea how it works with music bands , so I ’ll take your word for it .
RPS : Okay – Influences then .
What influenced your thinking about the game – and I mean , in specifics rather than generalities .
In what ways did other games open your eyes , make you realise this is what games could be and why were they wonderful ?
Vince : Fallout – a masterpiece that redefined role - playing and set a new standard .
Planescape – reading in a game has NEVER been so much fun , and according to Avellone , never will be .
Darklands – it ’s easier to list what you could n’t do in that game than what you could do .
It saddens me that a game of that caliber wo n’t be made again , but hey , who needs gameplay when you can look at shiny next - generation graphics ?
m i rite ?
XCOM – The king of turn - based gameplay .
If you have n’t played it , stop reading this crap and go play it right now .
And finally , Prelude to Darkness , a brilliant indie game that nobody played :
Prelude to Darkness featured an original , very detailed setting , great TB combat system , multi-solution quests , branching main quest , and many innovative design elements .
That was the game that inspired me the most .
It has shown me that indie projects can easily compete with and even beat “ commercial ” games in the gameplay and design departments .
RPS : Of the list , Fallout was the one I was sure of .
Not just because of the game ’s mechanics , but because what the setting brings to mind is the post - apocalypse model applied to the fantasy / medieval RPG .
That is , a society that is collapsing , and has been for some time – and the player is thrown into it .
Is that the impression you were aiming at ?
Why was this interesting to you ?
Vince : Yes , I ’m a Fallout fan .
* waves at Bethesda *
As for the other questions , yes , that is the impression we were aiming at .
Why is it interesting to us ?
It adds another layer to the story and overall atmosphere .
It makes a setting more alive as the past in post - apocalyptic games is more than a dry background .
It gains shape and become an ever - present ghost of what once was .
Besides , when societies collapse , it strips people from artificial restrictions of civilization and reverts them to their natural state , which is always fun to explore .
RPS : What ’s the problems with the modern RPG ?
How does Age of Decadence deal with it ?
Vince :
The problem is simple .
Nobody is interested in making dialogue - heavy , turn - based RPGs loaded with meaningful choices and multiple paths .
A game like Diablo will always sell more than a game like Planescape : Torment , and games like Torment are much harder to make .
So , no publisher is interested in making games like Torment that may or may not sell enough to break even when you can make guaranteed hits like Diablo or Oblivion .
That creates a niche – a market too small for big companies to care about , but big enough for indie developers to play at .
Since we can’t match the multi-million budget visuals , we go back to the roots – we focus on gameplay .
RPS : I ’ll agree that there ’s an unserved demographic there , and while probably not enough to support a megabudget game , it ’s enough to support a game .
This is as true in the turn - based expansive RPG as it is in any of the other niches which are no longer properly provided by the mainstream ( wargames , most flight sims , etc ) .
Do you think we ’re going to see more people exploring the space you are ?
How do you see the future of the indie- RPG ?
How would you like it to be ?
Vince : I see the indie industry exploding and successfully competing with the “ commercial ” games .
If we are lucky , maybe it will even bring some long overdue changes .
The publishing system must be changed if we want to see original designs and fresh , risky by definition , ideas .
Right now it reminds me of a loan - shark operation .
You are a fan of Looking Glass Studio , are n’t you , Kieron ?
How are they doing , I wonder ?
Anyway , the foundation for the indy industry is there : good tools , affordable engines , affordable high - speed internet , powerful digital download delivery methods , etc .
Now we need more people willing to go the distance .
Spiderweb Software has been making indie RPGs for years .
The graphics can blind 75 % of your audience – we do n’t want that , do we ?
– so do n’t post any screens .
Mount & Blade features the best mounted combat to - date and was made by two people .
Escape Velocity Nova , a space trader game , had 6 main story arcs .
Six .
Main .
Story .
Arcs .
Let ’s stop for a second and think about this concept .
Silently .
Then we have the aforementioned Prelude to Darkness , Fate , Depths of Peril , Eschalon : Book 1 , etc .
More games are in development – The Broken Hourglass and Purgatorio are good examples .
The indie scene is pretty much alive and kicking , and all signs point to increased growth .
RPS : Okay – the thing which caused that mass - pile in the previous RPS thread was the turn based combat , specifically how it looked .
I think there ’s a problem in that it becomes more noticeably odd the more graphics effort a developer makes .
The videos you ’ve been releasing demonstrating the combat have that sense of distance due to sitting back and watching the attacks bounce between character to character – but if you treat them as immobile pieces ( like , say , in a hex based game ) it does n’t phase the gamer .
Is this a fair analysis ?
Or am I full of it ?
If so , why ?
Vince : Have you played Silent Storm ?
Temple of Elemental Evil ?
Both games featured excellent turn - based combat and great graphics .
Detailed 3D models and animations did n’t create any “ odd ” feelings but made gameplay more enjoyable , as one would expect .
Your comment implies that you ’re looking at TB from the “ it does n’t look real ” point of view and that ’s where you ’re mistaken .
RPG combat systems , turn - based or real - time , is no more realistic than hit points ( do you really think that someone could recover from a two - handed axe blow and continue fighting like nothing happened ? ) , carrying enough junk to fill a warehouse , spells memorization , rechargeable mana , etc .
Frozen in time characters patiently taking blows and waiting for their turns are no more odd or weird than RT ’s single characters fighting thousands of enemies and destroying entire armies .
These mechanics are n’t about realism , they are about fun .
Now , fun is a very subjective concept .
Some people think that playing chess is fun .
Some people think that playing in traffic is fun .
Go figure .
So , if tactical chess - like combat filled with “ what happens if I do A vs what happens if I do B vs. … ” decisions sounds like fun to you , then you wo n’t find TB odd or slow .
If you prefer non -stop , mindless by definition , action requiring nothing but manual dexterity and fast reaction , then RT is your friend .
Most people see turns as a some kind of relic from the days long gone , a throwback to the old days when electricity was n’t invented yet and computers were powered by candle light .
Some morons even compare turns to a pause , but we shall blame the education system for that .
The main difference between turns and pauses , so brilliantly illustrated by XCOM , is that when your turn is over , someone else ’s turn starts , and if you did n’t prepare for that , well , mostly likely you are dead and it ’s “ game over ” for you .
In RT it ’s perfectly acceptable to run toward a door , open it , hit pause , review the situation , pick targets and start kicking ass in an unbelievable but visually pleasing fashion .
In XCOM if you open a door when your turn ends , and a hostile character is in the room , you are dead .
What you may see as a flaw is actually a quick test of your tactics employed during your turn .
If you fail , your character dies .
You need to carefully plan your actions and then you ’ll have a chance to beat games like XCOM or Jagged Alliance .
Only a chance .
I played XCOM for 6 months on my first playthrough .
I beat Heavenly Sword in a few days .
It ’s an amazing looking game , but it does n’t require much brainpower .
If you can hold a controller , you can play and beat the game .
See the difference ?
RPS : Regarding your thorough take on turn based … well , I take your points ( and generally agree ) but that ’s not quite what I was really chasing after .
I tend to think most real - time combat in an RPGs can trigger a disconnect as much as a turn - based one – but that ’s a slightly different issue .
What I was trying to draw a line between is the actual feedback on the actions you ’ve ordered – that an animated character taking turns swiping at each other can create that disconnect more than two pieces with no animation just standing by each other , with the game information of attacks being offered in a more symbolic fashion .
I ’m trying to talk about why some people had that odd response to the video you released , if that makes sense .
Do you think the audience just need re-educating of what games can be ?
Explaining that this system offers so much more to them than a more kinetic presentation would allow ?
Vince :
Let me ask you one of them rhetorical questions .
Is turn - based for everyone ?
No .
Will chess appeal to anyone ?
No. Casual players prefer to load a game , hit a few buttons and watch their characters kick some ass .
They do n’t want to play games like XCOM where a single mission can easily take a few hours .
Yes , a few hours to kill 20 aliens .
Should we be really surprised that in an age of weapons with DPS stats – that ’s damage per SECOND – and avg expected kills of 10 - 15 monsters per minute , spending 2 hours to kill twenty aliens does n’t sound like fun to some people ?
As for the comments in that “ let ’s laugh at turn - based combat together ” article , look at what some guy named Kieron said – “ I was fine with the turn - based combat , in terms of it being an indie - game and all … ” .
See , he was fine with TB combat because it ’s an indie game , but if it was n’t an indie game he probably would have written an angry letter to his congressman or maybe even shot someone .
Imagine that .
And yes , I understood what you were chasing after , but I guess I failed to explain my point properly .
Let me try again using the most important discovery and technological breakthrough of the century – bullet time .
Remember Matrix ?
The first scene , where that cop points the gun at Trinity and says “ English , motherfucker !
Do you speak it ? ” , and Trinity says “ my turn lolz ” , slowly jumps into the air , hangs there for a few seconds , while the cop blinks , and then kicks him ?
Tell me with a straight face that when that happened you did n’t stare at the screen with an open mouth but said “ I call bullshit !
That shit is clearly turn - based and it just done ruined my suspension of disbelief ! ”
Tell me that , and being a gentleman , I ’ll admit that you have a point .
Now , let ’s go back to the responses to that article and take a look at the points your audience made :
“ I ’d rather puke a lung , to be honest .
It would probably be more fun . ”
“ I am a discerning gamer of the modern age .
I demand heads that smush like rotten melons , over then top rag doll death animations and screams recorded live from Nike sweatshops . ”
“ They took their combat model from Bookworm Adventure .
Snore ! ” “ This is for those times when you want to sit back in your chair and only click the mouse once every 10 minutes . ”
“ Taking turns fighting may be something “ classic ” and “ niche ” audience , but it ’s “ niche ” for a reason , people are looking to new things , and while rolling dice worked for pen and paper , we do n’t have to do that anymore and for most people , it ’s just not all that fun .
Real time is just more immersive for most that want to deal with something that feels more like a real world , not a jumble of numbers and calculations on screen , the illusion is maintained with it off screen , happening in real time while people move and fire freely aiming where they want , when they want , how they want . ”
“ Wow , I will never play a game like that , ever .
I loathe turn - based games , which is the main reason why I refuse to play any Final Fantasy game .
It takes me straight out of the immersion of a game when everyone lines up and takes TURNS swiping at each other .
Give me something that involves my skill .
I absolutely hate it when my hit chance relies on some random dice roll .
That is pure and total BS . ”
When you have time , Kieron , how about writing an article explaining the difference between RPGs and shooters to your audience ?
Or maybe an article mentioning that the first computer games were real - time , not turn - based , and disputing the popular opinion that RT is more advanced than TB ?
I mean , it ’s nice that your site tries to attract morons and makes them feel at home , but should n’t you be educating them too ?
It would n’t take much to double their IQs , so if you want , I can give you a hand there .
RPS : Okay –
Some of your answers seem genuinely angry , or at least frustrated .
Who are you most angry at ?
Are you worried about alienating people who would be interested in your game by showing that , or do you think that your real audience at the people who would empathise and completely understand it ?
Or do you just not care either way , and would rather speak your mind ?
Vince : I ’m a big fan of the “ honest and blunt ” approach .
An internet reader has a right to visit a game site and read “ Did Oblivion really suck or what ? ” or “ Molyneux has gotta be on drugs ! ” , do n’t you think ?
Instead every journalist pretends that Oblivion was a 10/10 brilliant masterpiece , that Molyneux is n’t a lying old kook , and that Dungeon Siege was n’t a screensaver .
Then Chris Taylor says that he ’s making Space Siege even simpler and everyone nods in agreement :
Right on , man !
It ’s about time someone makes a game for the amputees .
BRA -VO !
And no , I do n’t really care who ’d think what and how my comments would affect sales .
I ’m making this game on a bold assumption that there are some people out there who are interested in complex games that are n’t made for retards .
Btw , did I mention that I was the editor of RPG Codex for 4 years ?
Perhaps you ’ve read my Oblivion review and other critically acclaimed articles / interviews ?
Now you probably understand where I ’m coming from a bit better .
Overall , I ’ve witnessed the trend from simple graphics - amazing gameplay to amazing graphics - simple gameplay .
Ca n’t say I ’m too happy about it .
Take X - COM for example :
1994 : It took 7 people to make X - COM : UFO Defense .
Two guys who did both design and programming , 2 artists , 2 music / sound guys and a project manager .
1996 : It took over 30 people to make a “ more of the same ” sequel .
Now we have 4 assistant producers , 12 artists , 6 level designers , etc .
1997 , XCOM : Apocalypse , a game that kinda sucked .
Over 50 people team .
5 sound guys .
21 artists .
An army of level designers .
We even have a brand manager now .
Good times are about to roll .
2001 : X - COM : Enforcer or Say Goodbye to the Series .
Great job managing the brand , assholes .
Do you see my point ?
I mean , what are the odds of seeing games of X - COM or Darklands caliber again ?
Let ’s end the interview with your own thoughts about the state of the gaming industry .
* passes the microphone to Kieron and opens a bag of popcorn …
RPS : From the mainstream industry as is ?
Not a chance in hell , unless the industry crashes in flames and we begat a new mainstream on a completely different basis .
In terms of an indie dev ?
Hell , yeah .
As you point out , it took 7 people to make X - COM – and I was following the Gollops all the way through the eighties , and love what they did with even fewer people ( I do n’t really have a favourite game of all time – I ’m against it in principle – but if I ’m asked , I normally mention the Gollop ’s Chaos ) .
There ’s
indie teams working with that number of people .
Why ca n’t they produce something similarly brilliant ?
They ’re not any less talented .
They require an infrastructure – which is building – and an attitude change in gamers – which will follow when there ’s games that walk it like they talk it .
( I ’ll stress that I ’m taking “ Caliber ” to be a literal case of “ Sharing the same qualities that made UFO and Darklands great ” .
I think the mainstream industry has had successes in completely different areas .
I also disagree that those reasons are as easily dismissed as shallow as you do – but I am and always have been a generalist in my interests in games , including just about everything . )
In really short :
Will there ever be a game of X - com or Darklands caliber again ?
That ball ’s in your court .
Play it .
Thanks for your time .
Age of Decadence will be released when it ’s done .
That ’ll probably be this Fall .

Turley is too soft on 'em .
But the fun does n't stop there !
Apparently John
Yoo was a very busy boy in those first months of the Administration .
Yoo , who put his name on that infamous lil ' ' torture memo ' , also justified suspension of the 4th Amendment --- the one that guarantees all Americans against " unreasonable search and seizure " :
The October 2001 memo was written at the request of the White House by John Yoo , then the deputy assistant attorney general , and addressed to Alberto Gonzales , the White House counsel at the time .
The administration had asked the department for an opinion on the legality of potential responses to terrorist activity .
But not just any " terrorist activity " , but specifically domestice terrorist activity :
The 37 - page memo is classified and has not been released .
Its existence was disclosed Tuesday in a footnote of a separate secret memo , dated March 14 , 2003 , released by the Pentagon in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union .
" Our office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations , " the footnote states , referring to a document titled " Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States .
Exactly what domestic military action was covered by the October memo is unclear .
But federal documents indicate that the memo relates to the National Security Agency 's Terrorist Surveillance Program , or TSP .
[ all emphasis added ]
Anyone care to hazard a guess as to what " domestic military action " might encompass ?
Luckily , Justice Dept. spokesman Brian Roehrkasse ( who was soooo forthcoming during the U.S. Attorney Purge Scandal ) responded by telling everybody , " We disagree with the proposition that the Fourth Amendment as no application to domestic military operations . "
Whether or not that means the DoJ has truly overturned the memo is not explicitly stated ; all Roehrkasse said was that they disagree .
In the double - speak of the Bush Admin , that does n't mean that they wo n't do it anyway .
Plus ,
Yoo had help in drafting these , um , unorthodox interpretations of the Constitution .
Gee , wonder where all those strict " Constitutional constructionists " are ... they 're awfully quiet these days ....

When , oh when will it be time to start charging those in the bush / cheney administration with war crimes ?
How many laws must they break before someone has the courage to do what should have been done some years ago ?
How many more hundreds of thousands of innocent Muslims must die to slake the blood lust of bush and those in his administration who seem to desire only to kill ?

Since May 2006 through March 2008 there have been 1,700 US & UK Military Fatalities ( and tens of thousands Iraqis )
Since November 2006 through March 2008 there have been 1,205 US & UK Military Fatalities ( and tens of thousand Iraqis ) Nancy Pelosi took impeachment off the table in May 2006 .
Nancy Pelosi became Speaker of the House on November 16 , 2006 .

I guess this is the MSM version of ' real time ' .
And it is probably caused by too much driving while looking out the rear view mirror , and not enough time driving while looking out the windshield .
What do you call it when you are happy that the press is only years behind ... when what the blogs call ' olds ' is what the MSM calls ' news ' ?
I propose that the MSM from this day forward be called ' revisionist historians ' instead of ' journalists ' .
They seem to have ' history ' and ' breaking news ' confused .
And it has been that way ' forever ' .
All rightie then , blog real time is ' putting those who commit torture in jail on the same day they do it in front of witnesses ' .
They will be held there pending trial and sentencing .
At which time they will not be pardoned .
I am not soft on violent crime like the neoCons are .

Does anyone have suggestions on how to articulate a concise policy solution to this , or if there has already been a solution proposed in Congress or elsewhere ?
By " this " , I mean all of the legal slippage and double - speak to justify torture by Yoo and the other minions .
You know , besides vague calls for " ending torture " or justified , but non-policy related calls for impeachment or prosecution or firings , etc .
In short , I 'm looking for a pedagogical and organizing tool .
Thanks in advance for your thoughts / advice .

... Robert " Bruce " McAlpine said on 4/4/2008 @ 3:26 am PT ...
Torture has long been prohibited by international law , including the Geneva Conventions and their common article 3 .
This total ban was reinforced in 1984 with the adoption of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , which criminalized torture and complicity in torture .
. . . The 1984 Convention , which is binding on 145 countries , including the United States , defines torture as " any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted on a person . "
The abuse , rising to the level of torture , of those captured and detained in the war on terror is a defining feature of the presidency of George W. Bush .
Its military beginnings , however , lie not in Abu Ghraib , as is commonly thought , or in the “ rendition ” of prisoners to other countries for questioning , but in the treatment of the very first prisoners at Guantanamo .
Starting in late 2002 a detainee bearing the number 063 was tortured over a period of more than seven weeks .
In his story lies the answer to a crucial question :
How was the decision made to let the U.S. military start using coercive interrogations at Guantanamo ?
The Bush administration has always taken refuge behind a “ trickle up ” explanation : that is , the decision was generated by military commanders and interrogators on the ground .
This explanation is false .
The origins lie in actions taken at the very highest levels of the administration - by some of the most senior personal advisers to the president , the vice president , and the secretary of defense .
At the heart of the matter stand several political appointees - lawyers - who , it can be argued , broke their ethical codes of conduct and took themselves into a zone of international criminality , where formal investigation is now a very real option .
-- The Green Light , by Phillippe Sands , May 2008 Vanity Fair
An open letter and call to action to my fellow citizens , As a citizen of the U.S.A. and a member of humanity , I urge you to beseech your elected representatives and officials to fully investigate the American governments use of torture , the destruction of related evidence and the cover - up of said activities regardless of where they lead and to bring such individuals to justice by holding open hearings and preparing full and complete documentation .
Our Republic is meant to be transparent and its officials answerable to the people .
Unfortunately to date , secrecy , cover - up , inaction , double - speak and now destruction of evidence have been the only visible and measurable results .
I do not approve of torture , period .
It is an uncivilized , vile and despicable crime against humanity .
I therefore will not stand idly by while my elected officials refuse to decide and act against an overreaching executive branch and the legislative and judicial branches that enable it .
I refuse to be an accessory to crimes against humanity and I will not pay any taxes while the United States of America ’s governmental institutions stand idly by and allow it to happen .
Indecision is a decision .
Inaction is an action .
Since my elected officials have to this point refused to decide and act on these crimes against humanity , they compel me , a sovereign individual , citizen of this great republic and member of humanity to make decisions and take actions .
These actions include civil disobedience and a campaign of non-cooperation by not paying taxes of which in part are being used to fund torture and to speak out against my government and its officials .
Additional activities include peaceful public demonstrations , speeches and email campaigns , all in the hope that they will make the moral decision to take action on these crimes against humanity .
I watched an amazing movie entitled , “ The Great Debaters . ”
The themes and content of the movie are so timely and relevant to our Republics current ongoing struggle that I would like to share a portion of it here .
Civil disobedience and violence can both be used morally in the fight for justice and may require the greatest sacrifice , one ’s life .
Gandhi believed we should act with love and respect toward one ’s opponents and enemies and that lawbreakers must accept the legal consequences of their actions .
Henry David
Thoreau believed that any man more right than his neighbor constitutes a majority of one .
However , the majority does not decide what is right or wrong , instead it is one ’s conscience .
A citizen should never kneel down and surrender their conscience to a majority simple because they are the majority .
Because nothing that erodes the rule of law can be moral , no matter what name you give it .
St. Augustine said that an unjust law is no law at all .
This means that the sovereign individuals and citizens of this great country have an individual responsibility to resist the unjust laws and illegal activities of the majority with violence or civil disobedience ; you should pray that they choose the latter .
My peace be with you , Robert “ Bruce ” McAlpine

Gimme a break !
It is n't that Congress does n't want to deal with it .
The problem is that THEY VOTED FOR IT .

If they had n't wanted to deal with it , they would n't have voted for it in the first place .
Case closed .

And while we discuss and debate and are appalled , people are being tortured in our name --- even as I type .
Some are dying from it .
With all the reports of attempted suicides , are they the lucky ones ?

Yeah , leave 'em laughing when you go , Keith .
That way the public can more easily forget about it .
Such an important topic deserved a more serious ending comment than Keith 's little jokes .

That 's a really good point , Lora .
We 're all so used to snarking about everything in our frustration that it even slips into one of the only places we can get real news on tv .

The dems like Ike Skelton are too busy helping Bush drum up his war with Iran .
Mean while over there another female KBR employee is reporting a particularly brutal rape .

The main point is they like to torture .
It 's Yoo 's and Gonzalez 's , Bush 's , and Cheney 's raison d'etre .
It would n't happen if they did n't take pleasure in it .
Then the next point is they need to try to torture people into admitting they 're terrorists or Al Queda and of course under torture someone could say anything to stop the torture .
They 're manufacturing enemy combattants who would n't normally exist .
OK Keith put all that on your show .

The " Constitutional constructionists " and gun-nuts are kept in a state of suspended animation during Republican administrations .
Look for them to be revived the moment real people start to gain momentum .
Great thread with lots of important information !
Thanks !

Alan :
In my next life , I 'm going to have broadband and be able to enjoy ALL of your great contributions , but if you never did anything other then that clip with Rove , you would have succeeded magnificently .
Olbermann should have played the whole thing .

# 11 Lora I think Keith made a good point about the show 24 being propaganda that supports torture .
It 's kind of how shows like NYPD Blue were propaganda for police brutality .
The ends do not justify the means .
It has been shown that torture does n't even work , that people subjected to it , unless they are Morpheus in The Matrix , are gonna eventually say what they feel is necessary to stop the pain .
Imho , Keith was on target with his last comment .

Coming Soon to Gmail : Automatic Vacation Responses and More
Caleb Eggensperger tells us there will be two new features coming to Google ’s Gmail soon ( how soon , nobody knows – usually these features are rolled out slowly , and can take anything from weeks to months to show up for everyone ) :
The first feature has already been mentioned here because it was found by translating future Gmail interface texts ; it ’s Gmail Contact Groups .
This is nothing new in the world of email and a feature most other email clients have as well ( at least desktop clients ) .
Instead of emailing a single person , you can group several addresses into one .

The second feature are automatic vacation responses .
That means whenever you ’re away from your computer , you can set up an auto - reply to inform those who email you that you ’re gone at the moment .
( While Google says that they will not send this auto - response to messages flagged as spam , it ’s also true they do n’t correctly identify all messages as spam .
This in return might “ validate ” your email to some spammers . )
