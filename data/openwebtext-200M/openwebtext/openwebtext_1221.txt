Brushing your teeth before you eat breakfast can help to prevent the dental erosion that can wear away your teeth .
A recent survey by the Foundation found that over three - quarters of people ( 81 % ) were unaware that brushing their teeth after eating acidic food and drink can damage their teeth permanently .
Acidic foods and drinks , such as oranges , grapefruit and fruit juices that are often eaten at breakfast time , soften the enamel on your teeth .
Brushing immediately afterward wears the enamel away , and can cause dental erosion , which may lead to pain and extreme sensitivity in the teeth , and also lead to cosmetic problems .
The saliva in your mouth neutralises the acidity and restores its natural balance .
However research has shown that this can take up to an hour .
Over time , regular consumption of acidic food and drink throughout the day can lead to the loss of the surface of your teeth .
To avoid dental erosion , the Foundation encourages people to :
brush teeth before breakfast if they have fruit or fruit juice , or
wait one hour after eating or drinking anything acidic before brushing

use a straw when drinking acidic drinks to reduce contact with teeth
drink water and milk between meals in preference to juice and fizzy drinks
chew sugar - free gum - this will produce more saliva to help cancel out acid in your mouth
finish a meal with cheese or milk to help neutralise any acids
British Dental Health Foundation Chief Executive Dr Nigel Carter said , " Drinks such as fruit juice and fizzy mineral waters are generally considered to be good for your health .
However , they can all be bad for your teeth if they 're consumed frequently throughout the day and you do n't follow a suitable oral care routine . "

This does not seem like a great excuse .
Would n’t you rather admit it was a plan than say you had so little self - control that hearing the president make a frequently stated claim about a much - debated bill caused you to create a spectacle on national TV ?
Obviously , this is not a guy you want to let in the room if Hugo Chávez ever comes to town .
Perhaps Wilson is just given to mood swings .
He seemed somewhere between mild - mannered and zombielike in a follow - up video , in which he stared into the camera and promised not to be muzzled if people would send him contributions .
“ Health care is a matter of life and death for so many , ” he intoned .
“ I choose life with health insurance reform . ”
Not all that catchy , but who knows what works these days ?
The Republicans are pointing out that Democrats made unfriendly noises during George W. Bush ’s 2005 State of the Union address .
This is true , although the difference between that and “ You lie ! ” is about the same as the difference between calling an opponent wrong and accusing him of “ hatred of America , ” as Wilson did in a TV debate with a congressman opposed to the Iraq war .
After a certain amount of arm - twisting by Republican leaders , Wilson did apologize for his behavior .
Now we are going to move on to arguing about the apology .
The Democrats are demanding that Wilson apologize all over again , on the floor of the House , or face the wrath of their official disapproval .
Meanwhile , just to make sure nobody else ever goes off the rails like this again , the Senate Finance Committee is changing its version of the health care bill from one that does not provide benefits to illegal immigrants to one that absolutely , positively , for sure does not provide benefits to illegal immigrants .
Over at the Taxpayers March , people wanted the Republicans to apologize for asking Wilson to apologize .
They seemed to be taking a cue from Rush Limbaugh , who said he was “ ecstatic ” when Wilson yelled at the president , since he himself had been shrieking “ liar ” at his TV throughout the speech .
Tea Party Patriots , do you really want your members of Congress doing something just because Rush Limbaugh does it ?
The next thing you know , they ’ll be abusing prescription drugs and comparing the Abu Ghraib tortures to a fraternity initiation .
Interestingly , very few of Wilson ’s defenders have noted that in the British Parliament , members shout insults all the time .
They are probably loath to unfavorably compare Congress with a legislative body that supports inhumane and murderous practices like national health care .

During the event , Sigaty discussed the new Battle .
net system that will exist from the moment StarCraft II is installed on your machine .
The non-linear gameplay of the single - player campaign , along with the details of the personal customization for the player 's profiles were reiterated on as well .
He also replayed the footage presented by Dustin Browder at BlizzCon of the custom scenarios that the Galaxy Editor can create and the extent of the tool 's abilities .
However , he turned to the Q&A session and after talking about a potential first - half 2010 release date , he said that the beta will be seen only next year as well .
In retrospective , Blizzard opened the beta opt-ins on May 6th , 2009 and promised a summer release .
The summer release never came about and it made people believe that it would arrive around BlizzCon 2009 .
BlizzCon came and went and everyone was left in the dark .
Now , we are told that the beta will actually begin in 2010 .
Assuming that Blizzard is able to hold to their word this time around , we can expect to see the beta only a few months before the actual release of the game .
In 2008 , the Wrath of the Lich King beta began only about three months before the game was actually released .
If Blizzard holds to their schedule that has been used with their World of Warcraft franchise , we can expect to see the same results with StarCraft II .
WASHINGTON  As President Obama vows to “ finish the job ” in Afghanistan by sending more troops , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has completed a detailed look back at a crucial failure early in the battle against Al Qaeda : the escape of Osama bin Laden from American forces in the Afghan mountains of Tora Bora in December 2001 .
“ Removing the Al Qaeda leader from the battlefield eight years ago would not have eliminated the worldwide extremist threat , ” the committee ’s report concludes .
“ But the decisions that opened the door for his escape to Pakistan allowed bin Laden to emerge as a potent symbolic figure who continues to attract a steady flow of money and inspire fanatics worldwide . ”
The report , based in part on a little - noticed 2007 history of the Tora Bora episode by the military ’s Special Operations Command , asserts that the consequences of not sending American troops in 2001 to block Mr. bin Laden ’s escape into Pakistan are still being felt .
The report blames the lapse for “ laying the foundation for today ’s protracted Afghan insurgency and inflaming the internal strife now endangering Pakistan . ”
A textbook and related project about Islam came under scrutiny from about two dozen parents at the Alexandria Township Middle School on Monday evening when concerns were raised over the content and age - appropriateness of the materials .
Some families questioned whether the textbook used to teach 78 sixth - graders -- part of the " History Alive ! " series -- delves too deeply into the Islamic faith .
A recent project assigned to students requiring them to create a collage about Islam caused many to attend the monthly curriculum meeting to discuss the content for a middle school audience .
informed the parents that they can submit formal complaints to the school district about the textbook , which would result in a review by a committee of school officials .
What do you think ?
Is this material appropriate for middle school students in a public school setting ?

The White House has told Congress it will reject calls for many of President Obama ’s policy czars to testify before Congress - a decision senators said goes against the president ’s promises of transparency and openness and treads on Congress ‘ constitutional mandate to investigate the administration ’s actions .
Sen. Susan Collins , Maine Republican , said White House counsel Greg Craig told her in a meeting Wednesday that they will not make available any of the czars who work in the White House and do n’t have to go through Senate confirmation .
She said he was “ murky ” on whether other czars outside of the White House would be allowed to come before Congress .
Miss Collins said that does n’t make sense when some of those czars are actually making policy or negotiating on behalf of Mr. Obama .
“ I think Congress should be able to call the president ’s climate czar , Carol Browner , the energy and environment czar , to ask her about the negotiations she conducted with the automobile industry that led to very significant policy changes with regard to emissions standards , ” Miss Collins said at a hearing Thursday that examined the proliferation of czars .
The debate goes to the heart of weighty constitutional issues about separation of powers .
The president argues that he should be allowed to have advisers who are free to give him confidential advice without having to fear being called to testify about it .
Democrats and Republicans in Congress , though , argue that those in office who actually craft policy should be able to be summoned to testify because they do more than just give the president advice .
At issue are the 18 positions Miss Collins says Mr. Obama has created since he took office .
Of those , she says 10 - the White House says eight - are in the executive office and not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests or requests for testimony .
Czar is an informal term given to the positions .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman , Connecticut independent and chairman of the government affairs committee , asked the White House to provide a witness for Thursday ’s hearing but it did not send one .
In a letter last week to Miss Collins , though , Mr. Craig explained that the White House is not trying to circumvent Congress .
“ We recognize that it is theoretically possible that a president could create new positions that inhibit transparency or undermine congressional oversight .
That is simply not the case , however , in the current administration , ” Mr. Craig wrote .
Mr. Craig said the new positions Mr. Obama has created within the White House “ are solely advisory in nature ” and have no independent authority .
Senators disagreed with that evaluation , pointing to Mrs. Browner and health care czar Nancy - Ann DeParle , who is Mr. Obama ’s health care adviser .
“ We do happen to have a Cabinet officer with Health and Human Services with whom I have never had a conversation on health care , not because I have any opposition to her but because it ’s my perception Nancy - Ann DeParle is calling the shots , ” said Sen. Robert F. Bennett , Utah Republican .
Criticism of czars has boiled over after talk - show host Glenn Beck - who senators at the hearing repeatedly referred to as “ he who shall not be named ” - began a campaign to highlight their proliferation in the Obama administration .
But Miss Collins said she ’s been looking at czars for months , and she does n’t have problems with many of the czars Mr. Beck has criticized .
Still , Mr. Craig spent two pages of his four - page letter to Miss Collins critiquing Mr. Beck ’s positions .
Legal experts testifying before the Senate panel said Congress needs to be careful not to overreach in reacting .
They said options open to lawmakers include writing new laws to restrict advisers ’ authority or writing the positions into law as needing Senate confirmation .
A White House aide , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said they are trying to work to accommodate “ all reasonable congressional requests for information ” and said some White House advisers have given informal briefings to members of Congress in lieu of testimony .
The aide also said some czars are outside the White House itself and they can be called to testify .
The aide said five of them have already done so .
Sen . Claire McCaskill , Missouri Democrat , blasted Republicans for raising the issue and said she took offense at their comparisons between Mr. Obama and President Nixon .
She said Congress should instead be looking at the legality of presidential signing statements to shape how laws are implemented - a tool whose use expanded substantially under President George W. Bush .
Last month , Miss Collins offered an amendment to compel administration officials to testify , but it was ruled not germane to the bill being debate .
Democrats said it went too far because it would have covered all executive branch employees , including the national security adviser and the chief of staff , who have always been recognized as out of bounds .
Miss Collins said the issue should n’t be so intractable and that Congress and the White House should be able to agree on a list of people who should be able to testify .
For his part , Mr. Lieberman said he ’s still looking for a good solution .
“ We both share a desire to do something about this to help Congress uphold our responsibility for oversight , but we understand the balance here as reflected in the Constitution , ” he said .

Stretch Marks
In this article , we shall tell you all about stretch marks .
To begin with , what exactly are stretch marks ?
They are basically fine lines on the body which are caused due to a variety of reasons .
They happen if the skin is pulled or stretched by rapid growth .
The skin is fairly elastic in itself , but if it is overstretched , there is a disruption in the production of collagen , which is the major protein that is responsible for the connective tissue in the skin .
Thus , the result is scars , which we call stretch marks .
One thing you need to know about stretch marks is that they are really quite common – so if you think you ’re the only one suffering from the problem , you ’re not alone .
Many girls and women out there have stretch marks , on the breasts , hips , backside , and thighs .
They are also a common occurrence during pregnancy .
And even guys can get stretch marks , though they ’re more common among females .
Stretch marks are usually reddish or purplish lines that usually appear indented hey also tend to have a different texture from the surrounding skin .
They usually become lighter and disappear with the course of time .
Body builders can get stretch marks due to the rapid changes in body weight that their exercises may cause .
In fact , stretch marks are also common among people who use creams or ointments that contain steroids for a long duration .
Causes of Stretch Marks –
Now let ’s discuss the causes of stretch marks in detail .
They are caused when the skin is stretched to the point of breaking down – it ’s a process that is similar to a piece of elastic losing its elasticity .
When the elastin and collagen in the skin are lost , then a person gets stretch marks .
Stretch marks can be caused due to rapid growth , hormonal changes , pregnancy , and other kinds of natural causes .
What happens is basically this – the dermal collagen is damaged , and the dilation in blood vessels causes reddish - purple colored marks – these are stretch marks .
Stretch marks developed in the dermis , which is the middle , elastic layer of the skin .
The dermis has the collagen in it , which lets your skin stretch and shrink back into the original shape , but if this layer is continuously stretched over a long duration of time , then there is a breakdown in the elasticity , and thus stretch marks are causes .
Stretch marks can be caused by rapid weight gain ( even pregnancy ) , children who have become obese quickly , or even due to abnormal collagen formation .
Some people may be more prone to stretch marks than others , due to genetic factors .
Prevention –
Now that you know that stretch marks are caused due to fluctuations in body weight , you need to control your weight , and also moisturize regularly .
Always avoid having dry skin .
If you are prone to dry skin , then apply shea butter on your skin regularly .
After showering , do n’t rub your body down , simply pay dry with a towel gently , and then let the water naturally evaporate .
Also maintain a balanced diet – this will take care of your skin .
Drink lots of water , at least 10 - 12 glasses a day .
Avoid too much tea , coffee , and do n’t smoke either , as this lowers the level of oxygen in your blood .
Enhance your diet with green leafy vegetables and lots of fruits , do n’t forget the vitamins .
Do exercise regularly to keep the stretch marks at bay , because this encourages better circulation of blood , and thus your skin is overall much healthier .
Go for a massage at least once a week , this will keep your skin supple .
Use massage oil , as this will definitely work wonders for your skin .
Treatment –
So how can one treat stretch marks ?
Well , since the elasticity has been lost , they do n’t go away entirely , but you can massage your skin with a massage brush to increase the circulation of blood .
Moisturizing cream can be applied to keep the skin soft and supple , and do take care of your diet as well – eat foods rich in zinc , silica and Vitamins C and E. Vitamin E oil is known to be beneficial in treating stretch marks , Vitamin A is also a pretty good emollient .
Try cocoa butter , as many women swear by it , for the treatment of stretch marks .
You can also consult your doctor for other foods or creams that you can use , to treat your stretch marks .
Ask for prescription creams that contain tretinoin or retin A , but do n’t use these when you are pregnant .
You can also try fruit acids ( AHAs ) which moisturize the outer layer of skin , thus making it more pliable .
They assist in the regeneration of cells by removing the outer layer , and thus the healthier ones rise to the surface – this gives an improvement in the texture and color of the skin .
Plus , AHAs have water - binding properties ; therefore your skin becomes more flexible and smooth .
Do remember to drink lots of water and get regular exercise , as these have major benefits .
Surgical Removal –
If you are interested in getting surgical treatment to remove your stretch marks , you can try laser therapy .
It is rather expensive ; you would need 5 - 6 sessions .
In laser surgery , a narrow beam of light is transmitted through the skin , which helps to stimulate the cells in the dermis , thus new tissue is formed .
Today , you can choose from many kinds of laser therapies which are available to treat different kinds of stretch marks .
Laser therapy also encourages the production of collages , which thickens the skin under the stretch mark , making it closely resemble the surrounding normal skin .
In fact , studies have shown that surgical removal of stretch marks is extremely effective , and that even 6 months after the first laser session , there is an improvement in the appearance of stretch marks .
Current laser technology has come a long way in improving red or raised scars , or even eliminating them completely .

THE SEARCH FOR LOST FATHERING
Rebuilding Your Father Relationship
Chapter 1 - Everybody Needs a Father
Jessica was not the girl I had imagined she would be .
Having heard some frightening details of her story from my nurse , I had assumed she would be hostile and reactive - a test of my patience .
But as she walked quietly into my office and took a seat , I saw that she was a sweet eleven - year - old , the type of daughter who would make any parent proud .
She greeted me respectfully and asked to be called " Red " ( which struck me as curious , since her hair appeared more brown than red ) .
She faithfully followed all my directions during our chat , and never once complained .
The child obviously had a dash of shyness , but she was able to talk about her feelings - our staff therapist had been a benefit .
When I told her that our team was pleased with her progress , she smiled warmly .
I found it hard to believe that just three weeks earlier , this same girl had taken a knife and chased her mother around the house , saying , " I 'm going to kill you ! "
At that time , she had been living with her mother .
Her parents had separated because of her father 's alcohol problem ; nevertheless , they had come to an agreement that Jessica 's father , who was also nicknamed " Red , " could see her three times a month , as long as he did n't drink during the visits .
Red followed this agreement faithfully for five months , during which time father and daughter regularly talked on the phone , bowled , played games , and even went to Red 's softball games .
But then he broke the agreement .
One weekend while Jessica was at her father 's apartment , a group of guys came by to watch a football game on TV .
They brought beer , and the temptation was too much for Red .
When Jessica 's mom called to adjust the time she would pick up her daughter , she could tell that Red was mildly intoxicated .
Moments later , while Jessica was reveling in the attention of five loud , exuberant men , her mother burst into the apartment and angrily pulled her off the couch and rushed her out to the car .
When they got home , Jessica was told to go wash the dishes piled up in the sink .
Her mother had planned to discuss the event over dinner , but Jessica was seething over what her mother had done to her .
Somewhere deep in her heart , she felt her basic need for a father 's love being thwarted , even assaulted .
She could not face losing her father , so she attacked her mother , threatening to kill her with a knife .
Certainly , Jessica 's story is extreme .
But she is not alone in her hunger for fathering .
Jessica 's act was wrong , but it is profoundly telling .
It points to a need in all of us .
Each of us longs for a father 's love and acceptance .
Life distracts us .
We forget or are unaware of the basic experiences of our past that have shaped and now control us .
Sometimes we do not perceive the problem in our father relationship .
We need our fathers to be special and good , so we stuff our bad father experiences deep down inside .
Father failures hurt too much to face .
The mistakes fathers make may be subtle and hard to pinpoint , but they still have immense impact on the lives of their children .
So where do we start ?
Perhaps with the questions that are behind the title of this book :
Do you feel a loss in your father relationship ?
Does something feel wrong with it ?
Do you hunger for something that your father relationship should satisfy but does n't ?
Emotional Signs of Father Hunger
Many people have a void inside them that is due to " father hunger , " and this disguised hunger has had great impact on the way they live .
Do any of these statements apply to you ?
When I think about my father I become emotional - insecure , sad , or angry .
When I 'm with my father I do n't act like myself ; I 'm either childish or grandiose .
I consider my father wonderful , but others think I 'm fooling myself .
I feel numb toward my father .
I have trouble with competitiveness .
My motivation is poor because I feel beaten down .
I have difficulty establishing relationships .
I move too quickly into new relationships .
I 'm confused about my identity - it 's not as if my father ever made me feel good about myself .
I do n't feel like a real man .
I lack confidence in my femininity .
I feel unattractive .
I feel incompetent .
It is difficult for me to relax .
I have problems with my sexuality .
Being assertive is hard for me .
People seem to feel that I violate their boundaries .
I 'm afraid to get too close to others .
I fear being abandoned .
Authority makes me uneasy .
My father 's criticism hurt me too much .
Now I have difficulty accepting criticism .
God often feels a million miles away .
I have little interest in spirituality .
When my father does not provide the emotional support my mother needs , my mother unknowingly tries to get me to provide that support .
My father confides in me too much .
My father and I do not talk openly and honestly about our lives .
I keep trying to please everybody - especially father - types or mentors .
I run to things and people to nurse myself in a compulsive way .
I am rarely satisfied .
I live with a vague , diffused fearfulness .
My mother 's boyfriend annoys me .
My stepfather and I do not get along very well .
I am a parent who worries I am repeating my father 's and grandfather 's mistakes .
Sometimes I feel like an orphan .
The conditions listed above are often associated with incomplete father relationships .
The absence of a mature father - child connection creates a void in the soul , a residual " father hunger . "
Father hunger is the result of receiving too little quality fathering as a child or young adult .
Some argue that even grown men and women need fathers or father surrogates and that the absence of such role modeling and support is associated with less fulfillment in life .
In general , father hunger results from too little intimacy between child and father .
Over the last ten years , I have witnessed during counseling sessions the depth of the hunger men and women feel for fathering .
Even those in their sixties and seventies have told me of the hunger and longing they still feel .
And often the need is hidden , like a deep river of water flowing under the surface .
The hunger may be out of sight but it is never gone .
I know this from having heard hundreds of people tell me what they want from life .
After we get beyond the superficial they say something like , " I want my father to call and talk to me " or " I want my father to stop drinking and come home .
I need him so much . "
After more time , the deepest waters break through to the surface .
The hunger , longing , and disappointments begin to come forth .
" I wish my dad were alive . "
" Dad , I feel so weak without you . "
" I wish my dad were n't sick so I could lean on him the way I used to . "
And so it goes .
Most of these people are highly functioning members of their communities .
They are respected in their relationships .
They are responsible employees .
Nevertheless , they obviously have unresolved pain associated with their fathers .
They thirst for " father water . "
1
They have been left with a void , an injury , a psychic thirst that only a father can quench .
I am becoming increasingly convinced that this is nearly universal .
In this book you may be surprised to see the extent of your father 's role in your most cherished relationships , your vocation , your satisfaction with life , and your experience of God .
I will try to walk with you through what may be intense topics , but in the end I hope you will feel less controlled by the past and have direction for further healing .
Father Deficiency
For the purposes of this book , I have identified two levels of father deficiency : obvious deficiency and broad deficiency .
Obvious father deficiency has various causes .
A father may die before his children reach adulthood .
Some fathers desert their children and leave their families to function alone - often in poverty .
Divorce causes 40 percent of all children to spend at least part of their growing - up years in a single parent family , and most of these children will have minimal contact with their fathers .
2
Sophia Loren is a vivid example of obvious father deficiency .
Her life illustrates how fathers impact our love life and marriage choice .
Sophia saw her father only a few times .
He put in an appearance at the hospital when she was born , acknowledged that he was her father , and immediately departed .
Having seduced Sophia 's mother , he now abandoned both mother and child , leaving them to face the shame and humiliation heaped upon them by others in their small Italian town .
When Sophia was five years old she met her father for the first time .
Her mother , upon hearing the news that he was coming to see Sophia , became nervous and excited , fussing over the child 's hair and dress so she would be as attractive as possible .
Sophia remembers that he was tall and handsome , and that he gave her a toy car - a beautiful blue race car with her name painted on the side .
After she received it , she ran up to her room in tears .
Despite all the lavish gifts she has received , Sophia Loren says that little blue car still holds a special place in her memory .
3
In her teen years , Sophia tried to fill in the hole left by her absent father .
" I was busy working on films ... I was the head of the family , going out to work everyday , my mother was the wife , and my sister , now back in school , was the child . "
4
As an adult , though , Sophia still longed for her father , despite the pain he had caused her .
On one occasion her sister had arranged a visit at their father 's home .
He was ill and weak and her sister , Maria , wanted Sophia to see him before it was too late .
He took her through his flat , and even showed her his favorite mementos .
When she was getting ready to leave , he took one of her hands and said , " I am very proud of you . "
5
Yet even this good memory brings heartache .
Because her father 's " I am very proud of you " was the only affectionate thing he ever said to her , it stands alone in a sea of silence .
" Growing up in a small Neapolitan town , " she reveals , " it was the dream of my life to have a father . "
Trying to get over the immense sense of rejection from having been left , she tried to find him in other men .
She spent her life seeking surrogates for him - in Carlo Ponti , the husband who fathers her , and in older actors and directors who remind her in some way of the father she never " won . "
6
Sophia is quite frank and pleasantly transparent about her choice of a husband .
In her late teens she was aware of a deep need to be loved .
She had met Ponti when she was fifteen , and by the time she was nineteen they were seriously involved .
He was forty - one and married , but he soon divorced his wife so he could marry Sophia .
She said , " I suppose he 's the father I never had , the father I needed in my life .
Even now .
I 'm forty - four , but the little , shy , illegitimate , fatherless girl of Pozzuoli is still very much inside of me , and I need the father of Carlo as much today as I ever did . "
7
In her autobiography , one sees signs of her understanding and healing .
Sophia had the courage to examine herself , and the benefit is obvious .
She can look at her life and admit to herself : " I sought him everywhere .
I married him .
I made my best films with him .
I curried his favor .
I sat on his lap and snuggled him ...
I saw him only a few times ... yet he dominated my life . " 8
She wrote her life story to come to terms with him , to separate the delusions from the truth .
And it seems , by extension , to find a stable identity .
At least in her life there was a clear starting point .
She knew she had a father deficiency because he clearly was gone .
What about homes with a father who is emotionally gone ?
To express the pain of children in these families we need another broader definition of father deficiency .
Broad deficiency occurs when a father lives at home but provides little or no quality parenting .
For example , fathers who abuse alcohol or drugs may be unable to have positive relationships with their children .
Their behavior may be disruptive to the family , causing financial problems , and forcing the children into overwhelming levels of responsibility early in life .
9
In this way an alcoholic father can undermine the emotional health of all family members .
Such fathers are " anti-fathers , " psychic black holes who consume the strength and childhoods of their children .
This is also true of sexually and physically abusive fathers .
For example , it has been estimated that as many as 5 percent of all girls are sexually abused by their fathers .
10
One researcher believes that sexual abuse victimizes a million children each year , with physical abuse claiming a similar number .
More recent figures show the real numbers are probably even higher .
Much of this abuse is inflicted by fathers .
Many fathers who would not physically abuse their children nonetheless abuse them verbally , through ridicule and insults .
Some adult children are controlled by insecure fathers and feel unable to choose their own path through life .
Some cannot connect with Dad because his standards are considered severe and impossible to obtain - he expects too much beauty , morality , academic or athletic prowess , or artistic ability .
Some are denied active fathering because their fathers are weak and ill with chronic illnesses like Alzheimer 's disease , stroke , cancer , diabetes , and heart or lung disease .
Many adult children , especially daughters , are stepping in and caring for the man they once looked to as a defender and provider .
Such a role reversal , even if appropriate , is much like a funeral .
For example , a demented father can never help his child again .
In fact , he has become her child - at this point she is clearly on her own and functionally fatherless .
Probably the most common source of father deficiency involves fathers who isolated themselves from intimacy with their children by excess work during the children 's formative first two decades .
Even as retired men these fathers may continue to be emotionally absent from their families , leaving many of their children with an emotional void .
Men have been taught in American culture that real men do n't cry or show affection .
Subsequently , we have generations of children who have almost never received affection or experienced emotional closeness with their fathers .
Years of counseling have shown me that those who say they have great father relationships are occasionally the most troubled .
It is common to use idealization to hide the reality of an unpleasant relationship .
Sometimes in my work I have discovered that the child who is close to Dad may actually have been very hurt by his or her father 's intensity in the relationship .
The difference between overwhelming intensity and appropriate involvement is very subtle .
An example of this can be seen by examining the life 's work of composer Charles Ives .
His father was a good parent by many standards , yet he controlled the entire life course of his talented child , even from the grave .
Ives 's story indicates that even a genius may live a life largely governed by a troubled connection to his father .
Charles Ives has been called " the most original and inventive , and possibly the greatest " composer in American history .
11
He was born in 1874 in Connecticut , the son of George Ives , an energetic bandleader .
George was an intense lover of music , and spent hours trying to pass on his passion to his son , making sure that the boy learned how to play a number of instruments .
Charles identified profoundly with his father , taking up George 's wildly experimental , inventive style of composing .
12
Most people , on hearing of a father and son spending so much time together , smile in approval .
But there is more to the story .
Indeed , some people wonder if Charles was not overwhelmed by his father , perhaps even abused by the man 's emotional intensity .
During Charles 's college years , a number of conflicts developed between him and his father .
Unfortunately , George died at the age of forty - nine before these conflicts could be resolved .
Charles 's feelings of anger and sadness were poorly worked through , and it appears he coped with his father loss by decades of idealization .
After his father 's death , the music of his father filled his mind , perhaps haunting him , and he began to write constantly - utilizing every bit of his spare time to create music .
As Stuart Feder compellingly demonstrates in his book , My Father 's Song , Ives 's music was an " unconscious creative collaboration " with his deceased father , a way to mourn without mourning .
Charles 's songs were filled with references to his father , his father 's hymns and marches , his father 's eccentric sounds , and the sights that had surrounded them as they played together when Charles was a boy .
After almost thirty years of productive composition , Ives 's output began to taper off .
Why ?
Feder believes that Charles 's unconscious identification with his father affected not only the content of Charles 's music , but the exact time it ceased .
After memorializing his father in his musical compositions , Charles " died , " in a sense , in that he allowed his creativity to die .
Specifically , when Charles reached the age of forty - eight , he began to pull his works together , publishing them in 1922 .
The following year , when he was forty - nine ( the age at which his father died ) , Ives 's creative impulse died .
The length of his father 's physical life thus marked the length of Charles 's creative life .
While many of his materials continued to be performed and praised after this time , nevertheless , in his remaining decades Charles Ives functioned largely as a " cantankerous recluse .
"

The life of Charles Ives shows that it is often difficult for a child to understand the depths of his father 's influence .
Ives was a brilliant man but he lacked insight into the effect of his father on him .
Though he and his father spent time together , it was not a healthy interaction .
You may think your father was a " good " father , but for your own well - being , you must evaluate the relationship you had and have with him .
Some of my patients call their fathers " good " as a way to defend against their " bad " experiences with them .
I 've heard many abused children quote their fathers as though they are sages .
They believe their fathers are " good " because that 's better than accepting the dark reality .
Even an involved father may not be a " good " father .
Some men have trouble changing from being a protective father of a little child to a mentoring father of a young adult .
Many protective fathers struggle to allow a young adult child to develop his own uniqueness , vocation , or parenting style .
It 's interesting to note that Charles Ives had his conflicts with his father when they stopped playing music together and Charles moved away , showing signs of independence .
Finally , calling a father " good " may be equivalent to saying he was satisfactory , i.e. , he was not abusive , paid the bills , and came to birthday parties .
Satisfactory may be the norm for American society , but is it good ?
According to two authors , what is normal is distant fathers who leave their children with feelings of incompleteness .
Victoria Secunda's Women and Their Fathers opens with five middle - aged women sharing lunch as they complain about their mothers .
After a period of time , Secunda suggests that they chat about their dads .
The conversation comes to an abrupt halt .
Slowly it dawns on these women that their fathers are largely strangers to them .
Sure , these women are able to talk about sterile facts such as their fathers ' ages , birthplaces , employment , and health .
But on the whole , their fathers seemed amorphous , mythical , and absent .
Indeed , just mentioning them induced a " curious amnesia " in their daughters .
14
Lee Salk's My Father , My Son discusses twenty - eight father - son relationships .
What is striking about these relationships is the almost universal sense , even among those with kind fathers , that they have not received enough of their fathers ' love .
All of them felt they needed more .
Secunda and Salk show us that something is missing in father relationships , even in " normal households . "
The implications of this father void are not trivial .
When I talk to psychologists , social workers , psychiatrists , pastors , priests , pastoral workers , and schoolteachers , I repeatedly hear an emphasis on the need for healing the effects of father deprivation .
In subsequent chapters I 'll use cases to show the specific effects of such deprivation on your work , love life , emotional struggles , and identity .
But you may also be surprised to learn how seriously spirituality can be distorted , blocked , or rendered empty - even among those who are considered spiritual giants - due to trouble with their fathers .
Chapter 3 - The Search for Lost Fathering
Angela was eight , with stringy brown hair and a wiry frame .
She had just started ballet , and was obviously proud of her new white costume .
She was aware that her daddy and his guests were laughing out on the porch , so she thought it would be a great opportunity to show off the routine she had just learned .
Smiling excitedly , she tiptoed onto the porch and into our midst .
Her father glared down at her .
" What are you doing out here ? " he demanded .
" I do n't know , " the little girl whispered , taking a step backwards .
" Did n't I tell you never to interrupt adult conversations ? "
" Uh ... yeah ... "
" Now that we have all seen your costume , you can go back inside , " he said firmly .
Sadly , with obvious embarrassment , the little girl turned and went back inside the house .
We did n't see her again for the rest of the evening .
My heart fell when I saw how Angela 's father responded to his little girl 's longing for attention .
That child needed to know she was important before the world had a chance to knock her down and make her feel like a loser .
But instead of giving her the affirmation she needed , her father shamed her in front of his friends .
He berated her need to be noticed .
I have met many Angelas in my practice , at my church , and among my friends .
They may be adults now , but inside they are still children looking for a father to say , " What a lovely outfit !
Could you please show us a few dance steps ? "
How many adults still ache to hear their father figures and mentors say , " Hey , gang , have you met my wonderful daughter ?
Boy , do I love her !
She 's the best ! "
Angela went to her room that evening with a bruised heart , emotionally beaten down .
Her hunger for affirmation not only remained ; it had grown .
Being shamed on the porch had only increased her need for encouragement .
As time goes on , things will change for that child .
Her body will become a woman 's body , her mind that of a woman .
Her sense of the profound subtleties of human relationships will grow .
She will put herself in positions and relationships that will let her be seen and built up .
And , quite possibly , she will spend the rest of her life trying to earn the kind words she missed that day on the porch .
John is driven by the same desire .
In a group setting he usually tries to answer every question , even if he really does n't know the answer .
He draws the attention of the group to himself because he needs others to praise him .
Why ?
As I have gotten to know John and hear him talk about his father , I have learned that in John 's experience for every kind word that came from his father 's lips , there were at least three critical ones .
John has been seeking approval since he was a little boy , trying to heal himself and show that his father 's devaluing comments were wrong .
John 's actions say to the group , " Please notice me and tell me I 'm special . "
Yet John is no longer a child ; he is forty - eight years old .
Someone may protest that I am making too much of the father - child relationship .
After all , a father is only one person among many who shape a child 's identity .
While that 's true , it 's also true that for many children their father has nearly defined their identity .
And we are wrong if we think years or success cause us to outgrow our desire for a father 's encouragement .
For example , I remember a restaurant owner , Tommy , who told me about the day he bought a brand - new Lexus .
He went out to dinner with his parents and girlfriend , and after dinner , he went out to the parking lot to get the car .
He began walking faster and faster to get to his car , finally breaking into a trot .
" Why am I running like this ? " he asked himself .
He felt ashamed of his behavior .
I 'm thirty - eight years old , he thought .
Why am I acting this way ?
As he and I discussed the incident , the answer emerged .
Tommy 's parents had parked on the opposite end of the street , and he was n't sure they would wait with his girlfriend while he brought the car around .
He was running because he wanted to make sure his father saw his fancy new car .
Surely , he reasoned , if his father saw the sort of car he was driving , the man would admire and respect him .
But that 's not what happened .
His father 's reaction was negative : " Never thought I 'd see you in something like that .
Bet the payments are a nightmare , huh ?
Well , hope you enjoy it anyway . "
Tommy was deflated by his father 's reaction , of course .
But then again , his father had always been much freer with the insults than the praise - and so , even as a thirty - eight - year - old man , Tommy was still looking to his father for what he had never received as a child , and he was still coming up empty .
Why do fathers matter so much to people like Tommy ?
Why can't they be satisfied with a blessing from their mothers ?
The answer may have to do with a father 's role in developing his children 's identities .
Fathers and Uncertain Identities
A child begins life united to his ( or her ) mother .
The child literally is fused into his mother 's body .
Even after birth , the infant is singularly dependent on his mother ; she is the source of his nourishment and security .
Over time , however , the child learns that the mother is a separate person - a potentially frightening realization , because independence means that you can be alone .
So where does the father enter in ?
In past decades , he was considered an outsider to the mother - child fusion , and referred to as the first " outsider . "
In many homes , the job of raising infants and young children was traditionally delegated to the mother ; fathers represented " the world , " the part of experience that was " out there , " beyond the front yard of our homes .
However , in recent years fathers have come to be seen as capable of bonding very early with their infants .
In fact , researchers say that whoever cares for the child 's physical needs in a tender and appropriate way will be noticed by the child .
1
Burlingham notes that even in the mother - child act of breast - feeding , the child can be looking up at the father while suckling .
2
This means that infants can get messages from their fathers and may bond very early with them - if the men are tender and nurturing .
But while it is possible for men to bond with infants , such tender intimacy is rare .
A child 's father is typically the first male to write his thoughts and feelings on his child 's heart .
Fathers , therefore , need to be sensitive to the messages their every word and action inscribe on that tender surface .
Their children enter the world like tiny sponges , ready to absorb every little impression about themselves and their identity .
They are unsure of who they are : Am I special ?
they ask .
Am I valuable ?
Am I good ?
Am I merely an annoyance ?
Their fathers play a primary role in answering those questions .
Last month I was playing golf with a close friend when he hit a ball into the water hazard .
( I suppressed the urge to dance , and managed a sympathetic look . )
Later , he hit another ball into the water .
" Joe , " he muttered to himself , " you are as brainless as a crow . "
On the final hole he hit the ball into the woods and said the same thing .
After the game I asked him where he picked up the " brainless as a crow " expression .
He said he was n't sure ; we dropped it , and the conversation turned to other things .
A few days later I was at a party when Joe 's older sister dropped a paper plate full of goodies onto the carpet .
Her immediate response was to scold herself for being - you guessed it -" brainless as a crow . "
Naturally , I asked her about that unusual saying .
She paused for a moment , and then remembered that it was something her father had always said to her when she was " bad . "
Today , these two adults still belittle themselves with the same words their father used , even though the man has been dead for twenty - five years .
This demonstrates the degree to which the words and actions of our fathers affect our identities .
Our fathers are carried around inside us long after they have died .
We continue to model them , dialogue with them , and listen to them , even after they have been gone for decades .
Many of us continue to mirror the image of ourselves that our fathers have written on our souls .
Individuals who did not receive a supportive self - definition from their fathers when they were children can sometimes feel insecure and easily shaken .
Those who did receive encouragement and support are more apt to stand strong in the face of life 's raging storms .
Jean is a ten - year - old who has a pale face framed by rather unflattering glasses .
She is not especially outgoing , but the kids in her school and neighborhood seem to love her .
Jean 's father spends a good deal of time at home with his family .
He is considerate and respectful to his wife , and he is constantly holding and praising his daughter .
He laughs a lot and seems to genuinely enjoy his daughter 's company .
My impression is that she first faced the world with this message on her internal blackboard : " I am fun .
People like to hold and hug me .
I have value just as I am . "
People who enter the world feeling valued have a benefit that is not often recognized .
Others respond differently to them than they do to those with fragile identities .
Why ?
Because individuals project a " spirit , " an " identity " that people pick up .
For example , the child who enters a new playground thinking , " I am worthless , and nobody will like me , " often finds the other kids treating him as if he is worthless .
And , as Jean illustrates , the reverse can be true .
People pick up her contentment and security , and they treat her accordingly .
But many people do not have Jean 's sense of wholeness and cohesion , and Cathy is a prime example .
I met her after she had attempted suicide .
Unlike many suicidal patients , Cathy did not appear to have any clear signs of a biological depression .
She had experienced no weight loss or gain , no fatigue , no problems concentrating , no sleep irregularities , and no appetite changes .
After I ruled out biological depression , we talked about her life .
It seemed clear to me that her sense of identity was dissolving because her husband had asked her for a divorce .
She could not think of being alone ; that was " impossible , " she said .
As we talked further about her marriage , it became evident that her husband had provided her the love and attention her father had never given her .
Cathy 's father had worked ten to twelve hours a day as a corporate salesman , and was often on the road for days at a time .
When he was home he was emotionally unavailable .
She said he was typically grouchy and irritable , " like he would be much happier if we were n't there . "
Her mother had also felt alienated by the man , and had looked to her children to be her friends .
Cathy found her mother 's behavior too stifling and emotionally incestuous , and she wanted out of the house .
At the age of twenty - three , Cathy met Tim , a man who seemed to be able to provide the " out " she wanted .
When I asked her about the events just prior to her suicide attempt , she said softly , " Tim asked me to come into the dining room .
He said , ' I suppose now is as good a time as any to tell you this ... ' "
She caught her breath and continued , " When he says this I 'm freaking out thinking ' Oh , no , what 's this all about ? '
I got really scared , and I could barely follow him because I was so tense .
His face looked so hard .
He 'd been distant before , but this was different . "
She stopped to wipe her eyes .
" He told me he wanted a divorce . "
After a few minutes , she went on .
" I can't live without him .
Please help me get him back .
I 'll never make it by myself ! "
Cathy is grieving the loss of a spouse , of course ; but she is also experiencing the dissolving of her psychological self .
Her identity is like a puzzle board with each piece held in place with glue - and Tim is the glue .
Because her father , the first key male in her life , was emotionally absent , she was unable to get glue from him .
She entered the dating arena looking for someone to glue her fragile identity together .
Tim played that role for a while , but now he is gone , and her identity is fragmenting - like a puzzle knocked off the table and onto the floor .
Pam 's situation illustrates the same principle in a more subtle manner .
Her father and mother were divorced when she was five , and she sees her dad two or three times a year when he is " in town " on business .
In our last session , we talked about her employer , a professor at a local university , whom she has known for three years .
" I 'm bummed out today , " she told me .
" Why is that ? "
" Dr. Reynolds and I are n't getting along all that well .
My job 's just not as fulfilling as it used to be . "
I was under the impression that she had been satisfied with her work , but we had n't discussed it much .
As we talked further about her week , she mentioned that her father had unexpectedly come to town and invited her to lunch .
She described their lunch as " annoying . "
Then , when she returned to work , she felt that Dr. Reynolds was responding to her differently .
" We went over some class handouts and a research proposal , and I had this sense that he did n't like me - like he wished he had another secretary .
He was critical and distracted .
I do n't know ... I just did n't want to be there working with him . "
A general pattern emerged over the months that followed .
Pam became more sensitive after a difficult visit with her father .
After time with her dad , if she was criticized , it would hurt more than usual .
If affirmation and praise stopped flowing toward her , she became insecure and needy .
Her father shook her identity .
When her father flew out of town , it seemed he left with Pam 's confidence .
Pam was often able to get Dr. Reynolds to help restore it .
He was able to glue her back together with his encouragement and attention .
She loved it when he was " nice . "
But she hated it when he was " too businesslike . "
When he criticized her , even for legitimate reasons , she experienced it as a catastrophe , because she needed him to hold her together and make her feel whole .
We all need people to support and affirm us , of course .
But Pam 's unresolved identity issues were causing her to relate to her employer inappropriately .
She longed for his affirmation after her father 's visits , and when Dr. Reynolds did not supply it , she lost interest in the job , and in him .
My sense is that many people do what Pam did .
They seek to heal their father issues in unproductive ways .
They overwhelm a spouse , their friends , mentors , or work associates .
Sometimes their hunger to feel valued causes them to join abusive groups and unsound or manipulative religious organizations in an effort to find loyal acceptance and self - worth .
They run to substances like alcohol , drugs , and excess food , or try to fill their void with a " high " from compulsive exercise or self - debasing sexual experiences .
They work themselves mercilessly because they hope that achievement will earn them a sense of value and self - respect - something their fathers never gave them .
It is not merely a child 's identity that a father influences , but also his or her life goals , motivation , sexuality , and relationships with other people .
Go Ahead and Hurt Me - I Deserve It
" Why wo n't she leave him ? "
One of my staff asked me that question once about one of my clients who was in an abusive relationship .
One often hears of people who are repeatedly abused , yet decide to stay with the abuser .
Why do they endure such treatment ?
While I believe the answer to that question has many elements , part of the answer relates to identity .
Your self - concept dictates , to a great extent , how you allow people to treat you .
Julie illustrates this principle .
She was sexually molested by her father from the time she was eight until she was twelve .
When she finally became able to talk about it , she asked , " What was it about me that caused him to pick me over my sisters ?
There were four of us , and he picked me out . "
That was the wrong question .
It sounds as if her experience has made her embrace a masochistic vision of herself .
The real question was , " Why did my father engage in sexual abuse ? "
But children see the world in terms of themselves .
A child 's mind reasons , " Bad happens because I did something to cause it - because ' I stepped on a crack , ' or ' I was bad . ' "
Like many children , Julie felt she was being abused because of some personal defect , though the defect , of course , was her father's .
Unfortunately , as Julie entered adulthood she emotionally disconnected herself from the abuse .
She treated her father as if nothing had happened , and tried to live as though nothing had happened .
But it had happened , and it affected the way she let others treat her .
For example , she regularly let her roommate violate their rental agreement , and when a conflict arose , Julie readily accepted blame , even when her roommate paid the rent two weeks late or invited guests for a weekend without consulting Julie .
Julie endures such abuse because of the " lessons " she learned from her father .
His behavior " taught " her to expect such behavior as a child ; consequently , she endures it as an adult .
When she was a child she was too young and too small to resist her father , but that is no longer the case .
Julie needs to confront her father , and come to terms with the effects of that relationship .
Only then will she treat herself with respect - and expect such treatment from others .
Eddie is a college English teacher in his forties .
He once heard me speak on father - child relationships and decided to come for counseling .
We talked about his disappointment with his work and about his father 's worsening lung cancer .
Eddie wanted a greater closeness with his father before he died .
He did not understand why he felt angry towards his father .
How can I be angry with a man who is weak with cancer ?
he asked himself .
Eddie also thought of all the fun they had had in recent years watching football together .
It did n't make sense .
Eddie started a journal in an attempt to understand his confusing emotions .
As he journaled , his mind often turned to his childhood years .
He kept seeing mental pictures of his father sitting around the house looking sad and disappointed , a mood that filled the house .
When Eddie was a child , his father would often complain angrily that Eddie had left his room a mess , or that he was doing his chores improperly .
Eddie also had the sense that when they ate dinner together , his father was not especially enjoying his company .
He believed that he was somehow responsible for his father 's unhappiness and felt that he must have been flawed to cause his father to be so depressed and irritable .
As we talked about it , Eddie realized that he had generalized his father 's nagging and complaining to mean that his father had rejected him as a person .
" I always sort of thought he loved me , " Eddie explained .
" Later in life , we became quite free in our words of affection .
But I think it has to do with an overall impression . "
" What do you mean ? " I asked .
" When I was young , he'd get angry at the work I did on the house .
The painting was sloppy , the windows were n't clean enough , the dishes were n't washed promptly enough .
When I was older , he did n't like any of the girls I dated .
Then , when I was married and had two kids of my own , he did n't like the way I was raising them .
I do n't know .
What 's the point ? "
He sighed deeply .
" What 's the bottom - line message you take away from this ? " I asked .
" That I 'm stupid and he wished I had n't been around . "
You see , a double layer of communication was going on between the two men .
In recent years they had developed the capacity to express their love for each other , yet other messages had been communicated by decades of disagreement and disapproval .
Unpleasant verbal and nonverbal communication from the father in the past carried more weight than more recent positive communication .
The message of four decades was far stronger than the recent warmer words between them .
These insights helped explain the alienation the son felt .
In the months prior to the older man 's death , Eddie was able to discuss his unhappy earlier dealings with his father .
After some tense conversations , Eddie and his father slowly achieved a greater intimacy and understanding .
When Eddie 's father finally died , Eddie had closure in their relationship .
Much like My Father
Ken 's relationship with his father is threatened by the elder man 's tendency to criticize his son .
For example , last year his father came to a party at Ken 's house .
While Ken was barbecuing the chicken his father made a big deal about the poor job he was doing .
" You 're letting the chicken burn ! " he said .
" Did you marinate it ? " " You 'd better get those flames out . "
Ken told me he got so mad at his father he wanted to " punch his lights out . "
But for all his indignation toward his father , Ken treats his own family the way his father treats him .
During a family therapy meeting , his older children said he is " a chip off the old block . "
They say he is controlling , opinionated , and critical , not only toward them , but toward his wife as well .
I see this pattern again and again :
The children who resent their father 's behavior often unknowingly mimic that behavior .
It seems to be a natural tendency .
When a child is hurt by his father , he relates to others the way his father related to him .
But there is an additional psychological principle that may contribute to why Ken could be considered " a chip off the old block . "
Leonard Shergold explains the mechanism that can cause someone to identify with an abusive father in his book , Soul Murder : The Effects of Childhood Abuse and Deprivation .
Overwhelmed by the sheer power of the adult , and utterly dependent , the child is emotionally crushed .
The child must have a " good " parent , and therefore , sees the parent 's bad acts as " good " or legitimate .
3
In other words , if the only person the child can depend on to protect and defend him is cruel and abusive , the child tries to justify the cruelty .
The alternative , that there is really no one to protect and defend him , is just too hard to take .
There is hope for hurting children , though .
Abuse does not have to be repeated .
Decades of criticism and neglect can be overcome .
But healing first begins with further insight - insight into the ripple effect a father has on all the family relationships .
Chapter 8 - The Orphan 's Need for Security
Many of Charles Dickens 's books have a character like Oliver Twist , a frail orphan who was born in a dingy poorhouse .
Dickens 's portrayal of the orphan is powerful because he experienced childhood isolation and orphan - like fears himself .
He knew that without a loving , protecting father , the world can be a dark and scary place .
Because many novels have autobiographical elements , the character of Oliver Twist may offer insight into Dickens 's own sense of isolation .
Oliver was clearly born without a father , and from the first words of the story , the raw vulnerability and isolation of his life are poignantly clear .
For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble ... it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all ...
The fact is , that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration - a troublesome practice , but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence ; and for some time he lay gasping on a little ... mattress , rather unequally poised between this world and the next : the balance decidedly in favor of the latter ...
There being nobody ... Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them .
1
According to Peter Ackroyd 's extensive biography of Dickens , the book 's plot was associated with " the pains of his childhood , " 2 including an incident in Dickens 's childhood in which his father 's unwise handling of money sent the man to prison for three months .
Indeed , the entire family ( with the lone exception of Charles ) was sent to prison because of the father 's indebtedness .
For three months , Charles walked through a huge city alone , " cold , isolated , with barely enough to eat . "
3
Such experiences are not quickly or easily processed , and will make a lasting imprint on anyone - of any age .
In the story of Oliver Twist , the newborn baby had to fight for the very air to breathe , a symbol of the orphan 's struggle for life , for love , for everything .
And , like the infant in Dickens 's novel , the emotional orphan may not even be aware of his struggle - or its cause .
Pastor
Fred grew up in a family with a very weak , passive father who was emotionally removed from the family .
Because his dad was listless and disinterested , Fred never " connected " with him emotionally .
Consequently , Fred has trouble " connecting " with and caring for the individual people he has been given to shepherd , and that 's very bad news for those parishioners looking for his empathy .
When he was hired last year to serve in a moderately sized church , Pastor Fred surrounded himself with people who would support him .
But it has become evident that he does not connect with them as people .
They are impersonal pawns that he uses to prop up his empty inner world , a world in which he was left alone and undefended by his withdrawn father .
When he talks about caring for his parishioners , he has no idea , really , what he is talking about ; he is playing a role .
He was never really cared for or valued himself , so he does n't know how to care for the members of his congregation .
During Fred 's therapy it seemed at first that I was simply a token therapist ; he could be talking to anyone as long as he was getting attention .
After two years , however , a slow change began to take place .
Fred began to see me as a separate person ; when I was out sick he seemed to genuinely feel for me , not just because he was missing what I could do for him in therapy .
Slowly , but steadily , Fred has grown .
In finding someone who genuinely cares for him , he has come to the place where he is beginning to be able to genuinely care for others .
Orphan psychology also affects how we respond to criticism .
When we are put down and told we " are not quite right " - particularly by someone as important as a father - we can tend to see the entire world as a dark and unfriendly place , a place in which we feel outcast , rejected , and alone .
An emotional orphan who is criticized by a spouse , a friend , a lover , or an employer is likely to react with hostility or quick withdrawal .
That 's because the people closest to us shoot at closer range .
And , if the father 's critical nature has already left a scar , the orphan will be particularly sensitive to criticism .
Pleasing Others to Feel Safe
Tricia has always been close to her father .
He is fairly intense , a real " go - getter " in corporate law .
I would describe her as being very much like her father , because she has his high " standards , " which she applies to her nursing career , relationships , morality , financial security , and her family .
He taught her these things when she was growing up , through his own example and through regular , consistent criticism - most often the latter .
Tricia exhibits constant restlessness , though she does not appear to have a biological anxiety disorder .
Her restlessness seems instead to be fueled by her desire to please so many people and , even more specifically , by her desire to avoid criticism , because " it hurts so much . "
She goes out of her way to please people in order to prevent their hurtful criticism or disapproval .
During one session , when she was slouched down in her chair , looking totally out of it , I told her , " You look more tired and sleepy all the time . "
She sighed .
" Well ... it 's been a busy week , and I 'm tired . "
" What made it so busy ? "
" I offered to stay late at work Monday because my nurse supervisor - she 's a friend of mine - needed me to work a double shift .
And Tuesday was rough because my friend from church had a baby , and I was organizing meals for ten days and cleaning her house . "
" How did you come to do that ? " I asked .
" Oh , I volunteered to do it at my local home group meeting .
We usually do this for new mothers , and when no was else was speaking up ... ah ... the home group leader looked over at me and ... "
" And you thought she wanted you to volunteer ? "
" That 's right .
And then last night my mom asked me to help her set up the house for my cousin 's baby shower .
So I went over , and it took twice as long as expected .
I guess it was fun-well , my mother seemed to enjoy it - but I never said I could stay for five hours . "
" So why did you ? "
" Because my mother would tell me she really needed me ... or she would say I was n't being thoughtful to my cousin if I left . "
Tricia finds it painful to refuse anything to anyone .
The more someone expects , the more she is willing to submit and ingratiate herself to them .
She fears that refusing her time to someone will earn her criticism and , in a small way , rejection .
She uses offensive pleasing to keep everyone liking her , and to prevent the pain of anyone criticizing her .
Using Criticism to Feel Safe
Tricia tries to please people to be safe , but Christopher manifests his orphanhood in defensive criticism .
In other words , he believes in lowering the boom on the other guy before the other guy lowers the boom on him .
When Christopher was a child , his father was usually at work from eight in the morning until seven at night , and then was irritable when he got home .
Generally , the family 's priority was not intimacy ; it was getting out of Dad 's way and avoiding his verbal attacks .
Christopher grinned when he talked about his home environment , but as the memories unfolded it was clear that there was nothing funny about it .
He became sad as he recalled being told over and over again to " be quiet . "
He said he rarely did fun things with his father .
In one session , Christopher mentioned that his conception had been an " accident . "
He was n't sure how he had learned this , but insisted that he had heard it a number of times .
He thought he had found the love of his life in Melanie , a girl he had dated for five years , but shortly after they became engaged she called it off .
I met him when Kate , his new fiancée , talked him into coming for premarital counseling .
She felt that Christopher was constantly " adjusting her . "
As later became apparent , he had been quite hurt by his father 's critical tongue , and his joking bravado was really a defense mechanism .
When his ex-fiancée , Melanie , broke off their relationship , she added to Christopher 's sense of disapproval .
He never talked about his fears or insecurities , but dragged his feet in his relationship with Kate instead .
Most importantly , he was regularly critical of Kate .
After discussing " the facts " over two sessions , Christopher began to listen to Kate 's appeals that " he is trying to make me perfect before he will marry me . "
He initially thought she was exaggerating , but he slowly gained insight into his fear of a commitment to her , realizing that he was afraid to " take in " another person who could hurt him .
Orphans and Control
Margaret was molested by her father when she was about eight years old .
She later learned that her younger sister had also been abused .
She has had some counseling over the years and currently works in a department store .
She has a couple of long - term friends , one of whom is her roommate .
Margaret came to see me because she was depressed and because she was having trouble with her roommate , who felt that Margaret 's standards for cleaning the house were " to the moon . "
I assumed that meant too high .
Margaret liked things organized and clean .
She also liked things clearly scheduled and predictable .
If I kept her waiting for five minutes , she would become intensely annoyed ; a cancelled appointment could ruin her entire day .
We eventually addressed her need for a controlled and ordered environment .
When she was a little girl , her father 's incest had subjected her to boundary violations that shook her deeply .
In response , she tried to order her world in a way that compensated for the tremendous chaos of her home .
Control , order , and predictability became her solution to her father 's abuse .
Unfortunately , she was still trying to offset her father 's conduct in new environments and relationships that held no threat for her .
Margaret 's need for control and order also translated into an acute concern for morality .
She adhered to strict moral principles - and expected others to do the same - but she was motivated largely by fear , not piety .
To her , morality was a way to control the world in the hope of preventing the kind of violation and trauma she had faced as a child .
Because she had been overwhelmed by her environment in the past , she now wished that all those around her would act in ways that were morally predictable and safe .
In this way Margaret is like so many with orphan emotions who try so hard to write a different ending to their experience , only to cause other problems with their " solution . "
Orphans and Fantasy
Many father - child relationships are characterized by fantasy , especially ones in which a father is dead , absent , or abusive .
If a father dies while his children are young , they may fill in the blanks , continuing their relationship with a fantasy father .
Others use fantasy when their dads are frequently away from home , perhaps imagining their fathers working in faraway places .
Still others use fantasy when a father inflicts hurts on them that are too distressing to face .
Some in this latter group use fantasy to construct a romanticized view of their fathers , magnifying their fathers ' good aspects and minimizing their faults .
The Orphan 's Need for Certainty
Ron is a minister from Maryland .
He sends me an occasional client as a " last resort . "
Before he referred the first client in my direction he wanted to meet with me a couple of times to make sure I was competent .
Our lunches were nice breaks in the day ; he has a delightful sense of humor .
Nevertheless , I was struck by his sense of certainty regarding controversial issues .
Ron has a deep commitment to the Bible , and yet I believe his certainty has little to do with " faith . "
In fact , I think it is an example of his lack of faith .
He was born in suburban Atlanta , the oldest boy in a family of five .
He told me :
It would be two in the morning and my mother would be walking by my room to go to the hospital .
She 'd tell me that everything was fine , and that she'd be back in a few hours .
But the redness in her eyes let me know that she was not fine .
She 'd tell me my father was ill and would probably be in the hospital for a few weeks .
I did n't let it bother me .
It had happened before and I could see the slight warning changes in his behavior .
He would start talking faster and work more around the house .
Mom would ask him if he was taking his medication .
He would complain that he did n't like the way it made him feel , and after a while he would become irritable , and then he would start spending money .
After that , he 'd just disappear for a few days .
Sooner or later , someone would see that he was acting bizarre and call the police .
He 'd wind up at the emergency room in the hospital once again .
Obviously , Ron did not have much stability in his home while he was a child .
He could never be sure when his father would stop taking his medication and become manic or psychotic .
It may have been that uncertainty in his childhood that made him long for certainty as an adult .
While I never did get to know Ron well , I was struck by his adamant feelings on difficult political , theological , and moral questions .
He seemed to have all the answers , no matter how complex the question .
Ron 's opinionated views may have grown , to a great extent , out of the fathering he had received when he was a child .
The point is that he brought his need for certainty , his fear of further chaos , to his reading of the Bible .
And in the end he had more answers than Moses .
Now that we have discussed Margaret 's need for control and Ron 's orphan - like hunger for certainty , let 's combine them .
And I want to do it by talking about my father .
My father was not only intelligent , he was also driven .
Once , looking back on his life , he told me , " Sometimes when I think about how I was back then , I sort of shudder .
I realize now how much I gave to get out of poverty , as if I 'd have been willing to sell my soul just to become a doctor and have a little money . "
He was the tenth of eleven children , born in 1932 , the same year his father walked home from his engraving work in tears because his pay had been cut in half .
My father was too young at the time to understand it , but the story of his father 's tears was retold on many occasions and was a source of fear to the entire family .
My father grew up in Lancaster , Pennsylvania , far from the Amish farms associated with the area .
His family lived in a narrow , poorly heated row house with minimal insulation and a tin roof , and my father slept in the attic .
In the winter he could see his breath , white fog floating out from under the covers to join with the fog of his three siblings in the same room .
My father was also deeply affected by wartime life .
From the age of nine until the age of thirteen , he was faced with rationing .
He would stand in line for meat , flour , and sugar .
He vividly recalls regularly going to the meat market and waiting an hour in line for a pound or two of ground beef .
And often after an hour wait there was no meat left .
During the war , he also came to realize that the poorer people were sent to the combat lines and exposed to the worst threats of the battle .
Many of his older brothers - in - law were in the infantry or paratroopers .
He also had a sister who served .
But most disheartening was the death of his cousin , a man who lived only three doors up the street .
Three others from his block also gave their lives in battle , and my father wondered whether the streets in affluent neighborhoods had so many dead .
My father especially wondered about this when he delivered newspapers in the Grandview area of Lancaster and saw the single homes with large , beautiful lawns .
Imagine actually having so much room that you would n't hear your neighbors ' conversations through the wall , he thought .
And you could play music and no one would complain about the noise .
All these experiences combined to create a fantasy of a different life .
A life with no wage cuts , cold winters , meat lines , or war dead .
A world in which the privacy of a home was guaranteed , and one in which you were self - employed - and therefore in control of your own future .
It was this fantasy that empowered him to spend thousands of hours in study to reach it .
Sometimes orphans become isolated by spending countless hours on their business or studies - whatever it is that will save them financially .
While my father had loving parents , he nevertheless had a specific area of orphan - like vulnerability .
He swore that he would never be poor , no matter what it took .
This is typical of the orphan mentality .
Those who have experienced the economic vulnerability of the orphan often swear that they will never face it again .
Some will do anything to avoid poverty .
The Orphan and Friendship
I first heard about the street children of Rio de Janeiro from my close friend Tim Manatt , a man who travels throughout South America and Mexico every year .
He saw thousands of children living there in the streets .
Such children have a great deal to teach us about the relational alternatives people use when they are alienated from their fathers .
Street children show us the importance of friends to orphans , or those with incomplete father relationships .
They show us that friends can sometimes become a surrogate family , and any change in friendships can be very disconcerting for the orphan .
It is estimated that there are presently forty million abandoned children on the streets of Latin America 's cities .
4
Some are " cute " children who can be seen begging at an airport or hotel , shining shoes , singing for small change , or carrying groceries ; others are pathetic waifs , dope addicts , and irresponsible rebels .
While there are significant dangers from living on the street , one study showed that the physical and emotional health of the street children is often better than that of their brothers and sisters who remain at home .
The street children have developed a level of life that very adequately compensates for the deprivations in their homes .
The authors who have studied this phenomena note a significant difference in the average weight which favors the street children when comparing them with their siblings at home , which [ is due ] to better nutrition .
5
Much of the research shows that these children , though mostly uneducated and illiterate , are surprisingly intelligent , and have a keen ability to take care of themselves .
Indeed , begging in such a competitive environment is hard work that requires intelligence , social insight , and stamina .
6
But some ask , " If these children are so smart , how do they come to live on the dangerous streets ? "
The answer lies in where these children come from .
Most are not abandoned , but come from fatherless families .
If a father or stepfather is present , he often makes the children work and hand over their earnings .
With either an absent father or one who seems to care only about the money , the children begin to look to the streets for caring , secure relationships , often finding better relationships there than at home .
7
In the streets , they find two key replacements : peer friendships and older , father - like males .
The boys typically begin to investigate the relational options on the streets and discover that they are better than the options at home .
At night these small boys can be seen huddled together under blankets or newspapers , squeezed into cardboard cartons , in ways that are a picture of the emotional comfort they find in these intensely close relationships .
In the daytime much of their attempts at finding food or money are done together , and they typically share in each other 's success .
8
All of this makes me think of the dozens of adolescents I have treated , so many of whom have followed a path similar to that of these street children .
These children began to look outside their homes for emotional replacements for their fathers ( and occasionally their mothers ) .
Their friends became their families , and their older friends or mentors became their heroes .
While part of this process is typical of adolescence , it often occurs early or is more pronounced when the child feels like an orphan due to a mediocre father relationship .
Orphan Survival
While some of those with orphan feelings give up ( emotionally or physically ) , many rise from their loneliness and make a decision to take care of themselves .
They learn how to take the best advantage of any situation .
In the evening ... [ Roberto and Antonio went to fashionable Sixth Avenue ] .
After receiving some malignant looks and rude comments from people , they stopped on a side street where a rather young affluent couple were dining at an open - air restaurant , a few feet from the street .
When the boys asked them for food , the couple tried to ignore them .
The two boys sensed that they were intruding on a special occasion and so were insistent , thinking that they were likely to be paid to leave the diners alone .
Finally the man who was dining told them in a loud voice to leave .
When they did not , he called the waiter for help , who halfheartedly told the boys to go .
They went across the street , maintaining minor eye contact with the diners , who were losing the pleasure of their occasion .
As the waiter disappeared for the moment inside the restaurant , Roberto approached from one side and asked once again for something to eat ; Antonio came from the other direction and grabbed a piece of meat off the man 's plate .
Running and laughing , they headed into the darkened street ... [ And ] tiredly entered their vacant corner , which they called " home . "
9
Could it be that Roberto and Antonio were not just trying to fill their empty stomachs ?
They might have met with quicker - and less risky - success elsewhere .
The two boys seemed to be also working that day to fill their emotional hunger and emptiness , and their stimulating exploits helped them do that .
When you feel an emotional hole , you will look to anything that might possibly fill it .
Sometimes individuals with orphan feelings use food , drinking , constant exercise , sex and aggression , movies , intense music , excess work , or drugs - anything to temper their sense of vulnerability .
Occasionally I see a desperate orphan - like survival reaction in the middle of marriage counseling .
John and Lila had been married for six years and had one newborn child .
After the baby 's birth , Lila cut her work hours , bringing on new financial pressures , and John 's work responsibilities were increased ( with no raise ) .
These developments added a significant amount of stress to their relationship .
Both parents reacted like orphans .
" When I try to share my feelings he reacts and gets his ' Mr. Know - It - All ' face on , " Lila said .
" I want to pop him one when he gets that pompous look . "
" She can share all the feelings she wants , " John chimes in .
" It 's not the feelings I get annoyed at , although the first three minutes in the door is hardly the time I want to hear them .
Her expectation is that at any moment I will drop everything else and try to meet her needs . "
" What is it you want from her , John ? " I asked .
" You know ... some space .
A little bit of freedom .
Not feeling as if I 'm giving my last ounce of strength when I 'm with her . "
" And Lila , what do you want from John ? "
" If I share my feelings with him , I do n't want to be told that I 'm wrong , and have him belittle me . "
" Anything else ? "
" Ummm ... yeah .
I just doubt that he 's ever going to have time for me , because - "
" She says that even after I 've been with her for three hours , " John interrupted .
" She never thinks I 'm spending enough time with her , even when I 've spent the entire weekend with her . "
In listening to them , I was struck by their orphan - like insistence that they each be heard .
They were unable to hear each other 's concerns because they were in an " emotional protection mode . "
John cried out for freedom and space because he could not find the emotional resources to listen to Lila 's feelings .
Lila thought that John should put her feelings above all else .
However , John is emotionally impoverished ; he has no " energy " to meet many of Lila 's needs , and reacts by refuting her comments or intellectualizing them away .
Basically , both of these people have decided that they will survive in this marriage - regardless of the cost to the other person .
They will " survive " by talking over and over again about what each wants , by ruthlessly defending their individual rights - in short , by acting like orphans .
The Orphan's Loneliness
We can see , from John and Lila 's example , that marriage does not prevent loneliness .
In order to combat loneliness , a marriage needs a measure of intimacy and some wholeness from which to give .
Loneliness can occur in the largest families , in the most crowded conditions , and at all stages of life .
One of my patients , a woman whose father was an irritable alcoholic , told me she used to fill her bed with big dolls and stuffed animals .
Then she would cry herself to sleep at night as she heard her father ranting and raving throughout the house .
Whenever he started shouting , she would clutch her big teddy bear in an attempt to find the comfort and protection she could not find in her father .
She told me through tears that her best friend while she was growing up was that stuffed animal .
My ninety - year - old grandmother is far more mature than that little girl , but she fights orphan loneliness , too .
She and I are very close and talk on the phone at least a couple of times a week .
She still lives in her own home , alone , with an occasional visit from my parents .
She explains how age isolates : " You reach your fifties and a few of your friends die .
You are affected by it , but you have other friends and you move on with your life .
But by the time you reach your eighties , your spouse has died , and any living friends have moved to Florida or are in a nursing home .
Your body decays , and your knees hurt just to stand up .
And going out looks more and more impossible because anything - heat , cold , whatever - really bothers you . "
As my grandmother has aged she has increasingly talked about death , but I guess that is appropriate as her body grows weaker and her feelings of loneliness increase .
Some say death is the one thing we do alone .
It is the point of our greatest loneliness .
But in the case of Mildred , I would have to disagree ...
The Loneliness of Facing Death
Some moments of aloneness are not everyday experiences .
Life ebbs and flows , and so does the sense of isolation .
There are valleys .
And there are mountaintops .
My experience with Mildred was one of those peak experiences in isolation .
She was the first person I ever escorted into death .
She was an elderly woman who had been hospitalized many times ; she had been through radiation and chemotherapy for the lymphoma that had spread throughout her body .
I was a raw , new subintern , a fourth year medical student , assigned to her for a month .
When I went in to see her for the first time it was 6 A.M. and she was sound asleep .
I hated to wake her , but my job required it .
Mildred was annoyed by the interruption .
I apologized for troubling her , in a sleepy manner that only burned - out medical students can do , and asked if she minded my listening to her lungs .
She said she was perfectly willing to do whatever I asked , just as long as I did n't ask her to use any of her own muscles .
It was obvious that she felt miserable , but there was still a glimmer of her old mischievous nature showing through .
She struck me as the kind of person who , as a child , had always gotten under her teacher 's skin .
I 'm sure that she had been full of adventure and trouble , but wise enough not to get caught in her mischief .
We became fast friends .
After a few weeks , it became clear that Mildred was going to die , but no one wanted to admit it .
Her doctors procrastinated , but it was reaching the point where I felt she should be told where things stood .
She would talk to me about what was going to happen when she went home , and I would sit there listening as if I thought it was really going to happen .
It made me feel like a terrible fraud , so I finally asked the senior doctor 's permission - which he granted - to talk to her about her situation .
Mildred accepted the news stoically .
After we talked about her terminal condition , I came to see her two or three times every day .
Her two daughters came to visit , too , but they had their own responsibilities and were already letting go - years of hospitals had worn them out .
Soon our conversations turned to questions of faith .
It seemed to be a comfortable place for us to be - a young doctor and a dying old woman , one person standing at the door of death , experiencing the ultimate orphan emotions , and the other acting as a simple human presence in the dark hospital room .
We prayed every day .
Mildred said it helped for me to hold her hand and pray that God would be with her .
She was so different from me .
We were separated in age by half a century , of different gender , from different ethnic groups .
I had nothing but a future , she had nothing but a past .
But when we prayed , God changed the desperation of a dying orphan into gentle confidence and peace .
I was not with Mildred when she died .
I had said good - bye the evening before and we had talked very seriously about her death .
During our last conversation I told her I would see her on the other side , and I hoped she would be there to greet me when my time came to undertake the journey she was about to make .
She smiled and nodded .
She died early the next morning - sometime around 6 A.M .
Her death took me back to my first day with her , when I haltingly entered her room about that same time in the morning .
I thought about isolation and vulnerability , and how , in the end , we are all orphans left to go on our final journey alone .
I had walked her to the foot of the mountain and waved good - bye , but in the end she climbed alone .
Yet I do believe that Someone escorted her on her final climb .
" No Right to Know " : A Wall Street Financial Site 's Attack on Congress and Ron Paul
Nov. 23 , 2009
Wall Street is an economic extension of the big banks , which are the government - protected segment of a government - created cartel : the national bank system .
The government controls entry into this cartel , thus offering above - market rates of return to those who are approved .
The primary enforcer of this cartel is the Federal Reserve System .
The FED provides the fiat money that in turn provides banks with reserves to lend .
It also serves as the lender of last resort -- officially , to the government ; operationally , to the banks .
This keeps the largest banks from having to face free market competition .
We can use this syllogism :
As goes the Federal Reserve System so go the big banks .
As go the big banks , so goes Wall Street .
Wall Street is hostile to any suggestion that the U. S. government has any legitimate authority to audit its creation : the Federal Reserve System .
The government 's authority must be limited to enforcing the barrier to entry in banking .
Anything beyond this is conceptually and operationally illegitimate .
This is the party line of the Wall Street establishment .
It has been since before the creation of the FED in 1913 .
The Federal Reserve was the joint product of a mutually beneficial alliance between the Morgan bank and the largest Rockefeller bank .
The story of this alliance is here
The Federal Reserve System has been described as the Temple .
That is because , ever since 1914 , it has been sacrosanct : above politics and above the law .
It has also been the inner sanctum .
No unauthorized person is allowed to open its door .
Congressman Ron Paul dared to introduce a bill , H.R. 1207 , that would require an audit of the FED by a government agency .
The House of Representatives agrees with him .
He got over 300 co-signers of the bill .
Barney Frank at first tried to bottle it up in committee .
Then he tried to substitute a watered - down version .
The committee voted for Paul 's version last week .
This was a palace revolt against Frank .
This does not happen often in any committee .
This is the first bill in Paul 's long career that has had widespread support .
This indicates that the Federal Reserve , for the first time since 1914 , has serious opposition in Congress .
This in an historic event .
The FED can no longer presume that Congress will treat it with kid gloves .
The Wall Street establishment understands the threat .
HACK ATTACK
Consider this hatchet piece on Ron Paul , written by a partner of a financial website , 24/7.com , one Douglas A. McIntyre .
He is a frequent author on The Huffington Post .
In assessing Ron Paul 's career and recent effort to audit the Federal Reserve , he began with an apocryphal story about insane asylum inmates .
There is a rumor that has been around Hollywood for decades that some of the greatest silent film comedy scripts were created by screen writers who would bribe wardens at a local insane asylum to allow a patient to sit in on their story meetings .
Allegedly , some of the most hilarious moments in the history of comedic cinema came out of ideas from the minds of people who spent all of their time on locked wards .
Even the craziest person in the world can give birth to an idea which is both brilliant and intelligible .
To begin an analysis of a serious piece of legislation with an unrelated story that is obviously nuttier than the alleged inmates gives an indication of the seriousness of Mr. McIntyre 's critique .
Mr. McIntyre continued :
Paul came up with the idea some time ago that the activities of the Federal Reserve are conducted in secret and that the public should have the right to know how , when , and to whom the nation 's central bank lends it money .
He has finally convinced enough of his peers about the validity of his concerns .
Now , the Financial Services Committee has approved an amendment to allow government auditors the right to look at the entire balance sheet of the Federal Reserve .
Paul 's quest to bring down the Fed has finally gotten to the point at which the Board of Governors needs to be concerned .
He 's got that right !
This is Paul 's position , and the Board of Governors is extremely concerned .
Paul 's amendment is part of a larger bill that intends to deal with the consequences that any future failure of large banks might have on the global credit markets .
His program for the Fed may set a precedent that will serve as a model for the entire financial services industry .
To " set a precedent " means to begin a new era .
H.R. 1207 is indeed a precedent .
It marks the first time since 1914 that a branch of Congress has asserted its statutory authority over its own creation .
The legal right to audit is an assertion of legal authority .
The Board of Governors sees this .
The Fed 's argument against Paul 's proposal is simple and defensible .
The agency keeps important secrets including which large banks need substantial amounts of money during hard times .
The public cannot know these details because it would cause a national panic .
What if it was common knowledge that Citigroup ( NYSE:C ) had borrowed $ 100 billion in emergency funds from the agency ?
Citi's stock could lose 90 % of its value in a day .
The Fed wants to keep secrets to prevent runs on major banks .
The Fed , its defenders would argue , is the home to impartial financial minds that have the best interests of the nation 's credit system at heart .
The average person would not be able to stand the strain of watching the agency 's daily high wire act up close , certainly not during a crisis .
Let me summarize .
The Federal Reserve System has always had the right to conduct secret bailouts of big banks that are in fact insolvent , and whose senior managers are being paid millions of dollars a year to deceive depositors , shareholders , and creditors .
This must not be changed .
Paul 's logic , as it applies to the Fed , will probably end up being part of a banking system overhaul that will tempt Congress to have audits of private banks made public as well .
The bill implies no such thing .
It says only that an agency created by the U.S. government is under the authority of the U.S. government .
This is intolerable , says Mr. McIntyre .
Secrecy is basic to all government .
There is a fundamental right of selected government bureaucrats -- self - selected -- not to have their decisions supervised by Congress , audited by Congress , or in any way known by Congress .
Public companies and government agencies have a history of defending secrets that goes back to well before the founding of the modern Federal Reserve and SEC .
This secrecy is based almost exclusively on the premise that a typical shareholder is too stupid to understand the complexity of balance sheets , cash flow statements , and profit and loss reports .
The information has to be put through a sieve before it can be released beyond the CFO 's office and the audit committee of the board of directors .
Mr. McIntyre has come to the defense of every government bureaucrat who ever wanted to hide a payoff , create a boondoggle for a company he was associated with , or run an illegal operation .
This position is the ultimate rejection of democracy : the public 's right to know where the money extracted by taxes has gone .
Mr. McIntyre faithfully represents the position of Ben Bernanke and all defenders of the Federal Reserve .
Mr. McIntyre is articulating the government 's core operating assumption : the right to deceive the public without interference .
Not many defenders of unrestricted government power ever go this far in full public view .
We owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. McIntyre .
He told it like it is .
Paul 's reason for wanting the Federal Reserve to open its kimono is that the public and members of Congress can understand the details of how the agency works without the help of a math , economics , or physics professor .
The public and Congress should be able to influence the Fed because it uses public money and may be putting that capital at unnecessary risk .
He 's got that right !
And does this upset Mr. McIntyre and his pro bono client , Ben Bernanke .
The flaw in the thinking about an " open Fed " is that most elected officials and average citizens are too stupid to understand the Fed .
They do n't have an IQ problem , but they do suffer , in most case , from a lack of education about complex fiscal policy , macroeconomics , and game theories of John Forbes Nash who was himself schizophrenic .
In other words , the Federal Reserve management and staff perform a function that most people cannot possibly understand in any detail .
Citigroup may need $ 100 billion for a week .
That does not mean it is going out of business , or , if it is , the Fed knows enough to call the Treasury Secretary immediately .
I suppose he would apply the same reasoning to the jury system , and draw the same conclusion .
Congress can hire economists to interpret the data .
It does so with respect to NASA or any other government - funded operation .
The point is this : the hired experts must have full access to the financial data in order to make their assessment .
Mr. McIntyre is not a skilled logician .
He treats his readers as if they were idiots .
He is contemptuous of them .
He is trying to put the shuck on the rubes .
It is not entirely unfair to compare what goes on inside the Federal Reserve with what happens at the CIA , FBI , or some parts of the Defense Department .
Secrets are not , in and of themselves wrong , if they protect something in the national interest .
So , the Federal Reserve System is comparable to agencies that prosecute criminals and terrorists .
But what if the FBI , CIA , or the Defense Department were in fact acting as the legal cover for criminals ?
What the FBI were actually putting up the money -- not as a sting operation , but as the money behind the operations ?
Would Congress have the right to know ?
Paul wants to raise the nation 's financial mansion and leave a vacant lot .
It could be especially dangerous for this to happen , especially in a time of fiscal crisis .
Paul wants to make sure that the government can follow the money -- the money created by the Federal Reserve System under the legal authority of the U.S. government .
Mr. McIntyre wants to keep the government from doing this .
He is not alone .
Wall Street has offered no support for H.R. 1207 .
Mr. McIntyre has stated the case boldly and baldly .
It is the case for a cartel of banks whose largest members can tap into the funds of the Federal Reserve , as well as receive T - bills in exchange for toxic assets at face value .
To suggest that this government - created agency should be audited by the government that created it and maintains its immunity from competition is to propose a vacant lot .
This is what passes for a defense of capitalism on Wall Street .
CONCLUSION
Douglas A. McIntyre is not a skilled user of rhetoric .
He is surely not aware of logical cause and effect .
My guess is that Dr. Bernanke would not be happy with this defense of Federal Reserve autonomy .
To argue that Congress is filled with economic dolts is fun for those of us on the fringes of politics .
To have a Wall Street publication make this case on his behalf is not the best strategy , now that the House will be voting on H.R. 1207 .
The way traffic moves over the Internet has changed radically in the last five years , according to a new report , and few people have realized it .
Arbor Networks measures network performance for its customers , but it has also used its vantage point to look at overall Internet trends .
The company found that the bulk of Internet traffic no longer moves across Tier - 1 international transit providers .
Instead , the traffic is handled directly by large content providers , content delivery networks and consumer networks .
That is , it moves directly from one of these edge networks to another , rather than going over a Tier - 1 carrier 's backbone .
Also see : Ethernet everywhere !
You can probably guess what some of these rising providers are : Google , Microsoft , Facebook .
Arbor says there are about 30 of these companies – which Arbor calls “ hyper giants ” – that generate and consume about 30 % of all Internet traffic .
You probably do n’t even think of the Internet in these terms .
I know that I see the Internet as an extremely diverse place with many , many voices , all with their own Web sites .
But the portals or windows that I use to view that world are the same ones that most other people use .
The rise of Google and other companies that provide content , host those many voices , and provide a view into the rest of the Web is profound , and I ’m not sure anyone fully understands the implications of that change .
Arbor says that a more densely interconnected edge network means more traffic will more often be exchanged locally .
Arbor also tries to focus on the changes to the overall Internet commercial ecosystem :
“ A wave of innovation is ongoing , with service providers now offering everything from triple play services to managed security services , VPNs and increasingly , CDNs .
This change in the Internet business ecosystem has significant ongoing implications for backbone engineering , design of Internet scale applications and research . ”
Arbor also notes that Internet applications used to use a more diverse set of application - specific protocols and communication stacks , but that has consolidated as well .
Traffic these days is concentrated on a small number of Web and video protocols , while peer - to - peer traffic has nosedived in the past two years .
Arbor is scheduled to formally present its findings at the NANOG47 meeting in Dearborn , Mich . , next week .
The report draws on more than 256 exabytes of Internet traffic data over two years .
If you have watched almost any Atlanta Thrashers game this season you have probably witnessed this trend - - a first period where they look passive , a better 2nd period and a great 3rd period where they desperately seek to rally .
This pattern has obviously begun to frustrate Coach John Anderson who would prefer a 60 minute effort .
Which is the real Thrashers team ?
Are the Thrashers being lazy in the 1st period , or are they really playing over their heads in the 3rd while the opposition goes into a defensive shell with the lead ?
Perhaps the Thrashers are giving the proverbial 120 % in the 3rd and they are simply incapable of playing at that level for an entire game .
What I do know is that the Thrashers are 7 - 0 - 0 when scoring first and just 3 - 7 - 3 when the opposition scores first .
That tells me that relying on a furious 3rd period is not a sustainable strategy in the long run .
Is this an unusual problem ?
I suspect that if you did a survey of fans of all 30 NHL teams , we would discover that MOST NHL clubs struggle to put forth a consistent effort night after night .
My guess is that MOST teams have bad periods .
A few years ago the Thrashers seemed to always have bad 2nd periods , now it is mostly bad 1st periods .
In the grand scheme of things , I 'd rather have a great 3rd period than great 1st periods only to fade late in the game .
Are teams taking the Thrashers more seriously now ?
When you 're a bottom team in the standings , the opposition rolls into town , throws out the backup goaltender , and sometimes does n't give a full effort .
In my opinion that has begun to change .
This last weekend , I thought that both Pittsburgh and Tampa played very hard and very well in our building .
After the game the Penguins Coach said that it was probably their best 40 minutes of the season in periods 1 and 2 .
I also thought Tampa 's defense was outstanding and their passing was crisp early on .
Is a problem with the lines or chemistry ?
Coach Anderson has shown great patience with line combinations most of the season .
In contrast , Bob Hartley would have changed things up multiple times by now .
I suspect that Anderson 's patience with the lines goes back to his time as an offensive player in the NHL - - he probably preferred having consistent linemates .
It looks like Anderson has chosen to shake things up going with totally new lines late in the game versus Tampa and then keeping them in practice .
Is it a function of youth or inexperience ?
Veteran clubs do n't always play hard every period , but they often play just hard enough to win .
The Thrashers have quite a few key players who are still quite young .
It is logically possible that the young guys have n't learned the trick of getting themselves up on a consistent basis .
Now , I throw this out as a point of discussion , but I can't say that I believe this to be the answer .
When I look at this team , the guys who make things happen every night ( Ilya Kovalchuk , Zach Bogosian , Tobias Enstrom , Ondrej Pavelec ) are all among the younger players on this squad .
Players that have struggled at times ( Kozlov , Little , Hainsey , Reasoner ) are a mixture of old and young guys .
Is it a function of emotion ?
When the Thrashers are playing well , they skate with great passion and energy .
When that passion is n't there , they can look rather lethargic .
To me , the critical thing to watch is their passing and decision making .
If they are making inaccurate passes or bad - idea passes , then I know they are off their game mentally .
Because they run an uptempo offensive - style of game , those bad passes lead to turnovers and quick counterattacks by the opposing team .
The Thrashers do n't play a boring trapping style , and for the team to have success they all have to play with energy and drive , otherwise it is an easy counter - punch for the opponent .
I do n't know what they have to do to get themselves up for a game ( you would think facing the Stanley Cup Champions would do it ) , but right now it is simply insufficient .
( Maybe they need that kid who does the Herb Brooks speech to give them a pre-game pep talk ? )
Given their system , they better be mentally sharp and play with determination and passion to make it work .
The big question on the domestic front right now is whether President Obama understands the gravity of the employment crisis facing the country .
Does he get it ?
The signals coming out of the White House have not been encouraging .
The Beltway crowd and the Einsteins of high finance who never saw this economic collapse coming are now telling us with their usual breezy arrogance that the Great Recession is probably over .
Their focus , of course , is on data , abstractions like the gross domestic product , not the continued suffering of living , breathing human beings struggling with the nightmare of joblessness .
Even Mr. Obama , in an interview with The Times , gave short shrift to the idea of an additional economic stimulus package , telling John Harwood a few weeks ago that the economy had likely turned a corner .
“ As you know , ” the president said , “ jobs tend to be a lagging indicator ; they come last . ”
The view of most American families is somewhat less blasé .
Faced with the relentless monthly costs of housing , transportation , food , clothing , education and so forth , they have precious little time to wait for this lagging indicator to come creeping across the finish line .
Prominent campaigners , politicians and scientists have called for Canada to be suspended from the Commonwealth over its climate change policies .
The coalition 's demand came before this weekend 's Commonwealth heads of government summit in Trinidad and Tobago , at which global warming will top the agenda , and next month 's UN climate conference in Copenhagen .
Despite criticism of Canada 's environmental policies , the prime minister , Stephen Harper , is to attend the Copenhagen summit .
His spokesman said today : " We will be attending the Copenhagen meeting … a critical mass of world leaders will be attending . "
Canada 's per capita greenhouse gas emissions are among the world 's highest and it will not meet the cut required under the Kyoto protocol : by 2007 its emissions were 34 % above its reduction target .
It is exploiting its vast tar sands reserves to produce oil , a process said to cause at least three times the emissions of conventional oil extraction .
The coalition claims Canada is contributing to droughts , floods and sea level rises in Commonwealth countries such as Bangladesh , the Maldives and Mozambique .
Clare Short , the former international development secretary , said : " Countries that fail to help [ tackle global warming ] should be suspended from membership , as are those that breach human rights . "
The World Development Movement , the Polaris Institute in Canada and Greenpeace are among the organisations supporting the plan .
Saleemul Huq , a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , said : " If the Commonwealth is serious about holding its members to account , then threatening the lives of millions of people in developing countries should lead to the suspension of Canada 's membership immediately . "
Canada 's environment department refused to comment on the call for it to be suspended .
The Commonwealth comprises 53 states representing 2 billion people .
In the past it has suspended Pakistan , Zimbabwe , Nigeria and South Africa for electoral or human rights reasons .
Speaking earlier this week , its secretary general , Kamalesh Sharma , said : " I would like to think that our definition of serious violations could embrace much more than it does now . "
Earlier this year , the IFPI gave Norwegian ISP Telenor an ultimatum – block access to The Pirate Bay within days or get taken to court .
Telenor refused , IFPI followed through with its threat and the case was heard earlier this month .
The decision was announced today .
IFPI lost the case and Telenor will not have to block The Pirate Bay .
This March , IFPI – backed by several Hollywood movie companies – gave Telenor , Norway ’s largest ISP , a warning : block your users from accessing The Pirate Bay within 14 days or we will take legal action .
Without any legal basis , Telenor refused to comply .
“ This would be the same as demanding that the postal service should open all letters , and decide which ones should be delivered , ” said Telenor boss Ragnar Kårhus .
The verdict in the case was due to be delivered October 30th , but was delayed until today .
IFPI has lost the case and Telenor will not have to block The Pirate Bay .
The court ruled that Telenor is not contributing to any infringements of copyright law when its subscribers use The Pirate Bay , and therefore there is no legal basis for forcing the ISP to block access to the site .
“ Obviously we are pleased that the District Court has arrived at this conclusion , ” said Telenor ’s Ragnar Kårhus in a statement .
“ At the same time it is important for us to emphasize that this case is not about being in favor of or opposed to copyright , but about whether or not it is reasonable to saddle Internet service providers with a censorship role in respect of content on the Internet , ” he added .
Kårhus went on to say that the most important way for IFPI and other rights holders to maintain healthy revenue streams , is to develop business models and services that render the use of sites like The Pirate Bay less attractive to Internet users .
In making its decision , the court also had to examine the repercussions if it ruled that Telenor and other ISPs had to block access to certain websites .
This , it said , is usually the responsibility of the authorities and handing this task to private companies would be “ unnatural ” .
This is a breaking news story and will be updated .
Description :
This application claims priority to co-pending U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/033,765 filed on Mar. 4 , 2008 , which provisional application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety .
FIELD
This invention is related to transformations and animations of objects in web - based content .
2. Description of the Related Technology
Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) is a well - known stylesheet language used to describe presentation of a document written in a markup language , such as HTML , XML , and XHTML , for example .
CSS may be designed primarily to separate document content ( typically written in a markup language ) from document presentation ( written in CSS ) .
This separation between the document content and the document 's presentation can allow for improved content accessibility , more flexibility and control in the specification and presentation characteristics , and reduced complexity and repetition in structural content .
CSS standardized specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) .
To parse documents including CSS , HTML , and other technologies , a document rendering model , or layout engine may be needed .
These layout engines parse the document content and document presentation to be displayed to the user .
One such layout engine may be Apple 's WebKit , which may be an open source application framework that parses CSS , HTML , and other technologies quickly and efficiently .
Increasingly , CSS documents must be able to provide users a richer , dynamic , and interactive experience on and off the Internet .
As such , various technologies have emerged to provide simple animations and transforms of various objects within a given document 's content .
One prevalent technology today is Adobe Systems '
Flash technology , which may be used by content creators to provide a rich and vivid experience on the Internet .
In creating Flash - based content , content creators often have to develop the Flash - based content in a separate program , and then embed the Flash - based content in the document .
This developmental separation between the Flash - based content and the document content itself often means that two developmental platforms are needed to create document content for a single document in order to provide simple animation and transforms .
With improved support for Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) in web browsers , web developers have been able to make use of CSS to control presentation of documents written in hypertext markup language ( HTML ) independently of its content .
Each content element within a web page may be assigned a set of stylistic rules that dictates presentation of that element .
In this manner , markup pages can be presented in different styles .
CSS further provides priority schemes that determine which style rules are applied if more than one rule matches a particular content element .
This behavior may be referred to as cascade and makes use of weights that are calculated and assigned to rules to provide predictable outcomes .
CSS styles can be provided in separate documents or embedded in markup documents .
Style sheets can be imported and alternative style sheets specified for user selection .
CSS provides various facilities to control both the appearance of single elements on web pages , for example their size and background color , and how various different elements on pages may be presented visually with respect to each other .
For example , properties may be provided that control back - to - front ordering of different elements , and whether elements “ clip ” elements inside of it .
These rendering behaviors may be described by Cascading Style Sheets specifications .
In order to create a single cohesive platform to provide static and animated objects within a given document , Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) has been developed .
SVG may be an XML specification and file format for describing two - dimensional vector graphics .
Using SVG allows content developers to provide an interactive and animated experience for a user using a single authoritative platform in which to create both the document content and document presentation when used in conjunction with XML / XHTML and often CSS .
However , SVG - based content typically relies on a document content to be written in XML or XHTML , or some combination thereof , in order for the content to be displayed properly to a user .
Thus , many old and new document contents that rely on HTML and CSS need to be completely rewritten in order to display SVG - based content .
Other limitations exist for both platforms .
Flash - based content suffers from not being truly three - dimensional .
Flash often uses the notion of perceived three - dimensional content to create animations and perspective .
Using SVG also has the downfall of not being fully supported by many document rendering models despite being an open standard by the W3C .
In not being fully supported by many document - rendering models , a document 's content may not even be displayed to a user .
A simply empty void space with a red “ x ” may just mark the spot where the SVG content should have been displayed .
Furthermore , Flash may be generally very computer processor intensive in nature and may reduce battery life on mobile devices significantly .

FIG .
1A is a block diagram of computing system 100 including computing device 150 in communication with web application 105 .
Computing system 100 may be used to implement certain systems and methods described herein .
Depending on the embodiment , the functionality described below with reference to certain components and modules of computing system 100 may be combined into fewer components and modules or further separated into additional components or modules .
In one embodiment , web application 105 may be accessed and manipulated via a network , such as Internet 120 using communication link 115 .
In another embodiment , web application 105 may be local to computing device 150 .
On software level 145 , as mentioned above , web application 105 may include document content and document presentation , such as CSS 110 , that may be rendered using layout engine 125 .
Web application 105 may include various webpages that include transforms and animations of various objects in the document content .

Furthermore , layout engine 125 may include a scripting framework , such as JavaScript , to specify various scripting parameters for the document content and / or document presentation .
A scripting framework , such as JavaScript 160 may be used in conjunction with CSS 110 to render web application 105 .
Further details of JavaScript 160 will be explained below .
Display engine 130 may be used by layout engine 125 to help render certain aspects , such as animations , of the document content and document presentation of web application 105 .
Display engine 130 may be implemented as Core Animation software from Apple Computer Inc. Display engine 130 may be a data visualization API and framework used by Apple 's Mac OS X 10.5 to produce animated user interfaces .
Display engine 130 may provide a way for developers to produce animated user interfaces via an implicit animation model .
A developer using display engine 130 may only specify original and final states of an object in a webpage or web application 105 , and display engine 130 handles transitions between the original and final states of the object .
In one embodiment , display engine 130 may allow animated interfaces to be created with relative ease , as no specific code for the animation may be required by the developer .
Graphics driver 135 may be used by display engine 130 to help render any animations in web application 105 .
Graphics driver 135 may be implemented based on Open Graphics Library ( OpenGL ) , which may be a standard specification defining a cross- language cross-platform API for writing applications that produce 2D and 3D computer graphics .
Graphics driver 135 can be used to draw complex three - dimensional scenes from simple primitive shapes or models .
Other hardware or software acceleration may be used to help render any animations in web application 105 .
Operating system ( OS ) layer 140 may control graphics driver 135 and other aspects of web application 105 and computing device 150 .
Operating system layer 140 may include Mac OS X , Linux , Windows , or any number of operating systems .
Conventional operating systems control and schedule computer processes for execution , perform memory management , provide file system , networking , and I/O services , and provide a user interface , such as a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , among other things .
In an exemplary embodiment , a computing device receives a webpage ( including a document content and a document presentation with moving objects ) , and using layout engine 125 and / or display engine 130 and / or graphics driver 140 , renders the webpage to be displayed on a visual display .
In one embodiment , the webpage or information about the webpage may be stored on the computing device in a cache storage .
The cache storage may be used for temporary or permanent storage of various files for the webpage .
On hardware level 146 , computing device 150 can include memory 155 , such as random access memory ( RAM ) for temporary storage of information and read only memory ( ROM ) for permanent storage of information , and mass storage device 151 , such as a hard drive , diskette , or optical media storage device .
Mass storage device 151 may include one or more machine readable storage media , such as a hard disk drive , optical drive , networked drive , or some combination of various digital storage systems .
Computing device 150 can also include a central processing unit ( CPU ) 153 for computation .
Typically , the modules of computing device 150 are in data communication via one or more standards - based bus system .
In different embodiments , the standards based bus system could be Peripheral Component Interconnect ( PCI ) , Microchannel , SCSI , Industrial Standard Architecture ( ISA ) and Extended ISA ( EISA ) architectures , for example .

Exemplary computing devices may include an Apple Macintosh , Windows based computing devices , Linux based computing devices , or mobile devices , such as Apple 's iPhone and iPod touch devices .
FIG .
1B shows an exemplary block diagram of layout engine 125 with software development kit ( SDK ) 170 .
In an exemplary embodiment , a developer may use SDK 170 in conjunction with layout engine 125 to form web applications .
These web applications may be loaded on various mobile and desktop devices 173 across Internet 120 or be loaded locally onto devices 173 .
To form user interface widgets , developer platform such as Dashcode 171 may be used .
It may be appreciated that user interface widgets are “ miniature applications ” that may provide a variety of functions , such as stock and weather checking .
It may be appreciated that other developer platforms may also be used to create web applications .
To protect the security of SDK 170 and web application 105 derived from SDK 170 , security mechanism 173 may be used .
In one embodiment , a developer may be provided with a key / token after signing up as a developer and providing a list of mobile device ( e.g. iphone , iPod touch ) identifiers to an organization , such as Apple Inc .
The organization may then embed keys in the mobile devices so that the keys are trusted , and the developer can use the keys to sign applications for specific devices .
These keys allow the developer to develop applications for mobile devices .
In one embodiment , the developer can then compile and sign applications for his / her mobile device , known as code signing .
However , the developer be prevented from posting the application on a network , such as the Internet in a form that other people can download and use .
The CSS visual formatting model describes a coordinate system within which each element may be positioned .
Positions and sizes in this coordinate space can be thought of as being expressed in pixels , starting in the upper left corner of the parent with positive values proceeding to the right and down .
CSS transforms are a method of transforming objects in document content using only CSS and HTML .
In one embodiment , using CSS transforms allows a developer of web applications to develop web applications that utilize various transformational properties of CSS transforms to manipulate one or more objects being displayed on the screen .
In an advantageous environment , the objects can be displayed on a visual display to a user and be manipulated with or without feedback from the user .
In one embodiment , the CSS transforms do not affect the flow of the current surroundings of the web application and / or web page .
However , in one embodiment , the value of an overflow area caused by the transform takes into account transformed elements .
For example , this behavior may be similar to what happens when elements are translated via relative positioning .
If the value of a CSS transform overflow property is “ scroll ” or “ auto , ” then scrollbars may appear as needed to allow viewing of content transformed outside a visible area .
CSS transforms use a syntax model in order to define certain parameters for a given object in a document content .
In one embodiment , the syntax model may be defined as follows :
webkit - transform : [ CSS transform property ] ( attributes1 , attributes2 , attributesN ) ;
However , the syntactical structure of the CSS transforms may vary .
Of note , the properties described herein can comply with the existing syntactic rules of CSS .
Embodiments of the present disclosure may , however , may provide new names of the properties and how their values are described .
In one embodiment , certain elements , such as the “ webkit ” prefix , may not be needed if these properties are adopted by the W3C organization .
As mentioned above , specific properties of CSS transforms may include scaling , rotating , translating , skewing , transform matrices , perspective , origin , and style .
A brief explanation of these transformational properties may be displayed in the table below :
CSS transform property Explanation scale , scaleX , scaleY Scale an object around the transform origin .
rotate Rotate an object around the transform origin .
translate , translateX , Translate an object .
translateY skew , skewX , skewY
Skew an object .
matrix Specify a full transform matrix .
perspective Gives an object perspective .
transform - origin Rotates an object around a defined origin .
transform - style Defines how nested elements are rendered in 3D space back - face visible Defines visibility of a backface of a two - dimensional figure
A more detailed explanation of each of these properties may be explained below using a CSS created box as a reference point .
In one embodiment , a CSS box can be created using the following CSS code :
< style type =“ text/css ” > . showbox { float : left ; margin : 4 em 1em ; width : 100 px ; height : 60 px ; border : 1 px solid green ; background - color : # fff ; line - height : 60 px ; text - align : center ; } </style >
The previous CSS code defines a CSS created box with a width of 100 px , a height of 60 px , with a 1 px solid green border .
The “ float : left ” applies to the box itself , and may control how the box is positioned relative to surrounding elements .
It does not affect the text within the box , which is horizontally centered by the “ text - align ” rule .
In one embodiment , a scale transform may be used to manipulate an object .
Scaling may refer to a change in shape and / or size of an object .
Using the property scale , an object may scale in size ( increasing or decreasing ) according to attributes defined in the CSS transform syntax .
Attributes assigned to the scale transform can be positive , or negative to flip an object .
Accordingly , using the property scaleX , an object may scale ( increasing or decreasing ) in size in the x-coordinate plane using the Cartesian coordinate system .
Likewise , using the property scaleY , an object may scale ( increasing or decreasing ) in size in the y - coordinate plane using the Cartesian coordinate system .
Likewise , using the property scaleZ , an object may scale ( increasing or decreasing ) in size in the z - coordinate plane .
In one embodiment , scaleX , scaleY , and scaleZ can be represented using a system of scaling vectors : [ sx , 1,1 ] , [ 1 , sy, 1 ] , [ 1,1, sz ] respectively .
FIGS .
2A , 2B , 2C illustrate box 210 scaled in twice in size in the x-y plane ( box 212 ) , x- plane ( box 214 ) , and the y - plane ( box 216 ) , respectively .
In one embodiment , the CSS transform property , scale3d , may be used to specify a three - dimensional scale operation by the [ sx , sy , sz ] scaling vector as described by the 3 parameters .
Thus , a two - dimensional or three - dimensional object may be scaled along the x , y , or z axis .
Objects other than boxes , such as images and text may be transformed using the scale CSS transform property .
In one embodiment , a rotate transform may be used to manipulate an object .
In one embodiment , rotation may refer to a rotation of an object .
Using the rotate property , an object may rotate clockwise around an axis a number of radians or degrees .
As in the scale transform , rotateX , rotateY , rotateZ , and rotate3d may be used to rotate an object around the x-axis , y - axis , z- axis , and along the three - dimensional coordinate plane as specified in the attributes .
In one embodiment , the rotate transform may correspond to the following 2×3 matrix :
cos (a ) sin( a ) − sin( a ) cos(a ) 0 0
However , it may be appreciated that other matrices with different rows and columns may be used .
FIG .
3A show block 310 rotated thirty degrees around origin 311 to become block 312 .
FIG .
3B show block 310 rotated ninety degrees around origin 313 to become block 314 .
In one embodiment , a translate transform may be used to manipulate an object .
In one embodiment , translation may refer to the displacement of an object relative to the original location of the object .
In one embodiment , an object may be translated around the x -axis , y - axis , and / or z- axis .
FIG .
4 shows block 410 translated along the x-axis 10em , along the y - axis − 10em , and along the x-y axis 10em as shown in blocks 412 , 414 , and 416 respectively .
As box 410 translates to either block 412 , 414 , 416 , then block 410 may be displaced from its original location .
As in the scale transform , translated , translatedY , translateZ , and translate3d may be used to translate an object around the x-axis , y - axis , z- axis , and along the three - dimensional coordinate plane as specified in the attributes .
In one embodiment , different measurement values , in addition to em units may be used , such as points , picas , and / or millimeters .
In one embodiment , a skew transform may be used to manipulate an object .
In one embodiment , skewing may refer to an oblique or slanted shape of a given object .
In one embodiment , an object may be skewed around the x -axis , y - axis , and / or z- axis .
FIG .
5 shows block 510 skewed thirty degrees about the origin 511 as shown in block 512 .
As in the scale transform , skewX , skewY , skewZ , and may be used to translate an object around the x-axis , y - axis , z - axis coordinate plane as specified in the attributes of the skew transform .
In one embodiment , a matrix transform may be used to manipulate an object .
In one embodiment , a matrix may be defined to specify a 2D transformation in the form of a transformation matrix of six values .
FIG .
6 shows block 610 in its initial state with center 613 before any matrix transforms .
Arrows 611 indicate a general direction of the transformation of block 610 under a matrix transformation of matrix ( 1,1,3,0 , −2,−2 ) .
In one embodiment , this matrix transformation may be a multiplication of vertices of block 610 by a matrix defined by attributes indicated in a matrix argument .
Depending on the embodiment , the matrix transformation may be multiplied by either a 1×6 , 2×3 , or 3×2 matrix .
It may be appreciated that other matrices with different rows and columns may be used .
Also , depending on the embodiment , the matrix transformation may be thought of as a multiplication of various smaller matrices .
In one embodiment , a matrix3d transform may be defined to manipulate an object .
In an exemplary embodiment , the matrix3d transform may be defined as follows :
matrix3d ( < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > , < number > )
This matrix3D transform specifies a 3D transformation as a 4×4 homogeneous matrix of 16 values in column - major order .
In one embodiment , a perspective transform may be used to manipulate an object in order to give a sense of depth to the way objects are displayed .
In one embodiment , the perspective transform may specify a perspective projection matrix that maps a viewing cube onto a truncated pyramid whose base represents the furthest visible z value and whose peak represents the viewer 's position .
The viewing cube may be defined as the region bounded by the four edges of the viewport ( the portion of the browser window used for rendering the webpage plus the nearest and furthest z values of the screen ) .
A depth , given as the parameter to the perspective function , represents the height of the pyramid .
Lower values give a more flattened pyramid and therefore a more pronounced pyramid effect .
FIG .
7 gives an exemplary example using the perspective transform on block 710 .
Block 712 shows a result of the perspective transform with an attribute of 20 .
Larger and smaller values of the perspective transform may give an object a more realistic appearance if it has been rotated a certain number of degrees .
In one embodiment , a transform - origin transform may be used to manipulate an object in order to scale around a defined origin of the object .
The transform - origin transform may be used to define an origin for an object and then scale the object around that origin .
In one embodiment , the transform - origin transform may be applied by first translating an element by a negated value of attributes assigned to the transform , then applying the object 's transform and then translating by the attribute value .
In this method , the method effectively moves the desired transformation origin of the object to ( 0,0 ) in the local Cartesian coordinate system , then applies the object 's transform , and then moves the object back to its original position .
FIG . 8A and FIG .
8B both show block 810 transformed by using the transform - origin transform .
In FIG .
8A , block 812 has been scaled down 50 % around origin 811 of ( x1 , y1 ) in the local coordinate plane to form block 810 .
In FIG .
8B , block 810 has also been scaled down 50 % around origin 813 of ( x2 , y2 ) to produce block 814 .
In one embodiment , a transform - style transform may be used to manipulate an object in order to specify a hierarchy of transforms and which styles to apply to those transforms .
This particular transform defines how nested objects are rendered in three - dimensional space .
In one embodiment , if the transform - style has a value of “ flat , ” all children of this element are rendered flattened into the 2D plane of the element .
Therefore , rotating the element about the X or Y axes may cause children positioned at positive or negative Z positions to appear on the element 's plane , rather than in front of or behind it .
In one embodiment , if the transform - style has a value of “ perspective , ” this flattening may not be performed , so children maintain their position in 3D space .
This flattening takes place at each element , so preserving a hierarchy of elements in 3D space requires that each ancestor in the hierarchy have the value “ perspective ” for transform - style .
But since the transform - style affects only an element 's children , the leaf nodes in a hierarchy do not require the perspective style .
In other words , the transform - style transform allows for selective application of a style to any level of a hierarchy .
As shown in FIG .
9 , object 910 may be considered the parent and objects 912 and 914 may be considered child # 1 and child # 2 of parent 910 , respectively .
In one embodiment , object 912 may be positioned at positive or negative positions on the z-axis of a three - dimensional coordinate axis relative to object 914 .
In one embodiment , any of a particular transform may be applied to object 912 independent of object 914 .
Selective application of a transform may be applied to any level of the parent - child hierarchy .
Backface - visibility may be a visibility property having values of “ visible ” or “ hidden . ”
Backface - visibility applies to the back side of an object that has been transformed in three dimensions .
This particular property thus allows a two - dimensional object to be created with information along both sides of the object , visible or not .
For example , two - dimensional green - colored square 1000 can be created with green side 1001 facing the user , as shown in FIG .
10A . A user can then “ flip ” the green - colored square around to expose other side 1002 of square 1000 where drop - down menu 1003 of other color choices , such as red , orange , blue , and yellow , may be selected .
Upon selecting a new color choice , square 1000 can be “ flipped ” back to its original state in newly selected color 1004 .
One embodiment , illustrated in FIG .
10 C , uses CSS and six images 1050 , 1051 , 1052 , 1053 , 1054 , and 1055 in the shape of squares , six images 1050 , 1051 , 1052 , 1053 , 1054 , and 1055 which can be combined together to form three - dimensional box 1070 .
In one embodiment , a user perspective can be virtually situated inside the box 1070 and then visualize the images from within the box in a pseudo three - dimensional world .
In one embodiment , block 1060 may be used as an intermediary step between images 1050 , 1051 , 1052 , 1053 , 1054 , and 1055 and block 1070 .
In one embodiment , an opaqueness value may be selected for the square in the prior example .
In one embodiment , the opaqueness value may be selected from a range of 0 - 1 , where a value of “ 0 ” may indicate no opaqueness while a value of “ 1 ” may indicate full opaqueness .
FIG .
10B shows block 1010 with opaqueness value “ 0 ” flipped around showing the other face 1020 .
Likewise , block 1030 with opaqueness value “ 1 ” flipped around to show backside 1040 .
Javascript may be used for clientside web development .
In one embodiment , Javascript can be combined with CSS transforms to transform various objects in a web application or on a webpage .
Furthermore , the javascript CSS combination can be used to apply various styles to an object .
For example , the following code snippet may be used to apply a style to rotate element “ e ” twenty degrees :
e.style.transform=“ rotate ( 20 deg ) ” .
Element “ e ” may reference an object , “ style.transform ” may refer to a style of type “ transform ” to element “ e , ” and rotate ( x° ) may refer to the number of degrees to rotate element “ e . ”
In one embodiment , the previous code snippet may be applied to matrices in the exemplary code snippet :
e.style.transform = ” rotate ( x° ) ” ; var m = example .
transform ; m.multiply ( mm ) ; e.style.transform = m ;
The previous code snippet shows how Javascript and a Javascript like syntax may be used to define certain transforms on an object , in addition to applying a current transform to a variable .
Using Javascript , matrices can be multiplied and the resulting matrix can then be applied to a particular transform .
In one embodiment , by using Javascript , it is possible to create and assign transform values in JavaScript , thus allowing sets of related transforms to be described programmatically , and dynamically .
Referring back to FIGS .
1A and 1B , the new CSS model for CSS transforms and CSS animations may be referenced using SDK 170 .
In one embodiment , using SDK 170 , a developer can reference information in CSS for software development models .
As mentioned above , SDK 170 may use layout engine 125 and JavaScript 160 to form web applications for mobile or desktop devices .
Furthermore , these web applications have a security level , limiting certain access rights , as explained earlier .
However , embodiments of the present invention apply equally to desktop browsers or browsers on any sort of electronic device .
As mentioned above , animation refers to any animated quality , liveliness , vivacity , and / or spirit of an object in a webpage or web application .
Using CSS animations , CSS transforms can be animated to show a transition between one state to another state .
Normally , when the value of a CSS property changes , the rendered result may be instantly updated , with the changed elements immediately changing from the old property value to the new property value .
Using new CSS properties , transitions may be made to animate smoothly from the old state to the new state over a selected time interval .
In one embodiment , CSS animations should have one or more property definitions specifying additional information : whether or not it may be animatable and how it should animate .
In one embodiment , animatable properties are all of those that allow values of the type integer , number , length , percentage , color , time , angle , or transform list , for example .
Additionally , some properties that take keyword values , such as visibility , may combine with typical timing functions and animations
For example , visibility may be used in conjunction with timing functions to cause an object to show when an animation started and hide when the animation ended .
CSS animation allows for two types of animation .
The first type of animation are implicit transitions , which describe how CSS properties can be made to change smoothly from one value to another .
The second type of animation are defined animations , which define values that CSS properties may take over a selected time interval .
An object may have a property assigned to that object indicating specific properties that the object may have .
For example , properties , such as opacity levels and colors may be assigned to an object .
For example :
div{transition - property : opacity;}
defines a transition on the opacity property for all < div > elements .
Thus , when a new value may be assigned to the opacity property , a smooth transition may occur between the old opacity value and the new opacity value .
However , each of the transition properties can accept a comma-separated list , allowing multiple transitions to be defined , each transition acting on a different property .
For example :
div{transition - property : opacity , left;}
may define a transition property on the opacity property and the left property .
Additionally , durations , or a specified interval of time , may be set over which to animate an object .
Thus , when a transition - duration and a transition - property are assigned to an object , then the object may animate according to the assigned property for a duration of time as assigned by the transition - duration property .
For example :
div { transition - property : opacity , left ; transition - duration : 2s , 4s ; }
may cause the opacity property to transition over a period of two seconds and the left property to transition over a period of four seconds .
FIG . 11 shows an exemplary embodiment of the transition - duration property combined with the transition - property property .
In this embodiment , block 1110 may be assigned an opacity value “ 1 ” and set to fade - out ( i.e. go from opacity value “ 1 ” to an opacity value “ 0 ” ) over a period of one second .
Block 1120 shows block 1110 after 0.25 seconds with an opacity value 0.75 .
After 0.5 seconds , block 1130 shows block 1110 with an opacity value 0.75 .
After 0.75 seconds , block 1140 shows block 1110 with an opacity value 0.5 .
Accordingly , after 1 second , block 1110 would have an opacity value 0 and will not be visible .
Although FIG .
11 shows a clean and smooth transition between block 1110 and block 1140 , older document rendering models may not necessarily support CSS transforms and CSS animations .
However , in these older document rendering models , block 1110 may degrade from block 1110 to being invisible without intermediate blocks 1120 , 1130 , 1140 .
This graceful degrading may work in other CSS transitions and CSS animations , such as skewing and translation in addition to opacity changes and timing durations .
In one embodiment , a keypath syntax may be specified for the transition - property property .
A keypath syntax would enable different transitions to be specified for components of a property .
For example , the blur of a shadow could have a different transition than the color of a shadow .
The transition - timing - function property describes how intermediate values used during a transition may be calculated .
For example , if a square has a transform property indicating to move from point A to point B , then the transition - timing - function may indicate exactly how the square moves from point A to point B. Furthermore , the transition - timing - function allows for a transition to change speed over its duration .
In one embodiment , these transitions are commonly called easing functions and depend on a mathematical function called a cubic Bézier curve to provide a smooth transition between the transitions .
In one embodiment , the cubic Bézier curve may be defined by four control points , P0 through P3 . P0 and P3 may be always set to values ( 0 , 0 ) and ( 1 , 1 ) respectively .
Thus , the transition - timing - function can be used to specify values for points P1 and P2 .
These values can be set to preset values using the keywords listed below , or can be set to specific values using the cubic - bezier function .
In the cubic - bezier function , P1 and P2 are each specified by both an X and Y value .
Name of timing function cubic - bezier attributes default cubic - bezier ( 0.25 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 1.0 ) linear cubic - bezier ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ease - in cubic - bezier ( 0.42 , 0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ease - out cubic - bezier ( 0 , 0 , 0.58 , 1.0 ) ease - in - out cubic - bezier ( 0.42 , 0 , 0.58 , 1 )
FIG . 12 shows two Be zier graphs 1200 and 1250 showing exemplary Bézier curves 1205 and 1255 for the ease - out and ease - in - out timing functions .
As can be seen in graph 1200 , control point 1210 may be placed to indicate where the curve 1105 may go for the ease - out timing function .
Likewise , in graph 1250 , two control points 1260 , 1270 are placed near the top and bottom of curve 1255 to indicate how the curve may go for the ease - in - out timing function .
Thus , a transition following these timing functions may follow the Bézier curves when going from one point to another point .
In one embodiment , a delay in the transition may be needed in order to keep several objects within the same webpage or same web application in synchrony with each other .
The transition - delay property allows specified delays to be assigned to an individual object such that one object can move after another object , for example .
In one embodiment , the delays can be either positive for staged animation or negative for skip ahead animation .
In one embodiment , a transition - name property allows an author of a webpage or web application to provide a name for a transition that may be used to match keyframe rules .
In one embodiment , a simple transition shorthand property may be used to combine the transition - name , transition - timing - function , transition - property , transition - duration , along with any other transitions into a single collective name .
Using this shorthand transition property , a developer of a webpage or web application can assign various arguments to the shorthand transition property to assign timing functions and assign a duration , for example .
In one embodiment , if a value assigned to an object may be changed midway though a transition , then a new transition may begin from the current position .
In another embodiment , if a from / to value ( e.g. from one to zero ) may be flipped ( e.g. from zero to one ) on an object , then a new property can be assigned or simply detecting when the from / to values are flipped to assign a new property to the object .
In a simple transition , a single timing function and duration may determine the intermediate values of the animating property .
For finer control , keyframes can be used .
Keyframes are based on the notion that an object has a beginning state and may be changing over time , in position , form , color , or any other property , to some different final form .
Keyframing may use “ key ” frames to describe a transformation of an object , determining intermediate positions from the “ key ” frames .
In one embodiment , keyframes are specified using a specialized at - rule .
A @keyframes rule consists of the keyword “ @keyframes , ” followed by the name of target transition ( using a transition - name ) or animation ( using an animation - name ) , followed by a set of style rules ( delimited by curly braces ) .
A keyframe selector for a keyframe style rule may consist of a comma-separated list of percentage values or the keywords “ from ” or “ to . ”
The selector may be used to specify the percentage along the duration of the animation or transition that the keyframe represents ( the block of property values declared ) .
The keyword “ from ” may be equivalent to the value 0 .
The keyword “ to ” may be equivalent to the value 100 % .
The keyframe declaration for a keyframe rule consists of properties and values .
Properties that are not transitioning or animating are ignored in these rules , with the exception of “ transition - timing - function ” and “ animation - timing - function ” .
The @keyframes rule that may be used by a transition or animation may be the last one encountered in sorted rules order that matches the name of the transition .
@keyframes rules do not cascade ; therefore a transition or animation may never derive keyframes from more than one @keyframes rule .
In one embodiment , to determine the set of keyframes , all of the values in selectors are sorted in increasing order by time .
If there are any duplicates , then the last keyframe specified inside the @keyframes rule may be used to provide the keyframe information for that time .
In one embodiment , there may be no cascading within a @keyframes rule if multiple keyframes specify the same keyframe selector values .
Keyframe example :
@keyframes ” wobble ” { 0 { left : 100 px ; } 40 % { left : 150 px ; } 60 % { left : 75 px ; } 100 % { left : 100 px ; } }
In the code snippet above , four keyframes are used to animate box 1300 in FIG .
13S with left property 1310 .
An initial state ( 0%/0 seconds for a 10 second duration ) for left property 1310 may be 100 px .
After 40 % or four seconds , box 1300 has left property 1310 of 150 px as shown in FIG .
13B . After 60 % or six seconds , box 1300 has left property 1310 of 100 px as shown in FIG .
13C . Finally , after 100 % of the total time duration or 10 seconds , box 1300 has left property of 100 px as shown in FIG .
13D , which may be its initial state in FIG .
13A .
By keyframing these four frames ( FIGS . 13A - D ) , box 1300 may be left “ wobbling ” right and left for 10 seconds .
A keyframe style rule may also declare the timing function that may be to be used as the transition or animation moves to the next keyframe .
The following code sample shows a “ bounce ” of an object as indicated by the five keyframes below :
@keyframes ” bounce ” { from { top : 100 px ; animation - timing - function : ease - out ; } 25 % { top : 50 px ; animation - timing - function : ease - in ; } 50 % { top : 100 px ; animation - timing - function : ease - out ; } 75 % { top : 75 px ; animation - timing - function : ease - in ; } to { top : 100 px ; } }
In the embodiment above and between the first and second keyframe ( i.e. between 0 and 25 % ) an “ ease - out ” timing function may be used .
Between the second and third keyframe ( i.e. between 25 % , and 50 % ) an “ ease - in ” timing function may be used and so on .
This ease - in ease - out effect may appear as an object that moves up the page 50 px , slowing down as it reaches its highest point then speeding up as it falls back to 100 px .
The second half of the animation behaves in a similar manner , but only moves the element 25 px units up the page .
CSS animations are similar to transitions in that they change the presentational value of CSS properties over time .
A principal difference may be that while transitions trigger implicitly when property values change , CSS animations are explicitly executed when the animation properties are applied .
Because of this , CSS animations require explicit values for the properties being animated .
These values are specified using animation keyframes , described above .
Many aspects of the animation can be controlled , including how many times the animation iterates , whether or not it alternates between the begin and end values , and whether or not the animation should be running or paused .
An animation can also delay its start time .
div { animation - name : ‘ diagonal - slide ’ ; animation - duration : 5s ; animation - iteration - count : 10 ; } @keyframes ‘ diagonal - slide ’ { from { left : 0 ; top : 0 ; } to { left : 100 px ; top : 100 px ; } }
The above code sample may produce an animation that moves an element from ( 0 , 0 ) to ( 100 px , 100 px ) over five seconds and repeats itself nine times ( for a total of ten iterations ) .
In one embodiment , a name is defined to select a keyframe at - rule for an animation .
Instances of “ wobble , ” “ bounce , ” and “ diagonal - slide ” have already been used in previous examples as exemplary animation names .
It may be appreciated that animation names may be any string combination .
In one embodiment , a duration of time may be assigned to an object when the object may be animating .
The length of duration may be any rational or irrational number .
Depending on the embodiment , variables may be used to define timing durations .
To describe how an animation may progress over one cycle of its duration , an animation - timing - function property may be used .
In one embodiment , the animation - timing - function may work in substantially the same manner as the transition - timing - function .
In order to define how many times an object may animate , an animation - property - count may be used .
In one embodiment , the animation - iteration - count may take rational and non-rational numbers to indicate how many times to animate an object .
In one embodiment , a variable may be used to define how many times to animate an object .
In another embodiment , a value of “ infinite ” may cause an animation to loop and repeat .
In one embodiment , non -integer numbers may cause animation to end part - way through a cycle .
In another embodiment , negative values may be treated as a zero .
In one embodiment , this zero value property may cause an animation to play in reverse on alternate cycles .
In the “ diagonal - slide ” example above , the iteration count was set to 10 .
When animating , it may be useful to define whether or not an animation should play in reverse on alternate cycles .
In one embodiment , the animation - direction property specifies if an animation should play in reverse on alternate cycles and may take values of “ normal ” or “ alternate . ”
In one embodiment , if normal is selected , then even and odd counts of each animation iteration may be played in the normal direction specified by one or animation properties .
In one embodiment , if alternate is selected , then odd counts of each animation iteration may be played in the normal direction specified by one or animation properties , while even counts of each animation may be played in a reverse direction .
When an animation is played in reverse , a timing function assigned to that animation may also be reversed .
For example , when played in reverse , an case - in animation would appear to be an ease - out animation .
In one embodiment , an animation - play - state property may define whether an animation is running or paused .
A running animation can be paused by setting this property to “ paused . ”
To continue running a paused animation , the property can be set to “ running . ”
In one embodiment , a paused animation may continue to display the current value of the animation in a static state , as if the time of the animation is constant .
In one embodiment , when a paused animation may be resumed , it restarts from the current value , not necessarily from the beginning of the animation .
In another embodiment , when a paused animation is resumed , it may restart from the beginning of the animation .
An animation - delay property may define when an animation starts .
The animation - delay property allows an animation to begin execution at some period of time after it is applied .
An animation - delay value of “ now ” means the animation may execute as soon as it is applied .
Otherwise , a time value may specify an offset from the moment the animation is applied , and the animation may delay execution by that offset .
In one embodiment , if the value for “ animation - delay ” is a negative time offset then the animation may execute the moment it is applied , but may appear to have begun execution at the specified offset .
The animation may appear to begin part - way through its play cycle .
In one embodiment , where an animation has implied starting values and a negative animation - delay , starting values are taken from the moment the animation is applied .
In a similar manner to CSS transition shorthand , CSS animation shorthand combines animation properties , such as animation - name , animation - iteration - count , animation - direction , animation - play - state , animation - delay , for example , into a single collective name .
Using this animation shorthand property , a developer of a webpage or web application can assign various arguments to the shorthand transition property to assign timing functions and assign a duration , for example .
In one embodiment , an object may have independent attributes ( nested attributes ) assigned to the object .
For example , the following code snippet shows an animation with two variables , “ a ” and “ b. ” However , these two variables also have nested attributes assigned to them .
animation -[ name ] : a , b ; a from { transform : rotate ( 0° ) ; } to { transform : rotate ( 60° ) ; } b from { transform : translate ( 0em ) ; } to { transform : translate ( loop ) ; }
Thus , an animation may be desired using variables “ a ” and “ b . ”
In one embodiment , the animation may be run in linear order , first with variable “ a ” and then with variable “ b. ” However , Javascript , loops , jumps , and other function calls can be used to run the animation from “ b ” to “ a ” among other things .

Global Warming Report Finds Time Running
Out A team of scientists from around the world issue their sternest warning yet .
Nov. 24 , 2009  --
There 's even less time for humanity to try to curb global warming than recently thought , according to a new in - depth scientific assessment by 26 scientists from eight countries .
Sea level rise , ocean acidification and the rapid melting of massive ice sheets are among the significantly increased effects of human - induced global warming assessed in the survey , which also examines the emissions of heat - trapping gases that are causing the climate change .
" Many indicators are currently tracking near or above the worst - case projections " made three years ago by the world 's scientists , the new Copenhagen Diagnosis said .
Nor has manmade global warming slowed or paused , as some headlines have recently suggested , according to the report , which you can see here .
The scientists also calculate that the world 's emissions of heat - trapping gases must peak in less than 10 years and then dive quickly to nearly zero , if warming of more than another 2 degrees Fahrenheit above the current annual global temperature is to be prevented after 2050 .
Any warming of more than 2 degrees F above current temperatures has been generally agreed among governments around the world to be " dangerous , " though what " dangerous " means is still debated .
This is the first comprehensive update of leading peer - reviewed climate science in the three years since the last report of the intentionally thorough and slow - paced Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was finalized .
That report is now widely recognized to be out of date in important ways .
This is because over the past three years , hundreds of new scientific field accounts of global warming 's impacts , as well as improved peer - reviewed analyses of global warming itself in both the deep past and the very near future , have depicted earth 's atmosphere as far more " sensitive " to the invisible CO2 , methane and other human - sourced greenhouse gases than had been hoped .
" Mother nature puts a limit on how long you can dither and procrastinate , " climatologist Richard Somerville , one of the study 's authors , told ABC News .
' Abrupt or Irreversible Change ' If It 's ' Business as Usual '
" We found that several vulnerable elements in Earth 's climate system -- like the Amazon and other big rain forests , like the great ice sheets that have so much sea level locked up in their ice -- could be pushed toward abrupt or irreversible change if we go on toward 2100 with our business - as - usual increase in emissions of greenhouse gases , " he said .
Global Warming Report Out in Time for Copenhagen Summit
Because the next IPCC report is not due before 2013 , there had been a growing concern among many of the world 's climate scientists that an update of the latest solid data would be needed , he said , if negotiations by the 192 nations gathering at the Copenhagen climate summit , scheduled for Dec. 7 - 18 , were to be based on reality .
By phone from his base at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California , Somerville told ABC News that the 26 authors of the survey all donated their time and expertise .
" The money we needed for basic transportation to get us to and from our big global review session in Copenhagen in March and for basic communication expenses turned up from the Live Earth philanthropy , " Somerville said .
Live Earth , founded by producer Kevin Wall , in partnership with former Vice President Al Gore , is a for - profit company that uses concerts , media and other events to encourage awareness worldwide about environmental issues .
" They 've had no influence or involvement of any kind with the report itself , " he said .
" That is entirely under the control of the 26 authors from the eight countries , all widely respected -- and many of them are lead authors of IPCC studies .
They 're known quantities in the peer - reviewed science world . "
Though this report is not " officially " from the IPCC , which makes no provisions for comprehensive mid-term reports halfway through its five - or six - year reporting cycle , Somerville said he and his fellow authors expect that it will be accepted by their peers in climate research around the world .
" This report is firmly based on more than 200 recent peer - reviewed papers clearly listed in the report , " he said .
The authors said they were aiming not only at policy makers , but also at the general public .
Common misconceptions about global warming are dealt with in separate side - bar boxes , explaining why , for example , the human - induced warming has not slowed or paused , contrary to some recent headlines .
The authors also give a relatively reassuring assessment about the chances of an uncontrollable " runaway " global temperature rise in the near future .
Sea Level , Ice , Acidification , Emission -- New Science
Their findings include :
Sea Level
Rise this century is likely to be " at least twice that projected " three years ago , with enormous humanitarian and economic impacts .
It could well be around three feet before the year 2100 , says the report .
Just a fraction of that increase in sea level could displace many millions of people and greatly increase vulnerability to storms .
A sea - level rise of 6 ½ feet is now considered by the scientists to be a reasonable " upper bound " of estimates -- a distinct possibility .
Global Warming Report : Ice Sheets , Glaciers Melting Faster Than Predicted
All ice types , including massive ice sheets , mountain glaciers and Arctic sea ice ( frozen sea- surface ) , are for the most part melting far faster than predicted three years ago .
Greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming are surging , with global emissions from burning fossil fuels now 40 percent higher than in 1990 and climbing .
Scientists are at constant pains to point out that recent ( or any ) slight and brief emissions drops in a few countries cause no reduction of the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere that set the global temperature thermostat .
This is because CO2 emissions stay in the air , on average , for hundreds of years .
Somerville and other scientists say they frequently have to make sure people they talk to understand the difference between " emissions " -- the amount of additional heat - trapping gas humanity puts in the atmosphere per year , and " concentrations " -- the amount of those gases that has piled up in the atmosphere and goes on hanging there for a long time .
Concentrations , which are measured in parts per million , have been rising steadily since the beginning of the industrial age some two centuries ago .
Devilish Coincidence : CO2 Plus H2O Makes Acid
Ocean acidification has been discovered in the past two years to be rising into fish - rich shallow waters far faster than oceanographers expected .
A significant portion of the CO2 emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere are absorbed by the oceans .
By what appears to be a devilish coincidence , this same molecule that warms the atmosphere , CO2 , happens , when combined with H20 , to form carbonic acid .
Scientists report the sea is already 30 percent more acidic than it was at the start of the industrial age .
A wide range of studies and reports of damage to sea life as a result of this rise in acidity is now coming in from the world 's marine biologists .
Relative Good News : ' No Strong Evidence ' Overall Tipping Point
There is one piece of relatively good news from the scientists in this report , in regard to what it calls " much talk in the popular media " about the possibility of " runaway " climate change .
It says this would be what 's sometimes called " a global tipping point , " in which many amplifying feedbacks around the world produce a cumulative effect in which Earth enters a " change in state , carried by its own internal dynamics . "
Many amplifying feedbacks are closely monitored by scientists , including thawing tundra and dying forest releasing massive amounts of heat - trapping CO2 , and the way in which the growing amount of darkened land absorbs more of the sun 's heat , thus further warming the ground and air .
Such a " change of state " could be uncontrollable , and possibly , some have worried , so fast that food supplies and human civilization in general would collapse .
Of this most frightening prospect , the report says clearly : " There is as yet no strong evidence that the Earth as a whole is near such a threshold .
Instead ' amplified ' climate change is a much better description of what we currently observe and project for the future . "
In other words , though painful changes are apparently coming in the next few decades and before there is a chance of getting Earth 's rising annual global temperature to level off , there is still time , according to the latest science , to avoid the very worst .
At least , it says , " there is as yet no strong evidence " that such an overall threshold " is near . "

A GERMAN doctor who went on the run after poisoning his lover 's 14 - year - old daughter more than 27 years ago has been found , bound and gagged , outside a French court .
The girl 's father has been arrested on suspicion of kidnap .
Andre Bamberski , 71 , has accused the French and German authorities of being unwilling to catch Dieter Krombach , 74 , who was convicted of manslaughter in his absence in 1995 .
A French court sentenced him to 15 years for the death of Kalinka Bamberski .
The blonde teenager died after receiving an injection at Krombach 's home in Lindau , Germany , during a visit with her mother in 1982 .
Kalinka 's father is convinced that Krombach drugged his daughter in order to rape her .
The doctor was found at the weekend , trussed and bleeding from a head wound , in a doorway near the court in the eastern French city of Mulhouse , close to the German border .
Mr Bamberski told police in an anonymous telephone call where Krombach could be found .
He later admitted that he had made the call and put on a '' thick Russian accent ' ' to try to avoid detection .
The cardiologist was taken to hospital under police custody .
His lawyer , Francois Serres , said he had been '' kidnapped and forcibly taken out of Germany ' ' .
BAGHDAD  Amira Edan , the director of Iraq ’s National Museum , says that soon she will no longer have to worry so much that the famous institution remains closed to the public for fear of violence .
People will just be able to Google it .
“ It ’s really wonderful , ” she said Tuesday .
Eric Schmidt , the chief executive of Google , had just made a presentation inside the museum , announcing that his company would create a virtual copy of the museum ’s collections at its own expense , and make images of four millenniums of archaeological treasures available online , free , by early next year .
He was addressing Iraqi officials , journalists and American Embassy officials , along with a platoon of bodyguards , gathered at the museum in a small conference room with a 50 - foot - high ceiling .
“ I can think of no better use of our time and our resources than to make the images and the ideas of your civilization available to all the people of the world , ” Mr. Schmidt said .
Ambassador Christopher R. Hill described the project as “ part of an effort spearheaded by the State Department to bring technology to Iraq .
We thought , what better way to do that than bring Eric Schmidt here ? ”
A massive parade in Beijing marked the 60th anniversary .
By the Communist Party of India ( Marxist - Leninist ) Liberation
October 9 , 2009 -- The October 1 celebration of the 60th anniversary of the foundation of the People ’s Republic of China has attracted worldwide attention .
Considering the historical baggage of backwardness with which modern China had begun its journey and the size of China 's billion - plus population , China has indeed come a long way in these six decades .
With “ Made in China ” products virtually swamping the global market , the whole world obviously recognises China ’s economic prowess .
The 2008 Beijing Olympics saw China emerge as the number one sporting nation .
Compared to China ’s economic strength , its voice in the strategic domain of international relations has of course been rather soft and subdued , but of late China seems to have begun stepping up its role in this arena too .
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , for a few years the world looked quite unipolar with unchallenged US domination in every sphere .
But over the last one decade , the aura of US power has started fading .
With every passing month , the burden of the economic , human and political cost of the US - led military misadventures in Afghanistan and Iraq is becoming increasingly heavy and unaffordable .
The US has also had to bear the brunt of the global financial crisis and the recession that has revived memories of the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The steady rise of China marks a striking contrast to this unmistakable decline of an overstretched superpower .
Multipolar world
China of course does not seem to be in any hurry to assert its status as a rising global power .
The keyword in Chinese foreign policy parlance is not superpower but multipolarity as opposed to a unipolar world .
In its quest for a multipolar world , China is seeking closer strategic cooperation with Russia and the Central Asian republics within the framework of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , and closer bilateral and multilateral economic cooperation with major developing countries like India and Brazil ( the combination of Brazil , Russia , India and China -- BRIC -- can indeed be a powerful bargaining bloc ) .
Apart from pressing for restructuring of the IMF , China has also come up with the idea of ending the US dollar 's prolonged reign as the universal currency of international exchange .
China has suggested that as a medium of international transaction , the US dollar should be replaced by a supranational currency basket like the Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) used by the IMF .
Socialism ?
While China ’s record in terms of domestic economic advance is quite extraordinary and its growing role as a balancing force against unipolar imperialist domination is undoubtedly significant , a lot is however left to be desired when one judges China by the yardstick of socialism .
Much of the initial post - revolution gains achieved by the toiling masses towards genuine liberation and social progress have been lost in the wake of post - 1978 modernisation .
Disparity , social as well as regional , is assuming critical proportions , even as the working people in both rural and urban areas are faced with growing unemployment and insecurity .
By the Chinese state 's own admission , corruption is quite rampant despite the law meting out stringent punishments and frequent death sentences against perpetrators of economic crime .
No wonder popular anger is also exploding in different parts of China at regular intervals , with the state often unleashing repressive measures to handle such protests .
For communists and anti-imperialists the world over the 60th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese revolution is an occasion to gather inspiration and strength from the historical transformation of a backward country into a powerful modern nation even as the problems facing China demand close scrutiny and critical introspection .
At the same time it is imperative that we must boldly denounce and resist the American design to encircle China .
In India the pro-US lobby has been working overtime to project China as a big imminent threat .
The US military - industrial complex wants to capture India 's lucrative defence market by promising to enhance India 's military capacity vis-à - vis China .
Such a course will not only make India ever more dependent on the US but also cripple whatever democracy we have by subordinating the country ’s economic and political agenda to the disastrous logic of war and militarisation .
We must learn from our past history and save the country from this US - prescribed road to disaster .
Avoiding the path of confrontation , India must move towards comprehensive cooperation with China .

As President Obama measures the potential burden of a new war strategy in Afghanistan , his administration is struggling to come up with even the most dispassionate of predictions : the actual price tag for the anticipated buildup of troops .
The calculations so far have produced a sweeping range .
The Pentagon publicly estimates it will cost $ 500,000 a year for every additional service member sent to the war zone .
Obama ’s budget experts size it up at twice that much .
In coming up with such numbers , the White House and the military have different priorities as well as different methods .
The president ’s advisors do n’t want to underestimate the cost and then lose the public ’s faith .
The Pentagon worries about sticker shock as commanders push for an increase of as many as 40,000 troops .
Both sides emphasize that their figures are estimates and could change -- in fact , a Pentagon comptroller assessment this month put the number closer to that of Obama ’s Office of Management and Budget .
Still , budgeting and politics are entwined , and numbers can always support more than one point of view .
The Bush White House minimized costs as it moved toward war .
Obama is weighing skeptically an escalation of a war he did n’t launch .
In his campaign , Obama promised not to tuck war costs away , off federal budget books .
“ Our resources in manpower , our resources in human lives and our resources in money are not infinite , ” White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in an interview .
“ The notion that we would n’t take each of those things into account does not make a lot of sense to this commander in chief . ”
All of those elements are under consideration as Obama wraps up a review of war strategy .
He is expected any week now to respond to requests from his commander in the region for a strategy change and for additional forces .
The White House could announce an increase of 20,000 to 40,000 troops shortly after Thanksgiving .
During a recent session of his war council -- where one contingent has questioned the wisdom of sending more troops -- Obama asked how much it would cost to pay for the troops Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal has requested .
The president sought an exact accounting , a request that turned out to be more complicated than anticipated .
The Office of Management and Budget says adding 40,000 troops would cost about $ 40 billion a year , or $ 1 million each .
White House officials included in their estimate everything they consider necessary to wage war , including troop housing and equipment .
Inside and outside the Pentagon , some suspect an effort to undermine support for a troop increase .
“ The large - scale message has been , ‘ This is going to be hard and expensive , ’ ” said Thomas Donnelly , an American Enterprise Institute fellow and defense expert .
The Pentagon arrived at its much lower estimate by dividing its war funding request by the number of troops throughout the region : 68,000 in Afghanistan and up to 95,000 in supporting roles elsewhere , such as on nearby ships or in surrounding countries .
The Pentagon cost includes higher combat wages , extra aircraft hours and other operations and maintenance costs , but omits such items as new weapons purchases -- one - time costs that vary by year -- and support equipment like spy satellites and anti-roadside - bomb technology .
The Pentagon also does not try to estimate costs of new bases for additional soldiers .
But in a memo early this month , obtained by The Times ’ Washington bureau , the Pentagon ’s own comptroller produced an estimate that broke with the customary Defense formula and did include construction and equipment .
That memo said the yearly cost of a 40,000 - troop increase would be $ 30 billion to $ 35 billion -- at least $ 750,000 a person .
An increase of 20,000 would cost $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion annually , it said -- a per-soldier cost equal to or greater than the White House estimate .
Even determining past spending is a fuzzy endeavor : Big chunks are paid through emergency measures and are not calculated into the total .
Under questioning by the House Armed Services Committee this month , a Congressional Budget Office expert could n’t say how much it costs to run the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ I find it astonishing that , eight years into this , we have n’t nailed it down with precision , ” another witness at the table , David Berteau , director of the Defense Industrial Initiatives Group of the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said later .
And yet the effort is necessary , said Stephen Daggett of the Congressional Research Service : “ If the budget is going to be constrained , one of the questions we have to ask is whether we can sustain the increases in forces . ”
Partisans of all stripes are likely to think first about intangibles , including American tolerance for troop casualties and support for sending new troops to Afghanistan .
Democratic leaders say money wo n’t determine their level of commitment .
“ You have to look at the mission first , ” said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton ( D - Mo. ) .
“ You absolutely start with that . ”
Obama ’s decision will not be based on money , his press secretary said .
“ The president is going to pick the strategy that ’s most in our national security interest , ” Gibbs said .
“ Along the way , the health of our forces , the toll on lives and the financial costs will all be discussed . ”

[ Updated 2:17 p.m. :
An earlier version of this post gave an incorrect name for the Humane Society . ]
The 24 - hour tip line , staffed by people who speak English and Spanish , will allow county residents to anonymously report dog- fighting incidents and collect up to $ 5,000 in reward money for information leading to an arrest or conviction .
The new tip - line number will be announced Tuesday at the office of L.A. County Dist .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Despite millions of unemployed job seekers desperate for work , many open positions are languishing unfilled .
The reason ?
Not enough candidates .
With job openings largely concentrated in specialized industries like health care , green technology and energy , some employers say the problem is finding qualified workers , which are in short supply .
Meanwhile , they are inundated with eager candidates from other industries who lack the skills and experience that the job requires .
According to a recent survey by Human Capital Institute and TheLadders , more than half of employers said " quality of candidates " or " availability of candidates " are their greatest challenges -- despite the recession .
Mary Willoughby , the director of human resources at the Center for Disability Rights in Rochester , New York , has been trying to hire registered nurses , home health aides and service coordinators for several of the agencies that she oversees .
Many of the positions , which require specific skills and offer salaries in the range of $ 30,000 to $ 45,000 , have been vacant for six months or longer .
The job postings , which appear on CareerBuilder , Craigslist and some regional sites , garner a lot of attention , she says .
" We get tons of résumés from people .
We are just not getting highly qualified candidates . "
The problem , according to Willoughby , is that they are bombarded by résumés from job seekers without the two years or more of health care experience necessary .
" We 're seeing a lot of people trying to break into the health care arena , " she said .
As a result , human resources spends too much time sifting through résumés for people who are n't remotely qualified , and can't find many that are .
" We 've gotten close to 300 résumés for a service coordinator position .
Out of that we brought in four people , " she said .
Those that did n't make the cut included someone with previous experience as an office clerk and a job applicant with a bachelor 's in mathematics , currently employed at a café .
Willoughby recently instituted a hiring incentive program to encourage existing employees to refer viable candidates .
Those responsible for bringing in new hires are eligible to receive $ 2,500 to $ 5,000 , depending on the position .
She has also added in a signing bonus for the new employees .
Things are even worse on the higher end of the pay scale .
At wireless leasing firm , Unison Site , a position for director of lead generation , which pays $ 90,000 - $ 140,000 , has been open for three months , with no candidates in sight .
" With the job market the way it is , we should be able to recruit really good people and it has n't worked quite as well as we wanted , " said Joe Songer , co-founder and chief financial officer .
" My problem is when I put an ad out I just get bombarded with people that are n't qualified . "
Typically , the jobs that are the hardest to fill are those that require unique or extensive work experience , according to management professor Peter Cappelli of the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School of Business .
For job seekers , applying to those types of positions may be worth the off chance that one responds with a request for an interview .
" They think , I 've got nothing to lose , " Cappelli said .
Recruiters recommend that job seekers create a targeted list of companies with a clear match to their background and tailor their experience to the job they are applying for , rather than blanketing all available job openings with the same résumé .
" Eighty percent of jobs are being obtained on personal referrals so candidates that are spending the bulk of their time sending their resume out blindly are not being the most fruitful , " said Carolyn Thompson , president of CMCS , a boutique staffing firm near Washington , D.C .
Thompson advises job seekers to network within those target companies , whether in person or through social networking sites .
Without a contact at the company , résumés should highlight and emphasize any relevant experience specific to the job opening , added Jennifer Becker , market director for Ajilon Professional Staffing .
" You really want your résumé to very quickly and easily reflect your relevant skills and the value you can bring to the position . "
" If the client has to look for it , you are probably going to get passed over . "
Many , no doubt , will be familiar with Afroman 's comic rap Because I Got High , in which good intentions - " I was going clean my room " , " I would have paid my child support " - are derailed " because I got high " .
Particularly shocking for those reading these pages is the lyric " I was going to go to class ... I could have cheated and I could have passed " as an example of good behaviour foolishly forsaken .
Afroman is not alone in finding cheating normal .
Once I was second examiner for a course in another department , and found myself faced with the task of giving a grade for an essay copied from a book I had written a few years before .
Even more galling , the first examiner had given it B +.
Later she kindly explained that she knew that the essay was derivative ; she just had n't quite realised how much so .
For the same course there was another essay so suspicious that I could n't bear to read on after the first page .
When I asked her opinion about it , my fellow examiner asked me whether I thought it had been written by that sweet old chap who comes and sits at the back in class .
When I asked her why she thought that , she pointed to a page where the author referred to an argument he had first given in what he described as " author , 1965 " .
The real author , of course , was a very distinguished scholar , and in the most naive plagiarism I have seen , this student had simply downloaded the paper in its entirety , clearly not even reading it before handing it in .
When academics hear stories of plagiarism we go through several stages , perhaps more commonly associated with being diagnosed with a fatal illness : outrage ; frenetic activity ; resignation .
Our first reaction is always " hang , draw and quarter " .
Next comes the need to document the case , finding all original sources , comparing the texts , marker pen in hand , and working out what proportion is plagiarised , and then fill in numerous forms .
A particularly tricky case can take a whole day - and a day in the middle of the examining period with a hundred more essays sitting on one 's desk .
But then , eventually , the student is confronted , and we are told a tale of boxes getting jumbled in a house move , notes losing their cover sheets , perhaps family problems leading to panic and disorientation .
True or false , there is always a human story and the will to crucify begins to waver .
But what is to be done ?
However much we warn students of the dire consequences of plagiarism , some continue to take the risk , perhaps partly because the consequences tend not to be so dire after all .
When I was an undergraduate there was an urban myth that anyone found committing plagiarism would be expelled and thereafter banned from all public exams in the land .
But the truth is more often that all we can do is fail the piece of work in question .
Often there is a right to resit next year , and so , like the House of Lords , all the plagiarism committee can do is to hold things up a bit .
Plagiarism does n't look like going away on its own any time soon .
The main response to this in the universities has been to turn to agencies that claim to be able to detect plagiarism by sophisticated electronic searches , if you give them enough money .
Yet the plagiarists , if determined enough , will always be able to keep one step ahead of this year 's software updates .
Another response has been to require students to keep a record of the " history of production " of their essays .
Notes , early drafts , and records of meetings with tutors should all be kept on file to show how the final result was created .
Reproducing such a file would be quite a challenge for a plagiarist .
Yet this has a nasty smell : it seems to presume all are guilty unless they can prove themselves innocent .
There are other alternatives .
It has been suggested that we might re-conceptualise the idea of essay writing and coursework .
Should it matter if the student has not put things in his or her own words ?
After all , a question has been asked , and if an answer has been found , how much does it matter whether it has been copied out of a book ?
Probably quite a lot , actually .
But we could at least start to think about this question .
Or we could abolish coursework , and go back entirely to sit - down examinations .
A retrograde step , some would say , but it would put the essay mills out of business , and that would be very satisfying indeed .

A man and woman from Sydney , who are accused of sexually assaulting their nine - year - old son , have been remanded in custody .
The 56 - year - old man , who is facing six charges , was the first of the two to appear at Sutherland Local Court today .
He was led barefoot into the dock where he listened as the magistrate told him that police had served an Apprehended Violence Order ( AVO ) on him , forbidding him from contacting his son .
Documents tendered to the court allege that the couple raped their nine year old son and streamed the video live on the internet using a webcam .
They were arrested last night at their home at Peakhurst , in Sydney 's south , where police say they found two computers containing the pornographic images .
The boy 's mother , aged 46 , said nothing during her appearance as the magistrate repeated the same instructions regarding the AVO .
She can not call or write to her son from jail .
The woman faces charges of sexual assault and aggravated indecent assault .
She also faces charges of concealing a serious offence and inciting an act of indecency .
The police documents state that she knew her husband was raping her son and she failed to report it .
It is alleged that the assaults happened sometime between New Year 's Day and a week ago .
The matter returns to court next year .

Chamber to launch new jobs campaign
After months of research and groundwork , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce will launch its Campaign for Free Enterprise on Wednesday , with the goal of spurring the creation of 20 million jobs in the next decade .
Organizers say the multimillion - dollar program will include grass - roots mobilization , national advertising , public education , outreach to opinion leaders and extensive involvement by young people .

“ Since we announced plans for the campaign in June , we ’ve been holding listening sessions with small - business owners , heads of state and local chambers , Fortune 500 CEOs , heads of trade associations [ and ]
Washington political and press types , and we ’ve built a one - of - a- kind , far - reaching campaign to promote free enterprise , ” said Tita Freeman , the Chamber ’s vice president of communications and strategy .
“ We ’ve said this is the most significant campaign we ’ve ever undertaken , so we ’re treating this announcement like none other in the Chamber ’s history , ” she said .
“ We have print and online ads running to build buzz as we lead up to the launch . ”
The goal of 20 million jobs includes the 7 million lost in this recession , plus 13 million additional jobs needed to keep the nation competitive , based on economic modeling by an outside economist hired to work with the Chamber ’s economist .
The Chamber plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on the campaign and has hired Brian Gunderson , a former top Bush administration official , to lead it .
Its website is 20 millionjobchallenge.com , and its Twitter account is @freeenterprise .
Chamber President and CEO Tom Donohue will launch the campaign Wednesday morning at an event at the group ’s headquarters that will be webcast to businesses and state and local chambers throughout the country .
Appearing with him will be Patricia Owen , the owner of Faces DaySpa in South Carolina ; Ray Pinard , president and chief executive of 48 HourPrint.com in Massachusetts ; Robert Milligan , chairman of M.I. Industries in Nebraska ; and Tom Bell , chairman emeritus of Cousins Properties in Georgia .
Afterward , Donohue will hold a news conference .
“ There are growing concerns about interference with the private marketplace and the private economy , and it ’s a ripe opportunity for reinforcing the importance of free enterprise , ” Freeman said .
“ People view free enterprise very positively , ” she added , “ but they do n’t necessarily understand the benefits of free enterprise to them personally in their everyday lives . ”
The Chamber , which calls itself the world ’s largest business federation , represents more than 3 million businesses .
Freeman said the Chamber did “ a good amount of polling and focus groups ” and “ got very positive feedback on the U.S. Chamber being well - poised to take on this campaign because of our unique infrastructure — our federation of state and local chambers throughout the country — and because we ’re well - respected in terms of Washington organizations . ”
“ We are out raising money for the campaign on an ongoing basis , and we have specific donors for the free - enterprise campaign , ” she said .
“ We have reached out to people who have clearly benefited from the free - enterprise system . ”
Those include “ entrepreneurs and individuals who have achieved great things because of our free - enterprise system , ” Freeman said , “ whether it be the head of a corporation or someone whose family built a great business , and now that business has been passed on . ”
“ This effort is about something much bigger than business , much bigger than policy , ” she said .
“ It ’s about the business community working to solve our nation ’s greatest challenge , which is creating the 20 million new jobs America will need over the next decade .
And free enterprise is the way to get there . ”

The Federal Communications Commission at an open meeting today approved a draft of proposed rules related to net neutrality .
As expected , the rules call for transparency and aim to ensure that the owners of the broadband pipe ca n’t discriminate against certain traffic on the wired and wireless Internet .
But the draft also allows for reasonable network management in response to congestion , asks tough questions regarding managed services , and seeks to apply the principles of network neutrality to players other than the Internet service providers .
The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is the formal process by which the FCC will seek to codify six principles into formal regulations , and drive comments about its plans for net neutrality .
Three of the five commissioners approved the proposal , with the two Republican commissioners concurring and dissenting in part .
For readers already weary of hearing about this debate , the pre-game trash talk and threats can finally end , and we can start arguing about a solid plan .
Comments based on this initial proposal are due Jan. 14 with replies to those comments due March 5 .
Here ’s the summary of the proposed rules :
Under the draft rules , subject to reasonable network management , a provider of broadband Internet access service may not :
prevent any of its users from sending or receiving the lawful content of the user ’s choice over the Internet ; prevent any of its users from running the lawful applications or using the lawful services of the user ’s choice ; prevent any of its users from connecting to and using on its network the user ’s choice of lawful devices that do not harm the network ; deprive any of its users of the user ’s entitlement to competition among network providers , application providers , service providers , and content providers .
A provider of broadband Internet access service must treat lawful content , applications and services in a nondiscriminatory manner .
A provider of broadband Internet access service must disclose such information concerning network management and other practices as is reasonably required for users and content , application and service providers to enjoy the protections specified in this rule - making . ”
However , the commission is also asking tough questions about managed services and how those may be used to circumvent net neutrality principles , as well as seeking to expand some rules beyond ISPs to application providers and other entities doing business on the web .
Presumably , this is in response to Google ’s ( s goog ) defense of its decision to not allow rural callers to use or receive calls from its Google Voice service .
From the draft rules :
The Notice affirms that the six principles it proposes to codify would apply to all platforms for broadband Internet access , including mobile wireless broadband , while recognizing that different access platforms involve significantly different technologies , market structures , patterns of consumer usage , and regulatory history .
The two Republican commissioners , Robert McDowell and Meredith Attwell Baker , both expressed their approval of an open Internet , but also questioned whether the FCC has the legal authority to draft a net neutrality policy .
McDowell also cautioned that the rest of the world will be watching what the U.S. does in this arena , offering the threat that less democratic countries may seek to regulate their own countries ’
Internet access but out of “ less pure motives ” and with undemocratic results .
In closing , FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski reiterated the fact that this notice is only the beginning of a necessary process .
( He cited the lawsuit filed earlier this year by Comcast as a perfect example of why this rule - making must commence . )
He also stressed that this will be a flexible and light - handed process saying :
Fourth , the government ’s role in preserving openness is important but also modest .
It should be no greater than necessary to achieve the core goal of preserving a free and open Internet .
Open Internet rules should be high - level , not heavy - handed .
And in fact , the draft rules in the Notice are less than two pages long .
The goal is to provide a fair framework in which all participants in the Internet ecosystem can operate , ultimately minimizing the need for government involvement .
Today ’s vote marks the true beginning of this net neutrality rule - making process , which is not likely to see an end until spring of 2010 at the earliest — and then the lawsuits will commence .
So nestle in , because it ’s going to be a long winter of carrier and community discontent .

This is a guest post by Karl Pfeifer
I am an 81 year old survivor of the Holocaust to whom strange things happened last week in Germany .
I was invited to give a lecture about racism and Antisemitism in Hungary in Bielefeld ( November 19 ) by Antifa AG of the university of Bielefeld a group of antifascists .
My lecture should have taken place in the autonomous youth centre ( AJZ ) Bielefeld and those responsible for it have announced this three weeks before the lecture .
Only two days before my lecture a few persons in the AJZ vetoed my giving there a lecture alleging that my military unit ( I served at the time in Palmach , second and ninth regiment ) had participated at a massacre in a Palestinian village and that I myself participated in it .
Those accusing me did not name the place where this alleged massacre was committed and they themselves said that their information is not reliable .
But one could hear comments : “ He is a Zionist … ”
And those vetoing my lecture on the premises of AJZ – presumably aged 30 – 40 – also declared that events with members of Black September are also unwanted and therefore the ban on my lecture is comprehensible .
They demanded that I should distance myself from this not specified alleged massacre .
Of course nobody of those excluding me has asked me about this story .
And the cowards are not ready to answer the questions of German journalists why they excluded me .
At least those inviting me found another hall where my lecture was applauded by 50 German students , who were shocked to hear about my exclusion .
I had been already once accused without any evidence of having caused the death of a Professor who was employed before his suicide at Bielefeld Fachhochschule .
I was from 1982 to 1995 the editor of the official magazine of the Vienna Jewish community .
In February 1995 I have published a commentary criticising Dr. Werner Pfeifenberger who had written an article alleging that the Jews had declared war on Germany in 1933 and which trivialised the crimes of the Nazi regime .
The professor brought defamation proceedings against me .
I stood trial in three Vienna courts and was ultimately acquitted in May 1998 when the courts found that my criticism constituted a value judgment which had a sufficient factual basis .
In April 2000 , criminal proceedings under the National Socialism Prohibition
Act were brought against Pfeifenberger by the Public Prosecutor of Vienna on account of his article .
He committed suicide shortly before his trial .
In an article from June 2000 , the extreme right wing weekly Zur Zeit referred to the commentary of the “ Jewish journalist Karl Pfeifer ” , alleging that it had unleashed a manhunt which had eventually resulted in the death of the victim .
I ’ve brought unsuccessful defamation proceedings against the publishing company that owned Zur Zeit .
While the first - instance court had found that the statement was defamatory , in October 2001 the appellate court found that it was a value judgment which was not excessive .
Meanwhile , in February 2001 the chief editor of Zur Zeit ( Andreas Mölzer MEP for the extreme right FPOE ) had addressed a letter to the subscribers asking them for financial support and claiming that a group of antifascists was trying to damage the weekly by means of disinformation in the media and by instituting criminal proceedings and civil actions .
The letter stated again that I and a number of other people were members of a “ leftwing hunting ” association which had chased the professor to his death .
I ’ve brought a second set of defamation proceedings .
My action was dismissed in August 2002 , as the appellate court held that the principles and considerations set out in its previous judgment of October 2001 applied .
I have lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights on 7 April 2003 .
Relying on Article 8 ( right to respect for private and family life ) , and complained that the Austrian courts failed to protect my reputation against defamatory statements made by the chief editor of Zur Zeit .
Decision of the Court on November 15 , 2007 Article 8
The Court held that a person ’s right to protection of his or her reputation was encompassed in Article 8 as being part of the right to respect for private life .
However , the statement here at issue went beyond the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 , claiming that I had caused the professor ’s death by ultimately driving him to commit suicide .
Although it was undisputed that I had written a critical commentary on Dr. Pfeifenberger ’s article in 1995 and that years later , in 2000 , he had been charged under the National Socialism Prohibition
Act in relation to this article and had committed suicide , no proof had been offered for the alleged causal link between my article and the professor ’s death .
By writing that , Andreas Mölzer ’s letter overstepped acceptable limits , because it in fact accused me of acts tantamount to criminal behaviour .
Even if the statement were to be understood as a value judgment , it lacked a sufficient factual basis .
The use of the term member of a “ hunting ” association implied that I was acting in co-operation with others with the aim of persecuting and attacking Dr. Pfeifenberger .
There was no indication , however , that I , who had merely written one article at the very beginning of a series of events and had not taken any further action thereafter , acted in such a manner or with such an intention .
Moreover , it had to be noted that the commentary written by me , had not transgressed the limits of acceptable criticism .
The European Court of Human Rights was therefore not convinced that the reasons advanced by the domestic courts for protecting freedom of expression outweighed my right to have my good reputation safeguarded .
There had accordingly been a violation of Article 8 .
Only two years later Bielefeld persons who wish to remain anonymous accuse me of having committed a „ massacre “ saying that I am a „ Zionist “ .
Enough reason , for not excluding me from their AJZ .
Antisemitic bigotry is no less morally deplorable when camouflaged as anti-Zionism .
This was the case in Bielefeld AJZ where after hearing the comment that I am a „ Zionist “ an assembly of young German antifascists agreed to exclude me .
Usually the onus of proof is on the accuser .
Accusing me of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by others without any proof seems to be part of their bigotry .
To compare my service in Palmach with the murderous terrorism of Black September is making mendacious , dehumanizing , demonizing , allegations about me , is applying double standards by requiring of me – a Jewish journalist – a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other person , that I should prove my innocence .
To accuse me , to have participated in a “ massacre ” is part of a projection customary in many German circles .
The best - known and by far the most widely held example of projection of guilt is the defamation of Israel as the “ Nazis of today . ”
This is one of the most objectionable forms of Antisemitism after Auschwitz .

If Howard Jones was n’t the definitive poster boy for synthpop during the 1980s , he was certainly one of the leaders of the pack , spending many a week in the charts during the course of the decade .
We wo n’t waste our time by listing off every single hit single the man had , but …oh , sorry , perhaps some readers do need a brief refresher course .
For those of us who may not have lived through the decade in which Mr. Jones saw his greatest success , we speak of the man responsible for such memorable ditties as “ New Song , ” “ Things Can Only Get Better , ” “ No One Is To Blame , ” and “ Everlasting Love . ”
Indeed , he even managed to maintain his success into the ’90s , scoring a substantial hit in 1992 with “ Lift Me Up . ”
Although he departed the ranks of Elektra Records not long after the label released his best - of collection in 1993 , Jones has continued to release records throughout the years , including Angels and Lovers ( 1997 ) , People ( 1998 ) , and Revolution of the Heart ( 2005 ) ; his latest album , Ordinary Heroes , will see release on Nov. 9th , 2009 , preceded on Oct. 26th by the single , “ Soon You ’ll Go . ”
As part of the pre-release press blitz , Popdose was provided with the opportunity to do an E - mail interview , and it was an offer we could not refuse .
First , here ’s the video for the aforementioned single , “ Soon You ’ll Go ” …
… and now that the stage has been appropriately set , here ’s the interview :
I ’ve followed your career since the ’ 80s and all the way through to the present , but it will likely not surprise you that many will be shocked to hear that A ) you have a new album , and B ) you ’ve pretty much been recording and touring all along .
How would you describe the sound of Ordinary Heroes to those who ’ve been out of the loop ?
Will it be hard to access for those who lost track of you after you departed Elektra ?
The new album is very not electronic .
It is a songwriter ’s album with very personal themes , intense lyrics , and a strict lineup of drums , bass , piano , guitar , string quartet , and background vocals .
Kind of pop chamber music … and very no synths .
People who have followed my output since the early ’90s will not be surprised by this collection of tracks , as they have come to expect an eclectic output from me .
( Next album : death metal meets Leonard Cohen ! )
I interviewed Glenn Tilbrook several years ago , and he said that Squeeze ’s final album , Domino , was actually the most profitable album of their entire career , owing to the fact that they released it themselves .
Have you found that to be the case with your recent output , and how do you find the indie route overall ?
Do you miss the major - label lifestyle at all ?
Being in control of my musical destiny is something I am happy to fight for .
As an independent artist , I am responsible not only for creating the work and financing it , but also for getting it out to my audience .
This is challenging and at the same time exhilarating .
I am grateful to have had the major label start to my career but I love the freedom and excitement of having to make things happen myself .
( And my collection of Francis Bacon Originals speaks for itself ! )
How did you come to team up with Duncan Sheik for the original version of “ Someone You Need “  ( my guess would be the Rupert Hine connection ) , and what made you decide to revisit it as a solo number for the new album ?
I knew Duncan Sheik before he worked with Rupert , because we met as fellow Buddhists .
We then ended up at a songwriters boot camp in France and wrote “ Someone You Need . ”
The song sits so well with the other material that it had to be included in the new album .
When I played “ Love ’s Never Wasted ” for one of our other Popdose writers , he said , “ Sounds like Keane . ”
I do n’t know if you ’d necessarily hear that particular similarity , but it does lead me to wonder if you can hear your sound within the work of any of today ’s musicians , and if any artists have come to you and acknowledged a sonic debt that they may owe to you .
I suppose the new rash of ’ 80s - sounding records is where I hear the influence the most .
I have no idea whether today ’s artists cite me as an influence , but I am sure I saw Brandon Flowers at a gig in Salt Lake City circa 1985 taking notes .
My wife and I saw you perform in Blackpool in 2001 while we were in the UK on our honeymoon , and we were positively blown away by the performance of your background vocalist , Shaz Sparks , on “ All I Want . ”
( She also does a great solo version of “ All I Want , ” which is available on her self - titled EP , and has contributed vocals to three songs on John B ’s upcoming album . )
How did you first cross paths with Shaz , and does she appear on Ordinary Heroes ?
Shaz – as part of dba – was signed to my dtox label , and I made a record with them ( Spectrum ) , which is fabulous and still available at the website .
But I wanted a male background vocal sound to the new album , and Daniel Pearce ( yes , that Daniel … Simon , are you deaf ? ) is amazing on this record .
Speaking of my wife , I do n’t think she would mind if I revealed that your first Pianosolos album helped immeasurably to soothe her spirit in the hours leading up to the birth of our daughter .
I can only presume that the idea of an instrumental album was something you had considered in the past , but what led you to finally release one ?
The piano solos started as a series of gifts that I did for people for special occasions .
A gift that was totally unique to them .
I found after a while that I had quite a few of them , so that became Pianosolos Vol. 1 and Pianosolos Vol . 2 .
Not to in any way diminish your recent and , indeed , current musical accomplishments , but what is life like for a musician who is generally perceived as an “ ’ 80s artist , ”  and do you find it hard to walk the line between making the casual fans happy and thrilling those who ’ve come to hear the new material as well ?
There are , broadly speaking , 2 parts to my audience .
The first group are the fans that are actively engaged with my output for the whole 26 years , and the second a more general or casual audience that only knows the ’ 80s work .
I do n’t find this a problem .
I ’m happy to have an audience that knows me at all !
Of your major - label output , which overall album do you think is the most underrated , and what album track from that era still leaves you thinking , “ That really should have been a single ” ?
One to One is a very interesting album produced by Arif Mardin .
There is a lot of experimentation going on with sampling , and some interesting grooves and amazing musicians .
Saying that ,
In the Running and Cross that Line row my boat as well .
You did n’t really tackle a great number of outside projects in the ’ 80s .
You made the occasional cameo here and there ( such as on Chris DeBurgh ’s “ The Head and the Heart “  ) , but were you ever tempted to step out a bit and do more guest appearances , production work , and so forth ?
In the whirlwind that was the ’ 80s for me , there was hardly time to catch my breath , let alone work with others .
Saying that , I did do an awful lot of Prince ’s Trust concerts with the great and the good of the pop and rock world .
And , lastly , I ’m looking at your Live Aid performance right now , and I ’m torn between two thoughts : “ Is it really true that the piano belonged to Freddie Mercury , and did he actually give you permission to use it ? ” and “ If Howard ’s mullet and Nik Kershaw ’s mullet had gotten into a fight that day , which would have come out the victor ? ”
Any comment on either matter ?
The piano was Freddie ’s , no permission was granted .
And Nik and I would take on Bono ’s do as a tag team .
In closing , our Popdose readers in the UK may be interested to know that Howard Jones will be embarking upon a tour to support the release of Ordinary Heroes .
You can catch him at The IndigO2 in London on Nov. 6th , at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester on Nov. 12th , and at St. David ’s Hall in Cardiff – featuring special guests The Morriston Orpheus Choir – on Nov. 13th .
Da L'espresso in edicola domani ( con aggiunta in calce ) :
A volte la tecnologia si fa beffe della politica .
E quello che sta accadendo con la nuova chiavetta di Sky ne è un esempio molto concreto .
La Digital Key , così si chiama , è un accrocchetto di dieci grammi che una volta inserito nei decoder di Sky ( solo quelli in alta definizione , poi vedremo il perché ) permette agli abbonati di guardare tutti i programmi gratuiti del digitale terrestre senza cambiare telecomando e senza bisogno di decoder per il Dtt .
In altre parole , la chiavetta rompe il muro tra tivù satellitare ( quella di Sky ) e tivù in digitale terrestre ( quella di Mediaset e Rai ) : chi ce l ’avrà potrà ricevere entrambi i segnali .
Perché Murdoch si è inventato questa cosa ?
Perché in tecnologia o hai un formato vincente al quale prima o poi tutti si adeguano oppure è meglio aprirsi ai formati concorrenti .
E in Italia , dove il digitale terrestre è stato imposto per legge , non era pensabile per Sky chiudersi all ’infinito nel “ formato ” satellitare .
Tanto più che da un anno Berlusconi ha dichiarato guerra a Sky : prima aumentando le tasse sugli abbonamenti , poi togliendo a Sky i canali satellitari Rai , infine spingendo la tivù pubblica a criptare sempre più spesso le sue reti generaliste sulla piattaforma di Sky .
Rinchiusa nel satellite , la tivù di Murdoch stava quindi perdendo appeal e abbonati .
Di qui il coniglio dal cappello : una pennetta che consentirà agli abbonati
Sky di vedere ( senza rischio di criptaggio ) non solo i sei canali generalisti Rai e Mediaset , ma anche quelli gratuiti del Dtt - tipo Raiquattro , Raigulp , Boeing o Iris - e ripescando pure i canali Rai che erano stati tolti dalla piattaforma
Sky , come Raisat , Raisat Extra , Raisat Cinema e altri .
Quest ’ultimo ritorno dei canali pubblici nei televisori degli abbonati
Sky ha effetti grotteschi .
Infatti il direttore generale Rai , Mauro Masi , li aveva fatti togliere nell ’ ambito di un disegno molto chiaro , cioè danneggiare il più possibile l’emittente di Murdoch , che stava dando fastidio all ’azienda del premier , Mediaset .
Così l’estate scorsa Masi ha rifiutato l’offerta di Sky per quei canali : 60 milioni l’anno per sette anni ( rosso previsto in Rai nel 2009 : 50 milioni ) .
Ora però , con questa chiavetta , gli abbonati a Sky riprenderanno a vedere i canali in questione : e la Rai darà gratis agli abbonati
Sky quello per cui prima veniva pagata da Murdoch .
La strategia di viale Mazzini si è rivelata suicida .
Tuttavia non si capisce fino in fondo la mossa di Sky se non si tiene conto del fatto che questa chiavetta funziona solo con i decoder ad alta definizione .
L’Hd è la tecnologia in cui Sky è più avanti di tutti .
Già oggi trasmette 16 canali così , alla fine dell ’ anno prossimo saranno 30 : molto calcio , ma non solo .
Sull ’Hd , Sky sta facendo una grande campagna , e se riesce a convincere gli italiani che guardare l’alta definizione è più appagante e coinvolgente , ha fatto bingo .
Perché è vero che anche il digitale terrestre può trasmettere in Hd , ma - per questioni di banda - in un numero più limitato di canali .
Per esempio ,
Sky può mandare tutte le partite del campionato di calcio in alta definizione , Mediaset Premium no .
Di qui l ’idea di “ creare ” un pubblico che grazie alla chiavetta potrà vedere tutto , incluso il Dtt , ma che sul lungo termine dovrebbe preferire ( nelle intenzioni di Murdoch ) i canali Sky , gli unici o quasi in alta definizione .
Per lo stesso motivo
Sky si è inventata una formula per offrire ai suoi abbonati l’acquisto di un apparecchio tv Hd , a rate e con 50 euro d’anticipo .
E sempre per la stessa ragione , Sky sta dando solo decoder in Hd ai nuovi abbonati , che da dicembre riceveranno di default anche la nuova chiavetta ; mentre i vecchi abbonati , se non hanno il decoder
Hd , lo avranno in prestito gratuito comprando per 19 euro questa nuova pennetta .
Una strategia aggressiva , insomma , perché per
Sky più gente guarda la tivù in alta definizione meglio è .
Chi vincerà , a questo punto ?
Dipende da tanti fattori , a partire dalla ripresa dei consumi ( i canali Sky costano sempre molto ) .
In linea di massima , comunque , Sky ha evitato di farsi tagliar fuori dalla diffusione del Dtt , mentre Mediaset non piange perché ora tutti i suoi canali gratuiti in Dtt ( quelli che campano sulla pubblicità ) saranno visibili anche agli abbonati Sky .
Chi resta al tappeto è invece la Rai , che per fare un favore al premier ha buttato dalla finestra oltre 400 milioni di euro , e - investendo poco in tecnologia - sembra destinata a un futuro residuale , con previsioni di bilancio per i prossimi anni che paiono bollettini da Caporetto .
_________________
In aggiunta , rispetto a quanto pubblicato sul cartaceo .
Il povero ( si fa per dire ) Masi ha tentato di replicare dicendo che « solo una piccola parte degli abbonati Sky » ( quella che ha il decoder Hd , circa il 10 per cento dei quattro milioni di abbonati ) potrà vedere il Dtt con questa chiavetta , quindi si tratta solo di « un' abile campagna di marketing » .
Che ci sia del marketing è ovvio ,
Sky fa il suo mestiere di imprenditore , cerca clienti : e Murdoch non è certo un benefattore dell ' umanità
Il punto però è che il decoder Hd gratuito ( in comodato ) che Sky ha deciso di dare a tutti suoi abbonati che lo vorranno , farà presumibilmente esplodere nei prossimi due - tre anni il numero di coloro che avranno questo decoder
Hd in casa .
Come al solito , la Rai parla al presente e non al futuro : entro tre o quattro anni milioni di persone avranno il decoder
Hd e quindi la chiavetta , e quindi potranno vedere i canali in Dtt ( senza cambiare telecomando ) inclusi quelli che , nel suo servilismo verso Berlusconi , Masi ha tolto al pacchetto di Sky , perdendo 400 milioni di qui al 2016 .
Masi ha gettato dalla finestra 400 milioni di euro della Rai , cioè nostri , trattandosi di un'azienda pubblica .
Dovrebbe andarsene a casa , e anche subito .
One of the foremost experts on structured finance and derivatives presents a holistic overview of not only the current economic fiasco , and in 10 brief minutes with Max Keiser she provides more succinct , unbiased and relevant information that most pundits are able to convey in years on and off TV , but also highlights the bigger problem of how the administration keeps treating the US public as a bunch of stupid infants , throwing paper blankets over raging systematic fires that are anything but doused .
And yet , the administration 's ploy so far is successful , unfortunately speaking volumes about the intellectual rigor of the average gullible American .

Adding testing to pip ¶
Python packaging has been in a bit of a state of disarray for as long as I ’ve been using it .
Pip has come along to make installing python packages easier .
It has a lot of features that are useful , but they have been talked about in many other blog posts .
Today I want to talk about adding testing to pip .
If you are familiar with the Perl community , then you probably know about CPAN .
It is basically Pypi for Perl .
They have a command , called cpan , which allows you to install packages in a similar way to pip .
One of the steps that a package goes through before being installed on your system is that the tests are run .
This allows you to know if the package that you have installed is actually going to work on your system .
It may be broken on your platform , or you may be missing a library that it thought you had .
Currently , pip has no way to test packages when they are being installed .
I went looking for a way to make that happen .
It should be noted that pip is based on setuptools .
Setuptools is what parses and understands most of the logic inside of your setup ( ) function in the setup.py for your project ( which you have , right ? ) .
Setuptools has an option called test_suite , which allows you to run setup .py test on your package , and have it run the unit tests .
This is done by calling whatever python function is defined in test_suite .
I added the ability for pip to run setup .py test on a package that it is installing .
It is executed by running pip install -- test < package > .
The implementation is on a ticket on bitbucket , and in a repository on github .
If you want to check it out , go ahead and clone my repo and check out the test_command branch .
Then you can simply run
python pip .
py install -- test wsgiref
for an example package .
If a package does n’t have a test_suite , then it simply does n’t run anything .
Note that if the tests fail , it does n’t impact the installation of the package .
The python community ’s tests are n’t quite good enough , and almost any Django package you try this on will not have any tests .
I wrote about how to add testing to your django package , but the process is long and involved .
I ’m working to improve the situation for Django and hopefully having the ability to run tests in the package management tool will spur people to add testing ability to their setup scripts !
Nose makes this really easy , by simply adding test_suite = ' nose.collector ' to your setup.py , nose will run your tests correctly .
This is the level of support that I am hoping to implement for Django .
On a side node , I talked to Ian Bicking about this , and he suggested writing the test command as a separate command , so you would be able to do pip test wsgiref , if it was installed .
This has some other problems , which I will talk about after I have implemented this functionality .
I would love to hear feedback , or if anyone has ideas for improving testing in the python and django communities .
I have lots of ideas , and I will be writing more of them up over the following weeks .
How to Open VHD File and Mount VHD File without using Virtual PC Microsoft Virtual PC ( VPC ) is a great virtualization tool where IT professionals like administrators , developers , and testers are using a lot .
It is easy to build a virtual pc on your computer without affecting your host system .
On the other hand virtual pc users frequently require to mount vhd file while they used as a virtual disk of your virtual operating system hard disk .
In this short step - by - step tutorial , I will try to demonstrate how to open vhd file and mount vhd file using free tool Gizmo
First let 's start by talking about " What is VHD file format "
VHD or Virtual Hard Disk ( VHD ) Image Format Specification is created and developed by Microsoft for specifying a virtual machine hard disk .
Using this VHD file format specification , third party software producers can build virtualization tools reading and writing virtual machine hard disk .
Now let 's continue to mount a VHD file using Gizmo tool after a short detailed information about VHD file format .
First of all , you can download free vhd mounting tool from Arainia Solutions web site Gizmo Central v2.7 download pages .
After you complete download vhd mount tool , where the total download size is approximately 8 MB , run the setup .
Note that before using Gizmo Central mount vhd tool , you should restart your computer .
This requirement for reboot is the only disadvantage of using Gizmo Central as a solution to open vhd files .
After you restart your computer , Gizmo Manager toolbar will place itself on the system tray .
Open the Gizmo Manager tool , and select the Virtual Drives from the left hand side panel in the Gizmo Manager tool .
Click on an empty Virtual Drive record in the Virtual Drives tab .
Open the context menu on the empty slot and select " Mount Image " menu item to open vhd file .
When the Mount Image dialog wizard is displayed , you can select details like virtual disk vhd file path that you want to mount as a disk drive to your computer disk management .
You can also assign a desired letter for the mounted disk image of the related virtual vhd file .
If you want to map disk as a drive everytime you restart your computer , you can automate mounting or openning vhd file by checking the option " Remount image when Windows starts up " .
You have also the option to open vhd file in read - only mode which prevents an accidental loss of data in the virtual vhd disk file .
When you select " Mount image as read - only " , you will avoid file deletion in the Virtual PC vhd virtual disk .
After you press the OK button the virtual disk mount operation is completed and Gizmo will open Windows Explorer .
On the Windows Explorer , the contents of the virtual disk vhd file contents are displayed .
The virtual disk is mapped using the letter selected as a new disk drive .
As you see , to mount vhd file and open vhd file with contents readable and even editable is so simple with Gizmo Central .

Senior angst and anger have been on vivid display as President Obama struggles to sell his health care reform package politically , but Mr. Obama is faring much better with another key demographic : the young .
Younger voters are disproportionately fans of Mr. Obama and his health care plan , polls show .
A Pew Research Center study found that 66 percent of adults younger than 30 voted for Mr. Obama .
Nearly 70 percent of these voters favor expanding the role of government as a way to solve the nation ’s problems , including medical coverage .
That support could be seen in downtown Missoula , Mont. , one day this summer at lunchtime , where passers - by were confronted by a group of young people dressed in doctors scrubs and wielding stethoscopes .
They were not looking to check heart rates ; they were trying to build support for health care reform .
The White House clearly has discovered this affinity and is trying to capitalize on it .
At the University of Maryland last month , Mr. Obama appealed directly for the support of young adults , calling health care reform the “ defining struggle of this generation . ”
“ That journey does n’t start in Washington , D.C. ; it begins in College Park and on college campuses like this , ” he added .
A coalition of pro-reform youth groups has labeled itself “ Generation H ” for health care reform .
Conservative groups opposed to the president ’s health care plans also see the trend and say they have struggled to enlist younger voters in their cause .
“ It has been hard , ” said Kerri Toloczko , policy director for Conservatives for Patients ’ Rights .
“ Young folks just do n’t understand because they have n’t had the life experience . ”
“ We need to explain to them the destructive nature of government , ” she added .
As a generation , young adults represent the largest percentage of the population without health insurance in the United States .
A recent Gallup Poll found nearly 30 percent of those who say they are uninsured fall into the 18 - to 29 - year - old range .
Young adults also tend to be more supportive of congressional action on health care reform than those in other age groups .
A Pew survey in July found 61 percent of young people favored spending on health care , compared with 37 percent who favored reducing the deficit .
In August , 45 percent of young people said they favor legislation being debated in Congress , while 38 percent opposed it .
Older Americans , by contrast , have been wary of health care reform .
Only a third of Americans 65 and older say they favor the legislation being discussed in Congress , and more than half oppose it .
The powerful senior lobby AARP revealed that 60,000 of its members quit between early July and mid-August after the organization announced it was broadly in support of Mr. Obama ’s drive to overhaul the nation ’s health care system .
AARP has resisted endorsing specific bills being considered by the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate .
Andy Shirtliff , a student and waiter , campaigned for health care reform in Montana for years , but the debate became personal this year when he was denied coverage for a pre-existing condition .
He learned that he had early stages of rheumatoid arthritis .
When he tried to move his health coverage from his student group plan to a private plan before he graduated from college , he was told his health records gave him an automatic denial .
Now he ’s taking an extra class at college so he can stay on the University of Montana ’s Blue Cross / Blue Shield plan while he searches for other options .
“ Now I really want to help people and I believe this is our moment and we actually have a chance , ” he said .
Despite their backing for Mr. Obama , young people were far less likely this summer to attend town - hall meetings , call their congressional representatives or donate money in support of health care .
That comes down to timing and location , said Matthew Singer , founder and chief executive officer of Forward Montana , a political action organization focused on training the next generation of progressive leaders in Montana .
“ Who ’s free to go to a town - hall meeting at 1 p.m. on a Tuesday ?
It ’s people who have freedom over their schedules ; it tends to be professionals who are established or the boss or retirees , ” Mr. Singer said .
Campus Progress , an arm of the liberal Center for American Progress , has found that the most reaction comes from people ’s stories and shared experiences .
In addition to providing information on its Web site and through blogs , it started a journalism project to share health care stories .
Montana Progress also uses humor to reach out to a younger audience .
Dressing up in fake surgical smocks , their volunteers approach young people at farmers markets , on college campuses , at popular lunch spots and at sporting events to lobby for health care reform .
It ’s not that they do n’t take the issue seriously , said Mr. Singer , but this generation relates more to lightheartedness and sarcasm .
“ It ’s complex and there ’s a lot of stuff .
We find people open up more with someone who is n’t taking themselves too seriously , ” he said .
“ This is the ‘ Daily Show ’ generation , the whole bring - some - hum or - into - it thing is pretty well accepted by young people . ”

BEIJING 
Nine people have been executed for taking part in ethnic rioting that convulsed a western regional capital in July and left nearly 200 people dead , a state news agency reported Monday .
The report by the China News Service did not give any further details of the executions , except to say that the cases had all been reviewed by the Supreme People ’s Court , a legally mandated step in death penalty cases in China .
The report , which was removed from the Internet early Tuesday , did not say when the executions occurred .
The ethnicity of those executed was unclear .
The report simply called them “ criminals . ”
The rioting that broke out in the regional capital , Urumqi , on July 5 was largely carried out by Uighurs , a Turkic - speaking people who mostly follow Sunni Islam and are the biggest ethnic group in the vast Central Asian border region of Xinjiang .
Many Uighurs resent what they call discrimination by Han , the dominant ethnic group in China ; the Chinese government says that 197 people were killed and 1,600 people injured on July 5 , most of them Han .

How to destroy five million roubles of vodka and cognac in just five seconds , by warehouse forklift driver
If you 've already been yelled at by your boss today , this is likely to make you feel a whole lot better .
For it 's not many workers who can say they destroyed an entire warehouse full of alcohol in just a few seconds .
Yet that is just what this poor forklift driver in Russia did in a video that emerged on the internet on Friday .
[ caption ]

[ caption ]
The video , which appears to be taken from a CCTV camera in the roof of the warehouse , shows the forklift driver backing up just a little bit too quickly .
He strikes a stack of boxes containing bottle of cognac and vodka - and the impact , to the horror of those standing by , brings the entire contents of the warehouse crashing down in a freak domino effect .
Workmen are pictured frantically clambering over the rubble to reach the two forklift drivers who appear to have been buried under the thousands of bottles .
And , lo and behold , that impact brings the stacks on the OTHER side of the warehouse crashing down
[ caption ]
Fortunately no one was seriously injured , with one driver suffering a wound to his foot , and the other apparently escaping unscathed .
Five million roubles ( £ 105,000 ) worth of alcohol was destroyed in the accident , according to the Russian website that posted the video , scandalim.ru .
It is not clear if the driver had been sampling some of the stored wares when the incident occurred .
The video from the warehouse , which was not named , was posted on Friday .

According to a recent study published in the November 11 edition of Science Translational Medicine , a high - sugar , high - carbohydrate diet might cause changes in the composition of bacteria in intestines which could make people on these diet are more prone to putting on weight , and much faster .
For the sake of research , laboratory mice were put on the said diet and it caused almost immediate changes to the gut flora bacteria in them , and the mice turned obese in a very short span of time .
The study has led researchers to believe that the same could be true for humans and they are now looking to study the many micro-organism that reside in human intestines more closely .
" Although how much you eat and how much you exercise are dominant drivers of your energy balance , it 's possible that microbial communities and how they work also comprise a factor that determines your risk for obesity or risk for malnutrition " , said study senior author Dr. Jeffrey I. Gordon .
Dr. Gordon is the Director of the Center for Genome Sciences at the Washington University School of Medicine .
The study 's findings are being viewed as much valuable in times where obesity is spreading like an epidemic .
Researchers will now be conducting further studies on the cues discovered through this study .
The Minnesota high school hockey season gets started fairly soon .
Tryouts are under way and games start in a couple of weeks .
That means it 's time to start up the high school hockey coverage again .
We 'll start things off with my annual Mr. Hockey Watch List .
It 's my annual list of 10 - - or in this year 's case 11 , since I decided to add a name late , and did n't want to take anyone off -- players who are candidates for the Minnesota Mr. Hockey award , given annually to the state 's top senior hockey player .
The award is voted on by college coaches and scouts , so it 's often more about who has the most talent , as opposed to who has the best stats .
The favorite coming into this year is Blaine 's Nick Bjugstad , who should technically be a junior , but is accelerating his schooling to finish high school this year , and thanks to the precedent set by Roseau 's Aaron Ness , he is eligible for the award .
But there are a lot of really strong players this year .
It should be an excellent year for high school hockey .
The whole list is after the jump .
Nick Bjugstad - Blaine High School - Committed to Minnesota
It 's tough to really call Nick Bjugstad a late - bloomer .
Not when he was scoring goals for his team in the state tournament sectional finals as a 9th grader .
And not when he 's finishing high school a year early to play for the University of Minnesota next season .
But last fall , Bjugstad was 5 ' 10 " 155 lbs.
and while he may have been on the radar of some pro teams , he certainly was n't considered a can 't - miss - prospect .
Now , Bjugstad is 6 ' 4 " 185 lbs and has drawn the attention of every NHL team as a potential first round draft pick .
He 's always been gifted with a world - class shot , but his newfound size has turned him into a stronger skater and a physical force .
He should be the top pro prospect in the state of Minnesota , and he should be the leader of a talented Blaine team that is likely to make another trip to the state tournament .
Caleb Herbert - Bloomington Jefferson - Committed to Minnesota - Duluth
Bloomington Jefferson returns a lot of key players from an excellent squad last season , and should once again be among the top handful of teams in the state .
Caleb Herbert may not be the most prized NHL prospect in the state , but he should score a ton of goals and be a leader on a top - notch team , which is sure to draw him a lot of attention for Mr. Hockey .
Herbert 's best assets are his offensive instincts and lightning quick release on his shot .
He led the Upper Midwest Elite League in scoring this fall , and finish among the top scorers in the state during the high school season could give him a shot at winning the award .
Brock Nelson - Warroad High School - Committed to North Dakota
At the end of last season , Brock Nelson may have been lower on this list , despite helping lead his Warroad Warriors to the state tournament .
But Nelson had an exceptional fall Elite League , which helped him earn a commitment to North Dakota , and catch the attention of many scouts to becoming a rising prospect for the NHL Draft .
There are a couple things working against Nelson .
First , his power forward style of play works more effectively with a playmaker helping set him up .
Nelson is n't the type of player to skate end - to - end around five guys and score a goal .
Second , fair or not , he 's not going to get nearly the attention of a Bjugstad or Herbert playing in the northwest corner of the state .
But while the average hockey fan or media member may not follow him much up there , there will definitely be a lot of scouts that make the trip up to Warroad and they 'll recognize what a quality hockey player he is .
Joey Benik - St. Francis HS - Committed to St. Cloud
Much like Ben Hanowski last season , there 's yet another St. Cloud recruit that is bound to put up amazing numbers against questionable competition , and be a source of discussion and debate all season long .
But Benik does n't have nearly the pedigree outside of high school hockey that Hanowski did , that helped proved Hanowski was one of the state 's best .
Benik definitely has talent , but his style of play with his high school team - long shifts , rarely treading into his own defensive zone - are bound to put up huge numbers that will impress people who read about him in newspapers ( or online , nobody reads newspapers anymore ) , but it will also probably leave those that actually get out to watch him play unimpressed .
Anyone from Minnetonka High School
More specifically , Max Gardiner ( Minnesota ) , Troy Hesketh ( Wisconsin ) , Andrew Prochno( St. Cloud ) , and Justin Holl ( Minnesota ) .
All four are future WCHA players , and three are potential NHL draft picks , while Hesketh was already drafted in the third round of last year 's draft .
The problem is : how do you separate them ?
With that many good players , especially on the blueline , it 's probably going to be hard for one player to stand out that much above the others to be considered for the Mr. Hockey .
Too many good players is a nice problem to have , and I 'm sure all four would much rather earn a trip to the state tournament together than win an individual award .
Mark Alt - Cretin- Derham Hall - Committed to Minnesota
Mark
Alt might be the best athlete playing high school hockey in the state .
The big , smooth - skating defenseman was also a star quarterback for his high school , and a marginal Division I college football prospect .
But there are also some question marks about his hockey sense .
Players his size that skate like he does do n't come around very often , which is sure to have scouts intrigued , and if he plays well , he might have an outside shot at even winning the award , but odds are , he 's not quite polished enough yet to be seriously considered .
Max Gaede - Woodbury HS - Committed to Minnesota State
Gaede is a unique player in that his two strongest skills are grinding along the boards , and making excellent passes to teammates .
He 's not guaranteed to be an NHL draft pick this summer , but he's at least played well enough to pique the interest of scouts , while his Woodbury team is starting to become a powerhouse in the eastern suburbs .
Adam Knochenmus - Roseau - Uncommitted
One of my favorite players to watch , Adam Knochenmus has just about everything you could want in a hockey player except ideal size .
He is always the hardest working player on the ice , and despite his size , is absolutely fearless .
He 's extremely unselfish and is really good at getting his teammates the puck in great position .
Knochenmus really is n't on the NHL radar right now , which probably kills any chance of him having a shot at the award , but he definitely deserves recognition as one of the state 's best .
Cal Decowski-Andover High School - Uncommitted
Decowski is one of the best kept secrets in the state of Minnesota .
Like Knochenmus , he 's a small player that is off the NHL 's radar , and the school he plays for is n't a powerhouse in high school hockey , so that probably eliminates him from much consideration , but he's as talented and exciting a player to watch as nearly anyone in the state .
He 's a shifty offensive player that can stickhandle around any defender and create great scoring chances from next to nothing .
Christian Isackson - St. Thomas Academy - Committed to Minnesota
Isackson never got big enough , or fast enough to become the top - notch player some thought he might be when he was younger , but he 's still exceptionally smart with the puck and should put up a ton of points on a very good St. Thomas team this year .
Linemate Justin Crandall may also end up being considered for the award .
Chris Casto- Hill - Murray - Uncommitted
Casto is like a slightly smaller , more polished version of Mark Alt .
He 's very effective in all three zones of the ice .
It 's tough to pick out one area where he 's great , but he does everything pretty well .
Casto should be the leader of a Hill - Murray team that is always strong , but probably still a year away from making a more serious run at things .
October 7 , 2009 – ARCATA , Calif . —
Stiff competition from thousands of mom-and - pop marijuana farmers in the United States threatens the bottom line for powerful Mexican drug organizations in a way that decades of arrests and seizures have not , according to law enforcement officials and pot growers in the United States and Mexico .
Illicit pot production in the United States has been increasing steadily for decades .
But recent changes in state laws that allow the use and cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes are giving U.S. growers a competitive advantage , challenging the traditional dominance of the Mexican traffickers , who once made brands such as Acapulco Gold the standard for quality .
Almost all of the marijuana consumed in the multibillion - dollar U.S. market once came from Mexico or Colombia .
Now as much as half is produced domestically , often by small - scale operators who painstakingly tend greenhouses and indoor gardens to produce the more potent , and expensive , product that consumers now demand , according to authorities and marijuana dealers on both sides of the border .
The shifting economics of the marijuana trade have broad implications for Mexico ’s war against the drug cartels , suggesting that market forces , as much as law enforcement , can extract a heavy price from criminal organizations that have used the spectacular profits generated by pot sales to fuel the violence and corruption that plague the Mexican state .
While the trafficking of cocaine , heroin and methamphetamine is the main focus of U.S. law enforcement , it is marijuana that has long provided most of the revenue for Mexican drug cartels .
More than 60 percent of the cartels ’ revenue — $ 8.6 billion out of $ 13.8 billion in 2006 — came from U.S. marijuana sales , according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy .
Now , to stay competitive , Mexican traffickers are changing their business model to improve their product and streamline delivery .
Well - organized Mexican cartels have also moved to increasingly cultivate marijuana on public lands in the United States , according to the National Drug Intelligence Center and local authorities .
This strategy gives the Mexicans direct access to U.S. markets , avoids the risk of seizure at the border and reduces transportation costs .
Unlike cocaine , which the traffickers must buy and transport from South America , driving up costs , marijuana has been especially lucrative for the cartels because they control the business all the way from clandestine fields in the Mexican mountains to the wholesale dealers in U.S. cities such as Washington .
“ It ’s pure profit , ” said Jorge Chabat , an expert on the drug trade at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City .
The exact dimensions of the U.S. marijuana market are unknown .
The 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 14.4 million Americans age 12 and over had used marijuana in the past month .
More than 10 percent of the U.S. population reported smoking pot once in the past year .
Mexico produced 35 million pounds of marijuana last year , according to government estimates .
On a hidden hilltop field in Mexico ’s Sinaloa state , reachable by donkey , a pound of pot might earn a farmer $ 25 .
The wholesale price for the same pound in Phoenix is $ 550 , and so the Mexican cartels could be selling $ 20 billion worth of marijuana in the U.S. market each year .
“ Marijuana created the drug trafficking organizations you see today .
The founding families of the cartels got their start with pot .
And marijuana remains a highly profitable business they will fight to protect , ” said Luis Astorga , a leading authority on the drug cartels at the National Autonomous University of Mexico , who grew up in Sinaloa in 1960s and recalls seeing major growers at social functions in the state capital , Culiacan .
Led by California , 13 U.S. states now permit some use of marijuana ; Maryland is considering such a law .
In many cities , marijuana is one of the lowest priorities for police .

New research adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting the Red Planet once had an ocean .
In a new study , scientists from Northern Illinois University and the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston used an innovative computer program to produce a new and more detailed global map of the valley networks on Mars .
The findings indicate the networks are more than twice as extensive ( 2.3 times longer in total length ) as had been previously depicted in the only other planet - wide map of the valleys .
Further , regions that are most densely dissected by the valley networks roughly form a belt around the planet between the equator and mid-southern latitudes , consistent with a past climate scenario that included precipitation and the presence of an ocean covering a large portion of Mars ' northern hemisphere .
Scientists have previously hypothesized that a single ocean existed on ancient Mars , but the issue has been hotly debated .
" All the evidence gathered by analyzing the valley network on the new map points to a particular climate scenario on early Mars , " NIU Geography Professor Wei Luo said .
" It would have included rainfall and the existence of an ocean covering most of the northern hemisphere , or about one - third of the planet 's surface . "
Luo and Tomasz Stepinski , a staff scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute , publish their findings in the current issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research -- Planets .

" The presence of more valleys indicates that it most likely rained on ancient Mars , while the global pattern showing this belt of valleys could be explained if there was a big northern ocean , " Stepinski said .
Valley networks on Mars exhibit some resemblance to river systems on Earth , suggesting the Red Planet was once warmer and wetter than present .
But , since the networks were discovered in 1971 by the Mariner 9 spacecraft , scientists have debated whether they were created by erosion from surface water , which would point to a climate with rainfall , or through a process of erosion known as groundwater sapping .
Groundwater sapping can occur in cold , dry conditions .
The large disparity between river - network densities on Mars and Earth had provided a major argument against the idea that runoff erosion formed the valley networks .
But the new mapping study reduces the disparity , indicating some regions of Mars had valley network densities more comparable to those found on Earth .
" It is now difficult to argue against runoff erosion as the major mechanism of Martian valley network formation , " Luo said .

" When you look at the entire planet , the density of valley dissection on Mars is significantly lower than on Earth , " he said .
" However , the most densely dissected regions of Mars have densities comparable to terrestrial values .
" The relatively high values over extended regions indicate the valleys originated by means of precipitation - fed runoff erosion -- the same process that is responsible for formation of the bulk of valleys on our planet , " he added .
The researchers created an updated planet - wide map of the valley networks by using a computer algorithm that parses topographic data from NASA satellites and recognizes valleys by their U - shaped topographic signature .
The computer - generated map was visually inspected and edited with help from NIU graduate students Yi Qi and Bartosz Grudzinski to produce the final updated map .
" The only other global map of the valley networks was produced in the 1990s by looking at images and drawing on top of them , so it was fairly incomplete and it was not correctly registered with current datum , " Stepinski said .
" Our map was created semi-automatically , with the computer algorithm working from topographical data to extract the valley networks .
It is more complete , and shows many more valley networks . "
Stepinski developed the algorithms used in the mapping .
" The basic idea behind our method is to flag landforms having a U - shaped structure that is characteristic of the valleys , " Stepinski added .
" The valleys are mapped only where they are seen by the algorithm . "
The Martian surface is characterized by lowlands located mostly in the northern hemisphere and highlands located mostly in the southern hemisphere .
Given this topography , water would accumulate in the northern hemisphere , where surface elevations are lower than the rest of the planet , thus forming an ocean , the researchers said .
" Such a single - ocean planet would have an arid continental - type climate over most of its land surfaces , " Luo said .
The northern - ocean scenario meshes with a number of other characteristics of the valley networks .
" A single ocean in the northern hemisphere would explain why there is a southern limit to the presence of valley networks , " Luo added .
" The southernmost regions of Mars , located farthest from the water reservoir , would get little rainfall and would develop no valleys .
This would also explain why the valleys become shallower as you go from north to south , which is the case .
" Rain would be mostly restricted to the area over the ocean and to the land surfaces in the immediate vicinity , which correlates with the belt - like pattern of valley dissection seen in our new map , " Luo said .
The research was funded by NASA .

You know what ’s really scary ?
Ghosts and vampires ?
Not really ; they do n’t exist .
What really freaks me out is plagues , pestilence , serial killers , bio -hazards !
I spent the last week thinking about the Martha Stewart lollipops , and how they could be made more scary .
I tried to brainstorm more gruesome fillings but it was n’t creepy enough .
Then I started thinking of what ’s really scary .
Serial killers !
I immediately thought of Dexter and his blood slides .
For any of you who are n’t familiar with the show , Dexter is about a serial killer of the same name , who works by day as a forensic analyst for the Miami police department , and by night , cleansing the city of the evil criminals who slip through the cracks of our faulty judicial system .
Every serial killer has to keep his mementos and Dexter ’s trophy case , consists of a box of slides , each containing one drop of blood from each victim .
For this years gruesome Halloween treat , I decided to create a trophy case of my own .
I followed the same basic recipe as the Martha one , but I cut mine in half since the slides are much smaller and thinner then her lollipops .
Here ’s the recipe and directions with a few of my own small changes .
Biohazard Blood Slides
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup light corn syrup
2 Tbs water
red food dye
bamboo skewer or tooth pic
Directions
1 . Line a few baking sheets with Silpat nonstick baking mats or parchment paper .
2. Bring sugar , corn syrup , and 2
Tbs water to a boil in a small saucepan , stirring until sugar is dissolved .
Do n’t stir , but occasionally wash down sides of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water to prevent crystals from forming ; boil until mixture turns golden , 5 to 7 minutes .
3 . Pour the melted sugar mixture in a line down the center of the pan .
Using a skewer or the flat edge of a large knife , spread sugar into a thin flat sheet .
Glass slides are pretty thin , so the thinner the better .
It will also be easier to cut in the next steps .
4 . Once you have the mixture spread into a flat sheet , let it cool and harden for 5 - 10 minutes .
Once the mixture is hard , pull it away from the mat or parchment .
If its super thin , try not to crack it .
5 . Place the blade of a large knife ( not necessarily your best ) directly into your burner to heat .
If you have an electric stove , you can use a lighter .
Once the blade is hot , begin to cut your sheets of sugar into strips .
Cut edges to be the length of a real slide .
Its good to have a glass slide to use as a template .
This step can be a bit annoying .
Do n’t worry if you break a few , it happens .
Reheat the blade for each cut .
Between each cut , wash your blade off with water to keep the sugar from burning to your blade .
I do n’t suggest using your best knife , since this heating and cooling is n’t the best treatment for your chef ’s blade .
If the edges are really rough , dip your finger and water and smooth them out .
6 . Lay your cut slides on your baking tray and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes .
7 . Take slides out of fridge .
Using a tooth pic or a bamboo skewer , paint on the blood circle in the center .
You do n’t need too much .
A small droplet off the tip of your tooth pic will be enough .
If you put too much on , it will run all over the slide and make a huge mess .
Refridgerate again until the dye is dry and you ’re done !
You can serve these guys up with a pile of latex gloves to protect the hands while handling these dangerous items or you can serve with tweezers .
Either way , the point comes across clear ( with a big bloody red spot in the center .
Ha ! ) .
I took a quick visit to the Science Surplus Store hoping to find a wooden slide box .
No luck !
So I just got one of the cheesy slide kits which came with a cardboard box to display the slides at an angle .
Maybe for next year , I ’ll try to find a box on ebay or something .
One way or the other , even if you do n’t know about the show , blood slides are still gross .
You can tell people they are blood samples infected with ebola or something like that .
Biohazards are super scary .
If you do n’t believe me , watch season 3 of 24 .
Actually you can watch any season of 24 , because I think they throw a little Biohazard chemical warefare wherever they can .
ENJOY !

Anyway , The Vamp , have at it .
For a depressing example of how members of Congress can be spoon - fed the views and even the exact words of high - powered lobbying firms , consider remarks inserted into the Congressional Record after the debate and vote on health care reform in the House .
As Robert Pear reported in The Times on Sunday , statements inserted into the official record by more than a dozen lawmakers were ghostwritten , in whole or in part , by lobbyists working for Genentech , a large biotechnology company that expects to prosper under some of the provisions in the reform legislation .
The company estimates that 22 Republicans and 20 Democrats picked up some of its talking points .
The comforting news is that none of the ghostwritten material sought to change the contents of the bill , which was not open to much revision during the debate .
Rather , the statements were inserted into the Congressional Record as revisions and extensions of briefer remarks made by legislators on the House floor .
Still , there they are in the official record for historians to read , or perhaps a judge trying to determine the lawmakers ’ intent in passing this bill .
The apparent goal was to show that , even though there were sharp divisions between the parties on the overall reform bill ( only one Republican voted for it ) , there was bipartisan support for provisions relating to drugs produced by the biotechnology industry .
One provision , for example , would allow generic competition to expensive biological drugs but only after the original manufacturer had enjoyed 12 years of exclusive use , a generous period by anyone ’s standards .
Editor 's note : Hamid Dabashi is the author of " Iran : A People Interrupted . "
He is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York .
His Web site is http://www.hamiddabashi.com/.
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- November 4 is the 30th anniversary of the Iran hostage crisis , a turning point in Iranian history , in the geopolitics of the region and in the troubled history of U.S. - Iran relations .
On that day , militants , many of them students , invaded the U.S. embassy in Tehran , taking about 70 Americans as hostages in a drama that would last 444 days .
I am one of the last Iranian students who peacefully walked into the United States embassy in Tehran .
I went there in July 1976 with a recently acquired Iranian passport and an even more recently obtained acceptance letter from the University of Pennsylvania , and an I - 20 form , as we called it then .
Then a 25 - year - old , I applied for a visa , received one and boarded a plane to Philadelphia .
In just about a second and a half , the way time flies these days , I will turn 60 , and I will have a claim over Philadelphia and New York as my successive hometowns more than I do over the cities in which I was born and received my college education , Ahvaz and Tehran .
I 've seen both sides of the tension between Iran and the United States :
Two homelands that have so far failed to connect on friendly terms .
My time in America began with the Gerald Ford - Jimmy Carter presidential debates .
When the hostages were taken in Tehran , President Carter ordered the cancellation of our student visas .
That meant we had to report to the Immigration and Naturalization Service , secure a temporary extension of our status , and forfeit any possibility of leaving the country -- for we would have not been allowed back -- until we could obtain the much - coveted green card .
Ted Koppel began counting the days of the hostage crisis on " Nightline . "
It made for a difficult time when I had to face my American classmates and colleagues .
Over the last month , and in anticipation of this day , an open - ended war has been waged between the supporters of the status quo in Iran and the champions of change in Iranian political culture .
As Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government and its clerical supporters are gearing up for business as usual of " Death to America ! " chants and marches to mark the anniversary , the nonviolent , grassroots , civil rights movement has produced its own posters and placards , leading with the chant : " Death to no one ! "
If Americans are cursed with a very short memory , Iranians have been plagued with very long recollections .
They talk about the Arab / Muslim conquest of the mid-seventh century AD as if it happened the day before yesterday , and they consider the CIA - engineered coup of 1953 as if it were indeed yesterday .
But this year , commemoration of historical events has turned into a battle for a happier and healthier future , rather than a tiresome marking of the troublesome past .
Iran and the United States have charted divergent and hostile paths over the last 30 years .
The legitimate fear of a U.S. - led coup on the model of 1953 resulted in an illegitimate breach of diplomatic immunity and the taking over of the U.S. embassy and its staff .
Ayatollah Khomeini then abused that crisis to build a theocracy and crack down on all alternative claims on that revolution .
When the American hostages had served their purpose , Khomeini 's regime released them in January 1981 .
By then he had bigger fish to fry in the course of the Iran - Iraq war ( 1980 - 1988 ) .
Under that smoke screen ( which he prolonged long after Saddam Hussein had realized his folly and was ready for peace talks )
Khomeini cracked down even more violently on internal opposition .
On the American side , the story was no less sad and catastrophic .
Under President Reagan and subsequent U.S. administrations , Saddam Hussein was armed to the teeth to confront the Islamic Republic .
At the same time , the Afghan Mujahedeen ( soon to be transmuted into " the Taliban " ) were even more massively armed ( via Pakistani intelligence and Saudi money -- fueled by militant Wahabism ) to battle the Soviets and prevent the spread of the Shia - inspired Iranian revolution into Central Asia .
The strategy succeeded , the Islamic revolution turned inward , killed its own children and aggressively degenerated into a terrorizing theocracy .
But soon the two monsters the United States and its allies had created , Saddam Hussein and the Taliban , came back to haunt their creators .
Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait soon after the end of the Iran - Iraq war , almost at the same time that Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda operation , feeding on the Talibanization of Afghanistan , began a series of terrorist attacks on U.S. interests that ultimately culminated in the events of 9/11 .
That resulted in the U.S. led - invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001 and of Iraq in March 2003 .
And our world has remained in the grips of the decades - old spiral of violence ever since .
Roger Cohen has written a column for the New York Times speculating about what would have happened if the massive June demonstrations in Iran had been successful in dismantling the Islamic republic .
One must also wonder what would have happened if the coup of 1953 had not implanted a national trauma in Iran that laid the groundwork for Ayatollah Khomeini 's anti-American measures and the creation of a repressive government .
When on November 4 , you see throngs of young Iranians chanting " Death to No one ! " they are not just challenging the brutal theocracy that is distorting their history and abusing their youth , they are also raising a gentle accusatory finger at their own parental generation .
I am father to four American children -- two born in Allentown , Pennsylvania and two in New York City -- who have never set foot in their parental homeland .
The Iran they now watch on television , track on the Internet , and follow in the news is no longer paralyzed by the post - traumatic syndrome of the 1953 coup .
A young generation of Iranians -- 80 percent of the population under the age of 40 , 70 percent under 30 , 50 percent under 25 -- seems determined to chart a future free from their parental follies .
So one day with the first direct flight from JFK to Mehrabad Airport , I , too , might take my children , two of them now old enough to have voted for President Obama , to the other side of who they are -- and of who they must proudly be .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi .
The best available explanation is that they are literally the earliest known works of art  practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects , contemplated both for their elegant shape and virtuoso craftsmanship .
Hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human prehistory , tools attractively fashioned to function as what Darwinians call “ fitness signals ”  displays like the glorious peacock ’s tail , which functions to show peahens the strength and vitality of the males who display it .
Hand axes , however , were not grown , but consciously , cleverly made .
They were therefore able to indicate desirable personal qualities : intelligence , fine motor control , planning ability and conscientiousness .
Such skills gained for those who displayed them status and a reproductive advantage over the less capable .
Across many thousands of generations this translated into both an increase in intelligence and an evolved sense that the symmetry and craftsmanship of hand axes is “ beautiful . ”
Aesthetically pleasing hand axes constitute an unbroken Stone - Age tradition that stretches over a million years , ending 100,000 to 150,000 years ago , about the time that their makers ’
African descendants , now called Homo sapiens , started to become articulate speakers of language .
These humans were probably finding new ways to amuse and amaze one another with  who knows ?
 jokes , dramatic storytelling , dancing or hairstyling .
Alas , geological layers do not record these other , more perishable aspects of prehistoric life .
For us moderns , the arts have come to depict imaginary worlds and express intense emotions with music , painting , dance and fiction .
However , one trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings : the pleasure we take in admiring skilled performances .
From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall  where now and again the Homo erectus hairs stand up on the backs of our necks  human beings have a permanent , innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts .
We ought , then , to stop kidding ourselves that painstakingly developed artistic technique is passé , a value left over from our grandparents ’ culture .
Evidence is all around us .
Even when we have lost contact with the social or religious ideas behind the arts of bygone civilizations , we are still able , as with the great bronzes or temples of Greece or ancient China , to respond directly to craftsmanship .
The direct response to skill is what makes it possible to find beauty in many tribal arts even though we often know nothing about the beliefs of the people who created them .
There is no place on earth where superlative technique in music and dance is not regarded as beautiful .
The appreciation of contemporary conceptual art , on the other hand , depends not on immediately recognizable skill , but on how the work is situated in today ’s intellectual zeitgeist .
That ’s why looking through the history of conceptual art after Duchamp reminds me of paging through old New Yorker cartoons .
Jokes about Cadillac tailfins and early fax machines were once amusing , and the same can be said of conceptual works like Piero Manzoni ’s 1962 declaration that Earth was his art work , Joseph Kosuth ’s 1965 “ One and Three Chairs ” ( a chair , a photo of the chair and a definition of “ chair ” ) or Mr. Hirst ’s medicine cabinets .
Future generations , no longer engaged by our art “ concepts ” and unable to divine any special skill or emotional expression in the work , may lose interest in it as a medium for financial speculation and relegate it to the realm of historical curiosity .
NEW YORK (
The Street
) --
As the unemployment rate crossed the double - digit barrier for the first time since Michael Jackson learned to moonwalk , President Obama announced that he will convene a " jobs summit " to finally bring the problem under control .
Using all the analytic skill that his administration can muster , the president is determined to figure out why so many people are losing their jobs and then formulate a solution .
That 's a relief .
For a while there , I thought we were in real trouble !
In fact , the absolute last thing our economy needs is more federal government interference .
If Obama really wants to know what 's behind entrenched joblessness , he should start by looking at the man in the mirror .
Obama is pursuing , with unprecedented vigor , the same policies that have for decades undermined our industrial base and yoked us to an unsustainable consumer / credit driven economy .
This doubling down on Washington 's past failures is destroying jobs at an alarming rate .
On Friday we learned that the September trade deficit surged by 18.2 % , the largest gain in 10 years .
Much of the deficit resulted from Americans spending Cash - for - Clunkers stimulus money on imported cars -- or " American " cars loaded to the sunroof with imported parts .
In exchange for more domestic debt , we have succeeded only in creating foreign jobs .
An recent
New York Times
article by veteran writer Louis Uchitelle confirmed a fact that I have been alleging for years .
Uchitelle pointed out that foreign outsourcing of component manufacturing has led to consistent overstatement of U.S. GDP and productivity .
The connection goes a long way to explain why we keep losing jobs even as GDP is apparently expanding .
As our economy becomes less competitive due to higher taxes , burdensome and uncertain regulations , and capital flight , more manufacturing and services will be outsourced to foreign firms .
However , the flaw in GDP calculation allows the output of those foreign workers to be included in our domestic tally .
Since we count the output but not the worker responsible for it , government statisticians attribute the gains to rising labor productivity .
To them , it looks like companies are producing more goods with fewer workers .
The reality is that we are producing less with fewer workers .
The added " productivity " comes from higher unemployment and larger trade deficits .
This is a toxic formula that will have lethal economic consequences .
Do n't expect the brain trust at the President 's job summit to fret much about these details .
That public relations stunt will likely ignore the root cause of the economic imbalances and instead stress the need for government spending on training and education , i.e. more public debt .
The unemployed do not need government theatrics , they need actual jobs .
But as long as the government props up failed companies , soaks up all available investment capital , discourages savings , punishes employers , and chases capital out of the country , jobs will continue to be lost .
To really fix the unemployment problem , the president must look past his peers in government and academia to understand how jobs are actually created .
In the private sector , all individuals have a choice to work for themselves or someone else .
Since labor is far more productive when combined with capital ( office equipment , machinery , business models , and intellectual capital ) , those who lack these assets themselves often choose to work for others who have sacrificed to accumulate them .
This increased productivity is shared between the worker and the owner of capital , and both are better off .
However , for one person or company to choose to offer a job to another , there must be an incentive to do so , and they must have the necessary capital .
In the first place , employers must commit to paying wages and benefits , comply with government mandates and regulations , and subject themselves to potential lawsuits from disgruntled employees .
All of these costs must be measured against the extra profits an employer hopes to earn by hiring an additional worker .
If profit opportunities exist , jobs will be created .
Otherwise , they will not .
Of course , anything the government does to raise the cost of employment , such as a higher minimum wage , mandated heath care , or greater regulatory burdens , not only prevents new jobs from being created but also causes many that already exist to be destroyed .
Anything that diminishes the profit potential of extra hiring will diminish the number of job opportunities that are created .
Also , since it is after - tax profits against which employers measure risk , the higher the marginal rate of income tax , the less likely employers will be able to hire .
Finally , in order to hire workers , employers must have access to capital to expand operations .
Anything the government does to discourage capital formation automatically diminishes job creation .
By running the largest federal deficits in history , Obama is diverting all available capital to the Treasury , and is in effect waging a war against private capital formation .
If the president 's summit truly intends to find the root cause of unemployment , his advisers do n't need Bureau of Labor statistics or complex modeling software , just the courage to drop their dogmatic belief in central planning and embrace the laws of economics .

Mr Obama has previously signalled some easing of restrictions on Cuba
US President Barack Obama has extended the 47 - year - old trade embargo against Cuba for another year .
In a statement , Mr Obama said that it was in the US national interest to extend the Trading With The Enemy Act which covers the trade embargo .
It is largely a symbolic step because the final decision rests with Congress .
Under legislation from 1996 , the Helms - Burton Act , the embargo can only be lifted when Cuba is deemed to have begun a democratic transition .
Cuba has been under a financial , trade and travel ban since 1962 - one of the last surviving remnants of the Cold War .
Critics see it as a missed opportunity to signal a further willingness to ease relations between the two countries .
Mr Obama has lifted some of the restrictions allowing Cuban - Americans to visit relatives whenever they want and send money home .
The two sides are once again holding direct talks on immigration and later this week US officials travel to Cuba to discuss resuming direct mail services .
The Cuban authorities have described these changes as little more than a cosmetic coat of paint , but the US administration continues to demand that Cuba must first show signs of reform before lifting the embargo .
Will the world end on December 21 , 2012 ?
The unsettling evidence behind ancient astrologers ' claim and the film they inspired
A tidal wave engulfs the Himalayas .
A tsunami scoops up a warship and dumps it on the White House .
The Great Wall of China crumbles and thousands of screaming tourists plummet to their deaths .
Soon the horrors reach British shores .
A massive earthquake sends Big Ben crashing to the ground and destroys the newly - built Olympic stadium , great surges in our rivers drown millions up and down the country , and plunging asteroids turn our towns and cities into smoking ruins .
Those who survive the initial onslaught flee in terror , but to run is futile for this is the ultimate catastrophe — the end of the world , as predicted by the Hollywood disaster movie 2012 , which opens next month .
Domesday : Scenes from Roland Emmerich's new disaster movie , 2012
Starring John Cusack and Thandie Newton , 2012 is directed by Roland Emmerich , whose previous films , Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow , have conjured up similarly apocalyptic visions — with Earth invaded by hostile aliens , or threatened with the sudden onset of a new Ice Age .
While these have been dismissed as entertaining bunkum , Emmerich ’s latest effort is causing rather more of a stir .
Its plot revolves around a real - life prediction that the world will end on December 21 , 2012 , and many doomsayers claim there is evidence to suggest that this prophecy will come true .
In America , they include Richard Heene , the Colorado father who created a worldwide frenzy when he claimed , falsely , that his six - year - old son Falcon had floated off in a home - made helium balloon shaped like a UFO .
It has since emerged that Heene planned to build an underground bunker to protect his family in the event of the sun exploding in 2012 .
Whether his strange craft was part of his escape plan has yet to be established , but Heene is far from alone in his fear of this imminent Armageddon .
Far - fetched though it sounds , rumours about what might happen in 2012 are fuelling so much hysteria that NASA has had to intervene to allay public fears .
‘ Two years ago , I got a question each week about 2012 , ’ says David Morrison , director of NASA ’s Lunar Science Institute in California .
‘ Now I ’m getting a dozen a day and people are really worried .
‘ A couple of teenagers over here have told me they were contemplating suicide rather than facing the end of the world and I ’ve also had quite a few questions from England .
‘ One of the saddest inquiries was from a woman who said her only friend was her cat .
‘ She wanted to know if she should have him put down before 2012 so that he would n’t suffer . ’
Morrison has posted a list of 20 questions and answers on NASA ’s website to address people ’s worries .
But fascination with our apparently looming annihilation continues to grow — with more than 175 books about it advertised on the Amazon website alone , and some ghoulish entrepreneurs even offering 2012 survival kits .
So , what has led to such alarm about 21/12/2012 , a date causing panic not seen since fears about the Millennium computer bug in the year 2000 ?
Worrying prediction or hokum ?
Another scene from 2012
Is it all nonsense or could we really be only three years away from Doomsday ?
This belief in our imminent demise is based on a calendar produced by the ancient Mayan civilisation , which flourished in the steamy rainforests of central America for nearly 2,000 years until its mysterious collapse around AD900 .
Today its abandoned temples and palaces have been engulfed by the lush green vegetation of the jungle , their rooms inhabited only by wild animals and birds — yet this was once one of the sophisticated societies of its day .
Without wheels or metal tools to help them , the Mayans built many splendid stone buildings , including intricately designed observatories in which they developed a highly advanced understanding of astronomy .
Scanning the heavens for many centuries and noting any association between the movement of the celestial bodies and events on Earth , they produced complicated almanacs full of horrifying imagery .
The rising of the planet Venus in the morning , a sign believed to augur Mayan success in war , was represented by pictures of decapitated heads , while the lunar eclipses were symbolised by drawings of a dead goddess with a rope around her neck .
Eclipses were thought to be a time of great danger for women , and a period when many children would be born deaf or blind .
For all their gruesome illustrations , these almanacs were remarkably accurate in their astronomical calculations .
With neither telescopes nor other equipment at their disposal , the Mayans managed to calculate that a lunar month — the period between successive new moons — lasted 29.5305 days , just 34 seconds away from what we now know to be its actual length .
They also accurately forecast the movements of planets including Jupiter and Mars , and the occurrence of both solar and lunar eclipses for many centuries to come .
Given these very precise predictions , Doomsday theorists are alarmed that the Mayan ‘ Long Count ’ Calendar , as it is known , appears to end abruptly on a date they recorded as 13.0.0.0 .
On the Gregorian calendar which we use today , this corresponds to December 21 , 2012 .
The only clue as to what the Mayans thought might happen on that day comes from an ancient stone tablet , discovered during roadworks in Mexico back in the Sixties .
Carved upon it are hieroglyphics that refer to the year 2012 and an event that will involve Bolon Yokte , the Mayan god of war and creation .
Weathering and a crack in the stone have made the last part of the inscription illegible , but Mexican archaeologists have interpreted it as saying : ‘ He will descend from the sky . ’
Might this be a warning of impending divine wrath ?
Those who believe so include journalist Michael Drosnin , author of the best - selling book The Bible Code , which describes the work of three Israeli mathematicians who analysed the Book of Genesis using a computer .
Apocalypse : A wave of catastrophe hits the earth in the film
They supposedly discovered coded references to the names of 66 legendary rabbis who lived and died many centuries after Genesis was written .
The text was also said to contain hidden details of the rabbis ’ birth and death dates , and of the towns and cities in which they would live .
Continuing this analysis , Drosnin claimed to have found encoded descriptions of the Earth being pounded by comets in the year 2012 .
Others have suggested that , on the day in question , the winter solstice , the sun will be in exact alignment with the centre of our galaxy .
According to Lawrence Joseph , author of a book called Apocalypse 2012 , unspecified gravitational and energy forces may be acting on us from the centre of the milky way — and , if disrupted , he speculates they would throw our bodies and our planet out of kilter , resulting in catastrophe .
He compares this to the way in which even a momentary disruption of electrical power can cause the clocks on DVD players and microwaves to blink meaninglessly .
But this theory is debunked by David Morrison of NASA .
‘ The galactic centre is very far away , approximately 30,000 light years , so it has negligible effects on the solar system or the Earth , ’ he says .
‘ In fact , the sun goes in the general direction of the galaxy ’s centre every December and nothing at all happens . ’
Morrison also refutes a popular internet theory that worldwide devastation will be caused by Earth ’s magnetic polarity suddenly changing and throwing its direction of rotation into reverse .
‘ The Earth has been rotating in the same direction for the past four billion years , ’ he says .
‘ The magnetic polarity does change every few hundred thousand years and the last time was about 400,000 years ago , but there is no evidence to suggest that it will happen again any time soon .
‘ Even if it does , it has no bearing on the direction in which the Earth spins , and there is no reason to think it will do any other harm . ’
Repetition of doom ?
The 2012 date is based on the sudden demise of the Mayans , whose skulls are seen above
One idea with at least some credibility is that the Earth will one day be hit by a large extra-terrestrial object .
But David Morrison dismisses the idea put forward in the film that this will be a mysterious planet known as Nibiru — long the subject of speculation among the gloom - mongers of cyberspace .
Niburu was supposedly first identified by the Sumerian people , who lived 5,000 years ago in what is now southern Iraq and it is said to be heading towards Earth at an alarming rate .
Astronomers insist that there is no such planet but , much to Morrison ’s frustration , this only increases suspicion that governments worldwide are concealing its existence to avoid global panic .
‘ The simple laws of planetary motion tell you that if this thing really was only three years away from hitting Earth , it would be the brightest thing in the sky apart from the sun and the moon , ’ he says .
‘ It would have been tracked by thousands of amateur and professional astronomers all over the world .
You just ca n’t hide a planet . ’
Fictitious though planet Nibiru is , the Earth has always been subject to strikes by comets and asteroids .
But to do any real damage , an object would have to be more than a mile wide .
Such big hits are rare and the last was 65 million years ago , leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs .
Searches of the cosmos for potential collisions up to 100 years into the future by NASA ’s Near Earth Object Program led to them reporting that there are no serious threats in the offing and , even if a sizeable projectile did hit us , it might not wipe us out altogether .
‘ There would be global firestorms and severe acid rain , ’ says Don Yeomans , manager of the programme .
‘ But all of these effects are relatively short - term , so the most adaptable species , like cockroaches and humans , would be likely to survive . ’
According to Bill McGuire , Professor of Geophysical and Climate Hazards at University College London , we are 12 times more likely to experience the explosion of a super - volcano — defined as an eruption that expels 1,000 cubic kilometres or more of debris , enough to obliterate an area the size of Yorkshire .
The site that currently gives most cause for concern is Yellowstone Volcano in the American state of Wyoming , which continues to rumble ominously and could explode with the force of 1,000 Hiroshima bombs and plunge the planet into a nuclear winter .
‘ There would be great clouds of sulphur gas that would mix with the water in the atmosphere to form a veil over the Earth , cutting out sunlight and dramatically cooling the Earth ’s surface , ’ says Professor McGuire .
‘ Plants would be unable to photosynthesise and there would be widespread crop failures , famine and starvation .
‘ A super - volcano probably would n’t kill all of us , but there would be a devastating impact on our global economy and society . ’
One thing the scientists agree upon is that life on Earth will one day come to an end .
The constantly diminishing supplies of hydrogen in the sun , as in all ageing stars , will cause it to swell up and become what astronomers call a ‘ red giant ’ .
It will then engulf us before collapsing in on itself and becoming a ‘ white dwarf ’ .
Chichen - Itza , Mexico : The Mayans , who built this pyramid , prospered for 2,000 years until their ‘ Long Count ’ Calendar abruptly ended on the date 13.0.0.0. , which in our modern system corresponds to December 21 , 2012
The good news is that this is unlikely to happen for another four billion years or so .
And since none of the other aforementioned fates is likely to befall us for a very long time to come , if at all , we are probably safe to get on with our Christmas plans for 2012 .
We cannot be too complacent about mankind ’s longevity , however .
Quite apart from the much trumpeted dangers of global warming , some experts suggest that the Earth ’s magnetic field — which is crucial for deflecting solar radiation and channelling it into belts that harmlessly circle the planet — will diminish to the point where it can no longer protect us from the sun ’s rays .
This could lead to an epidemic of cancers and a major disruption of the food chain .
Compasses would stop working , animals would be unable to find their way back to breeding grounds , and the weather would become less predictable .
The Earth would become unstable , unleashing a series of natural disasters .
Such a lingering end to humanity ’s time on Earth might not be the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters , but it lends a chilling resonance to the final lines of TS Eliot ’s famous poem The Hollow Men , penned in the aftermath of World War One .
This is the way the world ends .
If I were a close adviser of President Obama ’s , I would say to him , “ Mr. President , you have two urgent and overwhelming tasks in front of you : to put Americans trapped in this terrible employment crisis back to work and to put the brakes on your potentially disastrous plan to escalate the war in Afghanistan . ”
Reforming the chaotic and unfair health care system in the U.S. is an important issue .
But in terms of pressing national priorities , the most important are the need to find solutions to a catastrophic employment environment that is devastating American families and to end the folly of an 8 - year - old war that is both extremely debilitating and ultimately unwinnable .
We have spent the better part of a year locked in a tedious and unenlightening debate over health care while the jobless rate has steadily surged .
It ’s now at 10.2 percent .
Families struggling with job losses , home foreclosures and personal bankruptcies are falling out of the middle class like fruit through the bottom of a rotten basket .
The jobless rate for men 16 years old and over is 11.4 percent .
For blacks , it ’s a back - breaking 15.7 percent .
We need to readjust our focus .
We ’re worried about Kabul when Detroit has gone down for the count .
I would tell the president that more and more Americans are questioning his priorities , including millions who went to the mat for him in last year ’s election .
The biggest issue by far for most Americans is employment .
The lack of jobs is fueling the nervousness , anxiety and full - blown anger that are becoming increasingly evident in the public at large .

In July it was announced that the highly anticipated Heavy Rain would be delayed past Christmas into the next year , as “ it ’s not ideal to release a new IP or a new genre just before Christmas ” .
Guillaume de Fondaumiere stated that “ it ’s a very crowded place to be , and certain games need more space to live their life . ”
However , since the delay numerous games , such as MAG , Bioshock 2 and Alpha Protocol , would all be releasing in early 2010 .
At this year ’s Eurogamer Expo in London PlayStation LifeStyle asked David Cage , Quantic Dream ’s CEO , and writer and director of Heavy Rain , about his views on the packed release window .
The writer and director replied :
“ It seems that many people had the same idea , and it seemed the right spot was definitely Christmas .
Lightening the mood the French developer quipped :
But yeah , well , we got some competition out the way , some games are going to be released at Christmas , I heard .
Referring to Heavy Rain Cage continued :
“ But , yeah , you know , if the game is good I think it ’s going to sell anyway , so it ’s up to us , and we are in this type of strange situation where we try to create our own genre , so we ca n’t say we really have competition as such , in the same category of game , so we believe it is an interesting position . ”

Will you still buy Heavy Rain , or has the flood of other titles next year stolen your money ?

Thousands of tonnes of food are binned annually in the UK because of confusion over use - by dates .
But those willing to overlook the labels are finding big online discounts on food past its prime .
The UK appears to be a nation of food wasters , throwing away 8.3 million tonnes every year .
That is a mountain of leftovers , enough to fill 4,700 Olympic - sized swimming pools , says the government 's anti-waste arm , Wrap .
FOOD LABELS EXPLAINED
Use - by : the key date in terms of safety .
Never eat food after this date .
Found on cooked meats , soft cheeses and dairy - based desserts Best - before : is about quality not safety .
Food should be safe to eat after this date , but it might not be at its best .
One exception is eggs Sell - by / Display - until : this information is for the retailer , not the customer .
It is mainly used for stock control purposes
Of that , 5.3 million tonnes could have been eaten , it claims .
The cause of much of this waste is down to confusion over date labels .
A recent survey suggests half of people do not understand the differences between them .
More than one - third believe any product past its best - before date should not be eaten and 53 % never eat fruit or vegetables after they have reached that date .
" We lead extremely busy lives and taking an interest in what 's written on the date label and then understanding what that actually means is a step too far for a lot of us , " says Julia Falcon from the Love Food Hate Waste Campaign .
" If people were more confident about what date labels mean they'd get round to eating more of their food rather than throwing it away . "
Offers online Some are already comfortable with eating food past its prime .
Two years ago Dan Cluderay quit his job as a market stall holder and set up an online supermarket specialising in products past their best - before date .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
His stock includes tinned and packaged groceries , biscuits , crisps and fizzy drinks .
" In the last year sales have gone up 500 % .
The reason we 've done well is that we 're offering value for money , " says Mr Cluderay .
His Approved Foods site is one of a small number of online retailers selling short - dated or out - of - date best - before produce .
" At one time , health inspectors would say you can't have that if it 's past the best - before date and now there 's a complete shift in the way people think .
Perhaps it is more acceptable to drink a can of pop that 's a week out of date . "
And , comparing the offers of such sites with High Street retail prices , it is easy to see where its success lies .
I 've made a career of selling food past its best - before and never once had someone say ' you 've made me ill '
Dan Cluderay
Founder , Approved Foods Chocolate brownies two weeks past their best - before date are 20 p instead of 89 p .
A dozen tins of olives with a best - before date of last August are going for £ 1 - as are 10 bags of crisps a week out of date .
Brand names are often erased , but otherwise the website looks like any other online supermarket : customers add products to a basket , pay up and a courier delivers the shopping .
Customers are asked : " Can you find it cheaper ?
Tell us . "
It is perfectly legal , and other online retailers are following suit .
" Shops are allowed to sell food after its best - before date has passed , " says Sam Montell , nutritionist for the Food Standards Agency .
" Best - before dates are concerned with quality rather than safety , so it does n't mean that the food is dangerous if the date has passed . "
Consumer advice
Although date labels are now a ubiquitous part of grocery shopping , they were introduced relatively recently .
Sell - by dates came in when supermarkets began to take over from milkmen , selling milk and cream .
Marks and Spencer started using them in the 1950s , to give people confidence in the products in their chilled cabinets .
Date labels came in in the 1950s
For some , attitudes towards food labels are now changing .
Perhaps it is down to a rising awareness of how much food and drink is wasted , and the cost .
Recent Wrap data suggests £ 12bn worth is binned every year in the UK , or around £ 680 for the average family .
Secretary of State for the Environment Hilary Benn has suggested sell - by dates should be scrapped and best - befores ignored .
It is a notion many market traders subscribe to .
At the Bullring Open Market in Birmingham , renowned for hundreds of stalls selling fresh produce , much of the food is sold without packaging or date labels .
" We 're much too fussy now , it 's out of all proportion .
We do n't use best - before or sell - by dates here , " says stallholder John Harris .
" A piece of cheese , you can take it home and it'll keep for a good three weeks . "
But retailers argue that doing away with date labels would not reduce food waste .
" Customer education will , " says Stephen Robertson , director general of the British Retail Consortium .
" Date labels are there to help customers but they need to understand what they mean . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
I worked for a food retailer and in just one week they threw away £ 8,000 of fresh fruit and vegetables .
I think the total wastage that week was £ 12,000 !
Almost all of which was not only edible but still fresh .
But the company had very strict rules on date rotation to ensure all that they sold was of the best quality .
We would have loved to give this ' out of code ' - but very edible - food to charity but Health and Safety would not allow it ; so it all went in the bin .
Then scavengers started to raid the bin so we had to pour bleach on it .
The problem is that manufacturers use these dates to ensure that stores buy new stock .
By having to throw away unsold ' old ' stock they can control the flow of food out of their gates .
Bob , N Wales
Doing away with date labels is impractical as there are certain products that can last , unopened , for months but will deteriorate eventually - such as boxed fruit juice .
It is important to have some date information as such products can sit in cupboards for some time before being used .
Phil , London " But retailers argue that doing away with date labels would not reduce food waste . "
Of course it will , since people will rely on their eyes and nose to establish if something is edible or not .
It 's not rocket science .
I regularly eat food that is past its best before date , and often find that even milk is still perfectly drinkable up to two weeks after the date predicted by the supermarkets .
But it will also result in fewer sales , wo n't it Mr Robertson ?
And we can't have that , can we ?
Lolly , London , UK
My rule is that if it's fit to eat eat it and if it's not do n't - after all you would n't eat something that had gone off just because it was within its sell by / use by date - so why chuck out something that has n't gone off ?
Use a bit of common sense .
Claire , Lancaster I run a small coffee shop serving light lunches .
Best - before dates help me keep stock rotating in the correct order .
All staff are encouraged to look at the dates every day because if they find one with only one day to go they can take it home free of charge .
A.K. Pearce , Reading I think that this is another example of the government assuming that common sense has disappeared .
It might be a better idea to have a ' packed - on ' date , so you know when the food was first made and packed .
Then you would have an idea of how long it would last .
Having worked for a supermarket as a student , I saw so much senseless waste , and I also know that tins of peas you 're going to buy could have been canned months earlier and so the use - by is quite redundant in this case .
The sad thing is , the waste supermarkets produce cannot be passed on ; it 's destroyed rather than given to homeless shelters or something like that .
Loulou W , Lancaster , UK I grew up in the 50s and my mum always said to me , " if it looks and smells ok , then it probably is ok . "
My daughter however will not eat a tin of soup because it is two months out of date .
We need clearer labelling .
Jackie Morten , Ruislip , England I think a lot of people suspect that manufacturers shorten these dates so that people will replace the product with a new one when really they do n't need to .
What seems really odd is seeing very short dates on items traditionally used as preservatives , such as vinegar .
Alastair , Manchester I myself have often used so called out - of - date tinned goods .
I was of the impression that the invention of the tin in the war was to stop food from going bad .
My father used to buy his weekly beer which was always months out of date and he never had a bad can .
Kenneth Willis , Rudgwick England
Before we retired we ran a shop for 35 years .
We never threw anything away if it was out - of - date or past its best - before date , it was taken down to our kitchen and used for the family .
We are still alive .

The department ’s flip interviews almost always failed , and even if they worked , there was no place to put the girls to receive treatment .
Officers resisted investigating what they viewed as a nuisance , not a crime .
Prosecutors regularly refused the cases against pimps because the girls made for shaky witnesses and unsympathetic plaintiffs .
Frustrated with this system , Sergeant Fassett started combing through old case files , looking for patterns .
One stuck out : 80 percent of the prostituted children the department had handled had run away from home at least four or more times a year .
“ It dawned on me , if you want to effectively deal with teen prostitutes , you need to look for repeat runaways , ” he said .
In 2005 , Sergeant Fassett created the “ High Risk Victim ” unit in the Dallas Police Department , which flags any juvenile in the city who runs away from home four or more times in a given year .
About 200 juveniles per year fit that description .
If one of those children is picked up by the police anywhere in the country , the child is directed back to Sergeant Fassett ’s unit , which immediately begins investigating the juvenile ’s background .
The unit ’s strength is timing .
If the girls are arrested for prostitution , they are at their least cooperative .
So the unit instead targets them for such minor offenses as truancy or picks them up as high - risk victims , speaking to them when their guard is down .
Only later , as trust builds , do officers and social workers move into discussions of prostitution .
Repeat runaways are not put in juvenile detention but in a special city shelter for up to a month , receiving counseling .
Three quarters of the girls who get treatment do not return to prostitution .
The results of the Dallas system are clear : in the past five years , the Dallas County district attorney ’s office has on average indicted and convicted or won guilty pleas from over 90 percent of the pimps arrested .
In virtually all of those cases , the children involved in the prostitution testified against their pimps , according to the prosecutor ’s office .
Over half of those convictions started as cases involving girls who were picked up by the police not for prostitution but simply as repeat runaways .
In 2007 , Congress nearly approved a proposal to spend more than $ 55 million for cities to create pilot programs across the country modeled on the Dallas system .
But after a dispute with President George W. Bush over the larger federal budget , the plan was dropped and Congress never appropriated the money .
The results of a new poll reveal the extent of opposition to Lord Mandelson 's proposals for tough sanctions against alleged file - sharers .
The survey , commissioned by the Open Rights Group , shows that not only is the public in favor of due process , but a third would be much less likely to vote for political parties supporting these proposals .
Driven largely by the big - label international music business , proposals for disconnecting alleged file - sharers are now common in many countries .
Having achieved some kind of momentum in France , the lobbying shifted focus to the UK , with Lord Mandelson advocating harsh punishment for persistent infringers , or more accurately , those that are persistently accused .
Opposition to such plans are widespread , but until recently , public opinion had n’t been tested in a measurable way .
Today we have a much clearer idea , as results from a YouGov poll commissioned by the Open Rights Group have been released .
A significant 68 % of those surveyed felt that individuals accused of illicit file - sharing should have the right to a fair trial before their accounts were disconnected or otherwise interfered with as punishment .
Just 16 % of respondents said they would be happy for Internet users to have their accounts automatically suspended once their ISP had received “ a number of accusations . ”
While 44 % said the proposals would not influence their vote , just under a third of respondents ( 31 % ) said they would be “ much less likely ” to vote for a political party that endorsed disconnection from the Internet without a trial .
Just 7 % said they were more likely to support a party bringing in such sanctions .
In this digital age , Internet connectivity is becoming more and more important for us to carry out everyday tasks , and as time presses on we all becoming more and more reliant on our gateway to the online world .
So just how would disconnection affect the respondents ability to carry out various tasks ?
19 % of respondents said their ability to work and conduct their education would be completely disrupted following disconnection , with 23 % labeling the disruption as “ fair ” .
When the focus is placed on processes such as online shopping or home banking , 30 % said disconnection would completely disrupt their activities , with an additional 43 % calling the problem caused as “ fair ” .
Jim Killock , executive director at the Open Rights Group , feels that the government is out of step .
“ Our conclusion must be that this is a politically unwise move , that will be unpopular and a vote loser for its architects , ” he said , noting that such measures will fail to meet their objectives .
“ [ They ] wo n’t make a single penny for artists , or help online music businesses get off the ground , ” he added .
While the Open Rights Group is aware why the government has gone down this “ disastrous ” route , Killock says they are not prepared to watch the rights of the people being taken away .
“ The right to freedom of expression , a fair trial , to be presumed innocent until proven guilty : and for proportionate punishments , these are basic principles on which democratic societies are built , ” he said .

One of the main competitions in our politics , aside from the liberal versus right - wing , and the establishment versus anti-establishment , is the the competition between technocrats and idiocrats .
While technocrats may be ascendant in Obama ’s Washington , as policy wonks and experts attempt to solve intractable problems with technical solutions and brainpower and science , the idiocrats , who try to get their agenda through by fooling enough of the people enough of the time , still have a solid hold on the political discussion .
Idiocrats take advantage of that old adage , “ Where there ’s smoke , there ’s fire , ” and make sure smoke obscures any issue in which they want to get their way .
Rather than respond to their opponents on the merits , they simply describe their opponents and their agenda as the fulfillment of the idiocrat ’s worst fears : “ Nazi ! ” “ Socialist ! ” “ Communist ! ” Terrorist ! ” “ America - hater ! ” “ Death panels ! ” “ Government - mandated abortion ! ” “ Reparations ! ” “ Secret Muslim ! ” “ Radical ! ”
For those who are not paying enough attention to the issue to sort through all the competing claims , this extremist rhetoric , while not convincing them , causes them to assume something bad is going on , even if it is n’t as bad as is being claimed .
For example , even as the health care plan Obama has proposed is largely based on previous Republican proposals , and seems to take into account conservative critiques of big government while still making progress towards liberal goals , idiocrats have condemned it in the harshest terms possible , raising every possible fear – from government kidnapping your children and indoctrinating them into socialism , to rationing by death panels , to runaway spending bankrupting the country , to abortion mandates , to the destruction of the employer - based health care system , to the destruction of Medicare .
It makes little difference that it is hard to imagine a plan that both rations care brutally and leads to runaway spending , or that everyone acknowledges our current system is on an unsustainable course , or that the measures included in the bills under consideration represent the most significant attempt at cost control in a generation .
Last week , as part of a continuing effort to generate smoke to obscure real issues , the Wall Street Journal editorial board started a deliberate lie to undermine the health care reforms in Congress by claiming ( without evidence and contrary to news reports as well as the the recommendation itself ) that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force – a independent , technocratic organization of doctors started by Ronald Reagan – had changed its recommendations regarding breast cancer prevention as part of Obama ’s push to reduce the health care costs .
This explosive claim became the focus of the public debate , instead of the recommendations of the report itself and their rationale .
On Sunday , Meet the Press had a typically “ even- handed ” debate between their own Dr. Nancy Snyderman and Ambassador Nancy Brinker , founder of an organization dedicated to fighting breast cancer .
The whole 12 minute segment is worth watching ( transcript ) , as you can see Brinker acknowledging that the task force might be right on the science , but at the same time suggesting that we should n’t show any weakness in our war against cancer by suggesting mammograms might not always be a good thing .
She made a few valid points , giving certain circumstances in which mammograms would be better than alternatives , but she could n’t and did n’t dispute the task force ’s medical conclusions .
But the piece is truly worth watching for “ Dr. Nancy ” took on the idiocrats who were muddying the issue and defended the scientific conclusions of the doctors :
DR . SNYDERMAN : [ O ] ver 1900 women screened over a 10 - year period of annual mammograms , one life is saved and there are a thousand false positives , which means ongoing , unnecessary tests .
Now remember , the scientists who did these numbers , their role is , as scientists , to take the anecdotes and the passion and the emotion out of it .
And I recognize that ’s hard as part of the message .
But they ’re to look at the public health issues of how we screen .
And we ’ve always known that mammography for women in their 40s has been fraught with problems .
It is not as precise for older women [ She meant younger here ] .
On that Nancy and I have great agreement .
So what their consensus was is that there are a lot of unnecessary screenings for that one life .
Now , if you ’re that one life , it ’s 100 percent .
I get that .
But their charge as an independent body was to look at the cumulative research as scientists .
Later , as Ambassador Brinker tried to simultaneously politicize the issue while claiming not to be , Dr. Nancy interjected with a righteous defense of science :
The key line that got me :
I would argue that we are on the verge of becoming a scientifically illiterate country if we do n’t at times separate [ science and politics ] …
In a large measure , the promise of Obama , the hope he held out , was to break the hold that idiocrats have over our political debate .
Thus far , this is a battle he does not seem to be winning .

WASHINGTON  More than 40 % of President Obama 's top - level fundraisers have secured posts in his administration , from key executive branch jobs to diplomatic postings in countries such as France , Spain and the Bahamas , a USA TODAY analysis finds .
Twenty of the 47 fundraisers that Obama 's campaign identified as collecting more than $ 500,000 have been named to government positions , the analysis found .
Overall , about 600 individuals and couples raised money from their friends , family members and business associates to help fund Obama 's presidential campaign .
USA TODAY 's analysis found that 54 have been named to government positions , ranging from Cabinet and White House posts to advisory roles , such as serving on the economic recovery board charged with helping guide the country out of recession .
Nearly a year after he was elected on a pledge to change business - as - usual in Washington , Obama also has taken a cue from his predecessors and appointed fundraisers to coveted ambassadorships , drawing protests from groups representing career diplomats .
A separate analysis by the American Foreign Service Association , the diplomats ' union , found that more than half of the ambassadors named by Obama so far are political appointees , said Susan Johnson , president of the association .
An appointment is considered political if it does not go to a career diplomat in the State Department .
That 's a rate higher than any president in more than four decades , the group 's data show , although that could change as the White House fills more openings .
Traditionally about 30 % of top diplomatic jobs go to political appointees , and roughly 70 % to veteran State Department employees .
Ambassadors earn $ 153,200 to $ 162,900 annually .
" It is time to end the spoils system and the de facto sale of ambassadorships , " Johnson said .
" The United States is best served by having experienced , knowledgeable and trained career officers fill all positions in our diplomatic service . "
JOB RECIPIENTS : See list of fundraisers who became staffers
The administration is " well aware of the historical target of career vs. non-career ambassadors , and we will be right on that target , " said White House spokesman Thomas Vietor .
He said the first round of diplomatic jobs traditionally go to political appointees because those are the first available when a president takes office .
Vietor said Obama also made it clear early on that he would " nominate extremely qualified individuals who did n't necessarily come up through the ranks of the State Department but want to serve their country . "
Among the top Obama fundraisers with jobs : former technology executive Julius Genachowski as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and Nicole Avant , a music industry executive who is the top envoy in the Bahamas .
Neither granted interview requests .
Those not in the administration benefited in other ways , including attending invitation - only White House bashes , such as a St. Patrick 's Day gala .
Fundraiser David Gail , a Dallas lawyer that the campaign identified as raising between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 , joined dignitaries in July for an East Room country music concert featuring Alison Krauss and Charley Pride .
He said he greeted Obama after the event but does n't have special access to the president , who was elected on a pledge to change business - as - usual in Washington .
" I 've seen people who have been included on conference calls or events who were very involved at the grass - roots level , " Gail said .
" Contributing does n't guarantee a visit to the White House , " White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Wednesday , " nor does it preclude it . "
Others not on the campaign 's list of official bundlers also have reaped rewards .
Sacramento developer Eleni Tsakopoulos - Kounalakis , a fundraiser in Hillary Rodham Clinton 's unsuccessful presidential campaign , was nominated this month by Obama to serve as ambassador to Hungary .
Clinton is now secretary of state .
Tsakopoulos - Kounalakis did not respond to interview requests , and her office referred calls to the White House .
It 's too early to tell how big a role Obama 's fundraisers will play .
On the ambassador front alone , nearly 100 top positions remain unfilled , according to the American Foreign Service Association 's tally .
Ronald Neumann , president of the American Academy of Diplomacy , wants Obama to limit political appointees to about 10 % of diplomatic jobs .
" The direction is not good , " he said of Obama 's appointments to date , " but you cannot definitively say what the picture will be for the whole administration . "
FROM FUNDRAISER TO STAFFER President Obama has named 54 fundraisers to government positions .
Here 's a look at who they are and how much they raised .
The campaign reported fundraising in broad ranges only .

I keep hearing and reading this nice proverb if it ain't broke , do n't fix it .
The latest appearance was in response to Shlomi Fish suggesting that some Ancient Perl code should be replaced by Modern Perl code .
I am not saying that every piece of code should be rewritten every 6 months but in my understanding that sentence actually translates to let 's wait till it breaks and then panic .
I think people who say that sentence are afraid that the new version will break something .
Sure there is always a chance that a change introduces an error but if we are afraid to touch the code what will happen when later on we encounter a case where it does not work ?
For example if we need to use it in a new environment .
Will we have the courage to change the code then ?
How much will it cost in money , time , and lost sleep ?
I think we have been trying to teach ourselves that we should have really good test coverage of our code and then we can easily refactor it and get rid of technical debt .
So why do we keep hearing that sentence ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration has sent six Uighur Chinese detainees from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , to the Pacific island nation of Palau , an administration official and a rights group said on Saturday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The transfer leaves 215 detainees at the detention camp that President Barack Obama has pledged to close by January 22 , although political and legal hurdles are making it difficult for his administration to meet that goal .
Palau has agreed to take up to a dozen Uighurs who come from China ’s largely Muslim far - west region of Xinjiang and were captured by the U.S. government during the Afghanistan war launched after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States .
Four Uighurs have already been transferred earlier this year to Bermuda .
The Center for Constitutional Rights , a group based in New York that has represented many Guantanamo prisoners , said a total of six Uighurs had landed in Palau .
Three of them are clients of the center while the other three are represented by other lawyers .
An administration official confirmed the detainees had been sent to Palau .
The departures occurred after the Supreme Court -- rejecting the administration ’s position -- said on October 20 that it would hear an appeal by the Uighurs , who argue that they should be released in the United States .
However , Obama signed into law legislation Congress passed barring the release of any detainees from Guantanamo into the United States .
China has demanded the Uighurs be returned there but the U.S. government has said it could not do so because they would face persecution , and it has searched for months for a nation willing to accept them .
The center identified its three clients as Ahmad Tourson , Adel Noori and Abdulghappar Abdulrahman .
Palau has agreed to provide a temporary home for the three men while the United States continues to search for a country where they can be permanently resettled , the rights group said .
“ President Obama has achieved a major milestone in his effort to close Guantanamo , but the prison cannot be shut down until other countries agree to resettle those detainees who are unable to return to their home countries , ” J. Wells Dixon of the center said in a statement .
“ There is an urgent need for countries like Australia and Germany to offer permanent refuge for not only the Uighurs temporarily resettled in Palau or still detained at Guantanamo , but also detainees from countries like Algeria , Libya and Tajikistan , ” he said .
The three detainees also were represented by attorneys from the New York - based firm of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel , including Eric Tirschwell .
“ The men are happy at long last to be free , ” Tirschwell said .
“ They have already begun learning English and look forward to becoming productive members of the Palau community , as the United States continues its diplomatic efforts on their behalf . ”
Since Obama took office , a total of 25 detainees have been sent from Guantanamo to countries overseas and one detainee has been transferred to New York to stand trial on terrorism charges .
As we reported last week , the tryouts for the next season of The Ultimate Fighter are already underway in the U.S.
The question many are asking now is , who will be the coaches for the 11th season ?
As yet there is no official word from the UFC themselves , so in the mean time we have looked through the promotions current roster , and selected five possible coaching match - ups for the show which is set to be filmed in 2010 .
Bear in mind that we ’re not just picking unrealistic ‘ superfights ’ here ( i.e. Anderson Silva Vs Brock Lesnar ) , but rather realistic coach pairings that would add something to the show , and provide an entertaining fight at the end of the series .
—
5. Diego Sanchez Vs Kenny Florian
There has been a trend in recent seasons of The Ultimate Fighter for former winners of the show ( such as Forrest Griffin , Michael Bisping and Rashad Evans ) to come back as coaches .
Therefore Diego Sanchez , winner of the middleweight competition in Season 1 , has a genuine chance at being the next fighter to be called up to the show .
What could be an interesting twist is to bring in Kenny Florian , the other finalist in the first season , as the opposing coach .
While both fought at middleweight on the show , Florian was clearly better suited to lightweight and moved there after the show .
He has lost only twice , both in title fights , in his eight fights at that weight class .
Sanchez has also followed suit after posting a 7 - 2 record at welterweight , and has so far gone two fights undefeated in the lightweight division .
Positives :
Two former TUF stars featuring as coach has n’t been done before on the show .
There is added spice to match - up since Sanchez called out Florian back in June , stating , “ One of the reasons for me dropping to 155 was the fact that Kenny Florian is coming up on his second title shot , and this is a guy that I walked through four years ago . ”
He went on to say , “ in my mind , I am the number one contender right now . ”
Negatives :
Neither fighter is likely to drive the kind of viewing figures that we have seen from recent coach pairings such as Bisping Vs Henderson and Rampage Vs Evans .
A better pairing may have been former TUF coach BJ Penn and Sanchez with the title up for grabs , but this fight is already scheduled to take place .
If Sanchez loses that fight , then that may harm his chances of becoming a coach on the show .
—
4. Wanderlei Silva Vs Chris Leben
Wanderlei Silva is currently making his way down to the middleweight division after a largely unsuccessful stint in the UFC ’s light heavyweight division , ( and then 195lbs ) in which he recorded only one victory in four fights .
Silva still has a loyal and passionate fan - base however , and he has enough charisma and intensity to be an excellent TUF coach .
Chris Leben , another veteran from The Ultimate Fighter Season 1 , is amongst the most memorable and controversial fighters to have emerged from the show .
Like Silva he has struggled in recent times , registering two losses in his recent visits to the cage .
Positives :
Both fighters are big characters and would undoubtedly prove to be entertaining to watch on the show .
A fight between the two , who are renowned for the their love of stand - up wars , could tweak the interest of casual fans and would be an entertaining way to round - off the show .
The show could be a good way to revitalize the two mens careers .
Negatives :
With both men currently on a losing streak , a fight between them has little significance to the overall picture in the middleweight division .
Is Siva ’s English good enough for the show ?
I would lean towards saying yes , but it ’s open to debate .
He still likes to speak in Portuguese when possible , as he admits he can’t always express himself fully in English .
—
3. Tito Ortiz Vs Mark Coleman
Former light heavyweight champion Tito Ortiz has been a coach on the show before , against Ken Shamrock on Season 3 , and has recently made a return to the UFC after an 18 month absence .
His form before his recent lay - off was poor , with a draw and two losses in has past three fights , though each was against a fighter who had held the title ( Lyoto Machida , Rashad evans and Chuck Liddell ) .
Mark Coleman was originally scheduled to face Ortiz at the upcoming UFC 106 event but had to pull out due to injury .
Coleman has the distinction of being the first heavyweight champion of the UFC , back in 1996 , and some 12 years later he returned to the octagon to fight in the light heavyweight division where he has claimed a victory over Stephan Bonnar , and a loss to current title contender Mauricio Shogun Rua .
Positives :
Both men are big characters with plenty to say for themselves , and are comfortable being the center of attention .
Ortiz has a knack for creating conflict , and with Coleman being an emotional character this has the makings of another rivalry similar to when he coached opposite another veteran , Ken Shamrock , which generated significant ratings for the show .
Ortiz admits there is still bad blood between the two after a war of words broke out when Coleman backed out of the original fight .
Negatives :
As with the Silva Vs Leben fight , this is not a fight that holds any major significance at the present time for the light heavyweight division .
It ’s questionable whether a fight between the two would live up to the hype that they will be able to generate throughout the course of the season .
—
2. Georges St. Pierre Vs Dan Hardy
GSP is one of the UFC ’s superstars , and despite being on the roster since the original series of TUF , he has never starred as coach ( though he did make a brief appearance as a trainer on the fourth season ) .
He is of course the current welterweight champion and is currently recovering from a torn abductor muscle sustained during his dominating title defense over Thiago Alves at UFC 100 .
UK fighter Dan Hardy is currently one of the fastest rising stars in the UFC , partly at least due to his ability to talk up a fight – a quality that should serve him well on The Ultimate Fighter .
He has also shown himself to be a significant threat in the welterweight division , winning all three of his fights in the octagon so far .
Positives :
GSP is one of the sports best known and most popular fighters .
Dan Hardy is a self confessed trash talker which has already fast - tracked him up the welterweight ladder , and should help add spice to the show .
As things stand there seems to be a level of apathy over GSP ’s potential challengers for his belt , so TUF could be a good vehicle to generate hype and interest in the fight .
Negatives :
Hardy still has to get past Mike Swick first before he could even be considered for a title shot , which will be no easy task .
Even then many will argue that he is not yet ready for a title shot .
first before he could even be considered for a title shot , which will be no easy task .
Even then many will argue that he is not yet ready for a title shot .
GSP ’s ‘ nice guy ’ image might not translate well on a show like TUF which often depends on hostility between the coaches to entice people to tune in each week .

1. Brock Lesnar Vs Frank Mir
Heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar is currently the UFC ’s biggest PPV draw , thanks to his larger than life physique and ‘ love him or hate him ’ personality .
When combined with the fan interest from his previous career in pro wrestling , and victories in the UFC over former champions Frank Mir and Randy Couture , Lesnar is a guaranteed ratings winner .
Frank Mir has starred as a coach on Season 8 of The Ultimate Fighter alongside Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira .
He won the fight at the end of that season , but is currently coming off a loss to Lesnar at UFC 100 .
He does however hold a victory over him dating back to Lesnar ’s debut in the organisation at UFC 81 , and has stated a number of times since his loss that he wants a rubber match between the two .
Positives :
As far as TV ratings go , Brock Lesnar should generate the biggest numbers for the show of any fighter currently appearing on the UFC ’s roster ( perhaps with the exception of Kimbo Slice ) .
There is a genuine rivalry between Lesnar and Mir that remains unresolved despite two previous fights between the two .
There is almost guaranteed to be fireworks if they were to appear on the show together .
Depending on how the two fighters forthcoming match - ups with Shane Carwin and Cheick Kongo respectively work out , there could be a title fight between the two at the end of the season .
Negatives :
Brock Lesnar is unlikely to be interested in appearing on the show .
When he is not fighting he tends to be a somewhat reclusive figure who would likely balk at the idea of having cameras following him around for the duration of the show .
Many will argue that one of the other heavyweight contenders such as Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira deserves the next shot at Lesnar ’s title ( if he is able to beat Shane Carwin ) instead of Mir , though such a match - up would likely have less of a ratings grabbing rivalry .
deserves the next shot at Lesnar ’s title ( if he is able to beat Shane Carwin ) instead of Mir , though such a match - up would likely have less of a ratings grabbing rivalry .
It ’s only been a few seasons since Mir last appeared as a coach on the show .
—
Other Possibilities :
Who are some other fighers currently on the UFC roster who could make an impact on the show ?
( we will exclude previous coaches like BJ Penn , Rich Franklin and Randy Couture from this list ) .
Vitor Belfort :
If it was n’t for the persistent rumor that The UFC wants him to fight for the title against Anderson Silva next , then a match up of the likeable Belfort versus fellow Brazilian Wanderlei Silva would make a lot of sense .
Wanderlei has already noted a strong desire to fight him , after losing their first battle back at UFC : Brazil in 1998 .
Belfort recently stated that he does not have a strong desire to fight for the title yet , so this could still become a reality if the UFC is willing to switch things around .
Josh Koscheck was another infamous character in TUF season 1 , thanks to his cocky attitude , and ability to wind up Chris Leben which painted him as the shows first villain .
Though he has mellowed somewhat in the years that have followed , he would likely strike up an entertaining rivalry with whoever was selected as his opposite coach .
A trash talking double act with Dan Hardy could be an interesting pairing , though Georges St. Pierre , and perhaps even former TUF coach Matt Hughes would also work .
Lyoto Machida :
No fighter in the UFC has been more vocal about wanting to be a coach on TUF than Machida .
He has admitted that he was overlooked for the current season due to his lack of English , but has been studying hard to improve since then in the hope of being considered in the future .
Though his English is improving it is still limited , and , for the time being at least , he has to recover from hand surgery and ffocus on defending his light heavyweight belt in a rematch with Shogun Rua before he is likely to appear on the show .
Phil Baroni : Perhaps a wild card pick , but Baroni ’s ‘ in your face ’ personality marks him out as a potential hit on TUF .
On the other hand he has only recently returned to the UFC after an indifferent spell fighting for other promotions , and he may have to prove himself before becoming a serious contender for a coaching spot .
If he was to get the nod the more interesting match - ups for him would appear to be at middleweight , where previously mentioned fighters like Wanderlei Silva and Chris Leben lie in wait .

This is the code in the enemy AI script that tests whether the enemy can see the player or not .
< pre>function findPlayer ( ) {
var hit : RaycastHit ;
var distanceToPlayer : float ;
directionToTarget = the Target.transform.position – transform.position ;
directionToPlayer = the Player.transform.position – transform.position ;
distanceToPlayer = Vector3.Distance(transform.position , the Player.transform.position ) ;
var targetAngle = Vector3.Angle(directionToTarget , transform.forward ) ; // for vision
var playerAngle = Vector3.Angle(directionToPlayer , transform.forward ) ;
Debug.Log(playerAngle ) ;
Debug.Log(distanceToPlayer ) ;
if ( Mathf.Abs(targetAngle ) < visionAngle && distanceToPlayer < visionRange ) {
Physics.Linecast( transform.position , the Player.transform.position , hit ) ;
//Debug.Log(hit.collider.name ) ;
if(hit.collider.name == the Player.collider.name ) {
canSeePlayer = true ;
theTarget = the Player ;
}else {
canSeePlayer = false ;
}
}else {
canSeePlayer = false ;
}
if( distanceToPlayer < hearRadius ) {
canHearPlayer = true ;
theTarget = the Player ;
}else {
canHearPlayer = false ;

// This has to ultimately be the final else
canSeePlayer = false ;
canHearPlayer = false ;
FindNextWaypoint ( ) ;
}
}</pre>
There ’s a fair amount of Unity mumbo jumbo in there .
In the beginning , I define the variables I ’ll need .
Some of them , such as distance to player , are somewhat self explanatory .
After the variables ( and two debug prints to the console ) comes the actual code .
The idea is that the enemy checks for the strictest test , then the second strictest , and so on .
Currently there are only two tests however .
The first , and the one we ’re interested in here , is whether the enemy can see the player or not .
To see the player , the AI requires three things .
First , the player must be within a certain angle of the front of the enemy ( in it ’s cone of vision ) .
Secondly , the player must not be too far away from the enemy .
And thirdly , there must be no solid object blocking the player from the enemy .
It was this third element that caused a lot of trouble .
I tried many ways of doing this .
While eventually I used a linecast , I spent a lot of time trying to get a raycast to work .
Linecasts and raycasts are built into Unity ; a linecast is between two points , and a raycast is emit from a single point .
Both provide information on the first game object they hit which has a collider component on it .
Raycasts provide more information and control than a linecast ; but ultimately the easiest method turned out to be checking whether the linecast hits the player or something else first .
Over time , playing around with the raycast / linecast systems more , I began to realize that my conditional structures were causing a lot of the weirdness I was seeing .
Level design is going well ; it ’s a much slower process than I anticipated though !
One tricky thing has been scaling things correctly .
I ended up creating a little player nub object , designed to serve as a consistent reference for the size of the character , but some of the earlier stuff is somewhat strangely proportioned .
The purple object in the image there is a standardized door - size object .

Until we can truly have an automated computer voting system , we need to stick with what has worked for decades in the voting booths .
Let 's implement some strict identity laws for who is voting on election day .

Um , Stephen , we have automated computer voting systems .
They do n't work .
None of them .
And it 's 100 % impossible to verify if / when they do .
Other than that , did you fail to read the article above ?
Or any other that we 've ever written here at The BRAD BLOG ?
What do " strict identify laws for who is voting on election day " have to do with failed voting systems ?
In fact we already do have such strict laws .
So pardon me if I ask :
What the hell are you talking about ?

This may affect other states .
The problem is that Sarasota 's Diebold OSX cannot read blue ink nor can they read # 2 pencil markings .
It affects several counties in Florida any likely any jurisdiction in the US using the same newer version Diebold OSX .
Saturday , October 17 , 2009
Sarasota 's Diebold scanners flunk test , fail to read blue ink on ballots WARNING : Voters in jurisdictions that use the newer Diebold / Premier optical scanners OSX with 1.0.2 firmware should use black ink to mark their ballots .
The machines may not read markings made with blue ink .
The OSC also has trouble reading markings by a number 2 pencil according to other reports .
This is an intermittent problem .
In the logic and accuracy testing of Premier Optical Scanners , which will be used in Sarasota elections beginning October 19th , test ballots were run with blue marking of ovals .
The result was an under vote in races where blue ink was used to fully fill out voting ovals .
The machine tested was the Diebold / Premier AccuVote OSX Digital Scan Tabulator ( Hardware Model A ) with Firmware .... more here at Voting New Blog

Intermittent electronic vote tabulation devices lead to intermittent US Constitution , intermittent justice , intermittent monetary system , intermittent health care , intermittent leaders , and an intermittent lifespan for our troops in Iraq , Afghanistan .
These electronic vote tabulation devices are the cause of every problem we currently have .
Get rid of these devices , and start cleaning the problem , keep these devices and look forward to more ponzi , oath breaking , death and mayhem .
Kathy
Dent does not serve the public interest .
And neither does anyone who pushes these devices on our elections .
In the past I might have called such people domestic terrorists , but there is no better " name " I can think of .
While Kathy is not out there strapping on a suicide bomb backpack , her actions lead ultimately to deaths .
( Our soldiers , and sick )
So what do you call that ?
If not a terrorist .
These devices bend the will of the people for political ends and prevent the public from holding anyone corrupt responsible .
( The cops do n't arrest the corruption , and you can't vote them out anymore . )
So what do you call that ?
Florida is n't the worst place to vote .
Anywhere these devices are is the worst place to vote .
And if your vote can't get counted correctly , what do you call that ?
It sure the hell is n't called voting anymore !
A waste of time ?
Terrorism ?
Corruption ?
What is it called ?
And after a freaking decade why can't we arrest these people ?

electronic counting machines do not give accurate results , we know this and yet our most basic voice in the descion making process in this country is repeatedly sabotaged
if i am remembering correctly , dent does more than buy inaccurate machines , she arrests her opponents if they have the audacity to want to " watch " the vote counting process

HeeehHHEE , Karen !
WHICH video of Kathy Dent trying to block public observation do you mean ?
I have about 40 ...
Still , this one 's a Dandy :
" Kathy Dent on Transparency : ' A Word to the Wise ' ... "
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhMbrZ1VvQA
This gem of a video opens with a 2007 clip caught on tape by the magnificent Ginny Ross ( Oregon Voters Coalition ) at a creepy vendor / S.O.E. conference in Colorado .
Here , Dent defends her " open and transparent " recount process in 2006 to her in - house sympathetic colleagues , I guess unawares that there was any evidence out there to the contrary ...
Shocked and amused that she would even assert such a thing after that bread - n'- circuses recount I filmed , ( where thanks to the ES* S iVotronic touchscreen machines there was nothing to recount ) , I took Ginny 's unbelievable Dent excerpt and spliced it with clip after clip from the recount that proves what a " distortion " ( lie ) that really is .
( This version does not contain Dent 's infamous temper tantrum at observer Susan Pynchon .
That video , laden with more freaky - deaky " distortions " and fun " incrimanations " caught on tape from that utterly bogus FL - 13 Recount is here :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQv7CmBp5kk)
For those of us with election video A.D.D. , here 's a quickie - Dent blames BBV and ( us ? ) for " all her woes " : " Kathy Dent : Those Pesky Activists ... " ( 2:35 ) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83TGawMwJhQ
... a similiar video , but one I personally adore because Dent was the best unintentional comedian I 've ever met , is here : ( 2:12 ) " Kathy Dent : Lessons Learned in Sarasota " http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXMgjrOeEUE
( again , thanks to Ginny Ross ! )
The following clip has less to do with Dent 's attempts to block observation , but points to what may be behind her almost obsessive need to hamper it .
A video we spent months trying to get to the bottom of - with the help of my hero of heroes Susan Pynchon ( " Hacking Democracy " ) - still shocks and confounds me .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oehEKXpupA
... On the second day of the recount , Dent tries to hand the Parameters of the Jennings / Buchanan election over to ES&S via contract she drew up with her husband :
To be fair , Karen , I do n't think Dent ever threatened to have anyone arrested .
But you do n't have to travel far in Florida to find two S.O.E.'s who have - one BRENDA SNIPES in ( FUBAR ) Broward Co. who arrested Ellen Brodsky last year for nothing - false charges , and ANNE McFALL in Volusia County who threatened to arrest her opponent , SUSAN PYNCHON , for filming the vote count in her own Florida Election .
( The filmmakers behind " Hacking Democracy " did a fantastic follow up piece on Susan re : this very issue for People and Power ( Al Jazeera ) at the time of the her S.O.E. election in 2008 .
Highly recommended viewing for everyone , but especially BradBloggers :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DEQfEQ-lG4) ... and thanks for asking , Karen .
Ain't Dent a piece of work ?
Her re-election last November was such a bummer .
Her name is synonymous with " Failure " in Sarasota .
We all thought for sure she'd be off and away , lobbying for ES *S by now .
Hm .
I guess now that Diebold is now ES*S , Dent wins some more .
I like to think she can't work for them because they would never offer her a position ; she 's such a bad liar - way too many " tells " .
She 's no Bachmann , that 's for damn sure .

I would like to say , in Kathy Dent 's defense , that the failures of Sarasota County 's voting systems , past and present , ARE NOT HER FAULT .
The State of Florida has absolutely the worst Bureau of Voting System Certification , which continues to certify faulty systems , ignores problems that arise during and after certification , and DOES NOT COMMUNICATE known problems to the counties .
Instead , the state covers up problems and leaves each county to flounder on its own .
Where Kathy Dent IS AT FAULT is doing just what the state does --- hiding and covering up problems , as she did in the 2006 election and continues to do .
We are sympathetic that election administrators are trying to deal with lousy equipment , but they are not doing any favors to anyone pretending that this lousy equipment is accurately counting votes .
We understand that they think democracy will be destroyed if voters know the truth , but that simply is n't the case .
I would be the first to cheer Kathy Dent if she simply starts acknowledging real problems when they occur .
Kathy
Dent wants her touchscreen machines back , not because they work , but because it 's impossible to tell when they do n't .
And THAT is where she 's got it all wrong .
Perhaps someday we can all work together towards verifiable , accurate elections with complete transparency .
Meanwhile , activists have to be careful to place blame where blame is due .
It 's fine to go after election administrators for NOT disclosing problems with voting equipment , but we have to remember that they are being handed this lousy equipment as a result of a failed state and federal certification process .
When Skip Parish , Sarasota resident , asked an employee at one of the federal testing labs if they were aware of some of the bugs that he 's discovered in the Premier voting system , the employee responded that she was aware of some of the bugs but that the lab did n't address them in their testing because they " were n't one of the questions . "
WHEW !
So , if the machines burst into flame when someone tries to vote on them it wo n't be disclosed because it 's not one of the questions ?
This is an indictment of the entire certification process .
And Florida , which does n't require federal certification of its voting systems , has a state certification program that 's even worse than the federal program , if that 's possible .
If election administrators and activists would join together to " out " the voting - system problems they find and demand that those problems be corrected , the whole nation would benefit .
We 're all part of " we the people , " and we should all be working towards verifiable and accurate elections .

The thoughts from on the ground there are much appreciated , Susan .
My main beef with Dent in this case was her " solution " .
I am * extraordinarily * offended by the idea that ballots are " duplicated " at some secret location by some unknown election official .
It does n't only happen as Dent has now ordered it to happen .
It happens other places as well when ballots can't be read by machines for whatever reason .
And I find the practice absolutely appalling and , yes , offensive .
Beyond that , of course , I 'm happy to associate myself with your opinions expressed above .

Brad , I absolutely agree with you and should have addressed the " secret duplication " of ballots in my first comment .
Secrecy is the BIG PROBLEM in our elections .
Most election procedures are done outside the view of the public and of course the machines count our votes on secret software .
Kathy
Dent prevented everyone from observing the absentee ballot process in 2008 , saying there " was n't enough room " in the absentee ballot area for even one observer .
I do n't defend her tactics or her cover ups --- my only point was that shoddy voting equipment makes it through the certification process and gets dumped on the counties .
Kathy
Dent has consistently operated on lies and cover ups , which is the other big problem with elections --- they 're only as honest as the person or people running them in each jurisdiction .
Dent 's talk at the Oregon election conference in 2007 , for example , in which she gave her version of how 18,000 votes were lost in Sarasota in 2006 , was riddled with inaccuracies and untruths from the beginning to the end .
( Dent 's Oregon talk was filmed by Oregon 's Ginny Ross and parts of her talk are linked in Jeannie Dean 's comments above ) .
Unfortunately , Dent is not alone in covering up problems .
Numerous supervisors of elections knew in 2006 , for example , that the iVotronic ADA ( Americans with Disabilities ) machines were not working --- the video ballot did n't work properly and votes cast on the ADA machines were inauditable because , instead of linking each vote with a PEB ( Personalized Electronic Ballot ) serial number , the ADA votes simply registered as " 0 VTR . "
During our investigation of the 2006 election , each supervisor gave a different reason why the votes on the ADA machines were thousands fewer in the general election than they had been in the primary --- and several of those explanations were false .
The truth was they had prevented people from voting on the ADA iVotronics in the general election because they knew they were n't working and were inauditable , but only one honest soul admitted that to us .
He was an IT employee from Pasco County , the county where our now Secretary of State , Kurt Browning , was then Supervisor of Elections .
Remember that Browning took 40 iVotronic machines out of circulation in Pasco County before the 2006 election , but then never admitted there were problems with the machines and blamed the Sarasota undervote on the voters .
Last but not least , a tip 'o the hat to Jeannie Dean and her relentless election coverage , which has resulted in an amazing video archive exposing the secrecy , inconsistencies , inaccuracies , and lies that exist around our elections and particularly around election problems .
Great work , Jeannie !

Florida Statute 101.5614 ( 5 ) covers the procedure for duplicating absentee ballots that can not be read by tabulators .
Like her or not , Kathy Dent 's " offensive " solution is what the LAW requires .
" Who can know for certain " if the duplicated ballot is " presumably " accurate ?

Also , your assertion that " this is the same system " that had editable audit logs and that was hacked by Hari Hursti is completely false .

The OS machines may still be in widespread use in Florida and elsewhere , but the firmware changes make them more secure and not " the same . "
Those " old " OS machines , by the way , can read blue ink and pencil just fine .
Heck , they can even read green and red and purple ink , too .

CLARIFICATION : Our original headline was somewhat clumsily worded as : " Diebold Admits ALL Versions of Their Software Delete Ballots Without Notice " .
In fact , while ballots can be deleted by administrators , from all versions , without being noted in the audit logs , at this time we 're only aware of versions 1.18.19 , 1.18.20 , 1.18.21 , 1.18.22 and 1.18.23 doing so automatically ( the " deck zero " bug described in the story ) .
All versions of the GEMS software allow the deletion of ballots , which are not necessarily recorded in the audit logs .
Though we do n't know if , in fact , the software itself deletes those ballots , as we know that it does in the versions mentioned above .
We apologize for any unintended confusion to readers .

Warning on voting machines reveals oversight failure http://www.mcclatchydc.c...omepage/story/50485.html
WASHINGTON — Disclosure of an election computer glitch that could drop ballot totals for entire precincts is stirring new worries that an unofficial laboratory testing system failed for years to detect an array of flaws in $ 1.5 billion worth of voting equipment sold nationwide since 2003 .
Texas - based Premier Elections Solutions [ Diebold ] last week alerted at least 1,750 jurisdictions across the country that special precautions are needed to address the problem in tabulation software affecting all 19 of its models dating back a decade .

in my reply let me first state that i am a fan of susan 's work in election integrity but i disagree that it is not dents fault for the system she has in place to count votes afterall if my county paid me to go buy a bumblebee with golden wings and i looked and looked but i could not find a bumble bee with golden wings ... what would an honest person do ?
should i buy a bumble bee with regular wings and have a vendor paint them gold ?
or should i just fess up and tell the county .. there are no bumblee bees with golden wings ?
i am not a strictly hand count only gal , i think if you used a counter with an open source , like mitchs , kept everything open and transparent and hand counted the top race along with random race on same ballot ( and re counted everything if a difference came up ) i could feel secure that the actual winner won

Golly gosh , our new friend " Phil N.

" D' Oval " sure sounds / writes like him , but I could n't tell you if it 's him or not at this point .
In any case , to the substance of his comment @ # 13 above ...
Florida Statute 101.5614 ( 5 ) covers the procedure for duplicating absentee ballots that can not be read by tabulators .
Like her or not , Kathy Dent 's " offensive " solution is what the LAW requires .
" Who can know for certain " if the duplicated ballot is " presumably " accurate ?
Read the statue .
Each ballot , duplicate and original , are serial numbered so that any challenge to their accuracy can be checked later .
If Dent stood up for the voters the way Ion Sancho , ( SoE in Leon County , FL ) , for example , does , instead of undermining them at every possible turn , perhaps such laws could be either changed , or worked around .
State law or not , I find the practice extraordinarily offensive and --- in the case of the problem where it occurs at the polling place --- entirely ineffective , since there 's no real way to know if a ballot is rejected because of purposeful undervotes on the ridiculous ink problem .
I do find , however , your presumption that hand - duplicated ballots are not accurate and should be looked upon with suspicion completely contrary to your own argument that all ballots should be hand - counted !
If you think electronic tallies can't be trusted , just wait until you see hand - tallied results !
Ask Iraq and Afghanistan how much better hand counting is !
I think you mean IRAN and Afghanistan , but I 'm just guessing .
Either way , apparently you failed to read the article that I linked to twice in the original post above : " Democracy 's Gold Standard : Hand - Marked , Hand - Counted Paper Ballots , Publicly Tabulated at Every Polling Place in America ... " wherein I discussed how it was , in fact , Iran 's recent election that was the last straw for me when it comes to the way elections are secretly tabulated , be it on Kathy Dent / Diebold - style optical - scanners , or equally - as - secret central - based hand - counting behind closed doors .
" Hand - tallied results " , at the polling place , in full view of the citizenry , do quite well , thank you , where they are still done , be that in 40 % of New Hampshire 's precincts , in Canada , or elsewhere .
That you and your friends are unlikely to enjoy millions / billions in tax - payer dollar welfare to privatize our public elections if we use people instead of secret corporate software to tally results , is not really my concern .
I believe in the Constitution and the self - governance called for therein .
If you enjoy a different system , might I suggest you move to Iran or Afghanistan instead , where you can have all the secretly - controlled election results you like .
Also , your assertion that " this is the same system " that had editable audit logs and that was hacked by Hari Hursti is completely false .
I guess by # 4 of your own " Rules for Posting , " that you should delete this entire post as misleading .
# 4 in our Rules for Posting at The BRAD BLOG concerns the posting of " knowing dis-information " .
Are you suggesting that I 'm knowing posting dis-information ?
If so , what is your evidence for that ?
Feel free to share .
" Karen in Illinois " already pointed you towards the March , 2009 article in which Diebold / Premier admitted that all of their current GEMS systems allow for the deletion of ballots without notice to the system operator and / or rewriting of " permanent " audit logs , etc .
Do you know something that Diebold does n't ?
Do you have evidence to back up your assertion ?
I 'd be happy to review it , and post a correction to the article above where merited .
Those security holes -- genuine as they were -- have long since been closed in subsequent versions certified by Florida well before the 2008 elections .
Firmware has changed , software has changed ; and the OSX equipment is in no way " the same " as the OS equipment Mr. Hursti revealed security flaws in .
The OS machines may still be in widespread use in Florida and elsewhere , but the firmware changes make them more secure and not " the same . "
Well , there are so many different " genuine security holes " when it comes to Diebold 's systems ( and ES&S ' and Sequoia 's , etc. ) that it can become difficult to keep track of them all .
That said , are you asserting that there is no more interpreted code in the Diebold systems ?
( Code which was expressly banned by the Federal Voting System Standards which Florida chooses to ignore ? )
If so , that 's swell .
And if the system in question here is the one which the U.S. EAC certified in August of this year , I 'd point you to this article posted here last week , in which it 's revealed that the federal certification tests did n't bother to test security issues .
Did Florida ?
Have any independent testers , such as those who carried about CA 's " Top to Bottom Review " been allowed to do so ?
Or should we just take your / Diebold 's word for it ?
Those " old " OS machines , by the way , can read blue ink and pencil just fine .
Heck , they can even read green and red and purple ink , too .
Too bad they were so easily hacked and so often failed and in such extraordinary violation of both federal standards and standards for publicly overseeable elections .

Jail , anyone ?
Perhaps that ’s too harsh , and at any rate premature , but is anyone ever going to be held accountable for the behind - the - scenes sweetheart deals that passed tens of billions of taxpayer dollars through the AIG shell game to the very banks that caused the financial meltdown ?
Or for the many other acts of double - dealing that left one out of three American homeowners owing much more than their houses were worth while the folks who swindled them were rewarded with hundreds of billions in public money ?
Undoubtedly not , since the same folks who are most culpable wrote the laws that made this , and the other scams at the heart of the banking collapse , perfectly legal .
And guess what ?
They ’re back at work in the government , writing the new laws that will , they claim , prevent us from being had once again .
As a telling example of that process at work , check the official response of the Department of Treasury to the devastating report by the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , Neil M. Barofsky , titled “ Factors Affecting Efforts to Limit Payments to AIG Counterparties . ”
The main factor was that Timothy Geithner followed the lead of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd “ I ’m Doing God ’s Work ” Blankfein in crowding the lifeboats with bankers .
Geithner , now treasury secretary , was previously the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( FRBNY ) , where he negotiated the deal to pay Goldman Sachs and the other top banks in full to cover their bad bets on securitized mortgages .
Barofsky ’s report concluded that Geithner ’s scheme represented a “ backdoor bailout ” for the financial hustlers at the center of the market fiasco .
Noting that Geithner denies that was his intention , the report states , “ Irrespective of their stated intent , however , there is no question that the effect of FRBNY ’s decisions — indeed , the very design of the federal assistance to AIG — was that tens of billions of dollars of Government money was funneled inexorably and directly to AIG ’s counterparties . ”
Not surprisingly , the Treasury Department that Geithner now heads defended his actions in not forcing “ haircuts ” on the full dollar - for - dollar payoff by AIG to the banks while he was at the New York Fed : “ The government could not unilaterally impose haircuts on creditors , and it would not have been appropriate for the government to pressure counterparties to accept haircuts by threatening to retaliate in some way through its regulatory power . ”
Nonsense , argues Eliot Spitzer , who as New York attorney general was way ahead of the curve in challenging Wall Street arrogance .
Writing in Slate on Monday , Spitzer points out : “ Pressuring Goldman and the other counterparties to offer concessions would have forced them to absorb the consequences of making suspect deals with an insurance company that was essentially a Ponzi scheme . ”
The Ponzi scheme was based on the collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) in which the bankers traded and which AIG had insured with the credit default swaps ( CDSs ) that they sold but failed to back with adequate funding .
Now Geithner ’s Treasury concedes that AIG “ should never have been allowed to escape tough , consolidated supervision . ”
But none of AIG ’s scams were regulated , nor were any of the others at the center of the larger financial debacle , because of laws pushed through Congress by Geithner ’s boss , Lawrence Summers , when they both were in the Clinton administration .
Specifically , they prevented regulation of those opaque CDOs and CDSs that would come to derail the world ’s economy .
As the inspector general ’s report stated : “ In 2000 , the [ Clinton administration - backed ] Commodity Futures Modernization Act ( CFMA ) … barred the regulation of credit default swaps and other derivatives . ”
Why did the financial geniuses of the Clinton administration seek to prevent that obviously needed regulation ?
Because the Clintonistas believed the Wall Street guys knew what they were doing and that what was good for them was good for us lesser folk .
As Summers , who is the top economic adviser in the Obama White House , put it in congressional testimony back then : “ The parties to these kinds of contracts are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies . ”
Sounds nonsensical today :
The inspector general ’s report notes that AIG , because of the deregulatory law that Summers and Geithner pushed through , was “ able to sell swaps on $ 72 billion worth of CDOs to counterparties without holding reserves that a regulated insurance company would be required to maintain . ”
But why , then , is Summers once again running the show with Geithner when both have made careers of exhibiting total contempt for the public interest ?
Because there is no accountability for the high rollers of finance , no matter who happens to be president .

From Morning Meeting Nov. 25 , 2009 , Rolling Stone 's Matt Taibbi and the Financial Times ' Chrystia Freeland discuss Matt 's recent article at Rolling Stone and the divide between the recoveries on Wall Street and Main Street .
Their analysis about what 's wrong with the economic team Obama has surrounded himself with is spot on and until he starts listening to some different voices on how to fix our economy , Matt Taibbi is correct , the cycles of bailouts are going to continue to repeat themselves .
Taibbi : I mean he has a unique responsibility for what went wrong because he was not only responsible for the bad policy , the deregulatory policy under Clinton but he also helped destroy one of the biggest companies in the world in CitiGroup .
And yet he was the guy who was put in charge and his people of being the architect of Clinton ’s economic policies .
Taibbi : I think so .
I mean you have to remember that probably , if you were going to have a Nuremberg for the financial crisis , Bob Rubin would be one of the first people on the dock .
Ratigan :
And that is the inherent insanity of the entire situation .
It ’s like giving the banks money , legalizing the banks to make money without having to lend it is like letting the cops create a military state .
They ’re the custodians of wealth , the custodians of security have been completely compromised — you think it ’s the people around the President that are largely responsible for that , correct ?
Ratigan : But Matt ’s ultimate point is that we have all these people that are still perpetuating a policy that is supportive of the banking system for sure , regardless of who ’s in there and an economy that is , has small business lending off a cliff , profits back at a record on Wall Street , one in four , one in seven mortgages delinquent ; you know I could go on and on with these statistics but basically the economy was torpedoed and the financial markets were supported and the reality Matt is that it ’s far more profitable not to lend money
In this country .
The fact of the matter is we ’re giving banks money at a time when the government has rules that say you can make more money if we give you money if you do n’t lend it .
Ratigan : I think he ’s got a great point , and I ’m a , I was a Rubin , well listen I ...I , Bob Rubin is an incredibly , obviously very accomplished , intelligent , etc. , etc. , etc. and they had an idea which was we ’ll create a hyper - efficient system — we ’ll create the most efficient financial system in the history of the world — as long as it does n’t collapse we wo n’t have a problem .
But it ’s like an efficient sports car .
It goes around the track real fast and then it blows into the wall , but if you ’re able to bail out and give the crash to the tax payer .
Freeland : I just think we need to be careful because Bob Rubin is n’t in the White House right now and the big bailout of Wall Street — we have to really be clear …
Ratigan : Umm hmm .
Freeland : … was n’t Obama ’s bailout .
The bailout of Wall Street …
Ratigan : Understood …
Freeland : … was Hank Paulson ’s bailout .
That ’s when the TARP happened .
It was last … ( crosstalk )
Ratigan :
There ’s no question that the car hit the wall last year … ( crosstalk )
Taibbi :
With the bailouts every step of the way Obama named …
Freeland :
That is absolutely right and it was Obama ’s choice to keep him , but it was n’t Obama ’s White House …
Ratigan : Let him finish .
Go ahead Matt .
Taibbi : Obama got elected .
On the day after he got elected he put two CitiGroup executives in charge of the economic transition team , especially Froman .
Two weeks later they do a gigantic bailout of CitiGroup and that very same day those same , those CitiGroup executives hired Tim Geithner to be the Treasury Secretary .
It ’s an absolute quid pro quo .
Ratigan : I would say Tim Geithner as the head of the New York Federal Reserve since 2003 as the bank regulator , in New York , over these banks at a time when the banks were accumulating leverage , at a time when the swaps market was continuing to get crazier and crazier , that this , that these people believe , implicitly or explicitly that that type of modeling is somehow good for America , based over a period of years .
Freeland :
Well do n’t get me wrong ; I ’ve written a piece complaining …
Ratigan : I know , I ’ve read it .
Freeland : … about how the guys at Goldman Sachs …
Ratigan : I get it .
Freeland : … think that they ’re Ayn Rand characters , but I just think that we have to be careful to get our facts right and so for example if you talk about CitiGroup , these actions were taken when Obama was not yet in office and I think one of the original sins about the financial bailout was there should have been more strings attached .
If you look at the strings that Warren Buffet attached to the money that he lent to Goldman Sachs , he got a better deal than the U.S. Treasury did .
Ratigan :
But to allow the continued funding of the banks under the counsel of the Obama advisory team and not come out with a windfall profits tax to take back the profits being made this year and all the banks CEO ’s compensation for the last ten years , because those people were paying themselves to accumulate risk that they could n’t accumulate because they legalized doing that .
And the fact of the matter is that I think Matt ’s onto something , is there ’s a good question to be asked which is why is it we ’re not seeing a windfall profits tax ?
Why is it we ’re not seeing a restoration of the rules of lending and investing ?
And the question you ’re asking is maybe there …or the answer you ’re positing is maybe the reason you ’re not getting that is because the people advising the President do n’t want us to have that .
Taibbi :
And also you have to look at the way the financial regulatory reform was you know what the White House proposals were on that this fall .
All the things that Tim Geithner sent to the Hill were very , you know , soft touches on Wall Street .
There was sort of a permanent bailout mechanism written into the resolution authority portions of the House bill .
Ratigan :
That ’s a fact .
Taibbi :
And it required a sort of open revolt in the House to get those measures killed or watered down .
That was the White House ’s position .
They wanted to have basically an automated future bailout system .
Ratigan :
So that I can basically pay myself out , torpedo the system and then whoever is left has to pay .
It ’s totally nuts .
And that was a Geithner … ( crosstalk )
Taibbi :
This was a built in safety net for the top twenty five banks in the country .
Freeland :
This is where I ’m with you .
I think that financial reform has not gone far enough , absolutely .
Taibbi :
And that ’s all because that it was these people who were writing these bills .
Ratigan :
So the issue you take Chrystia is to be cautious in assigning particular blame to Larry Summers or to Bob Rubin at this point because we do n’t have enough information to know whose doing or did what .
But we know that what ’s gone on has been directly offensive and destructive to American and directly beneficial to the banking system .
Freeland : Yeah and look …
Ratigan :
We just have to figure out who and why .
Freeland : I think bailing out the financial system , no matter what your politics , you have to be glad that that happened because we did n’t have a second Great Depression .
Ratigan : I disagree .
I would say that ’s like saying putting out a house on fire — we ’ve got to be glad we put the house out that ’s on fire …
Freeland : Yes …right …
Ratigan :
But I ’m more concerned about the fact that the people building our houses build houses that burn everybody in them down every ten years and everyone ’s acting as though the fire was an accident and the fire was n’t an accident .
The fire was started consciously by individuals ten years ago and it came home .
That ’s my … ( crosstalk )
Taibbi :
It ’s also a repeat of a pattern .
Let ’s not forget that .
Ratigan : Exactly .
Taibbi :
This is n’t the first time we ’ve bailed out Wall Street .
You go back to the Peso Crisis , Long - Term Capital Management , the , you know … Greenspan cuts the rates eleven times after the tech crash , we have the housing bubble .
It ’s over and over and over again we have the same policies and it ’s because it ’s the same people who are setting the policies in the White House .
I mean it ’s not … it ’s no accident that this is happening .
Freeland :
Well that ’s why financial reform legislation needs to be the central part of the discussion .
That ’s how the new house gets built .
Ratigan : Exactly and more importantly making sure that we identify who burned the house down , who made themselves rich burning the house down , getting the money back from those who made themselves rich burning the house down , punishing those who burned the house down and then building a new house that does n’t allow people who like to burn houses down to build them .
And they ’re acting like the house fire was an accident and I think that ’s where you run into a lot of problems .

An Israeli human rights group says more than half of almost 1,400 Palestinians killed in Israel 's Gaza war were civilians , which include more than 250 children under 16 .
The B'Tselem group says its figures were compiled after months of research , checking and cross checking , and visits to victims ' families .
It said its findings should compel the Israeli government to order an independent investigation into its punishing three - week offensive last winter .
Although the Palestinian Center for Human Rights has expressed concern that B'Tselem 's figures are far less than the actual death figure , the Israeli human rights group says the casualties are heavy enough to require serious introspection by Israeli society .
Palestinians mourn the death of a relative killed during Israeli
strikes , at a local cemetery in Gaza City in January 2009 .
Israel's
Gaza offensive killed 1,387 Palestinians , with more than half of them ,
including 320 minors , not having taken part in the fighting , an Israeli
human rights group has said .

The first Aids vaccine to show an encouraging result in clinical trials is only modestly effective and did not protect those at highest risk of HIV , it emerged today , as US and Thai researchers revealed their full results in Paris .
The announcement last month that the controversial $ 105 m ( £ 64 m ) trial carried out in Thailand had unexpectedly been successful took experts by surprise and sparked excitement around the world amid speculation that the steady spread of HIV / Aids could before long be checked .
However , it is now clear that this is a long way wide of the mark .
The full results , presented at the Aids vaccine conference in Paris and published immediately online by the New England Journal of Medicine reveal that :
• The vaccine did not protect those at high risk of HIV infection , such as sex workers and intravenous drug users .
• The protective effect was greatest in the first 12 months and then seemed to diminish .
• When those who did not get all six vaccine shots were taken out of the analysis , the positive result was statistically insignificant .
Some scientists and campaigners in Paris nevertheless hailed the results , if not as a triumph , then as a beacon of hope .
Dr Nelson Michael of the US army – the US military had run the research programme with the Thai government – said scientists would now be working intensely to pick up clues to future Aids vaccine development from the results of the trial .
" It is a signpost for vaccine development , " he said .
" This was a yes - we - can moment : the opportunity to become enthusiastic .
The door has cracked open .
We are all going to try to collectively crash through it . "
But Seth Berkley , president of the International Aids Vaccine Initiative , which evaluates and channels funds into trials , said he thought the regime tested in Thailand would be taken no further .
The vaccines involved – AidsVax , which previously failed in a trial in Thailand on its own , and Alvac – were 15 years old .
" That 's why there was scientific controversy about starting this trial , " he said .
" If you were going to start again , you might use one of the more robust vaccines we have [ in the lab ] today .
" We do n't have a vaccine on the horizon .
It is n't the Thai one or one of the others .
That 's why we have to have the patience for this marathon rather than a sprint . "
The Thai trial , given the name RV144 , was controversial from the start because it involved two vaccines given together , one of which had previously failed to protect people from HIV while the other had not been tested alone .
Many people felt the $ 105 m it cost could be better spent .
More than 16,400
Thai men and women aged 18 to 30 who did not have HIV were recruited and randomly assigned to receive the vaccine or a placebo .
They were given six shots over six months : two of Alvac followed by two more sessions where they were injected with both vaccines .
They were tested for HIV every six months , and counselled on how to avoid it for the next three years .
By the end of the trial only 125 people had become infected with HIV .
In the announcement of the headline results last month , it was said that 51 of those given the vaccine had become HIV positive compared with 74 in the placebo group , which gives a statistically significant efficacy of 31 % .
But many volunteers did not get all six vaccinations , taking the numbers down from around 8,000 in each group to around 6,000 .
Among those people , there were 50 infections on placebo and 36 on the vaccine , which gives an efficacy of 26 % but is not statistically significant , meaning it could happen by chance .
Well , September had been a trend - shifter in most of the things in Technology during which most users looked - out of their “ traditional approach ” to technology , towards the next step in Future .
Last week , we reported that Google search re-gained it ’s search market share , when it re-gained 80 % of the market in U.S , highest since last year .
On the Operating system side , Users are running away from Windows Vista to grab Windows 7 copies thereby declaring what was inevitable : Death of Vista .
Thanks to great Windows 7
Reviews , it does n’t even matter that Windows 7 has n’t been officially released yet , the Betas , RCs has been solid convincing proofs for Vista users to leave their OS , according to market - share data collected by popular web metrics firm : Net Applications .
As per the stats , Vista ‘s market - share dipped by 0.18 percent in September , which is the first time the OS has seen a down trend since it ’s hype in January 2008 .
Windows 7 , on the other hand , climbed 0.34 percent and now claims to be occupying 1.52 percent of the OS market .
Not bad for an OS that has n’t been released and yet that ’s lying only on the P2P sites like piratebay .
Steve Ballmer , CEO Microsoft , is already excited for Windows 7 launch of October 22nd .
On the other side , browsers also saw shifting trends .
Internet Explorer ( IE ) lost 1.26 percent of it`s market share .
This is not something new , every month it falls , but again , September ’s numbers were better .
Now , IE ’s market share is lowest - ever at 65.7 percent .
This again came as good news for Google : Chrome , whose market share jumped by 0.33 percent .
Firefox also managed to grab a big slice of 0.77 % .
It ’s pretty much evident to to see a similar trend in coming months .
What do you think , is it just the beginning ?

In a recent commentary titled “ Diagnostics and Therapeutics in Political Economy , ” I endeavored to show that an analytical understanding of past growth in the government ’s size , scope , and power does not permit us to prescribe effective means of stopping or slowing this growth , particularly any simple “ silver bullet ” remedy , and I specifically disclaimed any personal knowledge of “ what is to be done ” toward this end .
Responses to this commentary , some of them from keenly intelligent friends of mine who insist that diagnostics and therapeutics must be firmly linked , lead me to believe that I did not make myself sufficiently clear .
One respondent wrote , “ Higgs must be speaking with tongue in cheek , for a man of his intellect simply must have a few solutions at least . ”
Well , yes , on one level , I have many “ solutions ” to propose .
The problem comes when we ponder why I ’ve just put quotation marks around the word solutions .
The reason pertains to the links that connect my understanding of why government has grown with measures that might be taken to stop or slow its ongoing growth .
My understanding of the process by which government has grown in the United States and many other countries since the late nineteenth century is not easy for me to summarize briefly .
It involves ( 1 ) a structural - ideological - political process operating in a persistent manner to produce long - term trends , ( 2 ) a crisis - ideological - political process operating during a series of discrete episodes of “ national emergency , ” and ( 3 ) interactions between these two processes , which should not be understood as independent of one another , but as identifiable aspects of the single herky - jerky historical evolution ― sometimes regular , sometimes erratic ― of a politico - economic order .
One upshot of this complex process might be seen if we were to examine a series of “ snapshots ” at , say , thirty - year intervals .
Each snapshot would show us a society with a different composition of economic activities , production techniques , occupations , demographic attributes , and so forth , a different composition of ideological identifications , understandings , and loyalties , and a different configuration of political leanings , organizations , and institutions reflecting these structural and ideological differences .
To oversimplify , we might say that the overall process creates ― usually gradually , but occasionally abruptly ― a changing set of “ vested interests ” among the population , but in this characterization we would have to interpret the idea of vested interests more broadly than usual , so that it includes not only people ’s interests in pecuniary payoffs , but also their interests in ideological outcomes of various sorts .
( My views in this area have been developed in a series of personal engagements [ as a teacher , consultant in regulatory proceedings , and expert witness in legal proceedings ] and in a series of research efforts , the most prominent results of which are reported in my books Crisis and Leviathan , Against Leviathan , Depression , War , and Cold War , and Neither Liberty Nor Safety , to which the reader is referred for a more detailed account of my views on this matter , among others . )
Now , with this rather desperately compressed vision of the complex process by which the government has grown as our background , let us return to my “ solutions , ” that is , to my proposals for stopping or slowing further growth of government .
In doing so , however , we must recognize that political “ solutions ” that clash strongly with the currently prevailing array of vested interests ( broadly construed ) probably cannot be implemented .
For me to suppose otherwise would be inconsistent , because doing so would be tantamount to rejection of my own interpretation of how those interests came into being in the course of the historical process just outlined .
At least within somewhat flexible limits , a society ’s socio-economic structure , ideological postures , and political institutions must cohere .
At a particular point in time , many conceivable ( and in my view desirable ) political reforms are not feasible .
At the moment , many people are enamored of the solution that calls for abolition of the Federal Reserve System .
I certainly agree that the Fed has played an integral ( but not an indispensable ) role in the growth of government in the United States since 1913 .
But once one has demanded “ abolish the Fed ” and subsequently found that it is still in operation , what does one do ?
Various next steps might be suggested , such as sponsoring lecturers who explain how the Fed has adversely affected economic prosperity , peaceful international relations , and liberty .
From time to time , I have myself given such lectures to audiences that ranged from ordinary Americans to social scientists to Latin American bankers , and , of course , many other speakers have presented similar lectures .
All right , we ’ve given our lectures , and the Fed is still operating , so what should we do next ?
Give more lectures , in an attempt to influence the thinking of more people ?
Or perhaps mount a political movement aimed at abolition of the Fed ?
If one chooses the direct political option , where does one get the financing for it ?
Who will organize it ?
Who will lead it ?
What actions will it take ?
Will it try to place sympathetic candidates on the ballot for election to Congress ?
Will it attempt to influence sitting members of Congress by bribing them with campaign contributions or by threatening to recruit constituents to vote against them in the next election ?
My point is that once we select a specific means of stopping or slowing the government ’s growth , an endless series of follow - up questions presents itself , as we encounter one problem after another , each of which must be solved successfully if we are to make headway .
No doubt the greatest obstacle of all to any such effort is that thousands of organizations are currently working , directly or indirectly , to promote further growth of government .
A 2005 article in the Washington Post placed the number of registered lobbyists in Washington , D.C. , at more than 34,750 and reported that their business was booming , creating “ a gold rush on K Street . ”
Many of them have well - equipped offices , large capable staffs , including legions of lawyers , and established connections with incumbents in Congress , regulatory agencies , and other government offices , not to mention their friends on the courts .
They also have millions upon millions of dollars to pour into their efforts to win friends and influence people , including the same mass electorate that an anti-Fed or other anti-government - growth political movement presumably seeks to influence .
At this point in the historical process , anti-Fed proponents face a fabulously wealthy , tightly connected , deeply entrenched conglomeration of opponents who would sooner confine you , me , and all our friends and relatives at Guantanamo for nonstop torture than give up the Fed , which has long served , and continues to serve , their interests exceedingly well .
So , yes , we can try to mount a political movement to abolish the Fed , but , given what we are up against , what chance of success do we really have ?
One in a thousand ?
One in a million ?
Given this reality , if I offer as a “ solution ” to the ongoing growth of government that we abolish the Fed , my proposal solves nothing .
It only raises a series of other difficult questions , each one of which leads to another and another and another .
No political realist was surprised when , according to an October 30 Bloomberg report , “ Ron Paul , the Texas Republican who has called for an end to the Federal Reserve , said legislation he introduced to audit monetary policy has been ‘ gutted ’ while moving toward a possible vote in the Democratic - controlled House . ”
If the powers that be are not even willing to permit a vote on a bill with 308 co-sponsors aimed at making the Fed ’s decision - making more transparent , does anyone really believe that those same powers would stand idly by while the Fed was abolished ?
Nor is abolition of the Fed unique in this regard .
One might propose abolition of any number of government departments or agencies ― for example , the Department of Education , the Department of Energy , the Food and Drug Administration , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and countless other government bureaus ― and find that in each instance one runs up against another fabulously wealthy , tightly connected , deeply entrenched conglomeration of opponents .
One might alternatively propose simply to reduce government spending across the board , without trying to reconfigure the government ’s organization chart .
The obstacles here , however , are if anything even greater , because thousands of powerful interest groups are currently seeking to increase government spending .
Of course , each wants mainly an increase in the portion of government spending that enriches its own members , but the budgetary process has evolved , along with the committee structure of Congress , to facilitate a gigantic logroll , so that each year nearly every predatory interest group of any consequence tacitly agrees to refrain from blocking the other predators if they will refrain from blocking its own raid on the Treasury .
Committee chairmen and ranking minority members are paid off as required to achieve this massive predation .
Hillary Clinton used to complain about a “ vast rightwing conspiracy , ” but if one wants to see a genuine mega - conspiracy , one need look no further than the nexus of members of Congress and the thousands of well - organized and well - financed special - interest groups that support these politicians ’ perpetual reelection in exchange for their direct or indirect channeling of almost unimaginably huge amounts of the public ’s wealth into these special interests ’ coffers .
So , yes , one might propose , say , a balanced - budget amendment to the Constitution ― indeed , by now this proposal is hoary with age .
Political realists understand , however , that getting support for such an amendment is diabolically difficult , and , even if one were to be ratified , the members of Congress would simply install the appropriate smoke and mirrors to conceal their violation of this constitutional restraint , as they installed such circumventions on previous occasions to violate their own rules for spending restraint .
Does anyone still recall the Gramm - Rudman - Hollings Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 ?
It appears , then , that among the critical difficulties of restraining the growth of government is the obvious fact that even when restraints are enacted into law , the government will not obey that law .
Needless to say at this point , constitutional amendments are not worth the parchment on which they are inscribed .
After all , the Constitution still contains the Ninth and Tenth Amendments .
With those amendments and three or four bucks , you can get a latté at Starbucks .
I trust that by this point I need not belabor my point at greater length .
To recapitulate : “ solutions ” to the ongoing growth of government are available for a dime a dozen .
I have a bag full of them myself , and every one of them is utterly worthless as a means of achieving the ultimate goal .
Every genuine solution must be carried through , and any serious solution will require enough people and money to carry out the activities necessary to bring it about .
Marshalling people and money may in turn require ideological conversions on a substantial scale , which themselves may require a great many people and a great deal of money , if such conversions are possible at all , given the existing configuration of vested interests ( broadly construed ) .
Moreover , another potent constraint always lurks in the background .
Although we need not spend much time at present in dwelling on this issue , the fact remains that if any truly effective measures were approved to rein in the government , the rulers in all likelihood would resort to whatever legal or illegal violence proved necessary to prevent those measures from taking effect .
Thus , I am quite sure , for example , that if Ron Paul were ever , by a miracle of miracles , to be elected president , he would not live to take the oath of office .
Opponents of the government ’s ongoing growth must bear in mind that we are dealing with violent , heavily armed , utterly unscrupulous people who , if pushed to the brink , will stop at nothing to retain their power and privileges .
I welcome anyone ’s proposed “ solutions ” to the ongoing growth of government , and I wish all such proposals success , however much I doubt the likelihood of their success .
I do not believe , though , that a substantial prospect of success is necessary to justify one ’s efforts in resisting the ongoing growth of what is at bottom a gigantic criminal enterprise .
To resist its further growth is simply the decent thing to do , regardless of whether one expects to succeed .
And even those who believe , as I do , that the chances of success in such efforts are extremely small can take heart from the knowledge that ultimately this criminal enterprise will attain such bloated size and scope that its own survival will no longer be possible , and it will implode , as the Soviet Union and other similarly overreaching politico - economic orders have imploded .
Governments that grow and grow ultimately find that their predation becomes greater than their prey can support , at which point such predators are doomed .
Thus , the present system of government in this country and many others contains the seeds of its own destruction , even if those of us who abhor it cannot stop or slow its continued growth in the near term .
Some of the younger people among us may live long enough to help in picking up the pieces and beginning anew .
One hopes that the new beginning will rest on a less coercive , more voluntary basis than the present system .
Otherwise , it will be destined only to trace the same predatory rise that the present system has followed and to arrive at the same self - destruction that ultimately awaits our own politico - economic order .

LONDON , U.K. —
Recently I received an email labeled " Strictly Confidential " from Dr. Bakare Tunde , who said he was astronautics project manager at Nigeria ’s space agency .
He also told me he was the cousin of the first African in space , Air Force Major Abacha Tunde , and that this poor intrepid astronaut had been stranded on a secret Soviet military station ever since the Soviet Union dissolved in 1990 .
“ He is in good humor , ” read the email , “ but wants to come home . ”
No wonder he was keen to hurtle back earthwards , Tunde told me his cousin had accumulated almost $ 15 million in pay .
For the price of my bank account details , I could claim 20 percent and fly the brave chap home to collect my portion of the earnings and transfer the rest on to him like the good space - supporter that I was .
This classic 419 scam is indeed far - fetched but one aspect of it is true .
Nigeria really does have a space agency .
The west African nation ’s National Space Research and Development Agency is already celebrating its 10th anniversary .
And as America and Europe ’s space agencies set their sights on joint exploration of Mars , Nigeria has big plans of its own :
It wants to send a Nigerian up into space in 2015 , making Nigeria home to the first black African astronaut .
Sitting across from Gerald Okeke , it ’s hard to fathom that the quietly spoken fellow might one day fly beyond the earth ’s atmosphere .
Okeke , 28 , is one of 27 Nigerian engineers being trained how to design and build an earth observation satellite in the U.K. , at private British company Surrey Satellites Technology in Guildford , southeast of London .
We are sitting in the canteen of the spacecraft - mad company , from whose ceilings dangle silver starburst lights and whose rubbish bins are shaped like shiny rockets .
“ There is much to learn but we are coping , ” says Okeke , whose father was also a scientist .
“ It ’s a big challenge .
Talking about space in Africa is kind of a new field but it ’s a very big opportunity for us to explore . ”
He says it would be an honor to be picked as Africa ’s first black space sailor — who must be aged 27 to 37 at the time of lift - off and whose selection will begin next year ahead of four years of training .
Okeke has already spent several years studying in the U.K. , which he says is challenging .
“ The weather can be trouble and we try to cope with the food even though it ’s not what we eat in Nigeria , ” said Okeke .
His is not the only sacrifice in an expensive and widely questioned mission .
Nigeria spends $ 20 million a year on its space program , in a country in which for every thousand children born , 137 will die before they are five years old .
A collapse in the value of Nigeria 's naira currency — in part attributable to the global downturn — has meant the costs of its payments in U.S. dollars have also rocketed by a third .
“ Even in the U.S. some people are opposed to the space program so we are not surprised this happens here , ” says Seidu Onailo Mohammed , CEO of the Nigerian space agency .
“ But we want to assess the problems that have devastated this land .
We need to monitor our environment , assess problems of flooding , deforestation — all this can only be done if we have a viable space program .
Plus after so many years it ’s a good idea to think of an astronaut . ”
The country jetted up a $ 13 million earth observation satellite , made in the U.K. and launched from Russia , in 2003 .
A much more expensive communications satellite , costing hundreds of millions of dollars , was launched from China in 2007 .
It failed within 18 months
but a replacement is due to be propelled into space by 2011 , paid for by insurance .
But still the Nigerian agency wants more money .
The government believes it will all pay off in the end .
Already the earth observation satellite has taken some pretty impressive snaps including pictures of poppy growing in Afghanistan , the state of cyclone damage after Myanmar ’s authorities restricted access to international rescue teams in 2008 and , closer to home , identifying the whereabouts of illegal tankers parking far out at sea to steal Nigeria ’s oil supplies .
Nigeria has managed to sell about 1,000 of its satellite images and hopes over the course of each satellite ’s lifetime such data sales will cover the costs of manufacture and operation .
“ We are bringing down space to apply it on the ground , ” says Francis Chizea , Director of the Nigerian space agency .
“ It ’s going to be very very important for the economy .
We can map the wetlands and advise on areas very good for rice production ; monitor desertification in the north ; find the best place to locate dams ; assess the environmental impact of oil drilling ; locate oil spills and track movements on the border . ”
It ’s all been made possible by a new approach to space science that has let developing nations in on the extra-terrestrial act .
“ We ’ve been able to shrink a satellite from a double - decker bus down to the size of a TV set , ” says Martin Sweeting , the British founder of Surrey Satellites Technology , a radio fanatic as a child who decided space should n’t be the privilege of the rich nations .
“ It ’s now possible for an African country to have its own satellite for $ 10 to $ 15 million .
It can yield real benefits at the right price . ”
South Africa , Algeria and Egypt are all marshaling their own satellite facilities , so there ’s no question Africa ’s scientists are reaching for the stars .

The game puts the player in the role of present - day combat troops
Video gamers are being asked to join a Facebook group set up to help defend games from critics .
Set up by MP Tom Watson , the group aims to coordinate responses to articles in the media which , gamers claim , do not give a fair view of their hobby .
Mr Watson set up the group in reaction to comments from fellow Labour MP Keith Vaz who strongly criticised Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 .
The game goes on sale on 10 November and is expected to break sales records .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Quoted in the Daily Mail , Mr Vaz said he was " absolutely shocked " by the violence portrayed in the game .
Modern Warfare 2 is rated 18 in the UK .
Set in a near - future scenario , Modern Warfare 2 sees The West engaged in fight for survival against Russian ultra-nationalists .
Mr Vaz 's disquiet centres around one section in which undercover soldiers pose as terrorists and are asked to help shoot civilians .
Footage of the section caused controversy when it was leaked onto the internet .
Tom Watson is planning to hit back with his own views on the gaming industry
Rory Cellan- Jones
Technology correspondent
Read Rory 's thoughts in full The MP for Leicester East pledged to raise the issue in Parliament on the day prior to the release .
Publisher Activision said the section was " not representative of overall experience " .
Warning screens advise players that the scene may be upsetting .
Announcing the Gamers ' Voice group on Twitter , Mr Watson said the group was for gamers that want to form a pressure group .
The Facebook description of Gamers ' Voice describes it as " unashamedly pro-video games " .
" We aim to discuss how UK video gamers can find their voice in newspapers and government , " it said .
Title challenge
More than 10,000 stores across the world , including 320 plus in the UK , are expected to open at midnight to let gamers get their hands on the title .
Modern Warfare prepares to strike
Although the game has not yet gone on sale , it is already breaking sales records .
Online retailer Amazon said the pre-order sales are already 50 % higher than for Grand Theft Auto 4 - which until now had the most successful release ever .
Play.com say that , at the peak of demand , it was getting more than 150 pre-orders per minute .
Piers Harding - Rolls - an analyst with Screen Digest - told BBC
News there was a huge anticipation for the game .
" It 's a traditional first person shooter game which in terms of the game space is one of the most popular between 18 - 35 year - old males .
" ' With forecast worldwide sales over 10 million in the run up to Christmas , Modern Warfare 2 expected sales revenues compare very well with the biggest blockbuster movie releases , " he said .

The series started life back in 2003 , using the Quake game engine .
It was set in a WWII environment letting users play various missions as a British , American , and Russian soldier .
Although popular with gamers , it was not until the fourth instalment of the game - Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare - that it really became mass market .
" The last product by the developer Infinity Ward - Modern Warfare - was very good quality and in terms of sales and keeps on selling .
There was no real decline in price over a long period of time , " said Mr Harding - Rolls .
While the plot of the first Modern Warfare followed a vaguely plausible line , this latest version sees players hunting the leader of a radical Russian ultranationalist organisation called Vladimir Makarov .
" As far as the story goes , Makarov is this super villain and you are this task force , " Infinity Ward creative strategist Robert Bowling said in a recent interview .
" And it 's good versus evil .
So we really like to be cinematic but also not let that ruin the fun . "
The game looks set to prove highly profitable for publisher Activision .
" With an average sales price of $ 60 and estimated wholesale revenues of around $ 400 m , the publisher can expect a very positive Christmas quarter , " said Mr Harding - Rolls .
However , UK prices are expected to be higher than that , with console versions of the game coming with a recommended retail price of £ 55 and PC editions retailing at £ 50 .

Money , money , money . . .
All knowledge is hierarchical , which means we learn in layers , and each layer is built on what went before it .
You have to learn the letters of the alphabet before you can grasp how they go together to make words , and you have to master the concept of words before you can formulate sentences .
The same principle is true of economics or financial literacy .
You have to master basic concepts before you can move on to more complex , higher intellectual planes .
So let ’s take a few baby steps here , and make sure everyone has a grasp of the fundamentals .
But before we begin , once again let ’s deal with the issue of Why bother ?
Economics is generally considered to be the dismal science , and even the briefest mention of the subject causes the eyes of most people to glaze over in disinterest .
Paradoxically , let them lack for money and they will riot in the streets , kill each other , and overthrow governments .
We are so accustomed to technological progress , and we have become so certain of its inevitability that we become intellectually lazy and expect things to happen today and tomorrow as they did yesterday .
We do not want to trouble our pretty little heads or interrupt our texting , youtubing , or endless chatter on social media to really learn what causes an economic chain of events .
So we blithely throw around terms such as money , markets , investing , supply and demand , or wealth without any comprehension of what those terms mean .
We tell others we have a position on matters , such as ‘ we are for free markets ’ or we are ‘ against bailouts ’ without realizing that we are using labels as a substitute for thinking .
I do not write to tell you what you should think , or what positions you should adopt , or what conclusions you should draw .
I write to give you the tools with which to analyze and make your own judgments .
And I AM here to tell you that when the crowd is going North , you almost always want to look South .
But it takes more effort and learning to be an effective and intelligent contrarian .
Taking an opposition viewpoint without solid information is as ignorant as traveling with the herd and rivals adolescent behavior for conformity .
I have written repeatedly that money is NOT the same thing as wealth , and yet folks still do n’t get it .
If you asked most anyone on the street , if they had one wish , what would it be , the answer for most would probably be “ More money . ”
They are equating money with wealth , and that is totally wrong .
As a matter of fact , if you make that mistake in your mind , you are going to make a lot of financial mistakes because of it .
Once again , money has no value in , and of , itself .
Money is a symbol , and it draws its value from what it symbolizes .
Money represents the use of the human mind to create value .
What is value ?
Something people will act upon to gain or keep .
If you value your car , you will change the oil and maintain proper air pressure in the tires .
If you value your house , you will mow the lawn .
If you value your spouse , you will show a sustained interest in him / her .
Value means there is a valuer .
Value is not an abstract concept ; it implies there is someone who is doing the valuing .
To value implies action .
Therefore different people will value things differently .
In any given society , people trade values , and they use some form of money as the medium of exchange .
There is no absolute , intrinsic , abstract value to anything .
The value is assigned by the person doing the valuing .
A powerful speedboat may be worth $ 75,000 to you and of no value to me whatsoever .
For you , the speedboat may serve as a totem of your financial success , or it may help you attract the beautiful chicks .
For someone like me , who maybe has violent motion sickness , ca n’t swim , and is happily married , such a boat would represent a needless expense and headache to maintain .
So if I won the speedboat in a sweepstakes , its only value to me would be to trade it with someone for something else .
If we did that , we would , again , use money as the medium of exchange .
For me , money permitted me to exchange an asset , my speedboat , for someone else ’s asset , and the transaction was made possible by our mutual acceptance of a currency .
All assets are created , or enhanced , by the creative use of the human mind .
The asset itself is wealth , not the money you paid for it .
The money you paid for the asset is the numerical value you attached to that asset .
The production of that asset required raw materials , tools , a place to manufacture it , and people to perform the specialized functions to make it all happen .
Every single person involved was trading with everyone else , and in every case , the medium of exchange was some form of currency , or money .
The system of exchange only worked because everyone involved accepted the currency at the same face value .
Because people do not understand money , they are quite flippant about taking someone else ’s money or about dictating to them how to dispose of it .
Because money represents the use of your strength , time , mind , and other resources to create something trade - able with others , your product , or what you trade , is your private property .
If you were a part of a team effort , which is most often the case , your particular contribution is also valued in currency , or money , in the form of a wage .
A wage is nothing more than a price for your labor .
The higher your skill level , or the rarer your particular knowledge , or even the value of who you know , the higher price you will be able to command in free trade with others .
To help you grasp this concept , remember that there would be no such thing as employers and employees were it not for government wanting employers to be their tax collectors and bookkeepers .
This is not a job employers ask for , nor do they get paid for it , but if they refuse to do it they go to jail .
If they had not been conscripted for compulsory bookkeeping service , employers and employees would be contracting with each other , and there would be no “ class ” issues or grave power issues .
They would be buying and selling to each other .
It is interesting to note that the IRS has detailed laws to make sure no one is illegally “ contracting ” with someone who “ should ” be labeled an employee , thereby shorting the tax man .
Those who insist that there is a “ fair ” price to any form of human labor do not understand money or value .
Again , value is not intrinsic .
God does n’t send down prices from heaven , but some think society should send them up from the bottom .
What creates the value of what you produce ?
A valuer , also known as a Buyer .
A Buyer is someone who is going to take his own money ( which represents the value of his creative effort trading with others ) and exchange it with you for some service you will perform at your Buyer ’s request .
The price will be determined between the two of you , and you will both have to come to an agreement on a number , and the medium of exchange will again , be currency , or money .
If you cannot come to an agreement , no exchange of values will take place .
Each of you will continue to seek other trading partners with whom you can exchange at a value more to your liking .
Who knows , at the end of the day you might come back together and make the deal of the morning work , because neither of you has been able to get the price you wanted .
Since you are both free to dispose of your effort , how can anyone say it was unfair ?
To say one or the other should have gotten a higher price is to deny the whole concept of value ; that value is not assigned by some elite Know - it - All , but by Buyers .
And folks , some stuff never gets bought because there are no buyers at an asked - for price .
This is called the market , and the market can be humbling .
I may delude myself that I am a terrific writer , and I may further delude myself that I have just completed the next Nobel Prize for Literature .
When my novel bombs commercially , I may console myself by stating that the market obviously does n’t appreciate true literature and good taste ( which of course may be true ) , but the fact remains that I am going to be poor because good , bad , or indifferent , the valuers in my marketplace did n’t value my book enough to open their wallets and hand over their money in exchange for it .
Now in my example , the critics may differ from the public at large , and may give my book high praise .
As a matter of fact , I may actually win the Nobel Prize for Literature , but I am still very unhappy because once the prize money is gone , there is no ongoing commercial value to my book because the public ignorantly , and stubbornly , still refuses to buy it .
If my book is for sale for $ 30 , and a bricklayer makes that same amount of money for one hour of masonry work , he may decide that a competing value would be more to his taste , perhaps a DVD of a new movie he wants to watch .
So he will trade his product ( completed masonry work ) for his movie instead of my literary masterpiece .
In a free market , there are always lots and lots of people unhappy with how well , or more likely , how poorly , they are trading .
They insist that there are intrinsic values that a market does not recognize ; they believe in a value without a valuer .
Actually , what they believe in is not a free market , where everyone makes their own choices about their money ( the symbol of what they worked to produce and trade ) .
Rather , they believe in forced trade , by coercion .
They do n’t believe that what people earn really belongs to them ; they subscribe to a form of altruism that in actual practice becomes slavery ; they believe that what each earns according to their ability , belongs to others , according to their need .
In fact , everyone has become a slave to everyone else .
They therefore subscribe to a control economy where a group of Know - it - Alls can dictate value for everyone , and the result is price fixing .
So if I can not sell my artistic product satisfactorily on the open market , because no one is particularly interested , or at least not at my price , the superior valuers can subsidize me through the National Endowment for the Arts .
This is using your money , taken by coercion , to pay me what you would n’t of your own free will .
Apparently only the superior valuers were able to identify the intrinsic value of my opus .
It was necessary to override the obvious poor taste of the bricklayer in the free market who wanted to watch a movie instead of buying my classic .
Price fixing , dear Reader , is all around you ; you just do n’t know it .
Minimum wage , for example , is a form of price fixing .
A wage is a price , and the government sets a price floor below which no trading for labor may take place .
Now obviously , this is not the same as a free market choice , because the price floor is only set because some folks , both Sellers and Buyers , absent the government ’s involvement , would willingly trade below that price level in a free market .
The person selling their labor and skills in this transaction is the Seller , and the person acquiring their services and skills is the Buyer .
Why would anyone disagree with two people who voluntarily came to a trade agreement and price ?
Only if they believed there was an intrinsic value that the free market would not recognize .
So government coercion is used to mandate a higher - than - market price .
If it were n’t higher than market , at least in some geographic areas , there would be no point to the legislation .
Interestingly , whenever you hear minimum wage legislation debated in Congress , you never hear the debate framed in moral terms , that it is price fixing , applying coercion to what otherwise would have been a free market transaction .
No , the debate is always limited to whether or not minimum wage legislation creates higher unemployment , jobs reduction , layoffs , etc .
What everyone is overlooking is that some people , the elite Know - it - Alls , believe they have a superior capacity to determine value than the individuals doing the trading .
And in so deciding , they have also de facto declared that the product of your time , energy , skills , and mind , are not your personal property to trade as you see fit , but subject to their superior valuing skills .
This is a control economy .
Another and very current example of government involvement in “ free ” markets is the issue of health care .
Legislation presently on the table for consideration will fix prices of services and some service providers .
As with the partially nationalized banking sector and automotive sector , the government will establish the permissible compensation of health care providers .
The first issue is , and the one most ignored , of course , Is health care a moral right , and on what basis ?
Read Professor David Kelley ’s answer here : http://www.atlassociety.org/showcontent.aspx?ct=14&h=53.
For more information on the disinformation we are being fed on the subject , read Health Care Mythology by Clifford Asness , founding principal of AQR Capital Management here : http://www.stumblingontruth.com/.
And finally , since the argument for government mandated health care is based on it being a survival issue , that begs the question of how is health care different from , say , food production , which is also a survival issue ?
Should the government also fix the price of bread ?
Or does it already ?
Read an excellent response from Bradley Doucet here : http://www.atlassociety.org/cth-43-2212-WOE-HealthFreedom.aspx.
Those who favor a control economy always see themselves as the elite valuers , or at least being prominent or influential in determining the final result .
They pride themselves in creating social justice , and their vehicle for fixing the world is your earnings .
They do not see your earnings as your property , to dispose of as you see fit , but rather as public , or community property , to be disposed of by the community , as vested in them , the valuers .
There are quite literally thousands and thousands of manifestations of this throughout our economy , which is known as a Mixed Economy .
It is halfway between capitalism and socialism , or as the Republicans dubbed it recently , compassionate capitalism .
I guess that equates with a compassionate plantation owner who is well intentioned towards his poor , ignorant slaves .
The Big Boss in the big , white , plantation house knows best for all of us .
Every control decision has unintended consequences , because there is no way to predict accurately how the herd will react , or what will stampede them in this direction or that direction .
Predicting human behavior is a lot like predicting the weather ; there are too many variables to get very accurate about it .
In a free economy , you do n’t have the burden of predicting ; you simply allow people to trade on a voluntary basis and things take their course .
Control is not an issue .
On the other hand , in a control economy , every control requires even more controls .
Combine that with the fact that in a control economy , every decision becomes a political decision , every decision becomes subjected to competing gang warfare among the special interests , all of whom are being paid to obtain and / or peddle influence .
It is extremely difficult to create and preserve wealth when a substantial part of all your earnings are expropriated in the interests of social tinkering .
Wealth is created when money is re-invested in additional assets , aka land , manufacturing plants , machinery , R&D , skilled labor to produce further earnings .
It is this reinvestment of earnings , through money as the medium of exchange , that results in productivity growth , or higher Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
Only an increase in real GDP results in wealth .
Wealth is wealth ; there are assets at work that produce an excess over expenses that are reinvested over and over again , that lift a society out of poverty .
No society in the history of the world has ever taxed its way to prosperity .
Some borrowing , and therefore credit , contributes to the growth of GDP : borrowing for further investment .
Borrowing for consumption is digging a hole with a shovel .
When governments borrow heavily , as the United States government has been doing , they destroy wealth , because the government is now competing with all business for the limited supply of credit available ; the more the government sucks up ( by offering higher rates ) , the more expensive commercial credit becomes ( or it becomes unavailable altogether ) .
That drives up the cost of doing business , reduces capital investment in business , and halts the growth of GDP in its tracks .
Printing money is not the same as creating wealth .
The problem with printing money is that it confuses money with wealth .
Wealth is investment in assets that create new and further wealth .
Sucking credit out of the economy by borrowing so much that government is now competing with business for available capital , and politicizing business decisions , is not a road to financial responsibility , and recovery ; business quickly focus on political connections rather than efficiencies and higher productivity .
After all , at the end of the day , it will be government that will decide who gets to survive and who wo n’t .
Sometimes because of a government ’s actions , the public loses all confidence in the currency of the country .
The currency in effect becomes worthless , quite literally not worth the paper it is written on .
In time this could be the price the United States will pay for its present political decisions .
We ’ll see .
When governments succeed in destroying their currency because of ill - fated attempts at social engineering through a control economy , they usually see their only means of correcting their mess to be , of course , further controls .
In its final stages this often involves physical repression , incarceration , labor camps , torture and death .
Some countries , such as France , during their Revolution , declared that anyone who refused to conduct trade using the worthless currency of the day was to be subject to the death penalty !
I have always found it ironic that the motto of their Revolution , that culminated in the Reign of Terror with the tumbrels carrying many thousands to their death at the public guillotine , was none other than the eloquent “ Liberty , Equality , Fraternity ” .
No one seemed to realize that the first two were mutually exclusive ; that everyone cannot be free , and still achieve equal results .
We are equal in our title to individual rights , but unequal in everything else .
Their experiment in social engineering led to the inevitable bloodbath that has been the hallmark of every experiment at State control .
But still we persist .
Surely we will get it right the next time !???

Adam Smith's " invisible hand " argument : the sole occurrence of the phrase " invisible hand " in the Wealth of Nations :
An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth Of Nations : Every individual ['s ] ... study of his own advantage naturally , or rather necessarily , leads him to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to the society .
First , every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can , and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry , provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary , or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits ....
In the home trade , his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption .
He can know better the character and situation of the persons whom he trusts ; and if he should happen to be deceived , he knows better the laws of the country from which he must seek redress ....
The capital which an Amsterdam merchant employs in carrying corn from Koningsberg to Lisbon ....
The uneasiness , however , which he feels at being separated so far from his capital , generally determines him to bring part both of the Koningsberg goods which he destines for the market of Lisbon , and of the Lisbon goods which he destines for that of Koningsberg , to Amsterdam ; and though this necessarily subjects him to a double charge of loading and unloading as well as to the payment of some duties and customs , yet , for the sake of having some part of his capital always under his own view and command , he willingly submits to this extraordinary charge ; and it is in this manner that every country which has any considerable share of the carrying trade , becomes always the emporium , or general market , for the goods of all the different countries whose trade it carries on ....
[ A ] capital employed in the home trade , it has already been shown , necessarily puts into motion a greater quantity of domestic industry , and gives revenue and employment to a greater number of the inhabitants of the country , than an equal capital employed in the foreign trade ....
Upon equal , or only nearly equal profits , therefore , every individual naturally inclines to employ his capital in the manner in which it is likely to afford the greatest support to domestic industry , and to give revenue and employment to the greatest number of people of his own country .
Secondly , every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry , necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry , that its produce may be of the greatest possible value ....
As every individual , therefore , endeavours as much as he can , both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry , and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value ; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can .
He ... neither intends to promote the public interest , nor knows how much he is promoting it .
By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry , he intends only his own security ; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value , he intends only his own gain ; and he is in this , as in many other cases , led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention .
Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it .
By pursuing his own interest , he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it ...

The main problem that has been popping up is the inability of barcode readers to read the barcodes from the screen of the phone .
This will most likely cause companies to simply make custom ads for phones that include a code like the one featured in the above picture .
The only other seems to be the inability of people to find local business on LBC at all .

I was doing a literature review which needed to be 6000 words approximately in length .

I gave dissertation - help.co.uk the task to reach my word count .
They did a great job by actually discussing several case studies : both clinical case studies and computerised case studies .
Apart from that they used www.psych.org and the Harvard website to include endless articles of " cognitive behavioral therapy / depression and anxiety " .
Again , they truly elaborated the literature review because they investigated several case studies .

A mild panic swept over the U.S. in 1939 , following a brave decision by President Roosevelt to move Thanksgiving forward from the final Thursday of November to its penultimate Thursday , in an effort to lengthen and boost Christmas spending after the holiday during what were the last groans of the Great Depression .
In the days and weeks following his announcement , the White House saw an influx of incoming correspondence from all manner of sources , filled to the brim with heated opinion and response to FDR ’s controversial decision .
Such was the ill - feeling that many people ignored the change and celebrated on the 30th , while others opted to celebrate on both dates just to be sure .
For the next couple of years , the holiday was called Franksgiving by many .
Below are just six of the letters , all followed by transcripts .
All are from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library .
P.S. Happy Thanksgiving !

The Budget Press . Calendars .
“ Gift ” cards
Salem , Ohio August 15 , 1939 The President ,
Washington , D.C. SUBJECT : Thanksgiving Mr. President : Millions of calendars for 1940 have already been printed and sold .
We alone have printed over two million 1940 calendars .
As you probably know , calendars are sold mostly in January , February , and March , for delivery in the Fall of the year , for use during the coming year , in order that we may keep our employees busy throughout the full twelve months .
Otherwise , we would be working day and night the last few months and shut down most of the year .
This situation makes it necessary to print calendars almost a full year in advance .
As stated before , at the present time nearly all calendars are printed for 1940 and we have in preparation most of the preliminary work for 1941 calendars , which are sold by salesmen starting the first of December .
In other words , actual samples of 1941 calendars are placed on display in December 1939 .
Your change for Thanksgiving naturally makes all 1939 calendars obsolete , as well as all 1940 calendars , although it is not too late to change the preliminary work for 1941 .
I am afraid your change for Thanksgiving is going to cause the calendar manufacturers untold grief .
If very many customers demand 1940 calendars to correspond with your proclamation , hundreds of thousands of dollars will be lost by the calendar companies , and in many instances it will result in bankruptcy .
You will realize , I am sure , that if you had purchased calendars last January for delivery this coming December , to be distributed January 1940 , you would want those calendars to show the correct date for Thanksgiving , and you would expect the manufacturer to furnish them – Presidential Proclamation notwithstanding .
Due to the fact that 90 % of the calendars will be showing Thanksgiving on the usual date for 1940 , your Presidential Proclamation should be rescinded ; and if it is necessary to change Thanksgiving it should not be changed until 1941 .
Otherwise , it is going to be difficult for calendar manufactures to get their customers to use the calendars already printed .
Yours respectfully , ( Signed ) John Taylor JT :P

Washington , D.C. Dear President Roosevelt : Would like to give you the view point of the small merchant in regard to your change of the Thanksgiving date .
The small storekeeper would prefer leaving Thanksgiving Day where it belongs .
If the large department stores are over - crowded during the shorter shopping period before Christmas , the overflow will come , naturally , to the neighborhood store .
Before writing , have consulted with my fellow directors of the Flatbush Chamber of Commerce , as well as my fellow trustees of the Kings Highway Board of Trade , and the executive council of the Associated Retailers of Greater New York , of which I am chairman .
We have waited many years for a late Thanksgiving to give us an advantage over the large stores , and we are sadly disappointed at your action , in this matter .
Kindly reconsider and oblige thousands of small retail storekeepers throughout this country .

NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
UNIVERSITY BOARD OF ATHLETIC CONTROL
WASHINGTON SQUARE , NEW YORK August 22 , 1939 The Secretary to the President ,
The White House ,
Washington , D.C. My dear Mr. Secretary : I am wondering if you are at liberty at this time to supply me with any information over and above what has appeared in the public press to date regarding the plan of the President to proclaim November 23 as Thanksgiving Day this year instead of November 30 .
Over a period of years it has been customary for my institution to play its annual football game with Fordham University at the Yankee Stadium here at New York University on Thanksgiving Day , although there have been some instances during this period when the game has been played on the Saturday following Thanksgiving Day .
As you probably know , it has become necessary to frame football schedules three to five years in advance , and for both 1939 and 1940 we had arranged to play our annual football game with Fordham on Thanksgiving Day , with the belief that such day would fall upon the fourth Thursday in November .
Please understand that all of us interested in the administration of intercollegiate athletics realize that there are considerations and problems before the country for solution which are far more important than the schedule problems of intercollegiate athletics .
However , some of us are confronted with the problem of readjusting the date of any football contest affected by the President ’s proposal .
As soon as I read of the President ’s proposal , I advised our Graduate Manager in charge of schedule making simply to mark time pending further public pronouncement by the President as to the definiteness of his proposal .
I thought that there might be a change of mind on his part following such public comment which has been made in the press .
However , time is slipping past and if it is necessary for us to make arrangements for changing the date of our game this year , we should be taking steps very shortly to make such change effective and to make public announcement with regard to it .
In short , I am wondering if you could furnish me with answers to the following questions which should prove helpful to us in reaching a decision : 1 . Has the plan of the President as announced in the press been definitely established , with the result that Thanksgiving Day in 1939 will come on November 23 and not upon November 30 as had been generally anticipated ?
2 . If no definite decision has been reached as yet , are you in a position to state the earliest possible date upon which a final decision will be rendered ?
3 . Granted that the President does proclaim the third Thursday , November 23 , as Thanksgiving Day for 1939 , does it necessarily follow that the same procedure will be employed in 1940 , with the result that Thanksgiving Day during the course of that year would fall upon November 21 rather than upon the fourth Thursday of the month , namely , November 28 ?
I realize , of course , that you may not be in a position to furnish me at this time with the information sought , but you will appreciate that any light which you may be able to throw upon our problem will be extremely helpful .
Very truly yours , ( Signed ) Philip O. Badger ,
Chairman of the University Board of Athletic Control , and Assistant to the Chancellor POB :DG

October 18 , 1939 President Franklin D. Roosevelt
The White House
Washington , D.C. Your Excellency , Your recent decision to change the date of our Thanksgiving Day has just taken effect here at Pratt Institute .
Our directors announced that our school vacation would begin on the twenty - third of November and last until the twenty - sixth because New York , being your home state , is abiding by your decision .
However , where I come from , Connecticut , they ’ll be observing it on the thirtieth of November as usual .
Really , this situation makes my heart ache because I love our Thanksgiving Holidays as much if not a bit more than our Christmas Holidays .
Oh , I ’ve missed one other Thanksgiving at home with my parents because I was away at college and too far away to get home to celebrate with them and I did n’t like being away at that time either but I see its going to happen again .
I would really like to know just why you did change the date , my curiosity has been aroused .
You probably wo n’t see or hear of this letter because you are so busy however , it ’s been nice writing you about the situation .
Respectfully yours , ( Miss ) Eleanor Lucy Blydenburgh
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Suppose a United Nations investigation team found that the United States had committed war crimes in its response to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The report finds that while al Qaeda may have been culpable for the attacks and the carnage they wreaked , America was equally to blame - if not more so - for the civilian deaths caused during Operation Enduring Freedom .
The U.N. instructs the United States to conduct an internal investigation and punish the perpetrators , or face action from the International Criminal Court .
This is the framework established by the Goldstone Commission Report , which is the product of an investigation led by South African judge Richard Goldstone .
Its target was Israel ’s war against the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza last January .
The United Nations Human Rights Council endorsed the report on Friday , and it will now move to the international body ’s New York headquarters for further action .
On a factual level , the Goldstone report is notoriously flawed and one - sided .
Much of the 575 - page document was cut and pasted from unsubstantiated and suspect reports from nongovernmental organizations with openly anti-Israel sentiments .
Some of the “ witnesses ” interviewed by the mission were disguised Hamas officials .
The fact that Hamas loves the report should raise eyebrows about its contents .
Even more troublingly is the report ’s fatal moral blind spot , which is ignoring the differences between Israel , a sovereign state , and Hamas , a terrorist organization .
The Israeli armed forces are professional organizations governed by strict policies to limit civilian deaths during the conduct of war .
Israel is a signatory to the Geneva conventions and respects the rights of noncombatants .
After the conflict , Israel conducted some 100 investigations into reports of misconduct by its troops .
Killing civilians is central to Hamas ’ military doctrine .
Hamas launched 7,000 rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli cities between the pullout from Gaza in 2005 and 2009 .
During the ground fighting in Gaza , Hamas routinely used mosques , schools and hospitals as military sites and employed civilians as human shields .
Hamas exploited the chaos of the conflict to round up Palestinian political opponents , some of whom were crippled with shots to the legs , while others were reportedly executed .
There is no moral equality between Hamas and Israel any more than there is between al Qaeda and the United States .
Yet under the Goldstone logic , terrorists and sovereign states are identical .
The incidental , unintentional civilian deaths Israel caused during the Gaza conflict are condemned as war crimes ; the widespread and intentional Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians are basically ignored .
The Goldstone model makes it impossible for civilized states to strike effectively against the world ’s barbarians who are fighting a shadow war against decency that views innocent noncombatants as both legitimate targets and useful shields .
The United States voted against the report and will presumably use its veto power if action is taken before the Security Council .
America would do well to make it clear , publicly and privately , that it will not countenance the report or its twisted logic , nor endorse any moves to level the playing field between terror organizations and civilized states .
If this movement gains traction , one day the United States will be in the dock .

PALO ALTO , Calif. --
From a Silicon Valley office strewn with bean - bag chairs , a group of twenty - something software engineers is building an unlikely following of terrorist hunters at U.S. spy agencies .
One of the latest entrants into the government spy-services marketplace , Palantir Technologies has designed what many intelligence analysts say is the most effective tool to date to investigate terrorist networks .

The koala , Australia 's star symbol , is dying of stress .
The marsupial is found only along the coastal areas of eastern Australia where it feeds off the leaves of the eucalyptus tree .
But , as more and more people move to the region , koalas are finding themselves with fewer trees , researchers say .
The stress brings out a latent disease , called chlamydiosis , that infects 50 to 90 per cent of the population .
" Koalas are in diabolical trouble , " says Frank Carrick , the researcher who heads the Koala Study Programme at the University of Queensland .
" Even in their stronghold , koala numbers are declining . "
Chlamydiosis is a virus that breaks out in koalas in times of stress – like cold sores in humans – and leads to infections in the eyes and urinary , reproductive and respiratory tracts .
It can cause blindness , infertility and death .

The problem came to worldwide attention during the wildfires that swept across south - eastern Australia this summer when Sam the Koala , who became a celebrity after being rescued from the fires , was photographed drinking from the water bottle of a firefighter in a smouldering forest .
The koala was in such obvious pain that veterinarian John Butler decided to operate .
But her organs were too scarred to complete the surgery , and Sam was euthanised .
Deborah Tabart , chief executive of the Australian Koala Foundation , has urged the government to follow up on Sam 's case by classifying koalas as a threatened species and implementing policies to preserve their habitat .
The United States already considers the koala a threatened species , and the Australian Koala Foundation estimates there are fewer than 100,000 left in Australia , down from the millions that were alive when Europeans started to settle in the late 1700s .
Mr Carrick and other experts think the numbers are slightly higher , but regional counts have shown a huge drop .
There is clear evidence that some local populations have become extinct because of chlamydial disease , Mr Carrick said .
The majority of koalas hug a stretch of eastern coastline in the states of Queensland and New South Wales .
They are most abundant on the so - called Koala Coast , a 155 square - mile swath of semi-rural coast in south - eastern Queensland .
Mr Carrick urged the federal government to get involved .
" If koalas are not of national significance , I do n't know what on earth would be , " he said .
" Koalas are right up there as an international wildlife icon with China 's pandas . "

Of course , those pictures can't shared in order to protect they 're source , and what 's more , they 're hearing that " Nintendo originally planned to bring the Netflix service to the Wii before the end of this year " but they 're " also considering holding off on the Netflix service until they release their next generation Wii HD unit in early 2010 .

Attacks by insurgents in Balochistan have killed hundreds Pakistan has warned the US that sending more soldiers to Afghanistan could endanger its southwest border region .
President Barack Obama is expected next week to order more than 30,000 extra US soldiers into Helmand province , to battle Taliban insurgents .
But Pakistan prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani fears this would force militants over the border into Balochistan .
" We want a stable Afghanistan .
At the same time we do n't want our country to be destabilised , " said Mr Gilani .
Exit strategy " This is the concern that we already discussed with the US administration - that the influx of militants towards Balochistan should be taken care of , otherwise that can destabilise Balochistan . "
We have asked US to consult us in case of any paradigm shift in the policy
Yusuf Raza Gilani , Prime minister , Pakistan Security in Pakistan has been deteriorating ever since coalition forces entered Afghanistan eight years ago .
In Balochistan , which borders both Iran and Afghanistan , hundreds of people have died in attacks by both separatist insurgents and Taliban fighters .
In wider Pakistan , suicide attacks and bombings have killed more than 2,550 people in the last 29 months .
President Obama is due to unveil his new Afghanistan policy next week , after weeks of deliberations .
He is expected to lay out an exit strategy for withdrawing forces .
Mr Gilani said Pakistan should be consulted on any shift in America 's Afghan policy , because it would be directly affected by it .
He would not say if Pakistan had been consulted on the expected troop surge .
" We have asked US administration to consult us in case of any paradigm shift in the policy ... so that we can formulate our strategy accordingly , " the prime minister said .
Domestic approval Correspondents say it is unlikely that Mr Gilani seriously believes he can influence US strategy in Afghanistan .
He is more likely trying to win domestic favour .
Many Pakistanis are angry with their government 's perceived support for the US military presence in Afghanistan .
Some blame the US for the suicide bombings by insurgents who have been " driven out " of Afghanistan and over the border into Pakistan .
Mr Gilani may simply be seeking to distance himself from the US announcement next week on how many new soldiers it will deploy .

Note that this fellow knew how to talk the talk .
From : GAWKER SALES GUY
Someone is approaching publishers as a representative of Spark - SMG on the Suzuki account , even though Suzuki very recently switched agencies .
George Delarosa and his accomplice Douglas Velez claim that there 's a limited amount of money left in the Suzuki account for them to spend , and they need to spend it quickly .
They have intimate knowledge of online ad sales , including terms like eCPM , roadblocking , RON , IAB sizes , lead generation , traffic coordinators , etc .
Email comes from @spark - smg.com instead of @sparksmg.com , though the who - is for their spoof domain is very close to the actual domain ( Erin has links in her original email )
They maintain a Chicago area code ( where Spark is based ) but claim to be in London , even though they could n't give us the actual time in London when asked .
Unlike most spammers , these guys were happy to jump on the phone to get ads back up and running .
Clue that should have tipped us off was that we had to use our IO template ... most major agencies like Spark have their own IO template .
But as far as malware distributors go , this guy is easily one of the most convincing I 've ever seen .
I doubt George is his real name , but whoever it is definitely worked in online ad sales at some point .

Just FYI , we 'll need tags this afternoon if we want to do the roadblock tomorrow .
Let me know if we 're good to go !
Heatmaps are visual representations of data and , in case of websites , point out with which content people interact with , how deep a page they scroll , how they move the mouse around the screen , etc .
This is done by tracking the mouse clicks and mouse movement of the visitor .
Different heatmaps can be generated , depending on what is being tracked by the tool you use .
The most common ones are clicks , movement and scroll depth .
Click heatmaps allow you to analyse the clicking behavior , movement heatmaps will show you how people move their mouse over the screen and the scroll depth shows you how far the page people scroll down the page .
So that was a small intro on what heatmaps are .
Now let me show you some of the tools !
I started out with Crazy Egg a long time ago but have tried several alternatives .
Crazy Egg
A while ago , Crazy Egg was a free service , but that ’s not longer the case .
They have various payment - options and if you have a look at the demo , you ’ll notice that 9 $ a month is not that much .
If you prefer to have a free alternative for Crazy egg , you can just keep on reading …
I also wrote an extensive review about Crazy Egg if you ’re interested in this tool .
It includes a link , giving you the opportunity to subscribe for a 60 day free trial .
Smartlook
Smartlook is a bit of a special one in this list .
Not only does it integrate session recordings , heatmaps , event tracking and funnels for the web environment , but also for native mobile apps .
Both iOS as Android are possible via an SDK .
Although still in beta , things are finally looking up for native app users .
The session recordings are pretty detailed and offer a lot of filtering possibilities .
It also has a few other tricks up its sleeve .
For example , you can add notes to the session or look at the console of the user .
Another nice and useful touch is that you can connect the recording to individual users from your database through an API .
The heatmap track clicks , moves and scroll depth of the visit and you can filter them on several parameters .
When setting up a new heatmap , you can either collect data from new visitors ( and new data points ) or use historical recordings to populate the heatmap .
With event tracking , you can inspect every element on your website .
You can either use a specified CSS selector or their built - in event selector tool .
On top of that , you can specify special events that track JS errors in the console .
A handy tool for developers to track javascript errors .
Last but not least , Smartlook allows you to create funnels , giving you some better insights where in the customer journey people start to drop off .
Smartlook has a free subscription which allows you to track 1500 visits per month .
Of course it ’s limited in the amount of session recordings , the amount of generated heatmaps and the tracked platform .
If you would like to track more sessions , generate more heatmaps and look at different platforms , you will need to upgrade to a Starters package ( €19 / month ) or the Powers package ( €79 / month ) .
IMPORTANT NOTE : I have written a more extensive review about Smartlook , so if you ’d like to know more about the tool , just head out over there .

Plerdy was actually recommended by one of my readers , so I really wanted to have a look at it .
And Oh boy , Plerdy does n’t disappoint !
Setting it up was like any other tool in this list and it went really quick .
Going over the tool ’s dashboard , it immediately noticed that they have plenty to offer .
The entire feature list is divided into 3 larger topics : UX Analysis , Smart forms and SEO alerts .
Let us start with the UX Analysis .
Plerdy ’s UX analysis contains the following features :

Heatmaps , smart forms and SEO analysis in one pretty neat tool .
Mouseflow
Next in line is Mouseflow .
Besides a detailed mouse click heatmap , it also offers a mouse movement and scroll heatmap .
But it does n’t stop there .
Mouseflow is in fact a powerful web analytics package that gives you plenty of statistics and features to play around with .
It records the pageviews , total visit length , interaction time ( which I find very useful ) , bounce rates , loading time , response time and the scroll reach ( in percentages and pixels ) .
On top of that , Mouseflow offers live streaming , a very nice feature with which you can follow your users live ( only for paying subscriptions ) !
It also records whole visitor sessions , which you can playback in your browser or simply download to your hard drive to watch it whenever you want .
These recordings include the mouse movements , clicks , scroll events and key strokes .
For only 10 € a month you get 1000 recorded sessions – which is a bargain – but if you ’re still not sure you can always start with a free subscription .
IMPORTANT NOTE : Mouseflow has just released a new version of their tool .
Check out the new Mouseflow .
Hotjar
I have been using Hotjar since the early Beta version and I am actually very happy with it .
The tool is really easy to set up and produces useful heatmaps per device ( desktop , tablet and mobile phone ) and per type ( click , move and scroll ) .
This means a nice variety of options to analyse and gain insights from .
But it does n’t stop there for Hotjar because they offer so much more than heatmaps .
Other features include live recordings , funnel analysis , polls , surveys and even live user tests via screen sharing .
Every feature is enabled for the basic ( free ) account but restricted in use .
Really worth your time to check it out .
If you would like to know more about Hotjar ’s other features , you check out the review .
Lucky Orange
Next one is Lucky Orange , which has more features to offer than any other tool mentioned in this list .
They have session recordings , heat maps and funnels .
On top of that , they have also integrated a live chat functionality , polls and form analytics .
The heat maps are divided into clicks , moves and scroll depth .
So what ’s so special then ?
Well , Lucky Orange does n’t simply take a ‘ snapshot ’ of your web page but instead creates an interactive overlay as you browse your website .
That ’s right people .
Finally a solution for dynamic content and interactive interfaces !
No need to worry about about menus , drop downs or popups any more .
You can easily switch between screen sizes and event types .
Filter on behaviour tags ( similar behaviour ) , keywords , source , browser , etc. and create segments for frequently used filter combinations , making it possible to define your personas for example .
Lucky Orange has several pricing plans .
Pretty pretty good value for money I might add , but , unfortunately no free subscriptions .
However , readers of paulolyslager.com will enjoy a 30 day trial instead of the normal 7 days .
Just sign up and they will make the necessary changes for you !
MouseStats
Next one in line is MouseStats , which has several features to offer .
They have session playbacks , heatmaps , form analytics and surveys .
The heat maps are divided into clicks , moves , scroll reach , viewport overlap , attention and areastats .
The coordinates of the clicks are pretty similar compared to the other tools but they seem somewhat less refined ( think bigger blobs ) .
MouseStats has also included the services of Unbounce , Instapage and Optimizely , giving you the possibility to generate a different heat map per A /B test variant for example .
The session recordings will show you , besides the actual video , the duration of the visit , the amount of pages during the sessions and some other details such as OS , browser , screen size and whether it was a touch device or not .
In all honesty , I ’ve seen better implementations of this feature .
MouseStats has several paid plans available , but they also offer a free life - time plan .
All of the above features are enabled in this free plan , but highly reduced in the amount of recordings .
Continue reading on the second page where you ’ll find more alternatives for Crazy Egg .

For many of us who already understand the unintended consequences of the “ War On Drugs ” this video covers most of the main arguments ; however , it puts it in a way that I think almost any rational thinking person could understand .
At the very least those who are still for the WODs must acknowledge that it has n’t come without its fair share of consequences .
In fact , it would be hard to prove that the WODs has been working at all .
It certainly has n’t succeeded in deterring others from experimenting with drugs and , if anything , it has only added more dangers to society by creating a black market and an environment susceptible to gangs , violence , and other criminal behavior .
One could of course make an argument for WOD reform , but it is n’t nearly as compelling as the argument to just get rid of prohibition entirely .
America ’s past history with alcohol prohibition is the best example anyone will ever need that drug prohibition simply does n’t work : it does n’t make people safer , and it does n’t get people to make healthier decisions .
We are going to need to change our approach if we have any desire to build a better society .

Each biscuit is then finished with an egg - based glaze .
Here ’s good news for college and university students desperate for a part - time job that wo n’t even require leaving a dorm room .
Humana , Inc. , the fine and good corporate citizen that spends millions of its customer ’s premium dollars to fight health care reform and a public option rather than using them to pay claims , now wants to use even more premium bucks to pay students willing to sneak on - line at places such as Facebook and Twitter to tout the horrors of any change to America ’s superb health care delivery and financing system .
In other words , Humana is trolling college campuses looking for whores willing to accept money to be on - line promoters of an anti-reform policy that ’s against the student ’s own , best interests – or will be , once they leave school and are on their own .
Given the state of the economy , no doubt Humana will be overwhelmed with applications .
On Monday , journalist and blogger Molly Horan reports that Humana is actively recruiting students to develop and implement viral media strategies designed to undermine support for health care reform among their unsuspecting peers , making the whole thing appear as if it ’s coming from just another tea party protester , or at least one who can use a computer .
Fortunately , the Federal Trade Commission is one step ahead of Humana .
New Disclosure Rules
Beginning Dec. 1 , bloggers and TV shows alike will have to disclose if they ’re getting cash for mentioning or touting a product or idea .
Clearly , Humana ’s paid corps of anti-reform student zealots will have to mention they ’re getting more than a penny for their thoughts .
As N.E. Marsden wrote Friday in an Op - Ed at the Washington Post , " bloggers and , more important , stealth corporate marketers ( must ) post ‘ clear and conspicuous ’ disclosures when they receive payment for endorsing online .
...
The principle is sound : People have a right to know when someone is trying to sell them something . "
While I ’m all in favour of the free marketplace of ideas , when the ideas are being slipped to a writer in exchange for cash , I ’d like to know who ’s footing the bill .
This is on a par with George Bush paying Iraqi journalists in 2005 to write glowing articles on the glorious wonders of the American invasion and occupation .
Humana ’s strategy gives a new and broader meaning to its slogan , " Guidance when you need it most . "
Under the circumstances , it might be more appropriate as " Guidance we pay for when we need you to shill for us . "
Is Everyone A Fraud ?
Look , I know times are tough .
Jobs scarce .
The future scary .
Real health care and insurance reform a toss - up .
So , having been one once , I ca n’t really blame journalism students for trying to grab a bit of spare change where they can – although , hopefully , some will have the integrity to see the offer for what it is , and reject the idea of applying out - of - hand .
Still , I ca n’t help but shudder when I read the job posting :
Humana – Guidance when you need it most
Role : Political Communications Specialist ( part - time , limited - term )
Location : Chicago , Ill .
or work - at - home Are you interested in politics and political communication ?
Have a way with words ?
Know your way around Facebook , Twitter and the blogosphere ?
Put your skills to work where politics , communication and public relations intersect .
You will :
• Help manage and track a variety of online ( " Web 2.0 " ) channels
• Build a strategic new media and social media presence
• Contribute content for both traditional and new media
• Get a " foot in the door " and gain valuable experience in one of today ’s most challenging and fast - paced public policy arenas – health care
A Humana spokesperson would n't comment on the job posting other than to confirm the company is recruiting students .
This is PR flackery , pure and simple , and of the worst kind .
Humana is trying to lure virgin minds onto the rocks of whoredom by singing a siren song promising money and " valuable experience " in exchange for selling out America .
It ’s ethical fraud ; not illegal but definitely immoral .
Of course , it turns out there ’s as much ethical fraud being committed by mainstream and highly respected journalists , as well .
A week ago , the lead story on CBS ’ 60 Minutes covered the supposed $ 60 - billion fraud in Medicare payments .
I sat watching it dumbfounded , wondering if this might pound a huge nail in the coffin of the public option .
Pierre Tristam had the same reaction .
But then , he decided to confirm the 60 Minutes reporting .
Tristam is an editorial writer for the Daytona News - Journal .
He started by calling the show ’s producers who referred him to the person at the Justice Dept . who worked with 60 Minutes which , he eventually admitted , used a high figure in the " range " of " possible " and " believed to be " Medicare fraud .
So Tristam kept digging , finally publishing a remarkable Sunday piece titled " Loose With Numbers : Medicare Fraud Report A Fiction . "
Steve Kroft and his producers never bothered to trace their facts to the source for viewers , relying instead on the slob - journalist 's cheapest cop-out : Attribution by estimates .
Nor did they make the equally important point :
Insurance fraud is n't unique to Medicare or government - run programs .
If anything , it affects the private sector more .
Shame on " 60 Minutes " and the Justice Department for throwing around wild numbers .
Those are the numbers – the fictions – shaping public opinion across the country and public policy in Washington .
Medicare fraud is a serious problem .
But singling it out and exaggerating it beyond credibility wo n't fix it , although it may help doom any government expansion of health care .
In that regard , the 60 Minutes segment did its death - panel best .
Has the whole world has turned into the 1919 Chicago Black Sox , sneaking around behind everyone ’s back , putting in the fix , winking and nodding at the rubes in the stands , and damning the consequences – and the rest of us .
A special h/t to Breandan Healy
October 18 , 2009 -- Newly elected local municipal councillor Sam Wainwright summarised what he saw as the significance of his election to the Fremantle Council , in the state of Western Australia ( WA ) : “ It ’s a victory for all those like me who believe that the council can and should play an active role in involving people in decision making , protecting the environment , campaigning for workers ' rights and making a place in the community for people who are too often left out , such as Indigenous Australians and people with disabilities . ”
Wainwright is a co-convenor of Socialist Alliance in Western Australia and an activist in the Maritime Union of Australia .
He said , “ I ’m the first socialist elected to public office in WA for a long time , if not ever .
Most candidates for council try to appeal to the middle ground and keep their political affiliations quiet .
I do n’t believe in that approach .
I think it ’s better to be upfront about your beliefs .
Throughout the campaign I emphasised that I was a staunch socialist , unionist and environmentalist . ”
He added , “ I did n’t expect everyone to sign up to everything I stand for .
But I did ask people to believe that I would be a hard working campaigner for their rights .
I ’m really grateful and humbled that so many people have shown their confidence in me and saw my background as a positive . ”
Wainwright thanked the diverse range of people who supported his campaign .
“ Active support came from all sorts of places : members of the Socialist Alliance , the Greens and the ALP all pitched in ; many unionists and community activists helped out ; and last but not least , everyday residents who do n’t wear a political label but want to see the sort of change that we talked about in the campaign .
The election result belongs to these people and I know that the hard work now begins . ”
Commenting on the Fremantle mayoral election Wainwright said , “ With three Greens members running for mayor I was worried that they would takes votes from each other and allow a more conservative candidate to win .
However Brad Pettit ’s win was emphatic and I extend my congratulations to him for his strong and vibrant campaign .
There has been a real changing of the guard on the council and I expect there will be some passionate and intense debate about the future of Fremantle .
I think this is a good thing and will be arguing my case like everyone else .
At the same time I pledge to work constructively with the rest of council where we can find common ground on the way forward . ”
Victory by 100 votes
At the October 17 poll in the seaside city , not far from the Perth , Western Australia 's capital , Wainwright topped the poll with 438 votes ( 33.44 % ) -- more than 100 more votes than his nearest competitor and enough to put him over the line for the Hilton Ward of Fremantle Council .
( The official election results can be read here . )
Under new , undemocratic first - past - the - post local government electoral laws in WA , Wainwright was elected as the candidate with the most votes .
The Greens decided not to stand against Wainwright .
Of the six new Fremantle councillors elected there is one member of the Australian Labor Party , two Greens , two independents and one Socialist Alliance .
However under WA electoral law local government candidates can not formally run for political parties and Wainwright was the only candidate to declare his political affiliations in his campaign material .
In the mayoral poll of six candidates , Greens member Brad Pettit triumphed with more than 45 % of the vote , well in front of two fellow Greens Michael Martin and Jon Strachan .
Both Pettit and Strachan were endorsed by the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce .
Issues that Wainwright campaigned on included : making Fremantle a “ fight climate change ” council ; better public transport , including linking Fremantle to Beaconsfield , Hilton and Samson with buses ; for council and community workers ’ rights ; maintaining the area 's beaches , parks and green spaces for everyone ; for rates based on ability to pay , not just house value ; and council democracy .
At a victory celebration on October 17 , Wainright told supporters that this victory was for the whole Socialist Alliance and the diverse supporters of his campaign .
He was proud that this campaign had been successful while being fully open about his socialist , environmentalist and unionist convictions .
Wainwright is the first Socialist Alliance member to be elected to a local government position in Australia .

Fossil fuel protesters occupied Didcot power station early yesterday morning , forcing it to switch electricity generation from coal power to gas as a safety precaution .
The protesters , who range in age from 19 - 50 and belong to no named group , said they planned to occupy the Oxfordshire station for up to a week and could escalate their action by occupying the inside of one of the flues .
Nine protesters were still 200 m up the chimney tonight after entering the power station grounds before dawn , but police removed 13 who had locked themselves to a coal conveyer belt .
" It is expected that the remaining protesters in the chimney area may remain overnight until it is safe for them to be bought down in daylight , " said Npower in a statement .
" We have barricaded ourselves into a round room through which the four flues run .
There 's no way we can be reached , we 're in control of this power plant and we 're not moving any time , " said Amy Johnson , one of the protesters .
Leon Flaxman , a spokesperson for RWE - npower , the German coal company which runs the power station , said its ability to generate electricity has not been affected .
" Only three of the station 's four units were working at the time of entry , and one tripped for reasons unrelated to the protest .
That is now back up and running .
They are all running on gas but we could switch back to coal .
We have an alternative way of getting coal [ to the boilers ] . "
According to the protesters , only a small amount of coal was in the boilers when they entered Didcot at 4 am , and will last for a few hours unless police clear the 13 protesters , who have locked themselves to the coal conveyer belt .
If the company then has to then shut any of its boilers , it will be possible for protesters to climb into its flue pipe , so preventing it being started up again .
" It 's an option .
But if we went in [ to a flue ] now it would kill us , " said Johnson , an Oxford university student .
" Climate change is already killing 300,000 people a year , but we have no intention of dying , " she said .
A report in May by Kofi Annan 's thinktank , the Global Humanitarian Forum , examined the impact of climate change on humans and found that it is responsible for the deaths of 300,000 people every year .
Flaxman warned the protestors should " absolutely not " enter the flues .
" It would be lethal .
It takes at least a week after the boilers shut down before people can enter them " , he said .
The protesters , who met at a Climate Camp in London this year , said they had targeted Didcot because RWE - npower is planning to build as many as 30 new coal - fired power stations across Europe , including two in Britain .
" They have been hiding behind the skirts of power company E.ON and its [ proposed new station at ] Kingsnorth .
This became a symbol of new coal in Britain , but npower is actually the foremost advocate for new coal .
We 're saying to them that we wo n't leave until they cancel all their plans for new coal , " said Johnstone .
RWE - npower responded that it was only planning one new coal power station in Britain , at Tilbury , and planned to reduce the company 's carbon intensity by one - third by 2015 .
" Didcot is closing down in a few years anyway .
We are planning to spend £ 1bn a year for 10 years on cleaner power , including carbon capture and storage and wind farms , " said Flaxman .
The siege of Didcot is particularly embarrassing for RWE - npower because the plant has just upgraded its security .
" To be honest we 're quite surprised at how easy it all was .
I did n't quite expect to be here , " said one of the protesters .
Didcot has been the scene of long - running local protests over RWE - npower 's plans to dump fly ash from the power station at Radley lakes , a beauty spot which it owned close to the power station .
The plans have now been shelved .

BBC News , Nagaland
Burmese troops have surrounded a base of Naga separatists in the country 's northwest and begun bombing it , Indian military officials said .
They said Indian troops have fanned out in the hills opposite this base in Sagaing to arrest any rebels who may try to flee into Indian territory .
The base is operated by the Khaplang faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland ( NSCN ) .
There are around 300 rebels at the base , Indian intelligence agencies say .
Most of them are NSCN guerrillas , but around 50 of them belong to the separatist United Liberation Front of Assam ( Ulfa ) .
Two Burmese light infantry regiments are involved in the attack , they said .
But Burmese military officials or diplomats were unwilling to provide details .
Villagers around Maniakshaw in Sagaing said they could see the Burmese troops firing mortars , targeting the camp .
Diplomatic pressure Indian troops confirmed heavy shelling of the Naga rebel base since late on Thursday but were not sure whether the Burmese had launched an infantry assault .
Burma 's military junta has been under Indian diplomatic pressure to launch assaults against northeast Indian rebel bases in its territory for some time now .
But the junta has cited counter - insurgency commitments elsewhere in the country for not starting an offensive against these bases located mostly in Sagaing division in the hilly northwest of the country .
Nagaland has also been hit by a prolonged insurgency
The Bhutanese army demolished the north - eastern Indian rebel bases in the southern part of the kingdom in December 2003 in an operation .
The success of that operation has prompted India to push its other neighbours in the east to initiate similar military action against the rebels from the northeast .
Bangladesh 's new Awami League led government has also started a crackdown against north - eastern rebel hideouts on their hideout .
The separatist United Liberation Front of Assam ( ULFA ) has alleged that Bangladesh police has picked up two of the senior leaders from Dhaka this week and expressed apprehensions that they may be handed over to India .

“ I do n’t believe we can significantly alter their effectiveness by cutting off their money right now , ” said Representative Adam Smith , a Washington State Democrat on the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees who traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan last month .
“ I ’m not saying we should n’t try .
It ’s just bigger and more complex than we can effectively stop . ”
The Taliban ’s ability to raise money complicates the Obama administration ’s decision to deploy more United States troops to Afghanistan .
It is unclear , for example , whether the deployment of 10,000 Marines over the summer to Helmand Province , the heart of the opium production , will have a sustaining impact on the insurgency ’s cash flow .
And American officials are debating whether cracking down on the drug trade will anger farmers dependent on it for their livelihood .
But even if the United States and its allies were able to stanch the money flow , it is not clear how much impact it would have .
It does not cost much to train , equip and pay for the insurgency in impoverished Afghanistan  fighters typically earn $ 200 to $ 500 a month  and to bribe local Afghan security and government officials .
“ Their operations are so inexpensive that they can be continued indefinitely even with locally generated resources such as small businesses and donations , ” said Kenneth Katzman , a Middle East specialist at the Congressional Research Service and a former analyst of the region at the C.I.A .
American officials say that they have been surprised to learn in recent months that foreign donations , rather than opium , are the single largest source of cash for the Taliban .
The Conservative leadership would aim to push through an emergency budget , including spending cuts and a possible rise in VAT , with the support of the Liberal Democrats if David Cameron fails to secure an overall majority in the Commons at the general election .
The revelation that senior Tories see the Lib Dems as their natural partners comes on the eve of Cameron 's final party conference speech before the election in which he will declare he is " ready to be tested " as prime minister .
He will draw on biblical references to offer a more positive vision to the nation after the dire warnings on the state of the nation 's finances , saying : " There is a steep climb ahead , but the view from the summit will be worth it . "
Despite the optimism in Cameron 's speech today , it is also clear that the Tory high command is looking at tax rises to fill the gap in the nation 's finances .
Senior Tories freely admit that the measures announced in shadow chancellor George Osborne 's speech on Tuesday will only make a dent in the fiscal deficit .
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the measures , including a pay freeze for 5 million public sector workers , will only reduce the deficit by a sixth of the amount the government has committed itself to cut by 2013 - 14 .
A rise in VAT to 20 % in an immediate post- election budget would raise as much as £ 13 bn .
Shadow ministers have not ruled out the move , saying such a rise would not necessarily choke off the recovery .
In his conference speech Osborne was strongly critical of the VAT cut from 17.5 % to 15 % , saying it had had little or no effect on stimulating the recovery .
VAT is due to be put back to 17.5 % after Christmas and other taxes , including a 50 p tax rate for those earning over £ 150,000 , are due to be introduced in April .
Overall Labour has said that 80 % of the reduction in the deficit to 2013 - 14 will come from spending cuts and 20 % from tax rises .
It is known that cabinet ministers have also been privately discussing a VAT rise coupled with increases in personal allowances for the low - paid .
Senior
Tory sources , who say they are confident of winning the general election outright , have none the less been preparing for a hung parliament .
If that were to happen they believe the Liberal Democrats would be more likely to support a minority Conservative administration than prop up a Labour government .
One senior Tory source said : " If no party wins an overall majority and then there is a hung parliament then the largest party will be invited to form a government .
It would be highly unlikely we would form a coalition with the Lib Dems , but we might be able to reach an understanding with them . "
The source noted that the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman , Vince Cable , recently wrote a pamphlet in which he called for the fiscal deficit to be reduced at a faster rate and highlighted the possibility of a rise in VAT to 20 % .
Osborne is understood to be relieved that tough spending cuts medicine in his speech has not led to a political backlash in the polls .
A Sky News / YouGov tracker poll last night showed the Tories rising by two points to 43 , giving them a 14 - point lead over Labour .
But Labour also increased its share , increasing a point to 29 % .
The Liberal Democrats fell by a point to 17 % .
Such a result in a general election would give the Tories an overall majority of more than 100 .
In an interview with Radio 4 's Today programme Osborne defended his decision to spell out some spending cuts in his speech , saying : " We need a democratic mandate for what needs to be done ...
I 'd rather be honest about that before the election than lie to you before the election and then be found out afterward . "
Closing the conference in Manchester today , Cameron will use language inspired by Matthew 's Gospel to tell voters : " If you put in the effort to bring in a wage , you will be better off .
If you save money your whole life , you 'll be rewarded .
If you start your own business , we 'll be right behind you .
If you want to raise a family , we 'll support you . "
But he will warn that " painful " cuts in public spending lie ahead .
" None of this will be easy .
We will be tested , I will be tested .
I 'm ready for that – and so I believe are the British people . "

When China announced that its economy grew 8.9 % in the third quarter , you 'd expect China - boosters to pour into the streets , acclaiming the nation as the world 's new engine of economic growth .
But instead of praise , experts are casting a skeptical eye on the Middle Kingdom 's economic figures .
This is a major turnaround from the spring , when many pundits applauded Beijing 's mammoth $ 586 billion stimulus package as a sign of the country 's migration away from an export - intensive economy .
Though a coterie of columnists ( Fareed Zakaria , in particular ) still fawns over China 's response , others are wondering whether China 's recovery plan is all wrong .
Why ?
These skeptics say asset bubbles , social upheaval and slow growth all lie ahead .
A Bubble Stimulus Zakaria , who recently declared China the real winner of the recession , lauds China 's stimulus plan for concentrating the bulk of its funds on " investment for future growth : infrastructure and new technologies . "
However , in an op - ed piece for the Financial Times , Qin Xiao , chairman of the China Merchants Group , voices concern over Beijings huge liquidity injection .
Qin says that while the plan has helped avoid the worst recession since the Great Depression , there are asset bubbles lurking ahead , specifically pointing out recent surges in China 's stock and property markets .
" I do not believe a quick steep bounce driven by fiscal fixed investment is a good thing for China , " he says .
While worried that tightening monetary policy would lead to a " second dip " in the economy , Qin believes it is still imperative China shift from a loose monetary policy to a neutral one .
A Stimulus Revolt To The American 's Michael Auslin , the asset bubble described by Qin Xiao above has manifested itself in the madness of China 's affluent crowds .
China 's growing conspicuous consumption , he says , poses a sizable threat in " a country that has such uneven economic growth . "
Auslin , who recently attended a Chinese auction where a bottle of wine was sold for $ 93,000 , expects the Chinese Communist Party to begin clamping down on the economic exuberance that has driven it forward , and , if not , social upheaval could still occur .
" If the world 's auction houses continue to crow over massive Chinese purchases , then being a contrarian may be the smartest move of all . "
A Pseudo Stimulus Forbes ' Gordon Chang points out that however impressive China 's 8.9 % GDP growth in the third quarter may seem , there is plenty reason to believe " Beijing 's statisticians have gone back to their old tactic of making up figures to support the Politurbo 's predictions . "
For one , Chang finds it difficult to believe car sales in China nearly doubled every month of the third quarter , while gasoline sales were nearly flat .
Looking at China 's trade numbers , Chang is curious to know how China , long dependent on sales abroad , managed to grow at such a rapid clip despite a precipitous drop in exports for the third quarter .
" If [ Wen Jiabao 's ] numbers were real , he would be worried about overheating .
But he 's apparently not . "

Some bloggers are keen to make money from their efforts US regulators will for the first time crack down on bloggers who fail to disclose fees or freebies they get from companies for reviewing products .
The Federal Trade Commission , FTC , decided to update its nearly 30 year old guidelines to clarify the law for the vast world of blogging .
Offenders could face eventual fines of up to $ 11,000 ( £ 6,900 ) per violation .
The updated policy on how advertisers can use endorsements will also apply to celebrities and research firms .
Until now , bloggers had not been covered by the guidelines - something which had concerned consumer groups .
They had argued for a long time that the links between some bloggers and companies were not always totally transparent and clear for readers .
" Consumers are increasingly dependent on the internet for purchase information , " said Jack Gillis of the Consumer Federation of America .
" There 's tremendous opportunity to steer consumers in the wrong direction . "
There is nothing in the new rules about how disclosures must be made .
" That 's left up to the endorser , " said Richard Cleland , assistant director of the FTC 's division of advertising practices .
" It can be a banner , part of the review .
The only requirement is that it be clear and conspicuous . "
' Material connections '
The FTC said its commissioners voted 4 - 0 to approve the final web guidelines , which will take effect from 1 December .
The commission had unveiled a draft of the proposed policy last year .
The blog by advertisers for bloggers who advertise
In a statement the FTC said " the revised guides specify that while decisions will be reached on a case - by - case basis , the post of a blogger who receives cash or in - kind payment to review a product is considered an endorsement .
" Thus , bloggers who make an endorsement must disclose the material connections they share with the seller of the product or service . "
The guides are not binding by law , but rather interpretations of law that hope to help advertisers comply with regulations .
The new policy will also apply to Twitter , Facebook , Yelp and other forms of new media advertising .
" The new rules on bloggers are the most far - reaching attempt to stamp some guidelines of conduct on the blogosphere , which in general operates according to informal codes and the notion that " inauthentic " bloggers - including those not disclosing commercial relationships - will suffer in the web 's court of public opinion , " wrote Michael Learmonth of Advertising Age .
' Trust ' Reaction from the blogosphere to the FTC's new guidelines over what has been dubbed blogger payola has been mixed .
" The concept of disclosure is not new to BlogHer .
The trust of readers is everything , " said Elisa Camahort Page , a co-founder of BlogHer the main news , entertainment and information network for women online reaching more than 15 million each month .
' Mommy blogs ' are starting to attract lots of traffic " We have never been in favour of a universal code of conduct but we think that what the FTC has introduced is simple and achievable for anyone who wants a professional relationship with the market and to retain the trust of the reader , " Ms Camahort Page told BBC News .
Wayne Sutton , who is a social media strategist and hosts a social media podcast at TalkSocialNews.com agreed .
" We 're in a time when companies will try ( to ) leverage individuals who are community leaders or have a large audience for brand awareness ... but if you want to keep them ( readers / followers ) , being honest or " transparent " is the best way to do so . "
Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at New York 's City University and long time blogger and sees things differently .
In a blog post he attacked what he called " the FTC 's misguided , dangerous ad / blog endorsement rules . "
" I think that openness is the best fix for questions of trust and advise companies and politicians and certainly governments to become transparent by default as enlightened self - interest .
" But mandating this for anyone who dares speak online ?
Foolish , " wrote Professor Jarvis .
On Twitter the issue became a trending topic .
" New FTC proposed rules on product endorsements are big - brotherish in extreme , unworkable and downright dangerous , " tweeted Dan Gillmor , director of the Knight Centre for Digital Media Entrepreneurship .

Scotland ( 3 ) 9
Pens : Godman 2 Drop-goals : Paterson
Australia ( 3 ) 8
Try : Cross Pens : Giteau By James Standley
Scotland ended a 27 - year losing streak against Australia as an awesome defensive performance set up victory over the Wallabies at Murrayfield .
Australia dominated territory and possession but it was 3 - 3 at the break as Scotland fly - half Phil Godman cancelled out a Matt Giteau penalty .
A Godman penalty and Chris Paterson drop - goal saw Scotland edge ahead .
And although Ryan Cross went over for an injury - time try , Giteau 's missed conversion handed the Scots victory .
The last time Scotland lowered the Wallabies ' colours was way back in 1982 when they won 12 - 7 in Brisbane , but since that win the Australians have grown into a major force on the world stage , something that cannot be said about the Scots .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In recent times they have struggled to make an impression in the Six Nations , let alone at a global level , but after several years in the wilderness the appointment of Andy Robinson as coach has paid immediate dividends .
The former England boss may have opened his account with a win over Fiji last weekend but victory over the Wallabies , who were on a 16 - game winning streak against them , looked highly unlikely .
No-one had told the Scottish players that they were not supposed to win , though , and they put their bodies on the line to clinch one of the biggest upsets of recent times .
The visitors ' cause was not helped by the normally accurate Giteau missing three kickable penalties , in addition to the crucial late conversion , as he struggled to come to terms with the swirling wind in Edinburgh , but he did manage to get the scoreboard ticking over with a fifth - minute effort .
MY SPORT : DEBATE
You only had to listen to the Murrayfield crowd to understand the passion the Scots played with today
BB The Wallabies came desperately close to scoring the first try of the game soon after , but some heroic defence from the hosts saw powerful Australia number eight Wycliff Palu stopped inches short .
The visitors came even closer to a try when Giteau sprung Stephen Moore through a hole in the heart of the Scottish defence but more superb defence , this time from Rory Lamont and Chris Cusiter , prevented the hooker from getting the ball down .
Scotland suffered a blow as Cusiter was forced off with a head injury , and it looked as though it was only a matter of time before the Wallabies opened their try account , but as the game went past the 20 - minute mark Scotland finally began to secure some possession .
A couple of powerful mauls from the forwards gave them some belief , and when the Australian pack infringed to halt a rumble from the Scottish eight , Godman punished the visitors with a well - struck penalty .
The Australians soon regained control of both territory and possession but more ferocious Scottish defence meant they could not cross the hosts ' line , and a missed penalty and drop - goal from Giteau meant the two sides were locked together at 3 - 3 at the interval .
Australia continued to enjoy the upper hand but the Scots refused to yield and missed penalties from both Giteau and Godman ensured the game was still deadlocked approaching the final quarter .
Scotland were having some joy when they kept the ball at close quarters and they managed to edge ahead on a rare foray into enemy territory when Dean Mumm was caught on the wrong side of a ruck and Godman landed the difficult penalty .
Australia continued to enjoy the lion 's share of the ball and it continued to look inevitable they would find a winning score .
But Scotland defended with a ferocity that would have warmed the cockles of ex-flanker Robinson 's heart and Australia failed to keep their nerve when it mattered .
With 15 minutes to go Quade Cooper had a two - on - one overlap after the Aussies had sucked in the remaining defence but his miss - pass to Drew Mitchell was wastefully forward .
Please turn on JavaScript .

And when Scotland went up the other end and extended their lead to six points through Paterson 's sweetly struck drop - goal even the most pessimistic of their fans started to believe victory could be theirs .
However , there was still time for Australia to launch a series of late attacks and they hammered away at the Scottish line with increasing desperation .
As the clock ticked over into injury time a last assault from the Wallabies saw them come within inches of scoring several times before Giteau sent the ball wide for replacement centre Cross to power over .
That left the fly - half with a tricky conversion to spare the Wallabies ' blushes but not for the first time the ball drifted to the left of the posts as the delirious Murrayfield crowd threatened to lift the roof off the stadium .

AMD 's fab spinoff , GlobalFoundries , has announced a deal with ARM to make the latter 's Cortex A9 parts available on the former 's 28nm half - node process .
This makes GlobalFoundries the first company to work with ARM on a 28nm A9 implementation , and it's a win for ARM because it makes any GlobalFoundries customers into potential ARM customers .
A bit of background : a system - on - a- chip ( SoC ) provider who is already using GlobalFoundries to produce its SoCs can more easily mix its own technology with ARM's to produce SoCs based on Cortex A9 .
This is the same reason that Intel ported Atom to TSMC — so that existing TSMC customers can also mix Atom with their own IP to make Atom - based SoCs .
( Of course , what was a shocking move for Intel is standard procedure for ARM , which is a fabless semi company whose total revenues are less than what Intel spends to develop one processor . )
ARM PR , for its part , took this opportunity to once again remind everyone that Adobe Flash 10.1 is now available on its processors .
This is a direct slap at the now - inoperable Intel talking point that Atom is better than ARM because only Atom " runs the full Internet . "
This talking - point was actually still in use at last month 's IDF , despite the fact that everyone there knew that it was essentially nonsense .
The most interesting aspect of today 's announcement surrounds AMD as a possible Cortex A9 user , because AMD is still GlobalFoundries ' main customer .
You may recall that AMD had a very exciting line of ARM - based SoCs that contained its DX10 - compatible graphics technology that went under the name of Imageon .
( AMD / ATI was well ahead of NVIDIA 's Tegra here ) .
But this past January , AMD sold the Imageon unit to Qualcomm — a depressing and abrupt exit from a real growth market , all in the name of cutting red ink in the face of the downturn .
Given that AMD was in the ARM business and got out of it just 9 months ago , it seems unlikely that it will jump back in with another ARM - based SoC courtesy of GlobalFoundries .
This is too bad , though , because there 's a ton of enthusiasm about A9 - based " smartbooks , " and an A9 - based Imageon would 've provided a great basis for a high - powered , low - cost , long battery - life Linux portable .
But AMD has gotten out of the SoC game just as it's getting interesting .
GlobalFoundries does n't need AMD to use ARM to make the deal worth doing , though .
STMicro has recently signed on with them as a customer , and the new company is also buying Chartered Semiconductor , a large foundry that counts Broadcomm and Qualcomm as customers .
Given the scope of GlobalFoundries ' ambition and the recent uptick in global semiconductor demand , this ARM announcement seems logical and timely .
Tom Cruise , Katie Holmes and daughter Suri reunited with John Travolta and wife Kelly Preston — plus over 4000 other Scientologists — at a massive party in England on Oct. 16 , Usmagazine.com has confirmed .
The stars were surprise guests at the 25th anniversary of the International Association of Scientologists held at Saint Hill Manor in East Grinsted , West Sussex .
During nearly two hours of speeches , Cruise , 47 , briefly addressed the rapturous , fist - pumping crowd : " Because we never took our eyes off the ultimate prize , we stand where we are today , " he intoned , witnesses tells Us .
" We are in this together ! "
When a choir took to the stage , the Cruise - Holmes family stood up with the rest of the audience .
" Tom was swaying and looked like he was in heaven , " an attendee tells Us .
" He was really , really into it .
Katie was next to him doing her best to look as enthusiastic .
She was clapping along with the
song , but was totally out of sync .
Suri was standing by , looking a little bemused in a cute little party dress . "
Seated nearby , the Travolta and Preston — still mourning the death of son Jett and dealing with a related extortion trial — were more muted .
" John and Kelly were holding hands throughout the performance , " an onlooker says .
" They look like a very united couple . "
Later , during a reception , Cruise was overheard chatting with another American man about the protesters outside the venue .
" They 're squirrels , " Cruise said angrily , according to a witness .
" Stuck in an electronic incident .
It makes me so angry ! "
The family left the party around 11 p.m. ; they have a home in nearby Dormans Park .
Glass is written ideally !

Systemic Failure Approaches By Jim Willie CB
Oct 2 2009 10:21 AM www.GoldenJackass.com
Use the above link to subscribe to the paid research reports , which include coverage of several smallcap companies positioned to rise during the ongoing panicky attempt to sustain an unsustainable system burdened by numerous imbalances aggravated by global village forces .
An historically unprecedented mess has been created by compromised central bankers and inept economic advisors , whose interference has irreversibly altered and damaged the world financial system , urgently pushed after the removed anchor of money to gold .
Analysis features Gold , Crude Oil , USDollar , Treasury bonds , and inter-market dynamics with the US Economy and US Federal Reserve monetary policy .
Debate stirs on whether the financial structure of the USEconomy is broken irreparably .
Debate stirs on whether actions taken in the last year or two have put the nation on a path that can even achieve stability , let alone recovery .
Debate stirs on whether a harmful syndicate has taken control of the USGovt financial ministries , let alone be removed .
Debate stirs on whether lack of US Federal Reserve audits and disclosure of their accounting is integral to sustaining the syndicate control .
Debate stirs whether the nationalizations have actually enabled adoption of wrecked assets and concealed executive ransacking .
Debate stirs whether the mountainous federal deficits , the nationalizations of essentially Black Holes , and the endless war spending make deficit reduction a distant dream .
Debate stirs on whether the gargantuan accumulation of USFed reserves will spill over to produce widespread price inflation .
Debate stirs on why after causing the foundation failure of the US financial structure from Wall Street and the USFed offices , these institutions not only remain in power but demand greater power .
It is my contention that the US financial structures broke without any remote potential for repair and revival in the summer of 2007 .
The symptoms became obvious in the summer of 2008 to the slower observers with visible shock waves bathed in crisis .
The reactions from shock waves have come since the autumn months of 2008 .
The system has broken , but the syndicate in control wishes to keep the music going , keep the machinery turning , keep the money flowing , so that they can continue the racket , bury the bond frauds , process the bad paper into USGovt coffers , continue to corner the printing press operations , and continue to con the USCongress into granting more funds .
Nobody seeks justice and prosecution for over $ 1 trillion in mortgage bond fraud .
Nobody seeks to remove key Wall Street firms from their command posts within USGovt finance ministries .
Nobody seeks even to locate the missing $ 50 billion from the Iraq Reconstruction Fund .
Foreigners have been very busy since the autumn 2008 , as they dismantle the levers , knock down the pillars , block the escape routes , yank the collateral from the paper marketplaces , and otherwise thwart the US - UK structures .
To claim that the system can be put on proper stable footing is lunatic .
To expect that the nation can be recalibrated so as to return to the Good Ole Days of US global dominance and leadership is lunatic .
To urge that the economic signposts , megaphones , and billboards be once again guided by policies best described as Bubbly Economic Mythology is lunatic .
Yet delusional Americans actually believe the dominant ship at sea can lead as flagship , when it has taken on more water than the Titanic .
Since the autumn months of 2008 , marred by the Lehman Brothers failure , marred by the Fannie Mae adoption , marred by the AIG adoption , punctuated by a shameful 0 % interest rate policy ( ZIRP ) and a green light for limitless money creation ( QE ) , the United States has lost any semblance of leadership .
Instead , its leadership has earned scorn , criticism , and disrespect .
The last people on the globe to comprehend the American condition of failure , corruption , and military aggression seem to be the Americans themselves , who live within the USDome of Perception .
The US press networks do not cover the global Paradigm Shift underway that will change its landscape radically .
The clearest conclusions center on almost nothing put on a sustainable viable course for the nation .
Amplification and widened breadth of all that failed cannot serve as the core for revival or recovery , let alone stability .
Yet such policies seem the only ones our hapless bank leaders are able to execute .
It is a dog returning to gobble his vomit .
It is akin to managers urging their worst workers to intensify their efforts , and to join the ranks of management .
These Keynesians cannot admit that the central bank franchise model has failed , not to be resurrected .
In my view , the debates , the foundations , and the reactions scream two major messages .
1 ) The system is out of control , with the drivers ramming down the accelerator for even more of everything that failed , for a locomotive within a monetary system based upon illegitimate money .
2 ) The USGovt finances are heading toward a recognized failure , identified by both a banking system bankrupt seizure and a USTreasury default .
The nation cannot come to grips with the bold stark notion that foreigners control our fate , from their revolt against the USDollar as a global reserve currency , from their revolt in supplying additional credit to the USGovt and USEconomy .
The reaction so far to crisis has been to rely more heavily upon the Printing Pre$$ , to monetize the debts , and to conceal such operations .
Things are out of control !
In fact , my forecast is for systemic failure .
Its primary elements will be a failed US banking system ( as in seizure ) and a USTreasury Bond default ( as in coerced restructure ) .
Again , martial law and declaration of economic emergency will be the final solution .
Two years ago , my analysis regularly mentioned martial law and imposed order to handle the chaos from a disintegrated economy and insolvent dysfunctional banking system .
Here we are in the present , when such forecasts do not sound so outrageous anymore .
The Jackass has featured a string of seemingly outrageous forecasts that have come true .
The US system is credit dependent , and credit will soon be cut off , in the next chapter of isolation .
The Printing Pre$ $ is a temporary solution , en route to a failed state .
The US leaders and citizens do not learn from history .
They defy history amidst delusions of omnipotent power .
See the Weimar Republic , which has gone global !
Even the World Bank led by yet another Goldman Sachs pupil warns the Untied States not to assume the USDollar will remain the unchallenged global reserve currency .
GOLD IS RESILIENT
The true sanctuary is gold , in the face of debauchery of paper money .
We see some clear first hand evidence of the ‘ Beijing Put ’ at work .
It could provide a banking system foundation , except that the Gold Cartel and Banker Elite would have to forfeit power , maybe face poverty .
Notice the quick recovery .
With a slightly lower gold price , the off - take delivery of physical gold has been magnificent , much greater than a week or two ago .
The Wall Street banksters are shocked to learn that demand is not isolated , but rather comes from diverse global sources .
The Powerz threw all they could at gold , mentioned some half - baked story about I.M.F. gold sales ( more like closure to decade old short sales ) , and upped the ante of controversail gold futures contract sales .
Notice the moving averages all aligned and rising .
Notice the stochastix cyclical index that come down quickly to the 20 low trigger , ready to rise on a quick reload .
The response breakout was very typical , seen a million times before .
The breakout loses the amateurs and fast traders who miss the big picture .
Like a diver off a springboard , the dive commences for a lift upward .
The pullback was really miniscule .
The recovery was rapid and impressive , in symmetry with the suddenness of the controlled correction .
The Chinese are obviously thanking the US gold merchants who offer the Middle Kingdom yet more gold bullion at reasonable prices .
The Chinese want to maximize their accumulation of gold from the PaperBoyz , at the best price .
They do not want a catapult upward in the gold price .
They want a gradual controlled price .
Expect continued accommodation .
ABSENT A STRONG FOUNDATION
Widespread Insolvency is a major theme of the broken condition .
The banks have assets and income grossly below their debts and liabilities .
They must rely upon phony FASB accounting , which was the basis of the stock recovery beginning in April .
They must bring fresh capital , lost as fast as it arrives .
They now tell the public what their assets are worth , backwards to any market concept .
The households are suffering from mortgage obligations even as housing prices continue to slide lower .
With almost one third of American homeowners who hold mortgages operating with an underwater status , whereby their home loans exceed the home value , the army of consumers is more than hampered .
Unlike the bankers , the households of America cannot just pound the table , engineer an absurd Stress Test , and declare they are solvent enough for equity extensions .
The households line up for defaults and foreclosures instead .
The smart ones demand that the bankers prove clear certified title of their property .
See the Kansas MERS case that might serve as precedent to jam the gears of the bankers intending to seize homes in foreclosure .
The bankers cannot prove they hold clear title .
Such is the vagary of mortgage bond fraud , as it seeps to the surface .
The USGovt finances are in shambles , with $ 1800 billion in fiscal 2009 deficits , and easily $ 1300 billion to come in the next year .
Take away the Printing Pre$ $ from the desperate delinquent devils running the USGovt finance ministries , and national debt default would take place within 60 days .
The nation does not even contemplate budget surplus , but rather justifies yawning deficits and lies using lunatic forecasts .
The industrial base is also largely depleted .
The Chinese Most Favored Nation granted in 1999 set the stage for shipment of much of the US factories to China .
In the process , the USEconomy replaced income with debt , all in the name of ‘ Low Cost Solutions ’ mindlessly .
Corporate leaders in America reacted to heavy burdens of government regulations and higher taxes , even to rugged labor unions .
Maybe their relocation decisions constituted betrayal , or maybe just reaction to onerous conditions that evolved over decades .
The Albatross of falling property prices , both residential and commercial , continues to hang around the neck of the USEconomy .
The full impact of the commercial property decline has yet to be felt , more in delayed reaction .
A queer factor comes into play with commercial mortgages and loans .
Even if the majority of payments are current , even if most tenants pay rent on time , the loans tend not to be viable for refinance and rollover .
The Loan - to - Value ratios are all horrible after a broad 30 % to 40 % property price decline .
Banks require more equity .
On the residential side , the Prime Option ARMortgages are lined up for the kill .
It seems that payment of less than the required interest was not a good idea after all .
It seems that leaving homeowners the option to build their loan balance when property prices fell was not a good idea after all .
Now they face 100 % to 200 % monthly loan payment increases , all in the fine print unread years back .
So liquidations and foreclosures will continue to come , complete with outsized bank losses .
The Perpetuation of Loss is ensured by continued property foreclosures and liquidation .
Despite all talk , the process continues .
The Accounting Fraud for bank balance sheets and stock valuation runs like a cancerous streak throughout the financial sector .
The best way to cover up fraud is with more fraud .
The best way to cover up accounting chicanery is to have the USCongress bless it as legal , vital , and essential .
Once the stock market rose for consecutive months , talk of phony accounting rules is forgotten , SINCE IT SUCCEEDED , even served as proof of recovery .
What nonsense !
A moral depravity has permeated not just the financial sector , but the public as well .
They cry out from the corners laden with pain , but without specific targets .
The end of the FASB relaxed rules is scheduled for January 1st .
Let ’s see if a compromised USCongress and corrupt Wall Street demand its extension .
They obviously will .
Furthermore , both Basel 2 and Basel 3 guidelines are ignored , since from outsiders .
Ignore them at one ’s own peril , as they gather as Enemies at the Gate among the USGovt creditors .
Foreign creditors are the # 1 adversary to American finance right here , right now .
SUSTAINING FORCES
Numerous hidden forces sustain the current breakdown and hamper anything remotely resembling a recovery .
In fact , most praise of success comes from people who praise their own efforts , like USFed Chairman Bernhacky .
His predecessor was also very accomplished at praising his own craft and alchemy .
Sir Alan Greenspasm left the national banking system hanging over the precipice , from where it fell in a short time after passage of the mantle at his retirement .
He believed his housing bubble saved America from disaster .
He believed that credit derivatives offloaded risk .
Little did he realize that the next disaster is always much greater than the saved previous one , when amplified credit and monetary ease are the solutions relied upon , all pure heresy .
He lives now in London , and spends much time in Switzerland .
These nations paid his secretive other paychecks .
These nations are where his loyalty and all directives came from in my opinion .
Many hidden forces will work to undermine the current efforts to instill a recovery to the USEconomy and a resuscitation of the US banking system .
Bernhacky will soon realize that reliance upon the same toxin to course through the increasingly decaying bodies will produce even worse problems during the next crisis phase .
It comes .
Numerous sustaining forces will contribute toward the inexorable path to systemic failure .
It will begin with the relapse failure of the US banking system .
The hidden housing inventory will ensure that housing prices continue down for a couple more years .
At best they will stabilize somewhat , but only if a monumental hidden housing inventory is permitted to accumulate .
The big banks , the very same that abused mortgage bonds with leveraged instruments , own an outsized supply of foreclosed homes .
What a fitting reward !
They tend to release only a portion of this home supply , so as to permit some price stability as demand catches up .
Lenders are reluctant to lend though , even while the foreclosure process continues .
Job loss is the main driving factor , amidst household insolvency .
The Zero Interest Rate Policy is worn as a badge of shame to reflect central bank failure .
It rewards savings not at all .
It encourages the same speculation that produced bubbles to kill the banks and households .
It encourages a Dollar Carry Trade , which ensures a pressured decline in the USDollar itself .
The October Hat Trick Letter will discuss additional risks and dangerous consequences from the Dollar Carry Trade .
Remember , Bernhacky assured the USCongress , the US conferences of economists , and the US people that the USFed would not resort to 0 % rates .
He did just that .
In addition to powering with leverage the US $ exchange rate downward , this carry trade takes away a viable Exit Strategy for the USFed .
Imagine Wall Street leveraged speculative machinery interrupting any potential lift in the official US interest rate !
Recall that the USFed must pamper the Wall Street crowd by inventiong new liquidity facilities and preaching solutions to the USCongress .
In the last year , the USFed has acted like it is the entire banking system .
What exactly is the exit doorway to take from that strategy ?
Without hesitation , one can claim that No Meaningful Reform or Restructure has occurred .
The US financial and economic structures continue to suffer from precisely the same problems that resulted in systemic breakdown in the autumn months of 2008 .
The difference now is that the previous high volume of acidic money is exceeded with higher volumes now .
USGovt debts are now much higher .
Lending institutions are less prone to lend now than one or two years ago .
Commercial paper used not to flow at all , and now flows but with less volume and from fewer channels and with more USFed assistance than ever before .
Advocates for a reformed system without paper fiat money are dismissed .
The financial wizards are sure to lose control , as frenzy sets in .
No meaningful reform comes even to the hundreds of thousands of mortgage loans that undergo Home Loan Modification .
They cannot alter the loan balances , since that would require alteration of the associated mortgage loans that rely upon income stream from loan payments .
This is not acceptable , since it would reveal the pervasive bond fraud , such as the duplicate usage of home loans in multiple mortgage bonds , or at least improper certification of titles .
So solutions come to toss billion $ at the big banks , without solution , an assuredly failed Top - Down approach that appeals to Wall Street .
Also , on the small business front , the restructure of the Small Business lender & insurer CIT failed to produce any meaningful revitalization .
Its June debt restructure agreement with bond holders failed to stick .
It now seeks a $ 5 billion loan as debtor in possession .
A million businesses would be affected if CIT folded and was liquidated .
No national initiative has come to bring back US industry to the US shores .
No national initiative has come to retain businesses by means of reduced taxation and reduced regulatory burdens .
No national initiative has come to remove from power those responsible for Wall Street bond fraud .
No national initiative has come to even force a proper accounting to Wall Street firms or Fannie Mae or AIG .
No national initiative has come to conduct a true autopsy of Lehman Brothers .
No national initiative has come to force disclosure of the TARP fund distribution , or to reveal what the USFed does with its trillion $ of created money .
Without hesitation , one can claim that all attempts to shine light on the financial sector and its ivory towers have been obstructed .
FAILURE & DEFAULT ON THE HORIZON Going hand in hand with the destructive 0 % policy is the Hidden Monetization of USGovt Debt , clearly .
The zero rate encourages new asset bubbles , like the historically unprecedented spectacular USTreasury bubble .
USTBONDS MAKE THE FINAL BUBBLE .
The zero rate enables new carry trades with no cost .
The zero rate permits a private banker party to engage in their own corner carry trade , buying long - dated USTreasurys with free money while shorting the short - term USTBills .
This acts like a money machine for bankers to restore their balance sheets .
The only trouble is their balance sheets have a hemorrhage at work , with additional ongoing relentless credit portfolio losses .
The accounting fraud can only mask the problem , which happens to grow worse with each passing month .
With lost integrity from the 0 % rate comes disdain for the monetary system generally and for the USDollar specifically , along with other major currencies locked near 0 % also .
INVESTORS TURN TO GOLD AND SILVER , the proven sanctuary during crisis .
While the 0 % official rate creates problems much like those that erupted in a crisis , the monetization of debt issuance signals to the entire world to abandon the USDollar .
The monetization assures the death of the USDollar .
It is Weimar revisited , but with more military might and far more arrogance .
Monetization represents back - door devious measures to stave off the disaster of bond auction failures .
Monetization is a broken promise made to creditors , who must feel betrayed .
Monetization is a vast undermine to the validity , value , and very authenticity of a currency .
The government debt for the custodian to the global reserve currency is being monetized , thereby creating gigantic air pockets , and funding a carry trade .
The most dangerous asset bubble on the planet right now is the USTreasury .
It pays 0 % on short maturities .
What is next ?
The forced USGovt worker pension contribution to USTreasurys ?
How about a national movement to supply pension money into USTreasurys ?
With lost integrity from the monetization patterned schemes , comes fear of a repeated Weimar hyper-inflation episode .
INVESTORS TURN TO GOLD AND SILVER , the proven sanctuary during crisis .
What comes is the US bank system failure .
The endless rounds of bank credit portfolio losses dictate it .
The Stress Tests are soon to be discredited , less than one year after their farcical production .
The leading losers will be commercial mortgages , prime Option ARMortgages , and credit card losses .
Banks are not prepared , having inadequate Loan Loss Reserves , guarding their profits , denying their reserves , managing their stock prices .
They run continued portfolio risk .
They try to shove all their garbage assets on the USFed and to Fannie Mae under the USGovt roof , amidst the shrill cries of ‘ Too Big To Fail ’ nonsense .
A US bank system failure is coming .
With lost integrity from the banking system , insolvent in its own core , supplanted in function by the USFed itself , lending so little as to force declines in the consumer credit funds , comes distrust of financial institutions generally .
INVESTORS TURN TO GOLD AND SILVER , the proven sanctuary during crisis .
INDIVIDUAL NOTES
My personal preference is to invest in silver , but to use gold as the signal .
The rise in silver price will be 3 x to 5 x that of the gold rise , which itself will be significant .
Central banks sell no silver , and industry has almost no gold demand .
Let gold fight the political battles , to clear the path for precious metals to rise in price to the heavens .

Also , immediately they started this paperwork to give Tillman a silver star . "
First lady Michelle Obama told Denver students Monday that there is a sure - fire way to succeed : hard work , focus and confidence .
Speaking at a luncheon for high school girls at the governor ’s mansion and at a sit - down with students at South High School , Obama urged the teenagers to reach their potential , seek out mentors and be role models for kids younger than themselves .
“ Be at school .
Work hard .
And do n’t let anybody doubt you , ” she said .
“ I want each of you to think about what you ’re going to give back . ”
“ There ’s no way that I could have known at your age that I would be standing here as first lady .
What I did know was that I wanted to make my family and my community proud , ” she said .
The Princeton University graduate , in town for a day of mentoring , also let some of the students at South High School in on a secret :
She never performed “ great ” on standardized tests .
Straight A’s , student government , sports , teacher recommendations and her essays are what led her to the Ivy League .
But while Obama said she did n’t consider the tests a good indicator of future success , she told the students that they are “ part of the system ” and need to be taken seriously .
And she urged them to focus on the thing they have most control over : their grades .
“ Fundamentally , the difference between an A and a B oftentimes is in your own hands , ” she said , responding to a student ’s question about whether it was fair to use test scores as the measure of school performance when many kids ca n’t speak English .
“ So if you use what you have and you make the most of the opportunities that you have control over , then things like test scores do n’t have to completely throw you off , ” she said .
The first lady ’s visit to Denver was part of a mentoring program she launched Nov. 2 , when more than a dozen high school girls from the Washington , D.C. , area came to the White House and met with Obama and members of her staff .
Cabinet officials , scientists , actresses , politicians and an astronaut met with 80 high school girls at the governor ’s mansion for a lunch of butternut - squash soup and baked chicken .
The girls were chosen by their respective schools based on who the faculty thought might benefit the most from the experience .
Noting all the successful women in the room , the first lady told the girls that the women ’s achievements did not come easily .
“ For each of us , we ’ve all failed .
We ’ve all made mistakes , ” Obama told the girls .
“ What we did n’t do was let those mistakes shatter us and keep us from moving on to the next set of challenges . ”
Alex Pash , 16 , is on the tennis team at East High School and aspires to be a news broadcaster after college .
Seeing the first lady , she said , was a chance of a lifetime .
“ I just think she is incredible .
She has style and passion about what she ’s doing , ” Pash said .
After the luncheon , Obama visited South High School , and the group of mentors visited 10 other metro-area schools .
Media access at the schools ( the majority of which are public ) was limited to a handful of initial questions .
Reporters were then asked to leave as politicians and celebrities continued to speak with students .
Obama and about 30 students at South gathered their wooden chairs in a circle , and the first lady took questions .
One student asked her what was the most difficult part of being first lady .
“ You ’re always struggling with making sure that you ’re doing right by the country , but you ’re also doing right by your kids , ” Obama said , noting that she and the president always make sure they are available for their daughters , Malia , 11 , and Sasha , 8 .
“ That means when they have an event , it takes precedence over everything .
“ I want to make sure they come out of this as whole as possible . ”

We ’re All Biased — Learn from It
Last week I posted an article about whether younger “ digital natives ” or older “ digital immigrants ” are better at IT .
In responses I saw on Reddit or that I received directly , I noticed a pattern :
1 . A lot of people were disappointed ( to put it mildly ) that I did n’t draw a conclusion in favor of one group or the other .
They did n’t like the fact that I saw the issue as shades of gray rather than black and white .
2 . Some readers thought that the article was biased toward one group or the other .
Interestingly , the younger readers thought that the article was biased toward the digital natives .
And the older readers thought that the article was biased toward the digital immigrants .
One of the readers in particular thought that I had sold out to my bosses , saying
“ Do n’t bother reading .
It ’s basically ‘ I ca n’t pick between my peers and the fat cats that give me my paycheck . ' ”
In fact I run my own business , so I ’ve got no bosses to answer to .
And I ’m flattered that this reader seemed to think that I ’m a digital native , although in fact I ’m a digital immigrant ( an early one — I was an immigrant on the digital equivalent of the Mayflower ) .
Quite honestly , when I first had the idea for the article , my gut feel said that older digital immigrants are better at IT .
We ’ve got more experience under our belts , we understand the challenges of trying to change a business process that ’s been used so much that it ’s practically carved in stone , and we understand the complexities of large - scale fault - tolerant systems .
But I tried to look at the issue from the perspective of the things that the older generation is lacking , and that ’s when I started seeing all of the advantages that digital natives bring to the table .
As I started listing the advantages that digital natives offer , I began to realize that there are distinct advantages to a fresh viewpoint , and that maybe this new way to look at things will produce better systems and better business processes .
That ’s when I decided to change the conclusion of my article to point to a balance between the two points of view , and I ultimately ended the article on a positive note ( so I thought ) by optimistically pointing to new solutions coming from the younger generation .
But going back to the two patterns I observed in responses to the article , let me make a few observations :
1. Not Drawing a Conclusion
I ’m concerned that the world is viewing everything as too black and white .
To some degree I think this is a result of the current “ sound bite ” mentality in which things are always summed up in just a few words .
When we ’re overwhelmed with information it ’s easier for us to reduce all of the detail to a high - level summary .
But I think we do this too much , and as a result we lose track of the subtlety that the world offers .
It ’s like the pictures from the early digital cameras — the ones that only had a few pixels and very little ability to distinguish one color from another .
The photos from those cameras were a representation of reality , but it was an oversimplified reality , like looking at the world through half - closed eyes .
Oversimplification of information — boiling it down to sound bites — is an insult to natural human intelligence .
And it discards so much valuable data that it often gives us incorrect results .
2. A Biased Perception of Bias
Everyone is biased in one way or another .
We each see the world through the lens of our environment and our upbringing .
We ’re taught about the world in a biased way by our biased parents and teachers .
We do n’t see the bias , of course , since the bias is taught as the “ truth . ”
We gradually see the word “ bias ” as meaning “ the way that other people see things . ”
That ’s not honest , but it ’s natural .
We have to use something as a reference point by which other points of view are measured , and our natural bias becomes that reference point .
So it ’s not surprising that to a young digital native it ’s more important that a software application be mobile , interactive and intuitive than it is for the application to be fault - tolerant , scalable and consistent with good business processes .
And so in their eyes the skills to create mobile , interactive and intuitive applications must be more important to IT than the more mundane skills held by older IT veterans .
And it ’s also not surprising that to an older digital immigrant a different set of skills is more valued .
Again , the natural bias comes into play — both bias in upbringing and the bias that has developed from years of making mistakes , learning , and then doing things better .
Conclusion
To the younger digital natives who read this article : Please recognize that there ’s a lot more to IT than mobility and sexy user interfaces .
Do n’t so readily discount the experience of older IT workers .
They may not have your intuitive grasp of computer technology , and they may not relate to video games the way you do , but the digital immigrants have attained a lot of practical business systems experience that will take you years to understand .
See their value , and learn from them .
To the older digital immigrants who read this article : Please try to remember your own early days using computers .
Remember the excitement you once felt when you got a new technology to work for the first time ( however basic that technology might look today ) .
Remember the thrill of putting a system in place that actually improved the lives of business users .
Recognize that you were once headstrong and abrupt , and that you learned from your experience , just as these younger people will learn .
Where you see mistakes being made , try to teach .
But recognize the difference between a mistake and a different approach .
Not all differences are mistakes .
To both generations :
Be more open - minded , and try to understand the reason ( and inherent bias ) behind an unusual behavior .
We ’re in the middle of a knowledge transfer between digital immigrants and digital natives .
And that knowledge transfer is bi-directional , so each group needs to learn from the other .
Neither group is “ right ” and neither group is “ wrong ” — we ’re both biased , and we can each learn by seeing a point of view that ’s different from our own .
Blindness , Mad Cow Disease and Canola Oil
By John Thomas excerpt from :
Young again : How to Reverse the Aging Process
Millions of people have suffered the loss of their vision from glaucoma , a disease involving atrophy ( deterioration ) of the optic nerve .
For years , " experts " have been telling us that glaucoma results from fluid - pressure buildup in the eye that causes the optic nerve to deteriorate .
This theory was based on an incorrect medical model :
They were wrong !
Now , the experts have admitted that this is not true and have given birth to a new theory .
According to it , glaucoma is instead caused by a deficiency of oxygen and blood flow .
Finally they are on the right trail .
In the end , they will discover that glaucoma is the result of insufficient blood flow due to agglutination ( clumping together ) of the red blood cells and waste buildup in the cells and intercellular fluids .
These blood - corpuscle clusters cannot squeeze through the extremely tiny capillaries in the posterior of the eye , so cannot deliver oxygen to the mitochondria .
1
This is what the problem has been all along , and if people continue to eat soy and canola oils , a lot more of them are going to experience vision irregularities - like retinas and macula lutea degeneration .
Death of the mitochondria in the cells in the posterior of the eye is due to oxygen starvation , sodium toxicity and waste accumulation .
When the mitochondria die , the cells die and the posterior eye tissues atrophy .
In this respect , glaucoma has much in common with hair loss , Alzheimer 's disease , multiple sclerosis , cerebral palsy and hearing problems .
There are several things a person can do to reverse these debilitating conditions .
Biologically friendly water is basic to all rejuvenation , as is fresh , viable food .
Detoxification of the tissues and body fluids is accomplished with yucca extract , Kombucha tea , PACs and colon therapy .
Degradation of Vision
Loss of vision is a known , characteristic side effect of rape oil which antagonizes the central and peripheral nervous systems again like soy oil , again worse .
The deterioration takes years , however .
Rape ( canola ) oil causes emphysema respiratory distress , anemia , constipation , irritability and blindness in animals - and humans .
Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991 when it was thrown out .
You may remember reading about the cows , pigs and sheep that went blind , lost their minds , attacked people and had to be shot .
A woman called me from Chicago to tell me that she had been in England when the " Mad Cow Disease " had been at its peak .
She said that she had seen a television news report that told people not to panic if they had been using rape oil in their diet and were over 65 years of age .
The " experts " added that the effects of rape oil ingestion takes at least 10 years to manifest , and in all likelihood , most of these people would be dead by then anyway .
Comforting !
In the reports I read , the " experts " blamed the behavior on a viral disease called scrapie .
However , when rape oil was removed from animal feed , " scrapie disappeared .
No longer a European livestock problem ; now it is ours .
U.S. farmers grow rape seed , and manufacturers use its oil ( canola ) in thousands of processed foods , with the blessings of government watchdog agencies , of course .
Rape Seed Oil or " Canola " ?
Canola is a coined word .
It appeared out of nowhere and is not listed in any but the most recent reference sources .
The flip side of the canola coin reads : " rape " !
You must admit that canola sounds better than rape .
The name canola disguised the introduction of rape oil to America .
Canola oil comes from the rape seed , which is part of the mustard family of plants .
Rape is the most toxic of all food - oil plants .
Like soy , rape is a weed .
Insects will not eat it ; it is deadly poisonous !
Canola is a semi- drying oil that is used as lubricant , fuel , soap and synthetic rubber base , and as an illuminate for the slick color pages you see in magazines .
It is an industrial oil and does not belong in the body !
Canola oil has some very interesting characteristics and effects on living systems .
For example , it forms latex - like substances that agglutinate the red blood corpuscles , as does soy , but much more pronounced .
Officially , canola oil is known as " LEAR " oil
Officially , canola oil is known as " LEAR " oil - Low Erucic Acid , Rape .
Industry experts love to tell how canola was developed in Canada and that it is safe to use .
They admit it was developed from the rape seed , but that through genetic engineering , i.e. irradiation , it is no longer rape seed , but " canola " instead .
[ " Canadian oil " , get it ? ]
They love to talk about canola "s qualities - its unsaturated structure ( Omega 3 , 6 , 12 ) , its wonderful digestibility and its fatty acid makeup .
They turn us against naturally saturated oils and fats , while they come to the rescue with canola oil .
They even tell us how Asia has warmly embraced canola due to its distinctive flavor .
Is n't it wonderful how internationalists brokers " help " third - world peoples ?
Reminds me of the introduction of the microwave oven .
An earthly expression from the Old West sums up the flimflam accompanying rape oil "s rebirth and promotion worldwide : " horse shit and gun smoke ! "
Its new name provided the perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make billions in the United States .
The euphemism is still very much in use , but is no longer needed .
Look at the ingredients list on peanut butter labels .
The peanut oil has been removed and replaced with rape oil .
Chemical Warfare
Between 1950 and 1953 , white mustard ( rape ) seed was irradiated in Sweden to increase seed production and oil content .
Irradiation is the process the experts want use to make our food " safe " to eat .
Genetically engineered fruits and vegetables - which will soon have innocent things like hepatitis - B spliced into their DNA - are another example of man "s misuses of technology and abuse of public trust by powerful interests and " head - in - the - sand " watchdog agencies .
*8*
Canola oil contains large amounts of " isothiocyanates " - cyanide - containing compounds .
Cyanide inhibits mitochondrial production of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , which is the energy molecule that fuels the mitochondria .
ATP energy powers the body and keeps us healthy and young !
Canola Oil and Metabolism
Many substances can bind metabolic enzymes and block their activity in the body .
In biochemistry , theses substances are called inhibitors .
Toxic substances in canola and soy oils encourage the formation of molecules with covalent bonds which are normally irreversible :
They can not be broken by the body once they have formed .
For example , consider the pesticide malathion .
It binds to the active site of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase and stops this enzyme from doing its job , which is to divide acetylcholine into choline and acetate .
Nerve Function and Organophosphates
Acetylcholine is critical to nerve - impulse transmission .
When acetylcholinesterase is inhibited , as by pesticide residues , nerve fibers do not function normally , and muscles do not respond .
For example , think of a garage door opener :
If its signal is not received , the door does not open .
worth one "s body , the hand or leg is ordered to move , but does not respond .
Recently there has been a tremendous increase in disorders like systemic lupus , multiple sclerosis , cerebral palsy , " Myelinoma " * 10 * pulmonary hypertension and neuropathy .
Soy and canola oils are players in the outbreak of these disease conditions .
So are the organophosphates , insecticides such as malathion used in food production in the name of efficiency .
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors cause paralysis of the striated ) skeletal ) muscles and spasms of the respiratory system .
That is why malathion is the pesticide of choice by the experts ; it kills insects by paralysis - just like rotenone from soy beans does !
It inhibits the insect "s enzymes and those of humans , too !
Canola oil is an edible vegetable oil that can be used to control insects on a wide variety of crops .
The public Bamboozled ?
Agents Orange and Blue that were used in Viet Nam to defoliate jungle cover are also organ - ophosphorus compounds .
The Viet Nam vets and the Vietnamese people know about them firsthand .
Government experts who okayed their use and chemical companies that manufactured them have finally owned up to their toxic effects on people and the environment .
Nonetheless , present - day experts in academia and government continue to bamboozle the public with stories of " safe " science and cheap food through the use of poisons .
Canola oil is also high in glycosides that cause serious problems by blocking enzyme function and deprive us of our life force - - chi , qi , prana , call it what you like .
Glycosides interfere with the biochemistry of humans and animals .
Their presence in rattlesnake venom inhibits muscle enzymes and causes instant immobilization of the victim .
Canola Oil , HIV , and AIDS Soy and canola oil glycosides also depress the immune system - the T cells - to go into a stupor and fall asleep on the job .
These oils alter the bioelectric " terrain " and promote disease .
The Cancer / Trans - Fatty Acid Connection - Known in 1949 !
In orthodox cancer research , renowned cancer researchers , among them , Nobel Prize winner , V. Euler of Stockholm , wrote and published a book in 1949 in which they concluded that if the numerous and diverse symptoms associated with various types of cancer were reduced to one common denominator , it would be that " the fat lacks the ability to integrate in the living tissue " .
" Trans - Fatty acid is the name of the fat that lacks this ability - it is bad fat .
Non-Spoiling " , Spreadable " Oils Are Destroying Our Health
Since 1902 , Western countries have resorted to chemical process to destroy the " unsaturatedness " of vegetable oils .
It is done to make them easier to handle ; easier to market ; and to preserve them so they will not spoil so quickly .
In the early 1900s , clever advertisements hailed its " spreadability " - exclaiming that what everyone was waiting for was " a spreadable fat " !
Although the destruction of the essential elements of the fat was originally well intended - to prevent it from spoiling the methods of processing fats are destroying our health .
Avoid any vegetable oil that is labeled ' hydrogenated ' , or partially hydrogenated , as this oil contains 100 % Trans - fatty acid !
Why Are We Still Being " Sold " Trans - Fatty Acid ?
Food manufacturing is a big , profitable business and employs many highly skilled lobbyists .
The new U.S. labeling laws do not list " Trans - Fatty acid " because the large food manufacturers spent billions of dollars to pay for lobbyists to keep " Trans - fatty acid " off the labels .
" Cold Pressed " labeling means nothing in the U.S.
All commercial oils and nut butters sold in U.S. Supermarkets contain Trans - fatty acid this is because the U.S. government allows heat treated and high pressure squeezed vegetable oil to be used and even labeled " Cold Processed " .
The Italian government passed a law that olive oil must be protected from heat and high pressure .
The U.S. government could save many lives if it passed a similar law to include all vegetable oil ( and banned cotton seed oil - it is poison ) .
Figure The Amount of Trans - Fatty Acid In Packaged Food By Using The New U.S. Labels
Find the amount of " Total Fat " on the label .
Find the amounts of " Saturated Fat " , " Polyunsaturated Fat " and " Monosaturated Fat " .
( These are found on the label , listed directly under " Total Fat " and slightly indented .
If one or the other is not listed , that particular food does not contain it . )
Add theses three together .
If there are only two listed , add them together or use one amount if only one is listed .
Subtract the total amount of # 3 from the amount of # 1 .
This would be the answer is the amount of Trans - fatty Acid in that product .
Fats That Can Be Safely Heated
Butter and tropical fats - coconut , palm , palm kernel , cocoa , and shea nut - are safest for frying , because they contain only small quantities of Essential Fatty - Acids ( EFAs ) .
The saturated fatty acids contained in these fats / oils are inert and therefore heat stable .
Heat does not destroy them in the same way it destroys EFAs .
Butter and tropical Fats are best used unhydrogenated .
Only small amounts should be eaten , as they are sticky , hard , saturated fatty acid-containing fats .
Tropical oils got a bad reputation for increasing cholesterol and triglyceride levels that supposedly cause cardiovascular disease .
An unconfirmed rumor suggests that the soy bean industry financed the successful campaign against tropical fats to kill imports and increase soy bean sales .
Tropical oils used in their country of origin have been shown in several studies to decrease cholesterol levels .
The difference in results may be due to several causes : deterioration in tropical oils during storage , differing experimental design ; or a combination of the above .
Raw tropical oils are rich sources of vitamin E and tocotrienols , which help protect arteries from damage leading to cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .
Olive oil imported from Italy is safe for baking but not for frying or deep frying .
But only imported Italian olive oil as it is cold processed by law .
Liver and Gall Bladder Problems Improved
The metabolism of fat affects each and every organ .
Anyone with liver and gall bladder problems is quite aware of how fats affect them .
In medicine they say " Eat less fat " , because it was observed that fats do not agree with the sick person .
However , if this person with liver and gall bladder problems is given " good fat " , i.e. live , highly unsaturated fat , it will agree with him or her very well .
It is best to use the threefold unsaturated fat from flaxseed oil or hemp seed oil , together with a substance that makes it soluble ( mix it with plain , low fat cottage cheese or emulsify it with 2 or more ounces of low fat milk ) before you take it .
Many serious medical problems can be solved on the simple basis of taking flax seed oil or hemp seed oil and a sulfur containing protein .
Diseased organs react very favorably to this remedy .
( Ed. Note : Also Recommended : EPA capsules ( fish oil ) and Evening Primrose Oil capsules )
Alcohols and glycosidcs in canola and soy oils shut down our protective grid - the immune system .
Fluoride , immunizations , antibiotics and bio-junk food play a similar role in immune system collapse .
An alcohol is a chemistry term for the " reactive " chemical group on an organic molecule .
Those " R " groups are what make organic compounds work - for good and bad !
Canola alcohols and glycosides are very reactive .
They are as toxic as fermented alcohols , but their effects manifest differently .
The damage takes years to show up .
In a future article , I will discuss the sweet proteins in soy .
Hybrid or Genetically Engineered ?
Canola is a hybrid variety of rapeseed developed in Canada during the 1970s from traditional pedigree hybrid propagation techniques based on black mustard , leaf mustard , and turnip rapeseed .
It is true however , that some forms of rapeseed are genetically engineered .
Canola oil that is certified organic is from non-genetically altered seed .
Our own Whole Foods Market 365
Brand of canola oil is from non-genetically altered rapeseed .
The Truth About Genetically Modified Foods
When surveyed , the majority of consumers are not comfortable eating genetically engineered foods , but most people can't really explain specifically why they have concerns .
Watch this in depth look at the history of the GE debate .
This web movie covers every aspect of the issue , from health impacts , to pesticide use , to biotech industry cover-ups .
" Canola oil is a health hazard to use as a cooking oil or salad oil .
It is not the healthy oil we thought it was .
It is not fit for human consumption , do not eat canola oil , it can hurt you .
Polyunsaturated or not , this is a bad oil .
" The Wall Street JournaL June 7 , 1995 pB6 ( W ) pB6 ( E ) col1 ( 11 col in ) Compiled by Darleen Bradley .
Canola is now Confined to those Cultivars Brassica rapa and B. napus
" Traditional rapeseed is considered unsuitable as a source of food for either humans or animals due to the presence of two naturally occurring toxicants , erucic acid and glucosinolates .
Following intensive conventional plant breeding over a period of twenty years , canola is now confined to those cultivars ( Brassica rapa and B. napus ) that contain low levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates , so called “ double low ” varieties .
Quality control measures also stipulate that no protein is present in canola oil suitable for human consumption . "
The analyses were conducted on test material grown over multiple growing seasons and at different geographical locations and thus demonstrate that the genetic modifications have not resulted in any significant variation in composition or agricultural performance in the transformed lines when compared to the non-transformed control lines grown under the same conditions .
Detailed compositional analyses on the transformed seeds also showed no differences in the levels of natural toxicants .
In particular , the level of erucic acid in the oil ( and glucosinolates in the meal ) conformed to the compliance requirements for certification as canola .
The transformed lines were tested in a range of environmental situations and following treatment with commercial levels of glufosinate - ammonium .
The nutritional value of the transformed seeds was evaluated in two animal feeding studies using rabbits and broiler chickens .
In both instances , where the transformed canola seeds were included in the diets of the animals over a defined period , no adverse effects attributable to the test material were observed in the animals , and all animals displayed normal patterns of growth .
Conclusion
On the basis of the available evidence , oil derived from the genetically modified canola lines ( T45 , Topas 19/2 , Ms1 , Ms8 , Rf1 , Rf2 , Rf3 and their crosses ) , is equivalent to oil from non-GM canola in terms of its safety and nutritional properties .
Key toxicants -
Seeds from the original native oilseed rape plants naturally contain high levels of two toxins , erucic acid and glucosinolates , and prior to the mid 1950s , the extracted oil was used primarily for industrial purposes .
Erucic acid , a long chain fatty acid , is a natural constituent of the seed oil , while glucosinolates are confined to the seed meal with the majority of the protein and other seed components .
Excerpt from Holistic Health Encyclopedia
Rape seed oil ( Canola oil ) is widely used in thousands of processed foods ... with the blessings of our own government .
Canola oil was first developed in Canada .
It 's proponents claim that due to genetic engineering and irradiation , it is no longer rape oil , but " canola " ( Canadian oil ) .
They also claim it is completely safe , pointing to it 's unsaturated structure and digestibility .
Although , I could not verify it , it is claimed the Canadian government paid the FDA the sum of $ 50 million dollars to have canola oil placed on the GRAS list ( Generally Recognized As Safe ) .
However it was done , a new industry was created .
The truth is , however , that rape is the most toxic of all food oil plants .
Not even insects will eat it .
No wonder farmers like growing it .
Studies of canola oil done on rats indicate many problems .
Rats developed fatty degeneration of heart , kidney , adrenals and thyroid gland .
When the canola oil was withdrawn from their diet , the deposits dissolved , but scar tissue remained on the organs .
Why were no studies done on humans before the FDA placed it on the GRAS list ?
Consumed in food , Canola oil depresses the immune system , causing it to " go to sleep . "
Canola oil is high in glycosides which cause health problems by blocking ( inhibiting ) enzyme function .
It 's effects are accumulative , taking years to show up .
One possible effect of long term use is the destruction of the protective coating surrounding nerves called the mylin sheath .
When this protective sheath is gone , our nerves short - circuit causing erratic , uncontrollable movements .
Excerpts The Great Con-ola
by Sally Fallon and Mary G. Enig , PhD
Rapeseed oil was a monounsaturated oil that had been used extensively in many parts of the world , notably in China , Japan and India .
It contains almost 60 percent monounsaturated fatty acids ( compared to about 70 percent in olive oil ) .
Unfortunately , about two - thirds of the mono- unsaturated fatty acids in rapeseed oil are erucic acid , a 22 - carbon monounsaturated fatty acid that had been associated with Keshan ’s disease , characterized by fibrotic lesions of the heart .
In the late 1970s , using a technique of genetic manipulation involving seed splitting , 2 Canadian plant breeders came up with a variety of rapeseed that produced a monounsaturated oil low in 22 - carbon erucic acid and high in 18 - carbon oleic acid .
The new oil referred to as LEAR oil , for Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed , was slow to catch on in the US .
In 1986 , Cargill announced the sale of LEAR oil seed to US farmers and provided LEAR oil processing at its Riverside , North Dakota plant but prices dropped and farmers took a hit .

Marketing Lear Oil as a ' Healthy Alternative ' to Polyunsaturated Oils
Before LEAR oil could be promoted as a healthy alternative to polyunsaturated oils , it needed a new name .
Neither “ rape ” nor “ lear ” could be expected to invoke a healthy image for the new “ Cinderella ” crop .
In 1978 , the industry settled on “ canola , ” for “ Canadian oil , ” since most of the new rapeseed at that time was grown in Canada .
“ Canola ” also sounded like “ can do ” and “ payola , ” both positive phrases in marketing lingo .
However , the new name did not come into widespread use until the early 1990s .
An initial challenge for the Canola Council of Canada was the fact that rapeseed was never given GRAS ( Generally Recognized as Safe ) status by the US Food and Drug Administration .
A change in regulation would be necessary before canola could be marketed in the US.4
Just how this was done has not been revealed , but GRAS status was granted in 1985 , for which , it is rumored , the Canadian government spent $ 50 million to obtain .
Modern oil processing is a different thing entirely .
The oil is removed by a combination of high temperature mechanical pressing and solvent extraction .
Traces of the solvent ( usually hexane ) remain in the oil , even after considerable refining .
Like all modern vegetable oils , canola oil goes through the process of caustic refining , bleaching and degumming — all of which involve high temperatures or chemicals of questionable safety .
And because canola oil is high in omega - 3 fatty acids , which easily become rancid and foul - smelling when subjected to oxygen and high temperatures , it must be deodorized .
The standard deodorization process removes a large portion of the omega - 3 fatty acids by turning them into trans fatty acids .
Although the Canadian government lists the trans content of canola at a minimal 0.2 percent , research at the University of Florida at Gainesville , found trans levels as high as 4.6 percent in commercial liquid oil .
24
The consumer has no clue about the presence of trans fatty acids in canola oil because they are not listed on the label .
A large portion of canola oil used in processed food has been hardened through the hydrogenation process , which introduces levels of trans fatty acids into the final product as high as 40 percent .
25
In fact , canola oil hydrogenates beautifully , better than corn oil or soybean oil , because modern hydrogenation methods hydrogenate omega - 3 fatty acids preferentially and canola oil is very high in omega - 3s .
Higher levels of trans mean longer shelf life for processed foods , a crisper texture in cookies and crackers — and more dangers of chronic disease for the consumer .
CANOLA OIL : Deadly for the Human Body !
It is genetically engineered rapeseed
It has been shown to cause lung cancer ( Wall Street Journal : 6/7/95 )
Generally rapeseed has a cumulative effect , taking almost 10 years before symptoms begin to manifest .
It has a tendency to inhibit proper metabolism of foods and prohibits normal enzyme function .
Canola is a Trans Fatty Acid , which has shown to have direct link to cancer .
These Trans Fatty acids are labeled as a hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils .
Avoid all of them !
According to John Thomas ' book , Young Again , 12 years ago in England and Europe , rape seed was fed to cows , pigs and sheep who later went blind and began attacking people .
There were no further attacks after the rape seed was eliminated from the diet .
What 's Wrong with Partially Hydrogenated Oils ?
Beware of Canola Oil , Canola Oil is an Industrial Oil , Not Fit For Human Consumption
Unlike butter or virgin coconut oil , hydrogenated oils contain high levels of trans fats .
A trans fat is an otherwise normal fatty acid that has been " transmogrified " , by high - heat processing of a free oil .
The fatty acids can be double - linked , cross - linked , bond - shifted , twisted , or messed up in a variety of other ways .
Trans fats are poisons , just like arsenic or cyanide .
They interfere with the metabolic processes of life by taking the place of a natural substance that performs a critical function .
And that is the definition of a poison .
Your body has no defense against them , because they never even existed in our two billion years of evolution -- so we 've never had the need or the opportunity to evolve a defense against them .
Partially hydrogenated oils will not only kill you in the long term by producing diseases like multiple sclerosis and allergies that lead to arthritis , but in the meantime they will make you fat !
Canola oil from the rape seed , referred to as the Canadian oil because Canada is mainly responsible for it being marketed in the USA The Canadian government and industry paid our Federal Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
$ 50 million dollars to have canola oil placed on the ( GRAS ) List " Generally Recognized As Safe " .
Thus a new industry was created .
Laws were enacted affecting international trade , commerce , and traditional diets .
Studies with lab .
animals were disastrous .
Rats developed fatty degeneration of heart , kidney , adrenals , and thyroid gland .
When canola oil was withdrawn from their diets , the deposits dissolved but scar tissue remained on all vital organs .
No studies on humans were made before money was spent to promote Canola oil in the USA .
Adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) is a rare fatal degenerative disease caused by in a build up long - chain fatty acids ( c22 to c28 ) which destroys the myelin ( protective sheath ) of the nerves .
Canola oil is a very long chain fatty acid oil ( c22 ) .
Those who will defend canola oil say that the Chinese and Indians have used it for centuries with no effect , however it was in an unrefined form .
Be Careful of Canola
Refined canola oil , typically found in conventional food stores , is usually exposed to high temperatures , deodorizing and bleaching .
Its health - giving constituents are processed away , and its omega - 3s converted into the undesirable trans form .
Even " lightly refined " and " expeller pressed oils can be exposed to deodorizing , which may raise the oil temperature to a sizzling 450 °– 470 °F .

Defense Secretary Robert Gates has used powers granted to him by a controversial new law to block the court - ordered release of numerous photos of detainee abuse , government lawyers revealed in a court filing [ PDF ] Friday evening .
Gates ’ new authority comes from a law , signed by President Barack Obama last month , that gives the Secretary of Defense the power to rule that photos of detainees are exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act.
Gates ’ action on Friday was the first use of the new FOIA exemption since it passed Congress last month .
The photos in question are the subject of a years - long legal fight by the American Civil Liberties Union , which first filed a FOIA request for records pertaining to detainee treatment , rendition , and death in May of 2005 .
The case is currently being reviewed by the Supreme Court .
The administration first sought to change FOIA in June , shortly after deciding to contest a ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that ordered the photos ’ release .
The resulting bill , championed by Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , was specifically designed to nullify the effect of the appeals court ’s ruling .
Since the court had ruled that the photos could n’t be withheld under an existing FOIA exemption , the Obama administration simply asked Congress to carve out a new exemption .
Despite objections from liberal members of the House , Congress obliged .
The new exemption ’s requirements are stunningly lax .
In order to withhold the photos , Gates simply had to certify , as he did in the court filing , that “ public disclosure of these photographs would endanger citizens of the United States , members of the United States Armed Forces , or employees of the United States Government deployed outside the United States . ”
In other words , their release had to endanger someone , somewhere .
And in the unlikely event that Gates had to stretch the truth to make that certification , it would n’t matter , since there ’s no provision in the law that allows any court to review Gates ’ determination or rule on whether it was truthful .
This is n’t just a few photos .
Gates ’ block could apply to a far larger group of images than the 44 that are at issue in the ACLU ’s lawsuit .
“ The photographs include but are not limited to the 44 photographs ” in the suit , Gates wrote in his certification .
The extension of the ban beyond the 44 photos is the result of a flip - flop by the Obama administration .
The Obama administration had originally planned to comply with the appeals court ’s order to release the photos .
In April , Justice Department lawyers informed the ACLU in a letter [ PDF ] that the government planned to release the 44 photos and a “ substantial number ” of other images — over 2,000 , according to some reports .
But three weeks later , the administration changed course and decided to contest the appeals court ’s decision and pursue a legislative workaround .
Now it appears that Gates has blocked the release of a large number — perhaps all — of the extant photos depicting abuse during the period from September 11th until the end of the Bush administration .
The administration undoubtedly has its reasons for withholding the photos .
It ’s certainly possible that the release of more photos could help terrorist recruitment or further enrage anti-American sentiment abroad .
But make no mistake .
The new FOIA exemption that the Obama White House sought and obtained has one obvious result : shielding evidence of government lawbreaking , abuse , and torture under the Bush administration from public scrutiny .
So much for Obama ’s claim that “ transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency . ”
There ’s a name for what the Obama administration did on Friday .
It ’s called a coverup .

One of my favorite family vacations growing up was camping .
It ’s still one of my favorite activities .
Once a year , my son and I meet up with my parents , siblings and their families to enjoy the great outdoors .
Of course , as a kid , I had no idea the preparation that went into camping .
Now that I ’m a mom , though , I have a pretty good idea of what my parents went through .
I ’m grateful they were willing to do it two or three times a year .
As I thought about the last couple of camping trips with my son , I thought of a few commonsense ideas for camping with kids that I think are worth sharing .
Tips to make camping with kids a little easier
Whether you are roughing it for real , or taking things a little bit easier in the outdoors , there are a few things that can make the whole experience a little more fun for the kids .
Start closer to home :
This is especially important when you have younger kids .
You do n’t want the camping trip to be ruined by an exhausting drive .
Look for campgrounds closer to home , then gradually branch out as your kids become more excited about camping — and as they get old enough to amuse themselves for longer in the car .

Look for campgrounds closer to home , then gradually branch out as your kids become more excited about camping — and as they get old enough to amuse themselves for longer in the car .
Consider campgrounds with running water :
This year , we had a campground with running water and flush toilets .
Sure , it was n’t exactly the “ wilderness ” , but my two - year - old niece was much happier without being attacked by mosquitoes while trying to use the loo ( like she was last year ) .
Additionally , the fact that the bathrooms were lighted made it easier for my son to find his way in the dark .
If you do n’t have running water , make sure that you have plenty of sanitary wipes and gel .
Consider bringing a large cooler ( with spout ) full of water .
Hang soap in one of those nylon holders underneath to give the kids a place to do a little washing .

Flashlights :
Let each of your children have his or her own flashlight .
My son has a cheap Cars - themed flashlight that he uses .
It does n’t need to be fancy ; it just needs to light the way .
Glowsticks can also be a cheap way for children to have a little light .

Backpacks : School backpacks can be great for camping .
Let your children keep snacks and water ( get each of them their own small water bottle ) , as well activities — books , travel games , coloring , a few small toys , etc. — inside a pack .
This also provides them with activities for in the car .
Tents :
When your children are old enough , consider letting them sleep in a different tent from you .
My son slept with one of his cousins in their own tent this year .
It was a big hit .
I know they did n’t get to sleep until late , but they were reasonably quiet , and they amused each other in the morning , allowing me to get a little more sleep .

Safety :
You want your children to be safe .
For very young kids , a playpen that can be set up near you can keep them contained .
Older children can understand and obey rules of the camp .
Make sure you tell them fire safety rules , and tell them not to go outside the boundaries of your campsite without first asking permission .
For children under the age of nine , it ’s best if you can see them most of the time .
Issue a whistle to each of your children to wear around their necks .
Tell them to blow it only if they are lost .
This way , you can come find them .

Outdoor activities :
There are a number of activities that you can do with your children .
We like to choose a campsite near fishing , so that we can spend a morning attempting to catch fish ( four - inch brook trout this year ) .
Make sure that you have a license , though , if you decide to take your child fishing .
Many states require that adults have licenses while they help their children .
We also like to go swimming in the lake or find someplace near good wading .
I bring an inner - tube for my son to float on .
This year , my son and I also did some stargazing .
Bring a star chart and look for constellations .
You can make bug boxes and help your children catch different specimens .
Create a “ camping journal ” and encourage them to tape in leaves , flowers and other items of interest .
You can also have them bring disposable cameras , and add their photos to the camping journal .
For the most part , you want to make sure that there is plenty of food , and that there are activities for your children .
You also want to keep an eye them .
I taught my son how to build a fire this year .
But I did n’t let him wave his flaming “ torch ” around .
In the end , it ’s about common sense and being involved .

BAGHDAD 
Two synchronized suicide car bombings struck at the heart of the Iraqi government here on Sunday , severely damaging the Justice Ministry and provincial council complexes , leaving a scene of carnage that raised new questions about the government ’s ability to secure its most vital operations .
The bombers apparently passed through multiple security checkpoints before detonating their vehicles within a minute of each other , leaving at least 155 dead and about 500 wounded strewn across crowded downtown streets .
Blast walls had been moved back off the road in front of both buildings in recent weeks .
It was the deadliest coordinated attack in Iraq since the summer of 2007 and happened just blocks from where car bombers killed at least 122 people at the Foreign and Finance Ministries in August , in the continuation of a focused attempt by insurgents to strike at the government ’s most critical functions .
For months , Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , who is seeking another term as Iraq prepares to hold national elections in January , has painstakingly tried to present Iraq as having turned a corner on the violence that threatened to tear the country apart in 2006 and 2007 .
" Christian piety recommends a visit to the cemetery to pray for them and for the families who experience the pain of human separation .

Saturday , September 12 , 2009
The Calabasas , California private elementary school New Village Leadership Academy ( NVLA ) opened its 2009 – 10 school year this week amid controversy over its connections to Scientology .
The school was founded by celebrity couple Will Smith and Jada Pinkett - Smith , who paid about US $ 1 million to lease the facility in 2008 .
Former head of school Jacqueline Olivier was removed from her job in July , and replaced by Piano Foster , an individual who has taken Scientology courses at the organization 's Celebrity Centre .
Smith and Pinkett - Smith are good friends with Scientologists Katie Holmes and her husband Tom Cruise .
In 2006 , Smith acknowledged to World Entertainment News Network that he had discussed Scientology with Cruise : " I 've talked to Tom about it .
[ There ’s ] lots of incredible , wonderful concepts but Jada and I do n't necessarily believe in organized religion . "
ABC
News reported that 2008 tax returns for the Smiths show they gave $ 122,500 to organizations with ties to the Church of Scientology .
" All I can say is it is not a Scientology school . "
— Jada Pinkett - Smith
In an interview with Ebony , Pinkett - Smith denied the school was affiliated with Scientology : " All I can say is it is not a Scientology school .
Now ,
If you do n't trust me , and you are questioning my integrity , that 's a whole different matter .
That is straight evil to think I would bring families into that educational institution and then try to get them to convert into some religion , " she said .
According to New York Daily News , the school is registered with the government of California as " non-religious " .
The school utilizes a teaching methodology called Study Technology , which was developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard .
Study Technology is promoted through Applied Scholastics , a Scientology - associated organization founded in 1972 .
" Study Technology is a secular methodology intended to help students better understand what is being studied and apply it to real life , " said Pinkett - Smith in an email to ABCnews.com .
Karin Pouw , an official with the Church of Scientology , was contacted by ABC News but did not comment on a possible affiliation between NVLA and Scientology , instead referring questions back to the school itself .
New York Daily News cited Radar Online in reporting that former head of school Olivier was fired from her position because she had issues with the Study Tech teaching methodology used in the school .
According to The Sydney Morning Herald , Olivier was removed from her $ 200,000 position with the school because she reportedly did not agree with portions of the school 's curriculum which were developed by L. Ron Hubbard .
" What they seem to have is some sort of a hybrid .
Scientology repackaged for the Hollywood crowd . "
— Professor David S. Touretzky
Carnegie Mellon University computer science Professor David S. Touretzky , described by ABC News as " the most ardent critic of Study Technology " , spoke with ABCNews.com about his thoughts on Scientology connections with the school : " What they seem to have is some sort of a hybrid .
Scientology repackaged for the Hollywood crowd .
It 's hitting all the politically correct elements ... but snuck in there is this Scientology stuff . "
Professor Touretzky operates a web site which analyzes Study Tech and argues that it is actually a form of Scientology masked as an educational method .
In a February 2008 interview with Wikinews , Professor Touretzky mused that recent criticism of Scientology on the Internet might prove to " warn off Hollywood celebs from cozying up to the cult " , including Will Smith .
Executive director of the California Association of Independent Schools , Jim McManus , was also critical of L. Ron Hubbard 's methodology , stating : " I look at the Study Tech ideas and it does n't seem sound educationally . "
University of Virginia psychology professor Dan Willingham , author of Why Don't Students Like School , asserted to ABC News that the methodology is flawed : " It 's perfectly possible that the methodology is based on ridiculous principles and that something effective is happening in the classroom , but ridiculous principles certainly lowers that possibility . "
" This revenue stream is one of the many sources of income which the Church of Scientology uses for such tactics as invoking frivolous lawsuits and hiring private investigators to intimidate critics . "
— Project Chanology press release
Members of the Internet - based group critical of Scientology , Project Chanology , were present at the school 's 2009 opening to protest what they called a " front " of the Church of Scientology .
A 2008 press release by Project Chanology was critical of what it referred to as the revenue the Church of Scientology receives from licensing fees schools pay the organization for utilizing the Study Tech teaching methodology .
" This revenue stream is one of the many sources of income which the Church of Scientology uses for such tactics as invoking frivolous lawsuits and hiring private investigators to intimidate critics , " said the press release .
According to the web site TruthAboutScientology.com , which publishes data compiled from Scientology magazines Freewinds , Celebrity and Auditor , multiple individuals in management roles at NVLA have attended Scientology classes .
In addition to the newly installed head of school , Piano Foster , the school 's director of learning Tasia Jones and its artistic director Sisu Raiken have both received Scientology course training .
" I officially took over on July 1 , 2009 , and I 'm looking forward to the challenge .
I 've been working in education for the past 20 years at various public and charter schools so I feel I 'm ready for the job , " said Foster of her new position at NVLA .

Breathing carbon dioxide can trigger panic attacks , but the biological reason for this effect has not been understood .
A new study by University of Iowa researchers shows that carbon dioxide increases brain acidity , which in turn activates a brain protein that plays an important role in fear and anxiety behavior .
The study , published in the Nov. 25 issue of the journal Cell , offers new possibilities for understanding the biological basis of panic and anxiety disorders in general and may suggest new approaches for treating these conditions .
The researchers focused on a brain protein known as acid-sensing ion channel 1a ( ASIC1a ) .
This protein is abundant in the amygdala -- the region deep in the brain that processes fear signals and directs fear behavior .
The UI team previously found that blocking or removing ASIC1a reduces innate fear and alters fear memory in mice .
" As long ago as 1918 , scientists learned that carbon dioxide triggers abnormal responses in patients with anxiety disorders , but our study provides the first molecular evidence for a mechanism that explains how carbon dioxide can trigger fear and anxiety , " said John Wemmie , M.D. , Ph.D. , associate professor of psychiatry and neurosurgery at the UI Carver College of Medicine and a staff physician and researcher at the Iowa City Veterans Affairs Medical Center .
" The findings are a foundation for saying that ASIC proteins in the amygdala might play a key role in sensitivity to carbon dioxide . "
In addition to helping explain why breathing carbon dioxide can trigger panic attacks , the study also suggests a new role for the amygdala as a sensor that can detect certain fear signals for itself .
" This is a new finding that the amygdala , which is considered the brain 's computer processor for fear , can also function as a sensor for detecting chemical signals -- carbon dioxide and acidity ( low pH ) -- that are known to trigger panic attacks in susceptible individuals , " Wemmie said .
Carbon dioxide inhalation can be deadly at high doses .
The study suggests that evolution may have provided humans with a vital ability to detect and respond rapidly to carbon dioxide by placing within the same brain region the ability to detect the threat posed by carbon dioxide and the ability to initiate a " fight or flight " response .
The new study shows that inhaled carbon dioxide increases brain acidity and evokes fear behavior in mice by activating ASIC1a in the amygdala .
Fear memory is also enhanced when carbon dioxide activates the protein .
Conversely , the study team , including first author Adam Ziemann , M.D. , Ph.D. , found that making brain tissue less acidic ( raising brain pH ) blunted fear behavior produced by carbon dioxide and reduced learned fear .
" It 's been suggested that controlling breathing with breath exercises could have anti-anxiety effects , " Wemmie said .
" Our results make me wonder if some of those breath exercises to control fear and anxiety might be acting by inhibiting the ASIC channels in the amygdala by raising the pH . "
Wemmie and his colleagues are now investigating whether ASIC1a abnormalities contribute to panic and anxiety disorder in people or to carbon dioxide sensitivity in patients with panic disorder .
If ASIC1a plays the same role in people as the studies suggest it does in mice , then drugs that target ASIC channels or strategies that alter brain acidity could hold promise for treating a wide range of panic and anxiety disorders .

Was it really only less than two years ago that I shifted from my venerable Planner - based wiki / blog to my WordPress - powered one after experimenting with syndicating my entries into WordPress ?
I miss writing in wiki markup on Emacs and knowing that publishing would Just Work .
I miss being able to dynamically expand entries from my address book in a way that automatically links to people ’s blogs .
( Or Twitter accounts , if I were going to do this now . )
ScribeFire is a pain on my Eee ( needs more horizontal screen space ) , and I have a hard time marking up the occasional bit of HTML in weblogger.el .
Windows Live Writer is pretty slick ( particularly with the SnagIt Screen Capture plugin and the Amazon Book Linker ) , but I can live without it .
Or maybe I can resurrect that WordPress Emacs client Ashish mentioned .
Let me think about the differences in experiences .
I wanted to support comments , but I did n’t want to spend a lot of time hacking on some custom commenting system .
This was a big issue for me .
I found some commenting scripts , but dealing with spam was a pain , so I switched to WordPress .
If I switched back to Emacs for my blog , I ’d probably use something like Disqus to handle the conversation , and just find some way of backing up the comments regularly .

I wanted to make it easy to navigate posts .
I modified Planner to generate a more browsable blog index , but it ’s still not as slick as what you ’d see with WordPress .
On this WordPress blog , I like offering people random blog posts ( good for me too – great way to rediscover old posts and make serendipitous connections ! ) , related posts , and posts on the same day .
I can do posts on the same day in Planner with a custom hook , but the others would require some hacking .
Also , Planner is very much day - based , while WordPress lists N posts per page and has good category lists .

Scheduling posts is handy , too .
I had n’t gotten around to figuring out how to build a post scheduler for Emacs .
I suppose if I was n’t picky about the time it went out , I could simply write posts on different days and then publish notes conditionally , plus have some kind of hook to notice if any of the current page ’s posts should be published in the RSS feed , plus some way to handle previous days , plus maybe a server - friendly way to do this for the times when I ’m not going to be online every day .
Right .
That said , I miss automatically sharing some details of what I ’m working on ( with details deleted before publishing so that they ’re available offline ) , publicly crossing off tasks , and other cool things .
Planner ’s model for task planning is n’t quite compatible with Org ’s model , and I ’ve been using Org +
Toodledo more these days .
What am I really looking for here ?
A quick , reliable way to post from a text editor , so that I can do it from the Eee .
Hmm , the WP Postie plugin will probably do the trick .
Easy way to share / review tasks : Toodledo export of week ’s tasks ?
And maybe a custom plugin for weekly displays , org agendas , that sort of thing .
Hmm ….

A university report has claimed that while men welcomed a male contraceptive pill , women said their partners could not be trusted to take one regularly .
A Teesside University team questioned 380 people about their attitude to the male pill , which is still under test .
Judith Eberhardt , who led the team , is urging companies to make the pill in many forms to allay women 's fears .
She said a male pill could be supplied as an implant or an injection , which would remove the need to take it daily .
Individual needs Writing in the Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care , Ms Eberhardt said : " Once the male pill is widely available , promotional campaigns could target not only men but also their female partners , as the latter tend to come into contact with health services more frequently .
" In order to increase confidence in effective implementation , a variety of presentations of the male pill should be made available in line with individual needs and lifestyles . "
She told BBC News that men , particularly in the north east , were often reluctant to discuss health matters and women were afraid their male partners would forget to take the pill regularly .
Her study also revealed that men in stable sexual relationships were more positive about the male pill than those in casual sexual relationships .
" A positive attitude towards the male pill does not automatically imply that the individual is confident about its effective use , " she said .
The survey , carried out last year , was conducted among students and people questioned at random .

Red Hat has filed an amicus curiae brief in a major Supreme Court case .
In the brief , Red Hat makes a strong case against software patents , arguing that the legal reasoning that led to software patents was flawed and that the pending Bilski case provides the Supreme Court with an important opportunity to rectify this long - standing problem with the patent system .
The Bilski case , which we have been following closely during its ascent through the courts , is a dispute that specifically relates to patents on methods for commodities trading .
The case has raised new questions about the legitimacy of business methods patents and the basis on which such patents are granted .
The outcome of the case could have a particularly significant impact on the software industry if the Supreme Court uses Bilski to redefine the boundaries of patentability in a way that excludes software .
Patent law expressly forbids patents on algorithms and mathematical truths , but that has n't stopped software companies from using loopholes in patent law to obtain patents on extremely broad software concepts .
Red
Hat argues that the proliferation of such patents is extremely detrimental to innovation because it creates an enormous amount of litigation risk for companies that want to develop software products .
Indeed , entire areas of technical research have become bogged down by complex patent issues .
Even video encoding formats that are thought to be unencumbered by patents , for example , are rejected by major industry players due to the lack of absolute certainty .
" Far from encouraging innovation , this proliferation of patents has seriously encumbered innovation in the software industry .
Software is an abstract technology , and translating software functions into patent language generally results in patents with vague and uncertain boundaries , " wrote Red Hat VP Rob Tiller in the brief .
" Under the Federal Circuit 's previous erroneous approach , the risk of going forward with a new software product now always entails an unavoidable risk of a lawsuit that may cost many millions of dollars in legal fees , as well as actual damages , treble damages , and an injunction that terminates a business .
Only those with an unusually high tolerance for risk will participate in such a market . "
Although most companies and many lawmakers acknowledge that some kind of patent reform is needed , there is significant disagreement about how the issue should be approached .
Congressional efforts have fallen short , which means that intervention by the courts could play a critical role in delivering much - needed fixes .
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Bilski last year .
The court dealt a significant blow to business methods patents , but declined to provide specific guidance on whether software patents would be regarded as acceptable under the new rules .
It is hoped that the Supreme Court will bring clarity to the issue with an unambiguous and authoritative ruling .

Nichols Hills doctor said ' he's got the devil in him ' during fatal assault on son , police report
NICHOLS HILLS -
The doctor accused of fatally stabbing his son Monday repeatedly said his son had " the devil in him , " police reported today in a court arrest affidavit .
Stephen P. Wolf , 51 , tried to stab his son again even after a police officer broke up the assault in the kitchen of the home at 1715 Elmhurst Ave. , according to the arrest affidavit .
Wolf is in the Oklahoma County jail .
His son , Tommy , was 9 .
The doctor has a history of mental issues that included hospital stays for depression .
He saw a psychotherapist in the 1980s while in medical school and was under the care of a psychiatrist in 1996 , his medical records show .
President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE on Friday came to the aid of embattled Sen. Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn . ) not long after a House committee made it clear that Dodd 's ethical problems are not behind him .
Even though Dodd was largely exonerated by a Senate ethics investigation into any " sweetheart " deals he might have made with Countrywide Financial , the House ethics committee voted Friday to issue subpoenas to continue to the investigation .
ADVERTISEMENT
That news came Friday afternoon as Dodd was joined in Connecticut by the president to tour a small business before Obama raised roughly $ 1 million for the senator and onetime presidential candidate .
The funds raised for the dinner at $ 1,000 a ticket will be divided between Dodd 's reelection effort , the Connecticut Democratic Party and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ( DSCC ) .
Both Connecticut and national Republicans made it clear last week that they smell blood in the water when it comes to Dodd 's reelection effort , but Democrats insist that they are far from worried .
The House Ethics Committee 's decision , aided by Democrats , hit Dodd and Obama at a terrible time Friday afternoon , prompting a reponse from Senate opponent and former Rep. Rob Simmons ( R - Conn . ) in the " Despite Sen .
Dodd 's wishful thinking that the ' matter 's behind us , ' the real corruption investigation has yet to begin , " Simmons said .
" Rather than raising a million dollars to help Sen .
Dodd polish his tarnished image , President Obama should be using his visit to Connecticut to fulfill his campaign promise to promote transparency and ethics in government by speaking out in support of his fellow Democrats ' efforts to get to the bottom of Dodd 's role in the Countrywide scandal .
" Connecticut Republican Party Chairman Chris Healy acknowledged that Obama , as the Democratic Party 's top fundraiser , should provide Dodd with " a good payday . "
" He 's going to need it , " Healy told reporters Friday .
" But I think in the end , it will be all for naught .
" Dodd 's reelection hopes are still struggling from a series of missteps earlier this year .
Dodd allowed a provision in the stimulus that allowed for large CEO bonuses and is also dealing with some personal ethical issues including an alleged sweetheart loan and a questionable property purchase in Ireland .
Republicans have lined up to face the incumbent and are flooding the race with money .
Simmons and investment advisor Peter Schiff both outraised Dodd's $ 900,000 in the third quarter , while former WWE CEO Linda McMahon has self - funded $ 3 million for the race , including a $ 100,000 ad buy Friday alone .
Healy said the crowded field is a " good problem to have , " but many think a crowded primary combined with Obama 's help and Dodd 's recent legislative victories spell good news for the Democrats .
“ Republicans face a brutal primary in Connecticut that is emblematic of battles they have all over the country , " DSCC spokesman Eric Schultz said .
" As their candidates are at each other 's throats , Chris Dodd will continue to build on his strong record of working with the president to get this economy back on track and deliver for the people of Connecticut .
” In Connecticut on Friday night , Obama praised Dodd for his work , equating him to the Energizer Bunny for all the work he has done in the Senate this year .
Dodd won high praise from the White House -- where he has made repeated appearances with Obama -- for his help in shepherding a healthcare bill in the absence of the late Sen.
Edward Kennedy ( D - Mass. ) , a close friend of Dodd 's and a huge ally of Obama's .
Obama on Friday night also praised Dodd for his work on new financial regulations and new laws regulating the credit card and tobacco industries .
Dodd , who is facing abysmal polling numbers and potentially dangerous ethical problems , has stayed close to Obama , who continues to enjoy immense popularity in Connecticut .
Dodd even joined the president for a fundraiser in Los Angeles in late May .
There ’s no doubt that Dodd needs all of the help that he can get in his uphill battle for re-election , but his poor approval ratings are evidence that Connecticut voters wo n’t so easily forget his abundant ethical shortcomings or his role in the economic crisis that our nation is suffering through today , " said Amber Wilkerson Marchand , spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) .
Healy said he gives credit to Dodd for being in a position to enlist the help of the White House and the head of the Democratic Party because he has been a " loyal foot soldier " for the Democrats .
" I think Chris Dodd will have all the money he wants , needs , desires , " Healy said .
But Healy said that unemployment numbers -- the rate in Connecticut is 8.6 percent , more than a point below the national rate -- will hurt Obama , Dodd and the Democratic brand .
" This economy is owned lock , stock and barrel by President Obama and Chris Dodd , " Healy said .

The " Man On The Moon " Photo 5903  Probably the most famous and most widely recognized photograph ever taken .
Photo 5903 ( original ISD scan , cropped ) 
This scan is the original ISD scan made from the actual Ektachrome transparency shot by Armstrong on the moon .
Photo 5903 ( cropped , noise removed , color balanced , lens vignetting removed ) 
The famous " Man On The Moon " photo of Aldrin .
This is one photo where I removed the Biogon 60 mm F / 5.6 lens 's inherent vignetting in order to show that the lunar surface was evenly illuminated by the sun .
This photo is as close to a true view of what Armstrong saw , in terms of color , brightness and contrast , when he photographed Aldrin .
Be sure to look closely at Aldrin 's watch in the full resolution photo version and note that the watch shows 11:14 PM CDT .
Aldrin had his watch set to Houston Texas CDT since this was the time used by mission control .
Thus photo 5903 was taken at 11:14 PM CDT on July 20 , 1969 , or 04:14 AM UT on July 21 , 1969 .
NASA 's Apollo Lunar Surface Journal says that the photo was taken within 5 minutes of the time shown on Aldrin 's watch .
The brighter patch behind Aldrin definitely was caused by the LM 's descent engine .
See enhanced versions of photos 5902 above , 5963 and 5964 further below , which show the same bright descent engine blast pattern .
In any event , technically this photo is perfectly exposed since the brightest portions of Aldrin 's suit just come close to reaching fully saturation and since there still are extremely faint details present in the deep shadow areas .
I am still working on calculating the perspective distortion for photo 5903 since Armstrong tilted the Hasselblad camera with its 60 mm Biogon lens approximately 20 degrees down relative to the horizon in order to take photo 5903 .
A lot of that tilt was due to the natural " lean forward " stance position needed to counter the weight of the personal life support system ( PLSS ) backpack .
Armstrong also had the presence of mind to rotate the camera clockwise since he figured that if he did n't , then the sun 's glare would be in the upper right of the frame and would completely wash out the photo .
He probably also figured on getting a fair amount of the extremely bright gold colored Mylar covered landing pad and strut out of the photo as well .
Or perhaps Armstrong just got lucky when he took this photo !
Aldrin admits that Armstrong was a far better photographer than he was .
This likely is why the majority of the Apollo 11 EVA photos were taken by Armstrong .
Armstrong also had an uncanny knack for getting the exposures right .
In all of his photos the brightest whites in the scenes come really close yet do n't oversaturate the film .
Apparently Armstrong took his assignment really seriously when NASA told the astronauts to take the camera equipment home with them and shoot tons of photos in order to gain experience using the camera gear .
How high was the sun above the horizon when photo 5903 was taken ? 
At the Apollo 11 landing site on July 21 , 1969 at 04:14UT when this photo was taken , the sun was at an altitude of approximately 14.75 degrees above the horizon .
The screen shot at left is from a program called Celestia .
It is a view from the Apollo 11 landing site on the lunar surface on July 21 , 1969 at 04:14UT .
Photo 5903 with lognormal curves applied 
This version of the above famous 5903 photo should dispel all Apollo hoax conspiracy claims that a second light source was present in the photo .
As you can clearly see , the only illumination of Aldrin is the sun itself , the gold and bronze colored Mylar covering the LM struts and descent stage , the moon surface itself , and reflections off of Armstrong 's white space suit .
Not convinced ?
Examine the close - up views of Aldrin 's visor reflection , further below , to see all of the bright objects which illuminated the shadow side of Aldrin 's spacesuit .
Portrait of Buzz Aldrin or an annotated version 
A close - up of Aldrin taken from the above photo .
The background was slightly darkened to remove glare caused by the sun and make the sky black .
Visor close - up from photo 5903 
Here I have removed the visor 's gold tint and rotated the view to make the horizon horizontal .
Note that the apparent visible phase of the Earth is misleading since the Earth 's reflection from near the edge of the visor is greatly distorted by the spherically shaped visor .
If you look closely at the image , it appears that the Biogon lens has some slight inherent on - axis astigmatism .
This instead may have been caused by Armstrong not holding the camera quite steady enough for the given the exposure time , or by Aldrin slightly moving during the exposure .
Mirrored , strongly enhanced and labeled visor close - up from photo 5903 
This particular image is extremely important due to what image information is truly shown in the reflection off of Aldrin 's visor .
This photo is mirrored compared to the above photo in order to show what Aldrin saw through his visor .
First , note that the Earth is offset to the right at a 13.9 degree angle relative to the camera and vertical .
Second , this image allows us to determine exactly where Aldrin was standing relative to the LM , based on his position relative to the horizontally bent +Y pad landing probe , based on the reflected perspective for the upper support struts for the +Y main strut , and based on how much of the nearer upper - Z strut which is visible and not occluded by the side of the LM descent stage .
I have drawn in burgundy colored lines from the bases of various objects in order to establish the vanishing point for all of the shadows .
I also circled the flag 's shadow in burgundy .
It is obvious that the ground upon which the LM was sitting sloped up towards the western horizon since the vanishing point for the shadows is above the horizon .
In particular , also note where the shadow of the top of the LM and Dish antenna hit the ground just to the right of Armstrong 's elbow .
The fact that the top of the LM 's shadow is foreshortened also indicates that the ground further west from the LM progressively slopes up further away from the LM .
Another indication that the ground slopes up towards the west horizon is provided by the length of Aldrin 's shadow .
Since the sun was at an altitude of 14.8 degrees when this photo was taken , we can calculate that Aldrin 's shadow should have been nearly 25 feet long , assuming that the space suits were 6 - 1 / 2 feet tall .
Thus the end of Aldrin 's shadow , if the ground surrounding the LM and under the LM was level , should have fallen further back from the base of the solar wind particle collector pole if the ground was perfectly level .
Photo 5903 ( Aldrin 's Visor View , distortion corrected ) 
My processed and distortion corrected view of the reflection in Aldrin 's visor in the above 5903 photo .
I have mirrored this image left - to - right in order to show what Aldrin saw from inside his visor when Armstrong shot the famous 5903 " Man On The Moon " photo .
Yes , that is indeed the Earth above and somewhat to the right of Armstrong .
You can also see that Armstrong had his gold colored visor pulled down when he shot the famous 5903 photo of Aldrin .
So , just where was the Earth in the moon 's sky above Aldrin 's head ?
 Celestia gives us this answer .
The Earth was at an altitude of almost exactly 59 degrees above the western lunar horizon on a bearing of 273 degrees along the western lunar horizon .
The real kicker is when you compare a close - up of Celestia 's representation of the Earth and its phase to the close - up of the Earth in photo 5924 further below .
Armstrong - Aldrin position angle ( bearing ) at which 5903 was taken 
This is only a preliminary result which assumes that the west lunar horizon , although elevated , is level .
It probably was not .
In order to figure out the bearing , you have to mentally draw a line from the camera on Armstrong 's chest to its reflection off of Aldrin 's spherically shaped visor .
You also have to realize that the exact point on the surface of Aldrin 's visor is the point on the visor which is closest to the camera .
Eventually I will create a CAD model to visually show this concept .
In any event , assuming that the west horizon was level and based on the above measured position angle of the Earth in the visor sky ( an angle of 13.9 degrees ) , I zoomed out as far as I could in Celestia and through several iterations of tweaking the direction along the horizon at which I was looking , I found that a bearing of 248 degrees produces the correct 13.9 degree offset for the Earth relative to the zenith .
Thus Aldrin was standing on a bearing , relative to Armstrong 's position , of 68 degrees east relative to lunar north , and of course Armstrong was standing on a bearing of 248 degrees relative to Aldrin .
Exact sun altitude and azimuth when 5903 was taken 
As you can see , the sun was on a bearing of approximately 88.87 degrees relative to lunar north .
The sun 's altitude was approximately 14.78 degrees .
Call the azimuth 89 degrees .
89 degrees minus 68 degrees is 21 degrees .
Thus , assuming that the west lunar horizon was level , photo 5903 was taken at a bearing of 21 degrees northward from the sun 's position in the sky above the eastern lunar horizon .
It ’s that time of year when Adobe gets set and makes some huge announcements for its future plans , partnerships and products .
With Adobe MAX 2009 under way , there is some good news lined up for the mobile world .
Adobe just made it official that full Flash Player support is coming to handsets like BlackBerry ( just like we told you a while back ) , Palm ( for webOS ) and Windows Mobile handsets .
Flash Player 10.1 is also going to be hitting several other smartphones as well as PCs and netbooks , so fret not .
We know what you ’re thinking – wo n’t this kill battery life and drain system resources ?
Adobe assured us that the coming version of Flash is optimized to conserve battery life and keep resource usage to a minimum , which means no lag or freezing up or instantly dead batteries .
Another feature Adobe brings to mobile - optimized Flash is the ability to make use of native input methods , whether touchscreen or physical keys , multi-touch , accelerometer and screen orientation .
It looks like Adobe is really pushing forward with the Open Screen Project , with RIM joining the ranks amongst other big companies , and making Flash a seamless experience across all devices .
Sadly there ’s no timetable on RIM ’s Adobe support , but a public developer preview for webOS is expected to be out before the end of the year .

Another week of guns and blood across America and before a public and polity so astonishingly impervious to the carnage that it is treated almost as if it were measles .
After 15 - year - old Alex Bolar was shot and killed while playing in a park near his Memphis school on Wednesday , the Reverend Joe Hunter , who helps teens in the neighbourhood , railed against the deafness .
“ Give me a break , ” Hunter said .
“ If we can't get in an uproar about that , what can we get in an uproar about ? "
On average , guns kill or wound 276 people every day in America .
Of those shot , about 75 adults and nine children die .
That adds up to just over 100,000 victims of gun violence a year .
The rate of firearm murders in the United States is about 16 times that in Australia and 26 times that in Britain .
In 2000 , Britain 's Home Office published a study that compared murder rates in the world 's capital cities .
Canberra had 0.64 homicides per 100,000 people .
London had three times that rate .
Washington , DC's , murder rate was 93 times that of Canberra's .
Martin Bryant was the Tasmanian misfit who , on an April afternoon in 1996 , used two military - style assault rifles to take the lives of 35 people in eight , dreadful minutes .
To his lasting credit , the then newly elected prime minister , John Howard , seized the moment and stared down the gun lobby to give Australia one of the tightest sets of gun ownership laws in the world .
He declared at the time : '' I hate guns .
One of the things I do n't admire about America is their slavish love of guns ...
We do not want the American disease imported into Australia . "
Australia endured 11 mass shootings in the decade leading to the day Bryant ran amok .
There have been none since .
It is , of course , wishful thinking to expect that an American president could , or would want , to intervene in the way Howard did to curtail gun ownership .
Emboldened by the Second Amendment which , they contend , still protects their right to bear arms , many Americans , in the words of one of their greater jurists , Joseph Story , consider gun ownership to be the palladium of the liberties of the republic .
Nevertheless , past presidents and the Congress have certainly tried to reduce the insanely high level of gun violence ; the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King led to bans on mail order guns ; the 1981 shootings of Ronald Reagan and his press secretary James Brady spawned the criminal background check and cooling - off period for handgun buyers and , when Bill Clinton became president , 20 types of assault rifles were banned .
Given the red-necked rage of the National Rifle Association whenever somebody tries to block the sieve of US gun law - and the many politicians beholden to the association 's millions of dollars in funding - the changes achieved in the past are no small thing .
Just last Thursday , as the deranged Hasan pulled out his gun in Fort Hood , the leadership of America 's biggest anti-gun lobby , The Brady Campaign , happened to be meeting in Washington to work how to counter the gun lobby 's latest campaign to overturn a law that bans mentally incompetent and incapacitated military veterans from owning guns .
There are 116,000 of them .
Hasan will be one more .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is one of the very few leading politicians who has stood up to the National Rifle Association .
He may be hated for it , but Bloomberg has made it very hard to own a handgun legally in New York .
New York police frisk hundreds of thousands of people annually to enforce his law .
In September , Bloomberg sent out undercover investigators with hidden cameras , to prove how easy it was for people who would fail a background check for gun ownership to simply roll up to weekend gun shows in other states and buy whatever weapon they wanted .
When the undercover agents warned they would n't pass a background check , 19 out of 30 gun sellers took their money anyway and handed over the guns .
One thing the National Rifle Association can't explain is why New York 's murder rate is on track this year to dip below 500 - the lowest since 1963 , when reliable figures became available .
In 1990 , the bloodiest year in the city 's history , there were 2245 murders .
However Bloomberg can't change America 's relationship with guns by himself .
Will President Barack Obama help ?
The likelihood , for now , is not much .
Consumed by two wars , recession , and health care , there is no stomach within the Obama Administration to open up a new front with opponents as rabid as the US gun lobby .
During his campaign for the presidency , Obama promised to restore a federal ban on several of the most lethal semi-automatic assault rifles .
A bill to close the gun-show loophole is stalled in Congress .
When Newsweek put questions to the White House in April about what had happened to gun law reform , it was told by White House spokesman Ben LaBolt : " There is n't support in Congress for such a ban at this time . "
LaBolt said : " The President supports the Second Amendment , respects the tradition of gun ownership in this country , and he believes we can take commonsense steps to keep our streets safe . "
He pointed to $ US2 billion in new funding for state and local law enforcement in the stimulus package .
It does n't help that Hasan simply walked into the Guns Galore shop in Killeen , Texas , and bought the gun he used , an FN Herstal Five - seveN , quite legally .
According to the website , they sell for about $ US1000 and are about the most murderous handgun it is possible to buy , designed to shred body armour and favoured by the Mexican drug cartels .
The US anti-gun lobby has been vocal for several years about why these weapons - marketed by the gun industry as elevating the power of a handgun to a high - powered rifle - should be banned .
The national anti-gun Violence Policy Centre was the most vocal and began a long report it published last year into why the weapons should be stopped , with a quote from San Jose gun dealer Jim Reed : " These new guns generate the incentive for the consumer to be the first among his buddies to own the ' biggest and the baddest ' handgun on the market , which computes into sales ...
The consumer who buys the big boomers will continue to purchase the new big calibres as long as manufacturers keep building them .
This is good for business ! "

The richly decorated tombs near Luxor are a magnet for archaeologists
France 's Louvre Museum says it is open to the idea of returning ancient Egyptian fresco fragments at the centre of a row with Egyptian officials .
Earlier , Egypt 's head of antiquities Zahi Hawass told the AFP news agency that the Louvre had bought the fragments knowing they were stolen .
Egypt had severed co-operation with the Louvre , pending their return , he said .
The Pharaonic steles , on display in the Louvre , are reported to be from a tomb in the Valley of the Kings , near Luxor .
A Louvre official said " the process for returning them has been engaged " .
But France 's National Scientific Commission for Museum Collections still has to give its approval before they can be sent back , AFP reports .
Ancient Egyptian artworks and relics are displayed in many of the world 's top museums , but in recent years Egypt has stepped up pressure to repatriate some of them .
5 Fashion Misperceptions
Page 1 of 2
As fashion evolves , so does its set of “ rules . ”
While men try their finest to uphold these ever - changing standards , they sometimes overlook the fact that many of these guidelines have been updated and modernized .
Believing in common fashion misperceptions like “ no white after Labor Day , ” can hold you back from becoming the stylized , fashion - forward man you have the potential to be .
So , let ’s debunk some of these fashion misperceptions and get you on the trendy road to becoming your better - dressed self .
1- No white after Labor Day
Possibly the most commonly cited fashion rule , “ Do n’t wear white after Labor Day ” is a misguided way to look at fashion .
It ’s hard to pinpoint exactly when this “ rule ” originated , but it ’s safe to say that this fashion commandment is not really applicable in today ’s contemporary world .
This rule mostly applied to the color of your shoes , and because white is a light and bright color , it was deemed appropriate solely for the summer months , whereas black and brown shoes were the color of choice for the drabber seasons .
Setting the record straight : Today , we ’ve come to the realization that climate does n’t control color .
While certain colors may be in style in different seasons , your color palette should never be limited .
So , do n’t fear the white shoe well into September and October .
Wearing the color white in other articles of clothing , on the other hand , is a year - round venture .
A white shirt , an ivory jacket , an ashen sweater ... these items add a crisp , refined look to any outfit during any season .
2- Your shoes and belt must be the same color
Most people are so afraid of clashing colors that they go overboard with color coordination .
Out of this common fear stems the fashion misperception that your belt should always be the same color as your shoes .
This has caused many men to unnecessarily walk around looking like boring , meticulously monochromatic drones .
Setting the record straight :
As long as the color of your belt and shoes belong to the same family , you ’ll look sharp .
In fact , this rule applies to your entire ensemble .
There ’s no need to pick two colors and have the same shade of each reappear throughout the outfit ( for example : chocolate brown shirt , chocolate brown belt , chocolate brown shoes ) .

Recyclez vos matériaux de construction , en les vendant sur Internet
Une bonne façon de recycler ses matériaux de construction , est de les vendre sur Internet .
Vous serez surpris , il y a des acheteurs pour tout … ou presque
Une construction verte , ça commence par une démolition de recyclage
Tout est en place maintenant pour la démolition de la maison , mais il me reste une chose à faire avant de mettre à terre la maison : recycler le maximum de matériaux qui autrement se retrouveraient au dépotoir ..
J’ai donc l ’idée de vendre sur Internet le plus d’items possible .
Le but de ma vente n’est pas de faire de l’argent , mais bien de donner la chance à d’autres de récupérer mes matériaux que je n’utiliserai plus .
Je prends donc ma caméra et m’affaire à prendre des clichés de tout ce que je crois être réutilisable : portes , fenêtres , armoires de cuisine , comptoirs , lavabos , foyer , cheminé , et une multitude d’autres items .
Je m’inscris donc sur un site de vente et j’affiche mes matériaux .
Pour ce qui est des prix , plus souvent qu’autrement , je marque : « Faites une offre » .
N’oubliez pas que je ne cherche pas à garnir mon fond de pension , mais bien à donner une seconde vie à des matériaux qui autrement boufferaient de l’espace dans les dépotoirs .
À ma grande surprise , je n’avais pas terminé de remplir mes annonces que le téléphone se met à sonner .
On m’offre 100 $ pour une partie de mon pavé uni !
Vous avez bien lu , j’ai vendu mon pavé uni !!!
Dès lors , je comprends que tout se vend sur Internet !!!
C’est comme ça qu’en quatre jours ( 2 fins de semaine ) , j’ai réussi à vendre ma terrasse en bois traité , des portes , des armoires , des lavabos , etc … J’ai même vendu des planches de bois de finition qui se retrouvaient sur les murs .
En tout , j’ai fait quelques centaines de dollars , mais le plus important , c’est que j’ai recyclé des matériaux et j’ai envoyé moins de déchets au dépotoir .
Prenez le temps de mettre en vente les items que vous n’utilisez plus .
Si vous n’êtes pas trop gourmands , vous serez surpris de trouver un acheteur pour n’importe quoi… ou presque .
Démolir , c’est aussi recycler .

GUANGZHOU , China 
The mood of participants here at the world ’s largest trade show on Thursday depended largely on how they were being affected by the weak American dollar .
As throngs of prospective buyers swarmed the exhibitions , equal to five times the floor space of the Empire State Building , Chinese exporters were upbeat .
By keeping China ’s currency , the renminbi , tightly yoked to the weak and weakening dollar , Beijing had made Chinese exports increasingly competitive around the world .
“ We are very confident , ” said Liu En Tian , the marketing manager of the Huasheng Jiangquan Group , a manufacturer of ceramic tiles in Linyi City .
“ Already the buyers who are coming this morning are more than last year . ”
Like those of many Chinese manufacturers , his company ’s exports fell by nearly half last winter because of the global economic slowdown , but they are now down only 20 percent from their peak more than a year ago because of a surge in sales to South America and the Middle East .
“ The economy will get better very soon ” around the world , Mr. Liu said .

about General McChrystal 's " counter - insurgency " strategy in Afghanistan , involving tens of thousands more troops .
We 've heard much less about the US government 's " counter - insurgency " strategy for America .
But it 's America -- not Afghanistan -- where the strategy is already in place , and where the real action may take place .
According to one report , which documents the " unraveling " of US society , " the demand for guns and ammunition has hit a record high and the gun industry cannot produce enough bullets to keep up with orders .
American's are arming themselves to the teeth !
In the past year , 100 new armed militia groups have been formed , as militia members have doubled in numbers .
Federal authorities are gravely concerned about the " uptick in militia activities . "
One federal authority recently said , " All it 's lacking is a spark .
I think it 's only a matter of time before you see threats and violence .
" Contingency plans for martial law were signed by President Bush just before the election in November 2008 .
These plans , written in bureaucratic detail , have appeared on the Internet in what seems to be a leak of classified government documents .
( by Bradley Moscrip ) Noting that there are presently 600 detention camps ( soon to be expanded to 1500 , generally in rural uninhabited areas ) , one of the documents provides the location of 94 of these detention sites in 28 states .
How reliable is this information ?
Are these documents real ?
Popular conservative gate - keepers like Glenn Beck have pooh - poohed stories about the construction of detention sites across the country .
There 's no way to be certain , but to me they ring true .
And skeptics who have personally researched the matter say there is no doubt that these detention camps exist .
The real question is why .
Some say it 's simply that the government needs to be prepared to maintain civil order in case of enemy attack or civil emergency .
But this does n't account for the scope and secrecy of the present plans .
The documents posted on the Internet state that the real reason is the prospect of domestic insurrection .
In principle there 's nothing new here .
The state 's first priority has always been to control its own population , especially when it is carrying out unpopular policies .
In the 1860s the Lincoln administration not only crushed the southern states that tried to secede , it also crushed all dissent ( and there was a lot of it ) in the northern states .
Secretary of War Stanton ordered federal law officers to imprison anyone engaged by act , speech , or writing , in discouraging volunteer enlistments in the army .
Habeas corpus was suspended ; newspaper publishers , judges , and legislators who dissented from the war policy were jailed ; and when a draft was instituted , hundreds of protesters were shot and killed .
The potential for these kinds of draconian actions is more real today than any time since the 1860s .
Hardly a week goes by that the government is not announcing some new peril .
At one time it 's a pandemic ( currently swine flu ) ; at another time it 's a terrorist attack ; at yet another time it 's a financial collapse ( recall that a Congressman revealed a year ago that Congress was threatened with the imposition of martial law if they should fail to approve the emergency bank bailout ) .
Current federal policies seem almost guaranteed to create some such crisis .
The federal government is treating our current economic problems by creating monumental new levels of debt .
This is like an alcoholic trying to cure himself by drinking even more whiskey .
Once the temporary artificial stimulus has passed , the result will be an even greater collapse .
There is no shortage of scenarios that would lead to martial law , and many would be created by the policies of the government itself .
Whatever the details , we may be confident that it has drawn up plans to suspend the Constitution " temporarily " and to impose direct military control of the civilian population .
In both Waco and Katrina , US military forces were employed , though not publicized .
More recently , the Pentagon has established the Northern Command , designed to carry out military operations within the US .
Yes , we may launch a " counter - insurgency strategy " in Afghanistan , at least for a while .
But America 's power is waning overseas .
We 're overextended militarily and financially .
We 're looking for a way to scale back if not withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan .
( The new buzzword is " endgame . " )
Most significantly , Obama seems to be seeking to reduce American power and autonomy .
So the future for counter - insurgency may be here at home .
The US government may be planning for a reduced role in the world , but it is not planning for a reduced role at home .
On the contrary , it plans to take control of all aspects of American society , as well as integrate America into a global system .
And it recognizes that these plans may lead to resistance .
So it is ready with a counter - insurgency strategy , and willing and able to implement it .
We would be well advised not to play into its hands .-----

The Pennsylvania supreme court has dismissed thousands of juvenile convictions issued by a judge charged in a corruption scandal .
The high court today threw out more than five years worth of cases heard by former Luzerne County Judge Mark Ciavarella .
He is charged with accepting millions of dollars in kickbacks to send youths to private detention centres .
The court says that all the convictions are tainted and that the youths may not be retried .
The Philadelphia - based Juvenile Law Centre represents some of the youths and says the court 's order covers more than 6,000 cases .
The biggest change to Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 was supposed to have been the introduction of something called Unified Communications -- the introduction of a singular console for the handling of all forms of digital communication , wrapping voice mail , instant messaging , and e-mail into a single delivery system .
History may yet vindicate UC as the product 's singular achievement .
But in the near term , administrators credit Exchange more for what it gives them than the world at large .
In that light , the inclusion of PowerShell as not only the underlying language of the system but as its engine as well , changed everything for the admin .
It may very well be why the product has surged to a two - thirds market share , by some estimates , over once formidable competition such as Lotus Notes .
So learning a lesson from history , the message from Microsoft with regard to Exchange Server 2010 , which went on sale this morning , is about new levels of control .
The idea that e-mail , or any kind of communication , once sent unto the vast Internet is out of the sender 's hands -- like a paper sailboat launched from a river pier -- is what the Exchange team has been working to combat .
During a beta program which Microsoft says involved dozens of universities , signing up some ten million participants worldwide , the company has completed development of a browser - based endpoint for ES 2010 - delivered e-mail that is not only more manageable than Outlook 2007 , but that has beaten Outlook 2010 -- the product it 's supposed to be derived from -- to market by perhaps eight months .
Advertisement
What that means is , hopefully for a short time only , there will be a functionality gap between what the new Outlook Web App -- hosted by ES 2010 -- can deliver compared to what Outlook 2007 provides .
If Julia White , Microsoft 's marketing director for Exchange , has anything to say about it , that gap will be shorter rather than longer , but it 's not unnoticed .
Microsoft Outlook Web App previews the textual contents of a voice mail .
[ Courtesy Microsoft Corp . ]
White spoke with Betanews this afternoon from Berlin , where she had just completed a TechEd Europe demonstration along with Corporate Vice President Stephen Elop .
" Obviously Outlook Web Apps comes with Exchange , so they can use that today ; when Outlook 2010 comes out , they can use that , " said White , " and we are absolutely planning support for Outlook 2007 in the roadmap here .
So it's on the agenda , and we will actually be getting to it . "
Much of what Exchange 2010 will deliver absolutely depends on this upgrade to Outlook 2007 , as you 'll see .
We asked White for her take on what she would consider the top three enhancements to administrator functionality in ES 2010 .
# 3 : Transport Protection Rules
Number three on this list is the Transport Protection Rules system , which we described earlier today .
It enables the administrator to designate the extent to which the recipient of a message can utilize its contents , based upon rules that enable Exchange to analyze the content itself .
" In the demo this morning , I set a Transport Protection Rule based on a keyword .
But actually another aspect of that is , those rules can be set based on the sender , the recipient , or even contents of an attachment , " White told Betanews .
" Any of those things can be triggered ; and having the ability to centrally decide what gets encrypted and what does n't , is a really powerful tool .
With end users , it 's hard for them to keep up with corporate policy , pay attention to it , or know about it .
So oftentimes it 's unintended , versus intended , when information is n't protected .
Having that essentially managed brings peace of mind , for the users as well as the IT pros . "
The ability to analyze an attachment takes place on a granular level , White told us .
If a PowerPoint presentation , for example , were to contain the words " Microsoft Confidential , " that fact alone would trigger a rule that automatically encrypts the message outgoing , and that restricts the recipient from being able to pass it on .
# 2 : Role - Based Access Control
One of the least loved features of Exchange , or anything Microsoft has ever done , disappears in ES 2010 : The Access Control List is a Registry - based system for designating which identified and authenticated user had permissions to control specific objects .
It has often been a ridiculous concept that starts one off with the assumption that everyone has rights to everything , and that ACLs provide the exceptions .
Exchange Server 2010 replaces this entirely with a concept that is much more rooted in Active Directory .
Now , the administrator starts off in a universe where nothing is allowed until groups of users are added into the pool of permissions .
Those groups that are added in are called management role groups , with the concept being that a predefined set of roles exist ( a concept made popular by Windows Server 2008 ) , and that groups of users or individual users are delegated those roles .
This morning , Julia
White demonstrated how Role - Based Access Control enabled an otherwise unprivileged user to search for e-mails through multiple mailboxes on the company 's behalf ( in this case , Microsoft 's usual fictitious firm , Contoso ) .
Her system was delegated a role that let her perform the search , without having to delegate other responsibilities and privileges of a much higher administrative order .
" A compliance officer might get that level of capability , " White explained to us , " but a help desk might have the rights to increase mail box quota size .
Maybe HR would be given the ability to update contact information on behalf of employees .
Extending all the way down to end users , even that same roles - based administration capability -- end users can now create and manage their own distribution groups within Exchange .
That no longer requires a call to the IT pro...usually that 's a lot of overhead . "

The defeated Iranian presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi today launched a formal appeal against the election result as his supporters took to the streets of the capital again , raising the prospect of more violent clashes .
Mousavi , who claimed his defeat by the hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was manipulated , said in a statement on his website that he had appealed to the ruling guardian council to overturn the result , and urged his supporters to continue protests " in a peaceful and legal way .
" We have asked officials to let us hold a nationwide rally to let people display their rejection of the election process and its results , " said Mousavi .
With temperatures at 35C , the situation in the Iranian capital threatened to run out of control earlier today , as special forces in riot gear chased protesters through side streets near Fatemi Square .
In a sign of the anger among Mousavi 's supporters , they chanted " the president is committing a crime and the supreme leader is supporting him " , highly inflammatory language in a regime where the supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , is considered irreproachable .
Shops , government offices and businesses closed early as tension mounted .
Crowds also gathered outside Mousavi 's headquarters but there was no sign of Ahmadinejad 's chief political rival .
Supporters waved their fists and chanted anti-Ahmadinejad slogans .
Mousavi's wife denied rumours that her husband had been placed under house arrest .
" People are tired of dictatorship , " she told Reuters .
" People are tired of not having freedom of expression , of high inflation , and adventurism in foreign relations .
That is why they wanted to change Ahmadinejad . "
Mousavi 's newspaper , Kalemeh Sabz , or the Green Word , did not appear on news stands today .
An editor speaking anonymously said authorities had been upset with Mousavi 's statements .
The paper 's website reported that more than 10 m votes in Friday 's election were missing national identification numbers similar to US social security numbers , which made the votes " untraceable " .
The president , who will address his supporters in a victory rally later today , was dismissive of the protests in a speech .
" These [ protests ] are not important and these are natural , " he said .
He said Iran 's elections were the " model of democracy " and accused " western oppressors " of criticising the election process .
" On Friday 's election , the people of Iran emerged victorious , " he declared .
He also said the country 's nuclear issue " belongs in the past " , an indication that he would not halt the programme that western leaders believe is geared towards creating weapons of mass destruction , despite the olive branch offered by the US president , Barack Obama .
Tens of thousands of flag - waving Ahmadinejad supporters gathered in the capital 's Valiasr Square for the president 's victory speech this evening , as he attempted a show of force he hopes will quell opposition protests .
The US vice - president , Joe Biden , said he had doubts about " the way they 're suppressing crowds , the way in which people are being treated " , although , using guarded language , he said the US had to accept " for the time being " Tehran 's claim that Ahmadinejad won a resounding re-election .
" There 's an awful lot of questions about how this election was run , " said Biden .
" We do n't have enough facts to make a firm judgment . "
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said today that his government was worried about the situation and criticised " the somewhat brutal reaction " by authorities in response to demonstrations .
The EU said in a statement it was " concerned about alleged irregularities " during Friday 's vote .
Last night saw violent clashes after Ahmadinejad was confirmed as the winner of the presidential election on Friday , barely an hour after the polls had closed .
Protesters set fire to rubbish bins and tyres , creating pillars of black smoke among the apartment blocks and office buildings in central Tehran .
An empty bus was engulfed in flames on a side road .
Police fought back with clubs , including mobile squads on motorcycles swinging truncheons , as protesters hurled stones and bottles at officers , shouting " Mousavi , give us our votes back " and " the election was full of lies " .
More than 100 reformists , including Mohammad Reza Khatami , the brother of former president Mohammad Khatami , were arrested last night , according to leading reformist Mohammad Ali Abtahi .
He told Reuters they were members of Iran 's leading reformist party , Mosharekat .
A judiciary spokesman denied they had been arrested but said they were summoned and " warned not to increase tension " before being released .
Protests also broke out yesterday in the cities of Tabriz , Orumieh , Hamedan and Rasht .
Mousavi , who had been widely expected to beat the controversial incumbent if there was a high turnout ‑ or at least do well enough to trigger a second round ‑ has also appealed against the result to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
But Khamenei replied that the election had been conducted fairly and ordered the three defeated candidates and their supporters to avoid " provocative " behaviour .
A second four - year term for Ahmadinejad torpedoes prospects for the freedoms and economic competence Mousavi had promised Iran 's 72 million people , creating a vibrant , youth - driven " green " reformist movement which had been peaceful until last night 's clashes .
Overt signs of repression included the failure of phone lines for hours after the polls closed and the blocking of the English and Persian - language websites of the BBC and Voice of America , which are regularly attacked by the Iranian authorities as " imperialist " .
Text messaging also failed .
A group of drunken fruit flies have helped researchers from North Carolina State and Boston universities identify entire networks of genes — also present in humans — that play a key role in alcohol drinking behavior .
This discovery , published in the October 2009 print issue of the journal GENETICS , provides a crucial explanation of why some people seem to tolerate alcohol better than others , as well as a potential target for drugs aimed at preventing or eliminating alcoholism .
In addition , this discovery sheds new light on many of the negative side effects of drinking , such as liver damage .
" Translational studies , like this one , in which discoveries from model organisms can be applied to insights in human biology , can make us understand the balance between nature and nurture , why we behave the way we do , for better or worse , and what makes us tick , " said Robert Anholt , a Professor of Biology and Genetics at North Carolina State University , Director of the W. M. Keck Center for Behavioral Biology , and one of the senior scientists involved in the work .
To make this discovery , Anholt and colleagues first measured the amount of time it took for the fruit flies to lose postural control after exposure to alcohol .
At the same time , changes in the expression of all the flies ' genes were recorded .
Using statistical methods to identify genes that work together , the scientists were able to pinpoint specific genes that played a crucial role in adaptation relating to alcohol exposure .
Armed with this information about fruit flies , the scientists set out to determine if the same genes contribute to alcohol drinking habits in humans .
Indeed they do : expression of the human counterpart of a critical gene in fruit flies could be directly tied to alcohol consumption in humans .
" From a scientific point - of - view , research like this is almost intoxicating , " said Mark Johnston , Editor - in - Chief of the journal GENETICS .
" We 've known for a while now that genetics played a role in alcohol consumption , but now , we actually know some of the genes that are involved .
As a result of this work , we have a potential drug target for curing this insidious condition . "

The little - known detention center in Greenwich Village , on the fourth floor , reopened last year .
Credit ... Suzanne DeChillo / The New York Times
When she asked that the lawyers ’ letters of legal advice be forwarded to detainees who had been transferred from Varick , she said the warden balked , saying he had to consider the financial interests of his private shareholders : 1,200 members of a central Alaskan tribe whose dividends are linked to Varick ’s profits under a $ 79 million , three - year federal contract .
Federal officials would not discuss their transfer policies , but asked for patience as they try to make the detention system more humane and cost - effective .
“ We inherited an inadequate detention system from the previous administration that does not meet ICE ’s current priorities or needs , ” said Matthew Chandler , a Homeland Security spokesman .
Officials say they are committed to a complete overhaul , including less - penal detention centers with better access to lawyers .
The volunteer lawyers and the petition ’s author , an ailing refugee from torture in Romania who spent eight months inside Varick , say many problems persist there , though the added scrutiny has led to improvements .
Detainees who want a Gideon Bible no longer have to pay the commissary $ 7 .
Immigration officials are more responsive when a lawyer complains that a detainee in pain is not getting treatment .
But most detainees do not have a lawyer , and the few who do include men who have fallen prey to incompetent or fraudulent practitioners .
Recurrent complaints include frigid temperatures , mildew and meals that leave detainees hungry and willing to clean for $ 1 a day to pay for commissary food .
That wage is specified in the contract with the Alaskan company , which budgeted 23,000 days of such work the first year , and collects a daily rate of $ 227.68 for each detainee .
The Alaska connection is one of the stranger twists in the jail ’s fitful history .
Opened as a federal immigration detention center in 1984 , Varick became chronically overcrowded after 1998 , when new laws mandated the detention of all noncitizens who had ever committed a crime on a list of deportable offenses , expanded to include misdemeanors like drug possession .
Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman has " unconceded " in New York 's special House election after reports that the vote margin narrowed between him and Rep. Bill Owens ( D ) .
Hoffman conceded the race on Election Night after learning he trailed Owens by 5,335 votes .
But the Syracuse Post - Standard reported last week that the margin had shrunk to 3,026 votes after recanvassing .

Hoffman appeared on conservative commenatator Glenn Beck 's radio show this afternoon .
Beck asked the him if he would " unconcede . "
" Yes , if I knew this information at the election night , I would not have conceded , " Hoffman said .
Beck asked him again if he was " unconceding " and Hoffman replied , " If that ’s possible , yes . "
Officials in the upstate New York district are still counting over 10,000 absentee ballots , which also had Republican nominee Dede Scozzafava 's name on them .
Scozzafava dropped out of the race three days before Election Day , citing poor fundraising and polling returns .
She subsequently backed Owens .
Owens was sworn into Congress on Nov. 6 , just before House Democrats voted on the healthcare reform .
Should Hoffman come away with more votes , a highly unlikely possibility , Owens would have to be removed from office , according to the House clerk .
Hoffman would have to take over 65 percent of the absentee ballots in order to eclipse Owens .
In the interview , Hoffman admitted his victory would be a " long shot . "

On the holiday known as the Day of the Dead , a Brazilian bricklayer walked into his own funeral .
The sight of Ademir Jorge Goncalves alive shocked relatives , some of whom tried to jump out of the windows of the funeral home in southern Brazil .
" In my 10 years in this business , I have never witnessed a scene like this , " said Natanael Honorato , manager of the funeral home in the Parana state .
On November 1 , some family members and friends had identified the victim of a car crash as the 59 - year - old Goncalves .
They scheduled his funeral for the following day , Dia de Finados , a holiday when Brazilians remember loved ones who have died .
What Goncalves ' family did not know is that he had spent the night drinking at a bar near the site of the crash , but he was not the victim .
When the bricklayer got word of his funeral , he showed up at the Funeraria Rainha das Colinas funeral home Monday morning .
Later that day , the mystery was solved when a family in a neighboring town came inquiring about a son who was missing .
The family recognized the body -- and took it away for burial .

AN ATTENTION deficit , rather than an inability to feel emotion , may be what makes psychopathic individuals seem fearless .
It ’s a finding that challenges the common characterisation of such people as cold - blooded predators .
“ A lot of their problems may be a consequence of something that ’s almost like a learning difficulty , ” says Joseph Newman , a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin - Madison who investigated how prisoners with psychopathic personalities react when anticipating pain .
Previous experiments have suggested such people may not feel fear , while brain imaging studies have found abnormalities in the amygdala , a region that processes fear and other emotions .

Last week , I was a bit surprised at the attention received by one of my posts from the middle of October , Get Rid of “ It ” ( and other vague words ) .
The post was submitted to Reddit , and received a somewhat controversial rating .
The ratings were mostly positive , but the comments were somewhat less so , indicating that ( perhaps ) my message had n’t gotten completely across .
On the positive side , I think that article received the most comments any of my articles has received .
Thanks to all the Reddit commenters who took the time to say why they agreed or disagreed with me !
I ’m not writing this post directly to those commenters , but I do think it is important to respond to the flaw pointed out by the comments .
As one commenter pointed out , general rules may hurt writers if the writer does n’t understand when to break the rule .
I felt I should clarify my message to help all writers who read this blog .
I think the major reason that the Reddit commenters disagreed with my post was that I went a bit too far with the selection of my title .
When I said , “ Get Rid of ‘ It ’ , ” I was referring ( mostly ) to the overuse of “ it ” in many new writers ’ work .
As a few Reddit commenters ( correctly ) pointed out , “ it ” is a perfectly good word , if used carefully .
My intention is not to eliminate the word “ it ” from the English language .
However , writers need to be careful to balance the convenience of “ it ” with the vagueness “ it ” introduces .
New writers tend to use “ it ” too often in their work , which makes understanding their intended meaning difficult .
Many writers use “ it ” as a crutch .
Instead of thinking about the concept a writer desires to convey , many beginning writers throw in the word “ it ” to shorten their writing , but this puts the burden of figuring out the message on the reader .
Taking a bit more effort to clarify your message can save your readers a lot of time .
Speaking of saving time , let ’s get to the main event .
When should you use “ it ” ?
Use “ it ” to refer to an object that has no gender :
The bookcase was lovely , its oaken shelves a beautiful shade of brown .
The water bottle let out a sharp hiss as I squeezed its trigger , water spraying out in a narrow stream .
Use “ it ” to refer to an event ( in the examples , “ It ” refers to the weather ) :
It was a blustery day in the Hundred Acre Woods .
It was a dark and stormy night .
Use “ it ” when you can substitute any number of things and still make the sentence true :
Forget about it , it will never happen .
It will be a cold day in Hell when that happens .
Use “ it ” when the surrounding context makes the meaning clear :
We loved that restaurant .
Its food was delicious , its atmosphere was pleasant , and its waiters were always prompt .
Can we continue this conversation later ?
I ’d really love for Janice to hear it .
Also , while we ’re talking about “ it , ” let ’s also get one commonly confused thing straight :
Its color was green .
It ’s standing still .
In other words , “ its ” implies ownership or a characteristic of something .
“ It ’s ” is used only to refer to “ It is ” or “ It has . ”
Writing is an art , and the use of “ it ” is no different .
Deciding to use “ it ” in a particular case depends on your goals as a writer –you ’re making a choice between clarity and vagueness , or wordiness and brevity .
The right place to use “ it ” is ( unfortunately ) often a judgment call .
“ It ” is a perfectly good word , when a writer carefully considers when to use “ it ” .
Happy writing !

" It was great ( seeing his name ) and a little emotional and yet it was n't .
Phew , there it is , finally . …
It feels so good to walk into there and see everything that 's come together . "

Six years ago in October , the Atlanta Thrashers traveled to Elmira , Ont. , to bury one of their own .
On Sunday they will return to the bucolic village of 7,000 , located in Mennonite country a little more than an hour 's drive from Toronto .
This time , they return for a more hopeful purpose .
After their Saturday game in Buffalo , the Thrashers will bus to Elmira and practice at the new Woolwich Memorial Centre and its rink , named for Dan Snyder , who died at age 25 six days after he was a passenger in a car crash with star teammate Dany Heatley " I think it 's important , because Dan , he was a member of our team , " said Ilya Kovalchuk , one of only two Thrashers left on the roster who played with Snyder during the 2002 - 03 season , when the spunky forward scored 10 goals in 36 games .
" He 's still a member of our team .
He 's always going to be with us .
When his name is there , it means we 're there , too .
For us , it 's going to be a big deal to see the fans , to see the rink .
" When their son and brother died so suddenly , the Snyder family made it their mission to build Woolwich Township a new community center , as their son had desired before his passing .
Through five charity golf tournaments attended by NHL players like Heatley and broadcasters like Bob McKenzie , Ron MacLean and Darren Eliot , plus other efforts , the Snyders sought to raise $ 500,000 .
Instead , they raised $ 750,000 towards the $ 22 million project .
LuAnn Snyder , Dan 's mother , said her son was outraged when he learned that a township study stated that it did not need a new rink until 2017 .
Dan played for the town 's Junior B team , the Elmira Sugar Kings , and his father , Graham , now a member the Ontario Hockey Association 's board of directors , had managed it .
So Dan knew the need to replace the aging rink was urgent .
Now that the process is complete and the Sugar Kings can play before crowds of 2,000 with immaculate sight lines , LuAnn Snyder has mixed emotions .
" It was great ( seeing his name ) and a little emotional and yet it was n't , " she said .
" Phew , there it is , finally . …
It feels so good to walk into there and see everything that 's come together .
" The Snyders invited the Thrashers to attend the facility 's Sept. 11 opening , but the team opened its training camp that weekend in Atlanta .
General Manager Don Waddell said he requested from the NHL an early weekend date in Buffalo or Toronto so the team could make a trip to Elmira .
For the 1 p.m. ET public practice Sunday , Thrashers coach John Anderson will be hooked up to a microphone .
At 2 p.m. , the town will host a private luncheon for the players , along with the families of Thrashers players Bryan Little and Rich Peverley , who hail from nearby Cambridge and Guelph , respectively .
An autograph session will follow in which organizers hope to have almost 2,000 children participate .
Perhaps some of those children will be the same ones who six years ago lined the streets from the Snyders ' home to the Mennonite Church for the funeral , silently tapping their hockey sticks in a touching tribute to Snyder , as his family members and the team made the short walk .
Before he was the Thrashers ' coach , Anderson had Snyder on his 2002 Chicago Wolves team that won the AHL's Calder Cup .
Snyder had 17 points in 22 playoff games that season .
Anderson said it was just " devastating " for so many of his players when Snyder passed in 2003 .
" It really hurt a lot of guys , " Anderson said .
" Guys are guys .
They do n't say much , but you could visibly see that there was a shock .
" The same was true of those Thrashers on the 2003 - 04 team .
Left wing Slava Kozlov still keeps a photo of Snyder on his locker stall at Philips Arena .
" Every time when I go in the game , I see his face , " Kozlov said .
The organization has not forgotten Snyder .
In a conference room at the team 's practice facility , a painting of Snyder hangs , as does his jersey and a framed photo of he and Heatley together , smiling , next to a New York Times column that praised the Snyders ' forgiveness of Heatley .
When Heatley faced vehicular homicide charges from the Fulton Count , Ga. , district attorney , the Snyders played a key role in keeping Heatley out of jail , as they believed their son would have wanted .
To this day , they continue to call the car crash " an accident .
"
In the Thrashers ' final home game each season , the franchise gives an award in Snyder 's name , presents a $ 15,000 check to a charity and brings the family back for the on-ice ceremony .
"
It 's the most important award that we give here from a player 's standpoint , " Waddell said , " because it recognizes a player who has to battle through some adversity to get where he has gotten and someone who is recognized by his teammates who is a team guy .
" Kovalchuk was 20 when Snyder died and was shaken by the event .
In the hours after her son died at Atlanta 's Grady Hospital , LuAnn took her son's watch , which was broken in three places from the violent crash , and gave one piece to then - coach Bob Hartley , another to Kovalchuk and kept one for herself .
Kovalchuk said he still has the wristband link at his home .
He only sees the Snyders occasionally , but enjoys the visits .
" They 're great people , " he said .
" His mom , she 's a great lady , very strong .
She reminds me of my mom all the time .
She 's such a kind person .
I always talk and say hello and wish good luck , so it 's great .
" Perhaps on Sunday Kovalchuk will meet Graham and LuAnn 's first grandchild , Reed Daniel Snyder , whose middle name comes for his Uncle Dan .
Reed , who will turn 1 the day after the practice , takes swimming lessons at the community center .
He is a new positive in the family 's life , as is their accomplishment of seeing the rink built that their son had wanted for the hometown of which he was so proud .
" Now they can come back for something good , " LuAnn Snyder said of the Thrashers ' visit .
" To celebrate . "
Reviews
AI War breaks most of the genre ’s rules .
Which is precisely why it ’s incredible …
This out - of - the - blue one - man passion project is one of this year ’s finest strategy games .
– Alec Meer , PC Gamer UK , November 2009
It ’s a balancing act , with your own strength on one side , and the AI ’s opinion of you on the other .
Piss it off before you ’re ready to face it , and you ’re going to get squashed .
That moment , when you ’re finally in a position to turn the tables , is about as glorious as gaming gets .
– Phill Cameron , Eurogamer , February 2011
I think I ’ve stumbled across this year ’s Really New Thing .
There ’s a lot of 2009 to go , but I ’ll be surprised if anyone else twists the RTS formula this dramatically and this effectively .
And I ’m hoping it ’ll be the Next Big Thing , because it ’s big , different , entirely unprecedented and an exciting way to play an RTS .
– Tom Chick , Crispy Gamer , August 2009
Having played this title at two distinct points in its life cycle what really stands out is the incredible dedication of Arcen Games in keeping on top of how the game evolves and expands .
Even though a great many features have been added and tweaked and refined , it was possible for me to drop back into AI War after more than a year away and not find it to be a confusing mish - mash of feature overload .
The post - release support is , quite honestly , the best I ’ve seen for any game .
– Peter Parrish , IncGamers , February 2011
AI War is , quite simply , the best experience you could have with co-op or single - player real - time strategy in this or any year .
It combines grand strategy with emergent AI to form an excellent game perfect for parties and multiplayer .
It is easily worth double the price that the developer is selling it at , and anyone with any affinity or taste for strategy games should not miss it .
It may be daunting at first , but an excellent tutorial and amazing gameplay mechanics alleviate this into a game that almost anyone can – and should – play .
– James Murff , Big Download , November 2009
Also see us on MetaCritic , which named AI War as the 40th best - reviewed PC title of 2009 ( AAA titles included ) .
That ’s a pretty big deal for a tiny company like us !
A Grand Strategic 4X Tower Defense RTS
“ You are outgunned .
You are massively outnumbered .
You must win . ”
These are your orders .
Humanity has already fought its war against the machines — and lost .
AI death squads stand watch over every planet and every wormhole , the few remaining human settlements are held captive in orbiting bubbles , and the AIs have turned their attention outward , away from the galaxy , to alien threats or opportunities unknown .
This inattention is our only hope : a small resistance , too insignificant even to be noticed by the AI central command , has survived .
These are the forces you will command .
The AI subcommanders will fight you to the death when they see you — but your glimmer of opportunity comes from quietly subduing those subcommanders without alerting central processing to the danger until it ’s too late .
You do have a few things going in your favor .
Your ships are much faster .
You have safe AI routines to automate defenses and mining outposts .
You have production techniques that can churn out fully - outfitted unmanned fighters in seconds .
There will never be more than a few thousand of your ships versus tens of thousands of theirs , but through careful strategy you must somehow reach and destroy the heavily - guarded AI cores .
Go forth into the galaxy , steal AI technology , recapture those planets you must in order to achieve your ends , and save what remains of humanity .
But draw too much attention to yourself , and the full might of the AI overlords will come crashing down .
So What Exactly Is This Game ?
AI War is a one - of - a - kind strategy game that plays like an RTS but feels like a 4X .
With tower defense and grand strategy bits , too .
You ’ll be wanting the demo ( see the bottom of this page ) to really know what we mean , there ’s nothing else on the market remotely like this ( as many reviewers have glowingly pointed out ) .
More specifically , this is a game that you can either play solo , or in 2 - 8 player co-op .
You always play against a pair of AIs , and you can configure an enormous amount of things about the experience .
The AI is very excellent , and also an entirely unique concept .
The longer you play , the more the AI will impress you , which is kind of backwards from most strategy games , right ?
We named this “ AI War ” for a reason .
The only way to play is in procedurally - generated “ campaigns . ”
There are quite literally billions of possibilities , and every campaign has a really different feel to it .
They also last a good while : most between 7 to 13 hours , about the length of time it takes to play through an FPS campaign once .
This means your decisions — victories and blunders alike — have really long - term , interesting consequences .
Some players talk about feeling bittersweet when they conclude a long campaign .
You can save and load at any time , even in multiplayer , so you could have one campaign going for weeks or months if you like .
In the past we ’ve emphasized how many ships are in the game , and it ’s true that there are often 30,000 and sometimes even 100,000 + ships in the galaxy at once .
But scale really is n’t the focus of the game in the sense you might think from that : it ’s about having a huge , living galaxy to make your way through , rather than about throwing as many ships as possible at your enemies .
There are a number of checks in the mechanics to keep players from “ blobbing ” excessively , actually .
This is foremost a game about cleverly picking your battles , evaluating scout intel for weaknesses and opportunities , and executing really long - term plans despite the monkey wrenches the AI is sure to throw into the works .
It ’s about thinking on your feet and evaluating each situation , rather than memorizing stats .
Why Would I Want This Game ?
Because you ’ve had a hankering for a deep strategy game for a long time , but you hate the obtuse , slow mechanics of some of the older genre standbys .
Because you love RTS games or 4X games , but you hate it when they ’re click - fests , involve a lot of sitting around and waiting , or just require you to memorize a bunch of spreadsheets to win .
Because you ’ve been hearing about this cult classic of a game since May of 2009 , and it ’s recently been hugely updated and re-launched , and you finally want to give it a try .
Because you like kicking robots in the teeth .
Information For Strategy “ Grognards ”
You want to try this game — seriously .
There ’s a big expansive demo ( see bottom of this page ) that you can try for hours and hours for free , and you ’ll know if you love it or not .
We ’ve got a real odd mix of fans , so if you ’re on the fence you should still try it : we ’ve got RTS addicts , 4X lovers , and folks in between .
This game is extremely configurable , so you can set it up to have a slower , more thoughtful , 4X feel , or you can make everything happen blazing fast so that your reflexes are tested .
By default it ’s in the middle , where things move along at a good clip but fast - clicking is n’t rewarded .
Information For Strategy Newbies

Until the welcome day capitalism does vanish , the monogamous family remains the legally enforced social model , at least in Western societies , for the organization of private life in its most intimate aspects : love , sex , bearing and raising children .
It is the central social institution oppressing women ; anti-gay bigotry flows from the need to punish any " deviations " from this patriarchal structure .
Why anyone not under social pressure or economic duress would voluntarily enter the bonds of matrimony is , of course , one of life 's mysteries .
Nonetheless , it appears that these days the only people who actually want to get married are the only ones President Bush wants to stop : gays and lesbians .
Absolutely , they ought to have the right to marry .
And just as absolutely , we socialists fight for a society in which no one needs to be forced into a legal straitjacket in order to get medical benefits , visitation rights , custody of children , immigration rights , or any of the many privileges this capitalist society grants to those , and only those , who are embedded in the traditional " one man on one woman for life " legal mold .
Controversy over " gay marriage " has roiled the U.S. since last November , when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that permitting only " civil unions " for gay couples was unconstitutional , thus establishing the right to gay marriage in Massachusetts .
In February the San Francisco mayor ordered same - sex marriage licenses issued , and 4,037 gay and lesbian couples from 46 states and eight countries got hitched before ceremonies were ordered halted on March 11 .
The Green Party mayor of New Paltz , New York , jumped into the fray , officiating at 25 same - sex marriages .
When he was barred by court order from continuing , two local Unitarian ministers took over , only to have criminal charges filed against them by the Ulster County D.A. for solemnizing " unlicensed marriages " in March .
In 1996 , Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act which pronounced , " the word ‘ marriage ' means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife . "
With unholy glee , Christian fundamentalists of all sorts are now pushing an amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning states from recognizing gay marriage ( 39 states already refuse to countenance it ) .
Others warn direly that the floodgates of unspeakable immorality are now open .
Polygamy is the least of it ; Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , dissenting from last year 's Supreme Court decision overturning Texas sodomy laws , claimed that decision could abolish bans not only on same - sex marriage , but also " adult incest , prostitution , masturbation , adultery , fornication , bestiality , and obscenity . "
President Bush , supporting the anti-gay constitutional amendment , intoned : " The union of a man and a woman is the most enduring human institution , honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith , " complaining that " After ... millennia of human experience , a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization . "
Meanwhile , the Wall Street Journal , beady profit - making eye on the bottom line , featured a piece on " Cashing In on Gay Marriage " ( March 11 ) , while vendors presented " Loveland , " a " Same - Sex Wedding Expo " at New York 's Jacob Javits convention center .
All this sudden churning of the crazed , hypocritical witches ' brew that passes for American political discourse these days , especially on questions involving sex , certainly has its darkly humorous and bizarre side .
Partly that 's because the messy reality most people actually live in bears little resemblance to the rigid official portraits of Christian moral rectitude this government claims as models of social behavior .
But the deeper social issues involved are deadly serious , ranging from the most intimate personal questions to broad areas of responsibility for raising new generations , and how to care for others , whether family , friends or lovers ; in short , how " private life " in its entirety is defined and organized .
Workers Must Fight for Democratic Rights for Gays !
Apocalyptic predictions of the end of civilization if gays are allowed to marry are obviously hysterical fantasies ; at the same time , gay marriage in itself will not end the often deadly prejudice and pain gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered people encounter every day in this homophobic , anti-sex society .
But that pain makes it even more important to fight for every possible democratic right , every form of social and political equality that can be wrested from this society .
It is a vital task of the workers revolutionary vanguard to fight for full democratic rights for gays — including , today , marriage rights — and to fight to win the working class to this cause .
The Spartacist League has done this since its inception .
As Lenin pointed out in his 1902 work What Is To Be Done ? :
" Working class consciousness cannot be genuinely political consciousness unless the workers are trained to respond to all cases of tyranny , oppression , violence and abuse , no matter what class is affected ....
Why is it that the Russian workers as yet display so little revolutionary activity in connection with the brutal way in which the police maltreat the people , in connection with the persecution of the religious sects , with the flogging of the peasantry , with the outrageous censorship , with the torture of soldiers , with the persecution of the most innocent cultural enterprises , etc .?...
We must blame ourselves for being unable as yet to organize a sufficiently wide , striking and rapid exposure of these despicable outrages .
When we do that ( and we must and can do it ) , the most backward worker will understand , or will feel , that the students and religious sects , the muzhiks and the authors are being abused and outraged by the very same dark forces that are oppressing and crushing him at every step of his life . "
Here in the United States , one of the most politically backward " advanced " capitalist countries on earth , saddled with a huge burden of puritanism and religious fundamentalism to boot , there is a lot of backwardness on the gay question .
Even among black workers , historically among the most militant in the proletariat and in general those with the fewest illusions in the " good nature " of this rotten capitalist social order , there is a significant amount of anti-gay prejudice .
Much of it is pushed by conservative forces in the black church , although even the black churches are deeply split on this question .
As we wrote in our article , " For the Right to Gay Marriage ! " :
" In its extreme , one gets the phenomenon of a black Baptist minister , the Rev. Gregory Daniels , who declared , ‘ If the K.K.K. opposes gay marriage , I would ride with them ' ( New York Times , 1 March ) .
He might saddle up , but it will be a short ride — the first target of this motley collection of nativist , anti-labor fascists is black people " ( WV No. 821 , 5 March ) .
In contrast to this myopic anti-gay prejudice is the compassion so many black people feel because they know firsthand the torment and danger of oppression and discrimination .
A Massachusetts State Senator from Roxbury put it well : " I know the pain of being less than equal , and I cannot and will not impose that status on anyone else .
I was but one generation removed from an existence in slavery .
I could not in good conscience ever vote to send anyone to that place from which my family fled . "
Others can't see that an injury to one is an injury to all , and so in a backhanded way end up in the camp of the racist anti-gay bigots .
Black columnist Adrian Walker , writing in the Boston Globe ( 12 February ) , quoted one clergyman : " Think about Emmett Till , the Scottsboro Boys , and those police dogs in Birmingham — and then tell me they 've faced what we 've faced .
This has nothing to do with civil rights . "
This reflects in part the pernicious influence of Democratic Party " constituency " politics , where one sector of the oppressed is pitted against another in the scramble for aid from a state which defends capitalist rule .
Of course there are many , and qualitative , differences between black oppression and gay oppression in this society .
Racism is the bedrock of American capitalism , the great fault line in American politics since the founding of the nation on the backs of black slaves .
The ruling class consciously manipulates racism to weaken the proletariat .
The fight for black freedom will be central to the proletarian revolution in the U.S.
For that revolution to succeed , the working class , including its strategic black component , must understand its historic task is to abolish class society in order to open the road to human freedom for everyone .
And that most certainly includes gays — and everyone else who , however self - defined , rebels against the straitjacket social roles imposed by the capitalist ruling class .
Further , violence against gays , lesbians and , increasingly , transgendered people is a deadly constant on America 's mean streets and in the repressive holding pens known as public schools .
The grisly 1998 murder in Laramie of Matthew Shepard , a 21 - year - old gay Wyoming student who was kidnapped , beaten , burnt and then left tied to a fence to die , shocked the nation .
Though accurate statistics are almost impossible to come by , given that many victims do n't come forward because they rightly fear more harassment from cops , school authorities or parents , and because official statistics do n't always accurately list " hate crimes , " there are still well over 1,000 reported cases a year of violence , sometimes fatal , against gays and lesbians and others deemed sexually " deviant . "
A recent Internet search uncovered an article from the Arizona Tucson Citizen ( 23 February ) titled " Gays , Jews Top Targets of Hate Crimes Here , " which described the June 2002 beating to death of 24 - year - old Philip Walsted , who was gay .
It was a hate crime , according to police .
In January of this year another gay man was found lying on the street , badly beaten , near a gay bar in Tucson , while a gay University of Arizona student was stabbed in 2000 .
That 's just a few stories from one city .
According to the Winter 2003 Southern Poverty Law Center 's Intelligence Report , there were 27 murders of transgendered people in a 21 - month period ( 2002 - 2003 ) in the United States .
The point of these few examples is not to " prove " that any social group is more or less hurt than any other , but to indicate that moral regimentation is part of what keeps this unjust society running the way it does .
It was a good thing that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down sodomy statutes in its 2003 Lawrence v. Texas ruling , because it explicitly overturned the Court 's infamously reactionary 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick that upheld states ' anti-sodomy laws .
That decision castigated gays with statements like " proscriptions against sodomy have ancient roots . "
Chief Justice Warren Burger practically called for a holy war against homosexuals , writing approvingly in his concurrence that " Blackstone described ‘ the infamous crime against nature ' as an offense of ‘ deeper malignity ' than rape , a heinous act ‘ the very mention of which is a disgrace to human nature , ' and ‘ a crime not fit to be named ' . "
This is the legal language that gives cover to gay - bashing .
Gays still do n't have full civil rights : they are n't allowed to serve openly in the U.S. military , for example .
According to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network , a gay rights group , in the ten years since Democratic president Bill Clinton adopted the infamous " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , around 10,000 service members have been discharged for being openly gay .
As we stated when that policy was raised : " Open gays and lesbians have just as much right as anyone else to participate in the armed forces , " while raising the classic Marxist slogan of " Not one man , not one penny " for the military ( " Gays in the Military , " WV No. 569 , 12 February 1993 ) .
This is the tradition of militant Marxism in opposition to imperialist war .
At the same time , the military is a microcosm of society as a whole , and so we fight against racist atrocities and discrimination in the armed forces just as we do in the rest of society .
The fight to integrate black soldiers fully into the armed forces toward the end of World War II created a potentially powerful base for struggles for black emancipation — and in fact black civil rights activists also fought for homosexual rights in the armed forces then .
Government and Social Control of Women
Many people still would argue , gays should have democratic rights , but why marriage ?
The capitalist politicians running for president are all dancing around the pretty meaningless " civil union " cop -out , basically catering to religious reactionaries with votes .
But is n't marriage in some sense " special , " more private , more " sacred " somehow ?
Not at all .
Monogamous marriage is a creation of society , not god ( since there is n't one ) , and it has been used historically as a means of reactionary social control by the ruling class .
We advocate effective consent in all sexual relations and think that what any combination of individuals do in bed is nobody 's business but the participants themselves , as long as it's consensual .
While defending the right to gay marriage , we also argue that the " marriage mania " represents a fundamentally conservative thrust by the well - to - do petty - bourgeois gay milieu .
It 's a far cry from " free love " and the Stonewall Rebellion of 1969 to today 's marriage ceremonies , PTA meetings and Democratic and Republican Party fund - raisers .
In the quest for bourgeois " respectability , " gay pride day organizers have viciously banned NAMBLA ( North American Man-Boy Love Association ) from their marches ( thereby fueling the " anti-pedophilia " hysteria which targets all gays ) and welcomed contingents of gay cops who spend a good part of their time busting " sex offenders . "
Nonetheless , by analogy to our position on the armed forces , we oppose excluding any category of people from access to the privileges and benefits such institutions offer in this society .
At the same time , in the course of fighting for these rights , we seek to convince activists that to really resolve women's and gay oppression it is necessary to create a socialist society , in which the current functions of the bourgeois family are socialized : communal childcare ; communal kitchens ; free , quality health care ; and in all ways freeing women from the burden of child rearing and household slavery .
A look at the history of monogamous marriage in the United States reveals its use as a tool of governmental control .
A valuable book on this subject , Nancy F. Cott 's Public Vows : A History of Marriage and the Nation ( Harvard University Press , 2000 ) , states : " The structure of marriage ... facilitates the government 's grasp on the populace ....
In the form of the law and state enforcement , the public sets the terms of marriage , says who can and cannot marry , who can officiate , what obligations and rights the agreement involves , whether it can be ended and if so , why and how . "
The following history is largely drawn from that book ; quotations from other sources are noted .
One of the book 's central themes is how entire categories of people , especially those deemed " inferior , " were denied the legal right to marry in many states .
This included , most notoriously , black slaves , who of course had no rights whatsoever .
And for decades after the Civil War , blacks and Asians were banned from marrying whites .
Additionally , as Cott writes , " Prohibiting divergent marriages has been as important in public policy as sustaining the chosen model . "
Thus polygamous Mormons and Native Americans were forbidden to practice their own forms of " marriage , " while attempts at utopian communes made in the years before the Civil War came under massive assault following the North 's victory and the consolidation of the American nation under the strengthening grip of industrial capitalism .
In America from the beginning , marriage , though infused with Christian doctrine , was a matter of governmental control , not primarily a religious institution , because the U.S. was established on the formal basis of separation of church and state .
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries , marriage itself , based on older common law , was seen as " a form of governance ....
A man 's headship of a family , his taking the responsibility for dependent wife and children , qualified him to be a participating member of a state ....
Under the common law , a woman was absorbed into her husband 's legal and economic persona upon marrying , and her husband gained the civic presence she lost . "
This concept in fact continued right up through the 20th century , and was really only dealt a decisive blow , in terms of public civil rights at least , with women getting the right to vote nationally in 1920 .
However , Congress determined in 1922 that a wife would lose her citizenship if she married a foreigner and stayed in his country for two years ; other grounds for female loss of citizenship included marriage to an Asian , a polygamist — or an anarchist !
Within the strict confines of the marriage relationship , male supremacy remained largely intact .
Cott describes three U.S. Supreme Court cases , in 1904 , 1908 and 1911 , all of which essentially upheld the husband 's right to control of his wife 's body .
The 1904 case determined a husband 's right to collect " damages " from his wife 's lover in a case of adultery , even asserting that the husband 's right to " exclusive " sexual intercourse was " a right of the highest kind , upon ... which the whole social order rests " ( rhetorical excess , to be sure ; were this literally true , civilization would have collapsed long ago ) .
The 1908 case justified Congress 's ban on bringing women to the U.S. for an " immoral purpose , " thus keeping out a man and his mistress and upholding the government 's authority to legislate monogamy and punish women who transgressed .
The 1911 case involved a woman 's attempt to sue her husband for assault and battery .
The Supreme Court refused to interfere between man and wife , rejecting the " radical and far - reaching " belief that a wife could sue her husband for injuries " as though they were strangers , " and that it was " better to draw the curtain , shut out the public gaze , " as an earlier North Carolina court decision put it , on the prerogatives of male brutality within the family circle .
It took massive social upheaval and a wave of New Left - derived feminist activism in the 1970s to finally breach what was in fact the husband 's right to rape his wife ; only in 1984 did a New York court finally overturn that state 's marital rape exemption , then followed by others .
Native Americans , Blacks , Asians , Immigrants : Forced or Banned Marriages
The creation of the American nation rested on the backs of black slaves — and on the virtual obliteration of the native Indian population of tribal hunter - gatherers and agriculturalists — resulting in the creation of a bourgeois democracy for white , male property owners .
How much more we could have learned about the early history of our species from these indigenous peoples , relentlessly slaughtered and driven onto " reservations , " is a question American Marxists must feel keenly .

The Origin of the Family , Private Property , and the State ( 1884 ) , was after all inspired by American anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan 's pioneering research into the family patterns of North American tribes .
It was this research , in good part , that led to the Marxist understanding that in fact human beings have lived " for millennia " in non-patriarchal relationships , in tribal , matrilineal societies in which women were not enslaved within the straitjacket of monogamous marriage , in which children were the responsibility of both men and women .
Monogamous marriage is a social invention brought to North America by the colonizers , along with their diseases , their " sacred family " and their slaves .
So the Native American population , when not simply killed , was offered an " enlightened " choice by their overseers : rot on the reservation or give up your " heathen " ways .
As Cott puts it , " Most groups — notably the Iroquois , who dominated the eastern part of North America — did not make the nuclear family so fundamental an economic and psychological unit as Protestants did , nor did they generally recognize private property as such ....
The federal government consistently encouraged or forced Indians to adopt Christian - model monogamy as the sine qua non of civilization and morality . "
In some cases it was considered that Indians could be " civilized " by converting to Christianity , and marriage of an Indian woman to a white male was tolerated , though in some dozen states marriages between Indians and whites were declared non-valid .
The 1887 Dawes Act stole Indians ' communal land and undermined their tribal way of life , assigning male family " last names " to Indians ( against native cultural tradition ) , and establishing " individual property - ownership , and further subverted native American women 's roles as agriculturists by presuming the Indian male should be the landowner and farmer . "
Cott writes : " Like ex-slaves and ex-polygamists , Indians were required by the federal government to adopt monogamy as ‘ the law of social life ' to become citizens . "
On the other hand , for black slaves in America , legal marriage was out of the question , though slaveholders did encourage childbearing to reproduce and expand the slave population , especially after 1808 when importation of slaves was banned .
" Concubinage , which is voluntary on the part of the slaves , and permissive on that of the master … in reality , is the relation , to which these people have ever been practically restricted , " wrote the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court in 1838 .
Thus the fight for the right to marriage , as an assertion of the right to control one 's own body and make a free contract with another human being , was seen as an important aspect of the fight for black freedom .
As it is with just about everything else in America , racism is deeply intertwined with marriage law .
Attempts to keep the " white race " " unmixed " were a unique feature of the American colonies since their inception ( with the peculiar result that people of all different skin tones and ancestral background are automatically considered " black " if there is even a hint of a black ancestor somewhere ) .
Ever since the inception of monogamous marriage and the family , from ancient times on , laws against intermarriage between different classes aimed to preserve ruling - class privileges .
Spain in 1776 had such laws , as did the British imperialists in Ireland in the 14th century , for example .
But America uniquely developed the illogic of racism , due to its slaveholding history , to such an extent that even after the victorious Civil War that freed the slaves , many states still banned black - white marriage ; in Mississippi the penalty was life imprisonment .
The miscegenation law was not repealed in Alabama until 2000 !
The relationship between slavery and women 's subordinate position in marriage was widely noted and utilized by those on both sides of the issues .
Southern evangelical Protestant ministers , who published more than half of pre-Civil War pro-slavery tracts , regularly quoted the Bible ; a typical claim was that god " included slavery as an organizing element in that family order which lies at the very foundation of Church and State . "
On the other side , those among the anti- slavery abolitionists and early women 's rights advocates who shared the liberal ideals of individual freedom and the view that " self - ownership " was a natural right , saw that both slaves and married women lacked this basic right .
As Lucy Stone put it , " Marriage is to woman a state of slavery .
It takes from her the right to her own property , and makes her submissive in all things to her husband . "
Following the Civil War , successive stages of immigration fed the fires of growing industrialization in the U.S.
Here too the government 's marriage policies were aimed at social control .
Chinese immigrants on the West Coast , who first came in the gold rush , were in demand for mining and railroad - building , but when the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869 , an explosion of anti-Chinese racism was unleashed .
The first federal step to restrict immigration , the Page Act of 1875 , was aimed at Asian women , who were supposedly all prostitutes , and required " the U.S. consul to make sure that any immigrant debarking from an Asian country was not under contract for ‘ lewd and immoral purposes ' . "
By 1913 eight states had laws against whites marrying Japanese or Chinese people .
" Free Love " Utopias and Polygamy
In the stormy years leading up to the great social explosion that was the American Civil War , the last progressive gasp of the bourgeoisie ( like the 1848 Revolutions in Europe ) in North America , many experimental utopian socialist alternatives to monogamous marriage flowered .
There were many " free love " communities established in the U.S. , inspired by such utopian visionaries as Robert Owen , Claude Saint - Simon and Charles Fourier , whose profound insight that the status of women is the decisive indicator of social progress inspired further Marxist theory on the subject .
The New York Oneida community , founded in 1849 with a pamphlet called Slavery and Marriage : A Dialogue , did away with the exclusive pairing of couples , though within a rather formal structure .
These groups , though ridiculed and condemned , were not by and large prosecuted before the Civil War , but afterward , when in the name of " consolidating " the nation , a crackdown on most forms of " social deviation " began .
One interesting — and still contemporary — group stands out in all this : the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , or Mormons , one of whose founding tenets is the right of men to polygamy , or multiple marriage to many women at once .
Right - wingers today throw up their hands in horror at gay marriage , breathlessly bemoaning that polygamy will be next .
Well , guess what , it 's already here , and has been for over a hundred years , out in Utah and other Western states , where an estimated 30,000 old - style Mormons still practice the sect 's early preaching , though the " official " church formally renounced it a long time ago .
We believe the Mormons have the right to be left alone , to practice their religion and live their private lives however they see fit .
Our position for the right of gay marriage , like the right of Mormons to practice polygamy , stems from our opposition to government interference with the rights of individuals to effect whatever consensual arrangements they wish .
We pointed out that American Mormons , including the women , essentially freely choose their practice , unlike in countries without bourgeois revolutions , where women are still little more than property of their patriarchal masters and where polygamous social systems must be relentlessly opposed .
As we wrote in " Free Tom Green !
Mormon Polygamists : Leave Them Alone ! " ( WV No. 764 , 14 September 2001 ) , defending a man convicted of felony bigamy charges :
" The family structure — whether monogamous or polygamous — necessarily oppresses women .
However , not everybody understands the source of their oppression , and people do all sorts of things that are undoubtedly bad for them that the state still has no business throwing them in prison for .
As Marxists we understand that the family serves a real social purpose and cannot simply be ‘ abolished , ' even in a workers state , but must be replaced with alternate social institutions . "
Women 's Liberation , Individual Freedoms and the Fight for Socialism
So , as radical columnist Alexander Cockburn put it , " Why rejoice when state and church extend their grip , which is what marriage is all about " ( " Sidestep on Freedom 's Path , " CounterPunch , 20 / 21 March ) .
Cockburn quotes early ACT UP activist Jim Eigo on the question : " Why are current mainstream gay organizations working to strike a bargain with straight society that will make some queers less equal than others ?...
Marriage has no more place in efforts to achieve equality than slavery or the divine right of kings .
At this juncture in history , would n't it make more sense for us to try to figure out how to relieve heterosexuals of the outdated shackles of matrimony ? "
It certainly would .
And it is the modern Marxist movement which has figured out how to break those shackles , through abolishing the system of private property in the means of production , thus abolishing the need for the bourgeois family structure to pass on such private wealth .
As Leon Trotsky , co-leader with Lenin of the 1917 Russian Revolution , wrote in response to the magazine Liberty ( 14 January 1933 ) which asked , " Is Bolshevism deliberately destroying the family ? " :
" If one understands by ‘ family ' a compulsory union based on the marriage contract , the blessing of the church , property rights , and the single passport , then Bolshevism has destroyed this policed family from the roots up .
" If one understands by ‘ family ' the unbounded domination of parents over children , and absence of legal rights for the wife , then Bolshevism has , unfortunately , not yet completely destroyed this carryover of society 's old barbarism .
" If one understands by ‘ family ' ideal monogamy — not in the legal but in the actual sense — then the Bolsheviks could not destroy what never was nor is on earth , barring fortunate exceptions . "

Please consider Bernanke Says ‘ Not Obvious ’ Asset Prices Misaligned .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said it ’s “ not obvious ” that asset prices in the U.S. are out of line with underlying values after a 64 percent jump in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index from its March low .
“ It is inherently extraordinarily difficult to know whether an asset ’s price is in line with its fundamental value , ” he said today in response to audience questions after a speech in New York .
“ It ’s not obvious to me in any case that there ’s any large misalignments currently in the U.S. financial system . ”
“ The best approach here if at all possible is to use supervisory and regulatory methods to restrain undue risk - taking and to make sure the system is resilient in case an asset - price bubble bursts in the future , ” Bernanke said .
On the possibility of using interest rates to pop bubbles , “ we can never say never , ” Bernanke said today .
“ We have to keep an open mind . ”
the Fed is ' attentive ' to changes in the dollar ’s value and “ will help ensure that the dollar is strong .
Bernanke :
Why are we still listening to this guy ?

From Alderaan to the Crab Nebula , if there is one thing that holds all God 's species together it is our faith that the selection of Miss Universe is impartial and free of favoritism .
Now that may be in doubt .
Information obtained by the Guanabee blog , in an exclusive interview with Michael Schwandt , choreographer of the last four pageants , tells that far from a purely scientific study of the looks , talents and poise of each contestant , one man 's preferences may be guiding the outcome of the race .
According to Schwandt , the dark hand of Miss Universe owner Donald Trump is in fact at work , behind the curtains , secretly culling the field of pageant thoroughbreds .
Apparently , the winnowing of the contest down to its 15 finalists happens not just in the meticulous parading and exhibiting skills viewers across the galaxies watch on TV , but in an Extra Special Private Judging Round in which contestants display themselves for Trump alone .
Explaining about Trump 's hands - on presence during the rehearsal Schwandt says in the Guanabee interview :
Then he does do something that 's a bit odd .
At all the shows , he pops in the day before the telecast and we line up all the girls in alphabetical order behind microphones .
And they say their name , age and country .
Then we line them up in alphabetical order in one single file line across the stage .
And he basically walks by and has an assistant that takes notes on all the girls .
And it 's just kind of common knowledge that he picks six of the top fifteen single - handedly .
So , the other nine of the top fifteen are judged in a preliminary show the week before and picked by those judges , but he picks six of the top fifteen .
The Miss Universe rules however , fail to note the Extra Special Private Judging Round and its impact on the race .
They state , in the website 's FAQ section :
HOW ARE THE SEMI - FINALISTS CHOSEN ?
In 1997 , a dual - paneled judging system was introduced .
One panel judges the preliminary rounds ; the other panel judges the live telecast .
All contestants are judged in three areas of preliminary competition which are not always televised due to time constraints :
1. Interviews - Judges spend time with each delegate to learn about her successes , goals and ambitions .
2. Swimsuit Competition - Each delegate wears one of a variety of swimsuit styles provided by a sponsor .
3. Evening Gown Competition - Each delegate wears a gown she has chosen for herself .
All scores are tallied in each of the three categories .
The contestants with the highest aggregate scores are named the semi-finalists .
The competition is narrowed twice more to produce the winner .
HOW ARE THE TITLEHOLDERS AND RUNNERS -UP SELECTED ?
Once the finalists are named , their scores are discarded , and they begin competing anew .
In the final competition , the same three areas ( Interview , Swimsuit and Evening Gown ) are judged .
The judges ' scores in these categories are tallied and the winners are named live on the air .
Further , according to the Guanabee interview , Trump instituted the Extra Special Private Round after he had raised concerns that the official judges had failed to adequately reward prettiness .
The interview reads :
Q : So , he 's orchestrating at least a portion of the results ?
A : Right .
And , his reason for doing so , as he told me and he's told the girls before , is that he left it all up to preliminary judging in the past and some of the most beautiful women , in his opinion , were not in the top fifteen and he was kind of upset about that .
And he decided that he would pick a certain number and let the judges pick a certain number .
Read the stunning interview in its entirety at Guanabee .
If there were one man fit to decide which of the Universe 's beauties is fit to reign over us all , that man would no doubt be Donald Trump .
However , without laws and regulations to govern even the most powerful of us , the Universe would be in chaos .
Donald Trump , give this competition back to your people !
WASHINGTON , D.C. November 13 , 2009 --
A group of researchers at the City College of New York is developing a new way to generate power for planes and automobiles based on materials known as piezoelectrics , which convert the kinetic energy of motion into electricity .
They will present their concept later this month at the 62nd Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society 's ( APS ) Division of Fluid Dynamics will take place from November 22 - 24 at the Minneapolis Convention Center .
About a half - inch by one inch in size , these devices might be mounted on the roof or tail of a car or on an airplane fuselage where they would vibrate inside a flow , producing an output voltage .
The power generated would not be enough to replace that supplied by the combustion engines , but it could run some system -- such as batteries that would be used to charge control panels and other small electronic devices such as mobile phones .
Led by CCNY professor Yiannis Andreopoulos , the researchers are currently attempting to optimize these devices by modeling the physical forces to which they are subjected in different air flows -- on the roof of a car , for instance , or on the back of a truck .
When the device is placed in the wake of a cylinder -- such as on the back of a truck -- the flow of air will cause the devices to vibrate in resonance , says Andreopoulos .
On the roof of car , they will shake in a much more unsteady flow known as a turbulent boundary layer .
In Minneapolis , Andreopoulos and his colleagues will present wind tunnel data showing how the devices work in both situations .
" These devices open the possibility to continuously scavenge otherwise wasted energy from the environment , " says Andreopoulos .
###
The presentation , " Harvesting energy in the wake of a circular cylinder using piezoelectric materials " by Dogus H. Akaydin , Niell Elvin , and Yiannis Andreopoulos of the City College of New York is at 8:00 a.m. on Sunday , November 22 , 2009 .

It ’s 8 p.m. Friday and the historic Towne Theatre downtown is sold out .
About 500 moviegoers have crowded into the three - screen movie house , paying up to $ 12 a ticket to watch not the latest Hollywood blockbuster but instead the premieres of three Indian movies that are opening simultaneously in India .
Tonight ’s showcase feature : the Tamil action thriller “ Aadhavan ” starring hunk Surya Sivakumar , who enjoys rock - star status among fans known to break out in cheers when his image appears on screen .
As couples , parents pushing children in strollers and bands of young men stream into the 81 - year - old theater , past the concession stand selling popcorn , mango juice and Indian fruit bread , an employee of the film ’s distributor is showing his gratitude .
He hands out doughy sweets called laddu , wishing patrons a “ Happy Diwali ” in Tamil , a salutation of the Hindu festival celebrating the victory of good over evil .
“ If you go to the AMC theater , they do n’t play South Indian movies .
This is our only option , ” said Sudhakar Desireddy , a software engineer for Cisco Systems Inc. and a Towne Theatre regular who sometimes attends showings twice a week .
“ There are so many Indians here .
. . .
The demand here is huge . ”
Welcome to one of the few bright spots for the stagnant U.S. movie theater industry : Indian cinema .
As the Indian film industry has mushroomed -- surpassing Hollywood as the most prolific producer of movies -- distributors of Bollywood and regional Indian films have been eager to broaden their global appeal , especially in the U.S. , which accounts for as much as 70 % of their movies ’ foreign box office .
The U.S. has a fast - growing and affluent population of Indian Americans : about 2.5 million people .
The Bay Area alone is home to an estimated 215,000 ethnic Indians , many of whom work in the Silicon Valley ’s high - tech industry and are hungry for entertainment from their home country .
Hoping to cash in on that appetite is Big Cinemas , India ’s largest movie theater chain .
Big Cinemas is a division of Reliance , the Mumbai - based conglomerate controlled by Indian billionaire Anil Ambani that is also bankrolling Steven Spielberg ’s DreamWorks studio and that also owns the Burbank postproduction house Lowry Digital .
In the last 18 months , Reliance has quietly assembled a group of 18 theaters around the country , with most offering a mix of Indian and Hollywood films and some , like the theater in San Jose , exclusively featuring Indian movies .
The company now operates 181 screens in the U.S. , ranking as the 25th - largest theater operator in the country .
Big Cinemas ’ goal : to build the nation ’s first theater circuit catering to Indian Americans and other ethnic groups passed over by the major chains .
It plans to open half a dozen more theaters targeted to Indian American audiences in Los Angeles -- it already has a theater in Norwalk -- and in Seattle , Dallas , Houston , Miami and Tampa , Fla . .
“ What we found is that there is a critical mass of audiences in the U.S. , but they are underserved , ” said Uday Kumar , who oversees Reliance ’s Big Cinemas operation in North America .
“ We saw an untapped demand . ”
Traditionally , Indian film distributors have had to ply the backwaters of the U.S. market , where their movies frequently were booked into third - tier theaters that lacked even such basics as reliable accounting systems for ticket receipts .
Many potential patrons preferred to stay at home and watch movies , often from pirated DVDs , rather than venture out to often run-down theaters , said Big Cinemas executives .
Seeking to upgrade the experience and the environment , Big Cinemas is spending $ 12 million to renovate theaters -- many of which it acquired from mom-and - pop operators -- with new digital projectors and sound systems , computerized accounting controls , stadium seating and concession stands serving Indian food .
A refurbished 12 - screen multiplex in North Bergen , N.J. , features a Bombay Cafe that serves such treats as samosas , papdichaat and mango lassi .
Another newly remodeled theater in the Chicago suburb of Niles features a full - service Indian restaurant , bar and lounge .
At the same time , Reliance reached out to Indian film distributors , offering to act as a “ one - stop shop ” to deliver their movies across the U.S. via a company - owned fiber - optic network that pipes films directly from Mumbai to New York .
That assures quicker and cheaper distribution than in the past , when canisters of film would have to be flown in and could get held up in customs , causing costly delays .
Lacking expertise in the U.S. market , Reliance formed a joint venture with Phoenix Theatres , a small , privately held company in Knoxville , Tenn. , to manage the entire Big Cinemas circuit .
“ They realized it was a different ballgame in the States , ” said Phil Zacheretti , a former executive with theater giant Regal Cinemas who founded Phoenix and now manages Big Cinemas ’ day - to - day operations .
Although some of major theater chains do show Bollywood films at a few locations , they do n’t pose a serious threat to Big Cinemas , Zacheretti said .
“ They are not going to serve samosas , ” he noted , adding that the theaters , for Indian Americans , are as much social points as they are entertainment centers .
“ Our theaters become the gathering place where families can meet in the lobby before and after the movies . ”
As a further draw , Big Cinemas plans to use its theaters to show live cricket matches -- India ’s most popular sport -- popular TV shows like the Indian adaptation of “ Dancing With the Stars ” and even religious festivals beamed via satellite from India .
So far , its U.S. theaters are a drop in the bucket for a conglomerate like Reliance , generating about $ 25 million in annual revenue .
The business is n’t expected to become profitable until next year because of the investment in renovations , Kumar said .
Still , Reliance takes a long - term view and even foresees using its theaters to sell other products , such as DVDs , as well as sell advertising space to companies , like Western Union , that want to target ethnic Indians .
“ We see an opportunity to mine the Indian diaspora in the U.S. , to market a whole range of products to them , ” said Anil Arjun , who heads Reliance ’s worldwide theater operations .
The company also is looking beyond Bollywood to screen movies for other “ niche audiences . ”
The Niles , Ill. , theater , for example , regularly offers Polish , Korean and Russian movies and even the occasional Mongolian flick , as well as Indian fare .
“ We ’re testing the waters , ” Kumar said .
“ But there ’s no reason we ca n’t do the same thing for other [ ethnic ] groups . ”

Few science fiction shows inspire so many naughty ideas as Futurama .
Go looking for regular images of the Planet Express crew , and you 'll probably stumble across porn quickly .
We sifted through and found the absolute sexiest and weirdest .
It 's NSFW !

Seriously , you have to make a major effort to avoid Futurama porn — go to Google image search and , if you have " safe search " turned off , most of the hits for Futurama will be R- rated or X - rated .
The hard part is finding the good stuff .
We sorted through thousands of naked Leela pictures , and perverted Bender pics , to find the absolute greatest .
Why does Futurama inspire so much lust ?
Well , it 's a cartoon , and cartoons have always been easy / fun fodder for pornographers .
But it 's also a genuinely fun show with sexy characters .
There are few characters , human or robot , as perverted and grungy as Bender .
And Leela 's purple - haired cyclops look is the essence of cuteness .
Most Futurama porn revolves around Leela and Amy , with Fry in the mix sometimes .
But there 's a surprisingly large amount of Bender porn ( including having sex with the Professor ( !? ) and even Dr. Zoidberg porn .
Because there really is something for everybody .

Breasts do not differ only in shape and size .
It is much more complicated than that .
The tissue of the female breast comprises a mixture of fatty and glandular tissues and also connective tissues , like collagen ( support fibrous proteins ) , ligaments and blood vessels , but the proportion of every breast tissue is different from woman to woman .
Women with much more glandular tissue have denser tissue on a mammogram and are about four times more likely to develop breast cancer than those with fatty breasts .
An Israeli research presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America ( RSNA ) 2007 investigated the way Western lifestyle affects breast structure .
A team led by Dr. Miriam Sklair - Levy from Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem made comparisons between the breast composition of Native or European - rooted Israeli women and Ethiopian Jewish women who came to Israel more recently .
The research discovered that the Ethiopian - born Jewish women who have immigrated to Israel presented much lower breast density than the women born in Israel .
Moreover , older Ethiopian Jewish immigrants who had started to adopt the Western lifestyle ( low number of children , western diet or use of hormonal pills ) presented much higher breast densities than those who came to Israel more recently .
This research has the same results with those of another recent British study showing that women living in urban areas have unhealthy denser breasts than those inhabiting rural areas .
Digital mammograms of the 972 British women , aged 45 to 54 , revealed that 69 % of the rural women had dense breasts , while in suburban women the number went to 74 % and in urban - dwelling subjects to 78 % .
" I work all my time in the city of London and I read mammograms of very dense breasts .
But every time I have gone outside to read mammograms elsewhere in more rural areas or parts of Europe that are rural , I am very impressed with the less dense breast tissue that is there , " lead researcher Dr. Nicholas M. Perry , director of The London Breast Institute at The Princess Grace Hospital in London , U.K. told CTV .
The results of both studies have been related to lifestyle , like obesity , exercising and stress levels , but also to hormonal contraceptive pills .
Also women in rural areas or developing countries have children earlier and in greater number .
Some say this is due to the air pollution , specifically " polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons " , which imitate female sex hormones , unbalancing hormones in the body .
Police Raid in Munich Germany Suspects China of Spying on Uighur Expatriates

Today , the < source > element provides a combination of MIME type ( including codecs parameter ) and media query to determine the available sources .
We think an interesting use case is one where two sources use the same codecs but are encoded with different properties .
For example , they may have different bit rates .
Alternatively , two audio sources may be in different languages .
We 're still actively debating this but would welcome feedback on this idea .

Child porn fears scupper airport ‘ nude X - ray ’ scans
Virtual ' strip ' :
A scan image showing a hidden knife , highlighted
Airport security chiefs have been banned from subjecting children to a controversial new X - ray scanner that produces ‘ naked ’ pictures of passengers because of legal warnings the images may break child pornography laws .
The full - body scanner , which can spot weapons and explosives hidden under clothing , was launched with great fanfare at Manchester Airport last week .
But now – with the system due to begin operating at full capacity at Manchester ’s Terminal 2 next week – security chiefs have been told no one under 18 can be subjected to the new checks .
Child protection experts have warned that the image produced by the Rapiscan machines may break the law which prevents the creation of an indecent image or pseudo - image of a child .
The legislation , the Protection of Children Act 1978 , could potentially have led to security officers facing criminal charges for doing their job by examining the images .
Airport bosses had originally intended to allow children to be scanned during the 12 - month trial if their parents gave consent .
But they changed their minds after they were approached by the civil rights group Action on Rights for Children , which has campaigned against the use of body scanners on children .
The group argues the machines are disproportionately intrusive and remove a child ’s right to dignity , particularly given that many youngsters are sensitive about their bodies .
Last night a Manchester Airport spokesman confirmed that all staff had been told not to allow children to be scanned by the new equipment .
He said : ‘ Our lawyers and child welfare groups have warned us this is a legal grey area .
‘ We do not want to open ourselves or our staff to the possibility of legal action , so we have decided children will not be subjected to these scans and will continue to face normal security checks . ’
The Department for Transport hoped the virtual strip - search device would provide the solution to long queues at security checkpoints at all airports .
The equipment means passengers are no longer required to remove their shoes and coats for security checks .
And it also does away with the need for physical ‘ pat - down ’ searches on those who trigger an alarm when they pass through traditional scanner arches because they have forgotten to hand over their keys or other metal objects .
A member of security staff would see a ' naked ' front and back view of the passenger ( left ) and a computer graphic ( right ) which will highlight in red which areas of the passenger needs to be checked by fellow staff members
The Rapiscan works by beaming electromagnetic waves on to passengers as they stand in a booth , creating a virtual three - dimensional black - and - white ‘ naked ’ image from the reflected energy and sending it to a computer monitor elsewhere in the airport where it is examined by a security officer .
The whole process takes only about 20 seconds and then the image is deleted .
But the scans show every contour of people ’s bodies – even revealing breast implants – which some may find intrusive .

Gay marriage advocates say they will fight on despite the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee recommending against same - sex marriage .
Australian Marriage Equality spokesman Alex Greenwich said the fight for marriage rights would continue .
“ This Inquiry has shown that marriage equality is passionately supported by many Australians from all walks of life – gay and straight , religious and non-religious , conservative and progressive , ” he said .
“ Kevin Rudd ’s obsession with opposing full equality for same - sex couples leaves us with no choice but to make marriage equality a key issue in the run up to the next federal election . ”
Greenwich welcomed the report ’s recommendation to remove a government ban on gay and lesbian Australians obtaining the official government documents required to enter into same - sex marriages overseas .
The restriction has been in place since 2004 .
The Committee has recommended the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issue Certificates of Non-Impediment to same - sex couples on the same basis they are issued for opposite - sex couples .
ACON CEO Nicolas Parkhill labelled the Committee ’s position contradictory .
“ To recommend the equal treatment of same - sex couples but then to also recommend the retention of unequal marriage laws is perplexing to say the least , ” he said .
“ It appears that in the eyes of the Senate Committee , all couples are equal but some are more equal than others . ”
A woman who operates the so - called Underground Restaurant from her London home has had a surprise threat from a movie company .
The host of the party , known as Ms Marmite Lover , had arranged a Halloween party with a Harry Potter theme , but Warner Bros.
took exception and sent their lawyers to turn her evening into a newt .
“ Since I started The Underground Restaurant in London nine months ago , pop-up or home restaurants have increased in popularity up and down the country , ” wrote Ms Marmite Lover in a Guardian article in October .
“ My initial idea was simple : provide well - cooked food in intimate surroundings at a reasonable price , with an element of punk rebellion and a do it yourself attitude which sprung from my background in a political samba band and cooking at anti-G8 camps .
I wanted to stick it to the Man . ”
Now , it seems , the Man has stuck it to both her and her not - for - profit events .
Ms Lover had arranged a couple of Halloween meals to take place in her house ( ‘ somewhere ’ in Kilburn , North London ) for this coming Friday and Saturday , with a seemingly - appropriate Harry Potter theme .
Rather than just sit - down - and - eat , Ms Lover had some elaborate plans for diners .
Following a journey down Diagon Alley , a password would be given to the Fat Lady to gain entrance .
Then how about some lovely Butterbeer along with Dumbledore ’s favorite sweets , lemon sherbets and mint humbugs , and a nice starter of pumpkin soup with Witches hat pumpkin pasties ?
Or would the whole thing be more creative with the addition of Lord Voldemort lawyers from the movie industry ?
In a letter addressed to Ms Marmite Lover ( yes Warner , of course that ’s her real name ) , the company ’s European Legal and Business Affairs division explains that although the company is “ delighted ” that she is such a fan of the Harry Potter series , “ unfortunately your proposed use of the Harry Potter Properties … without our consent would amount to an infringement of Warner ’s rights . ”
The lawyers then asked Ms Lover to confirm that the nights were now canceled , although noting that they had no problem if she held a “ generic wizard ” night .
“ I ’ve written back , saying that I ’ve changed the title of the event to Generic Wizard night , ” writes Ms Lover .
“ But I added that J.K .
Rowling herself , having at one time been a struggling single parent , and having donated to the National Council of One Parent Families , would probably approve of a single mother being entrepreneurial and creative . ”
Do Warner own the rights .
Yes .
Can they do this legally ?
Of course .
Should they ?
Absolutely , as long as they do n’t mind coming over as petty , trivial and small minded , with a penchant for stifling creativity .
Is Dick Cheney 's ego writing checks his poll numbers can't cash ?
That seems to be the bet the Democratic National Committee is making , going back to the Cheney well again with a new TV ad slamming him for being " wrong " and " wrong again " on a host of issues , including Iraq ( both how we'd be greeted and what we 'd find ) and most recently " enhanced interrogation techniques " ( or what before 9/11 we simply called " torture " ) .
As The Plum Line 's Greg Sargent points out , this appears to be the first time the Democrats as a party have said that Cheney was flatly wrong on torture .

When PepsiCo Inc. did n't show up in Jefferson County Circuit Court to defend itself against accusations it hijacked the idea of two Wisconsin men to sell water in bottles , a judge decided against the soft - drink maker and handed the pair one big gulp of a damage award - $ 1.26 billion .
Now PepsiCo , alarmed by the enormous default judgment , is pushing hard to have the award rescinded .
Although the case was filed in April and the damage award was handed down by Circuit Judge Jacqueline R. Erwin on Sept. 30 , PepsiCo contends the proper people in the company did n't even know about it until Oct. 5 because of a series of miscues .
PepsiCo did not immediately respond to a Journal Sentinel request for comment , but company spokesman Joe Jacuzzi told the Associated Press the company feels it has been denied due process and wants the opportunity to defend itself , although it acknowledges an " internal process issue . "
One of the reasons for PepsiCo 's delayed response , according to court documents , was that a secretary in PepsiCo 's legal department was so busy she did not tell anyone about a letter regarding the case or enter it into a log that tracks such matters .
The case was filed by Charles A. Joyce of Juneau and James R. Voigt of Cleveland , who allege that in 1981 they entered into confidentiality agreements with an executive of Watertown - based Pepsi products distributor Wis - Pak Inc. and an executive of Carolina Canners Inc. of Cheraw , S.C. , about their idea for a new product .
Joyce and Voigt contend that Wis -Pak and Carolina Canners breached their confidentiality agreement with them because Pepsi began making and distributing its purified bottled water product Aquafina .
The lawsuit argues that PepsiCo used information it knew was secret when it began selling Aquafina years later .
Pepsi is asking the judge to vacate her $ 1.26 billion award , saying the plaintiffs did n't properly serve PepsiCo with the complaint and that the soft - drink maker acted diligently once it became aware of it .
PepsiCo 's local attorney , Robert W. Roth , of Menomonee Falls , contends the judgment is " unprecedented " and that the company has " strong defenses " against it .
" The sole basis for the plaintiffs ' claims - the confidentiality agreements - are nearly 30 years old and fail to show any connection between the alleged trade secret and PepsiCo 's sale of Aquafina , " Roth argued in court documents .
Voigt referred a reporter 's questions to his Chicago attorney , David C. Van Dyke , who could not be reached .
A phone call to the Chuck A. Joyce residence was not answered Wednesday .

The brain is our most complex but least understood organ .
We can name its parts but our knowledge of what each part does , or how , is rudimentary .
In The Brain Book , journalist Rita Carter has assembled what is known about the nerve centre of each individual and explains with the aid of images and graphics its structure , function and disorders .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The moral brain
When rail worker Phineas Gage blew a hole in the front of his brain while tampering with explosives in 1848 , he provided one of the earliest insights into how the organ worked .
The explosion drove a rod through his cheek and out through the top of his head , causing him to lose the sight of his left eye but , remarkably , little other damage .
However , his personality changed dramatically and from being a conscientious , polite and thoughtful man , he became rude , reckless and socially irresponsible .
Damage to several areas of the brain involved in feeling and thinking can affect moral judgement .
Belief and superstition
A complex interplay of genes , culture and upbringing contribute to people 's belief systems , which provide a framework for their experience .
But certain aspects may directly reflect brain activity .
Some scientists have suggested that supernatural experiences may be the result of disturbances in the brain .
The feelings of ecstasy that accompany them have been attributed to tiny seizures in the temporal lobes .
Temporal lobe disturbance has also been associated with the sense of an invisible presence that people who claim to have seen ghosts often report .
Out - of - the - body experiences have been linked to reduced activity in the parietal lobes , which normally maintain a stable sense of space and time .
Creativity
There is a striking difference in the brains of musicians who play from a score in front of them and those who improvise .
Brain imaging studies have shown that the frontal lobes are activated when musicians are reading the notes but turn off in improvisation , allowing ideas to " float " .
Research suggests that this reflects wider creative processes .
When the brain relaxes out of sharp attentiveness , shown by tightly - compressed gamma waves on the EEG , into its " idling " mode , marked by slow alpha waves , that is when new ideas tend to occur .
Stimuli that might otherwise be ignored are allowed to enter awareness and can resonate with thoughts , memories and existing knowledge .
Sex differences
Brains are as individual to people as faces .
But there are broad differences between the sexes , and between differing sexual orientations .
The corpus callosum , which links the two sides of the brain , is better developed in women than men .
It has been suggested this is why women are more emotionally aware – the right side associated with the emotions is better linked to the left side , the seat of analytical thought .
Brain scans of gay people show structures associated with mood , emotion , anxiety and aggression tend to resemble those in the opposite sex .
In gay women , for example , the right side of the brain tends to be larger , a feature shared with heterosexual men .
Patterns are similar between gay men and heterosexual women , especially in areas involved with anxiety .
Personality
Studies of the brain have raised the possibility that personality may be " visible " from the activity in different brain areas .
At the crudest level , a person with a " sensitive " brain – one that produces more activity in response to a mild stimulus – are less likely to indulge in sensation - seeking or adrenaline sports than those with " insensitive " brains , who need a lot of stimulation to produce the same level of excitement .
Extroverts have reduced activity in response to stimuli in the neural circuit that keeps the brain aroused – involving the prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex and the thalamus .
People who like novelty have strong links between the hippocampus and the striatum , while shy people show a strong reaction to unfriendly - looking faces in the amygdala .
Optimism , co-operation and aggression can be traced to activity - specific brain areas .
Does size matter ?
Brains tend to vary little in size , but there are exceptions .
Jonathan Swift , the author of Gulliver 's Travels , had a brain which weighed an enormous 2,000 grams when he died in 1754 , while the brain of Ivan Pavlov , the Russian physiologist who discovered the Pavlovian response , weighed barely 1,500 grams .
There is no link between size of brain and intellect but other features may be important .
Einstein 's brain , removed after his death , was missing part of a groove that runs through the parietal lobe .
The area affected is concerned with mathematics and spatial reasoning and it is thought the missing groove may have allowed neurons in that area to communicate more easily .
If so , it could account for his extraordinary talent .
The ageing brain
Most neurons in the brain remain healthy until death .
But the brain itself shrinks by 5 - 10 per cent between the ages of 20 and 90 .
Other changes include a widening of the grooves and the formation of plaques and tangles – small disc - shaped growths .
The significance of these changes is not understood – they may occur in the brains of healthy people and those with Alzheimer 's disease .
However myelin decay , affecting the myelin sheath that insulates the neurons , increases with age and can mean brain circuits are less efficient , causing problems with balance and memory .
However , decay in the physical brain may be compensated for by the accumulation of knowledge and experience , resulting in improved intellectual performance .
Exercise , a healthy diet and engaging in mental tasks such as chess or crossword puzzles can slow mental decline and protect against memory loss .
Headache and migraine
A headache is the commonest reason for taking painkillers – yet the brain has no pain - sensitive nerve receptors .
Tension in the meninges – the membranes that surround the brain – or in the blood vessels or muscles of the head and neck may account for some headaches .
In others , such as migraines , the pain may be due to a surge of neuronal activity .
Migraines usually occur at the front or side of the head and the pain often gets worse with movement .
They have a range of triggers – specific foods , tiredness , hormonal changes , emotional factors , or even a change in the weather .
A classic migraine attack can last for days and include a postdrome phase during which the sufferer experiences difficulty focusing , poor concentration and increased sensitivity .
Memory
A patient known as HM had brain surgery to control epileptic seizures in 1953 , which involved removal of large areas of the hippocampus from both hemispheres of his brain .
The operation successfully controlled his epilepsy but had a disastrous side - effect – it destroyed his ability to remember .
Like a sufferer from severe Alzheimer 's disease , HM was from that day unable to recall , people , places or events .
Whenever he met someone , even though he had seen them many times a day , for months or years , he did not recognise them .
The case demonstrated the essential role the hippocampus plays in memory storage .
Sleep and dreaming
Without sleep we would die .
Sleep is essential for health and if we get too little , the brain becomes confused , and we lose the ability to think and remember .
Yet our understanding of what makes sleep so important is still limited .
Sleep - wake cycles are controlled by neurotransmitters that act on areas of the brain .
There is also a brain chemical , adenosine , which builds up in the blood during waking hours and begins to cause drowsiness .
Once we are asleep it is gradually broken down .
Dreaming is most apparent during REM ( rapid eye movement ) sleep , when the brain is highly active .
In deep sleep , brain activity reduces but dreams still occur , often emotionally charged .
Unconsciousness
The conscious brain is responsive to sound , light and pain .
But levels of consciousness can descend through confusion , delirium and stupor to coma , under the influence of drink or drugs , injury or infection , and tiredness .
Coma results from damage to the parts of the brain involved in maintaining consciousness , especially the limbic system and the brain stem .
There are various degrees of coma , from shallow to deep .
In the less severe forms the person may respond to certain stimuli , such as a sudden sound , with a turn of the head or small movements .
In persistent vegetative state , the person may appear to sleep and wake and to move their eyes and limbs as if they were awake , but be unresponsive .
In deep coma there is no response to stimuli although automatic movements such as blinking and breathing are maintained .

WASHINGTON --
The Chinese government is ratcheting up its cyberspying operations against the U.S. , a congressional advisory panel found , citing an example of a carefully orchestrated campaign against one U.S. company that appears to have been sponsored by Beijing .
The unnamed company was just one of several successfully penetrated by a campaign of cyberespionage , according to the U.S. - China Economic and Security Review Commission report to be released Thursday .

How the Media Have Depicted the Economic Crisis During Obama ’s Presidency
The gravest economic crisis since the Great Depression has been covered in the media largely from the top down , told primarily from the perspective of the Obama Administration and big business , and reflected the voices and ideas of people in institutions more than those of everyday Americans , according to a new study by Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism .
Citizens may be the primary victims of the downturn , but they have not been not the primary actors in the media depiction of it .
A PEJ content analysis of media coverage of the economy during the first half of 2009 also found that the mainstream press focused on a relatively small number of major story lines , mostly generating from two cities , the country ’s political and financial capitals .
A companion analysis of a broader array of media using new “ meme tracker ” technology developed at Cornell University finds that phrases and ideas that reverberated most in the coverage came early on , mostly from government , particularly from the president and the chairman of the Federal Reserve , and that few Republicans in Congress articulated any memes that got much traction .
As the story moved away from Washington — and the news about the economy seemed to improve — the amount of coverage of the economy also dropped off substantially .
These are a few of the findings from the comprehensive study of media coverage of the economy since Obama took office .
The PEJ report is comprised of three different analyses of the media ’s economic coverage .
The basic narrative of the coverage was studied from February 1 through August 31 , an analysis of about 9,950 stories from television , radio , cable , newspapers and online .
A more detailed analysis of the sourcing in stories , the datelines , the events that triggered each story and the differences between media sectors was conducted for a shorter period , from February 1 through July 3 .
The third element , an examination of the precise phrases and ideas that resonated most fully in the media was conducted in collaboration with researchers at Cornell University and Stanford University .
This third element included an even larger universe of media – millions of different web - based outlets , including mainstream news sites , new media sites and blog RSS feeds .
Among the findings :
Three storylines have dominated : efforts to help revive the banking sector , the battle over the stimulus package and the struggles of the U.S. auto industry .
Together they accounted for nearly 40 % of the economic coverage from February 1 through August 31 .
Other topics related to the crisis have been covered much less .
As an example , all the reporting of retail sales , food prices , the impact of the crisis on Social Security and Medicare , its effect on education and the implications for health care combined accounted for just over 2 % of all the economic coverage .
Actions by government officials and business leaders drove much of the coverage .
The White House and federal agencies alone initiated nearly a third ( 32 % ) of economic stories studied through July 3 .
Business triggered another 21 % .
About a quarter of the stories ( 23 % ) was initiated by the press itself and did not rely on an external news trigger .
Ordinary citizens and union workers combined to act as the catalyst for only 2 % of the stories about the economy .
Fully 76 % of the datelines on economic stories studied during the first five months of the Obama presidency were New York ( 44 % ) or metro Washington D.C. ( 32 % ) .
Only about one - fifth ( 21 % ) of the stories originated in any other city in the U.S. , and about a quarter of those emanated from two other major media centers : Atlanta and Los Angeles .
When it came to which phrases and ideas reverberated most in a broad array of media , an analysis of some 1.6 million news websites , blogs and other online sources finds that the president dominated .
Nine of the top 20 most - quoted phrases came from him .
But among Republicans , it was 38 - year - old Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal ’s voice that carried the furthest — not any of the national party leaders .
Overall , Republicans accounted for just four of the top 20 “ memes ” tracked in the analysis .
The US government 's latest reading on the workplace includes a whiff of what may lie ahead for unemployed Americans .
And it 's not exactly pleasant .
What if your job reappeared , but the work load increased and your raises were so paltry that you never seemed to get ahead ?
That 's exactly what happened to American workers in the third quarter .
Their productivity was on a tear , rising at an annual rate of 9.5 percent in nonfarm businesses from the previous quarter , according to a US Labor Department report released Thursday .
It 's the biggest seasonally adjusted gain in six years ( click on chart at right ) .
That boost in productivity helped push down unit labor costs – the amount that the boss pays you to produce a unit of output – by 5.2 percent at an annualized rate .
Over a year 's time , they fell 3.6 percent , the biggest drop in 41 years of federal record - keeping .
But how business achieved these gains is less encouraging for workers .
They were more productive last quarter because they created 4 percent more output but worked 5 percent fewer hours compared with the previous quarter .
True , employers paid a little more for the stepped - up work – 0.5 percent higher than a year ago .
But that 's the smallest annual gain on record , points out Michael Feroli , senior US economist with JPMorgan Chase in New York .
Given all the unemployed people still looking for a job , " it 's hard to see a very strong acceleration of compensation growth . "
All this is great news for employers , because it makes them more competitive with rivals overseas and allows them to grow , creating new jobs .
But for workers in the next couple of years , it could well mean more work per hour with not much of an annual raise .
" Forget the rise in the oil price to $ 80 a barrel , it 's a sideshow compared with the collapse in labor costs , " writes Paul Ashworth , senior US economist at Capital Economics in Toronto , in an analysis .
" These savings will feed through into lower final prices .
The upshot is that deflation is still by far the biggest threat " to the economy .

I have been using Okra for a couple of months now after having worked on it for a few weeks .
Although " a couple of months " should be seen in the perspective of someone with a full - time job , a wife and a kid .
While researching avenues to do games and graphics programming from CL and while working on Okra I often had this Usenet thread from comp.lang.
lisp on my mind : C++ to CLOS mapping .
Very disheartening .
However , I 'm currently prototyping a mobile game using Okra which has procedurally generated textured terrain , animated models walking on that terrain and mouse picking down to the triangle level .
Let me be the first to say that I would love to have native games , graphics , physics and input libraries for CL but they are simple either not available or not mature enough .
So that leaves either writing those myself in CL or talking to the outside world .
Since I 'm mainly interested in games programming and not engine building the latter choice was the obvious one for me , not in the least since it would take far less time ( weeks versus months ) to get decent results on the screen .
So here are some of my observations in no specific order : Abstractions over the raw FFI calls to C++ are quickly made and once you have those the programming experience is suffiently ' Lispy ' to be pleasant .
Performance is good enough for prototyping and even simple games .
You will not see cutting edge AAA titles released with Okra in the near future though .
New minor versions of Ogre are handled well by the automatic bindings generator .
Okra was started when Ogre was at 1.6.2 and it is at 1.6.4 now and I had no problems following the upgrades .
Keep in mind that Ogre is a very well written and stable library .
I do expect the step to 1.7 to be more problematic .
I would have spent far more time doing the explorative programming projects in C++ than it took me doing them in CL .
Additionally they would have been far less fun .
This is also due to me being even less versed in C++ than I am in Common Lisp .
Portability between Linux and Windows has not been much of a problem .
I can move pretty effortlessly between different combinations of Linux / Windows Vista / Windows XP and CLISP / Clozure CL / SBCL .
I did have to turn to #lisp once for a problem with SBCL on Linux ( thanks pkhuong ! ) .
My main problems have been hardware related : my machine at work I use to test now and then has an old on - board Intel 910 that barfs on some Ogre material scripts which use shaders .
That 's it for now , I 'll add more points when I remember them :)

Google ’s favorite sentence
Asked if he what he would do if he could “ wave a magic wand ” to create a back - end net technology that “ we do n’t have today , ” Gill waxed cryptic about Google ’s famously distributed online infrastructure — which treats data centers as “ warehouse - scale ” machines — touching on the idea of moving loads from any data center that ’s in danger of overheating .
“ What we are building here ... is warehouse - sized compute platforms , ” Gill said .
“ You have to have integration with everything right from the chillers down all the way to the CPU .
“ Sometimes , there ’s a temperature excursion , and you might want to do a quick load - shedding — a quick load - shedding to prevent a temperature excursion because , hey , you have a data center with no chillers .
You want to move some load off .
You want to cut some CPUs and some of the processes in RAM . ”
And he indicated the company could do this automatically and near - instantly — meaning without human intervention .
“ How do you manage the system and optimize it on a global level ?
That is the interesting part , ” Gill continued .
“ What we ’ve got here [ with Google ] is massive — like hundreds of thousands of variable linear programming problems that need to run in quasi - real - time .
When the temperature starts to excurse in a data center , you do n’t have the luxury to sitting around for a half an hour …
You have on the order of seconds . ”
Asked if this was a technology Google is using today , Gill responded with one of Google ’s favorite sentences .
“ I could not possibly comment on that , " he said .
When we later asked uber Googler Matt Cutts about this — with a Google PR man listening on the line —
Cutts gave another Googly response : “ I do n't believe we have published any papers regarding that , ” he said .
But it would seem that Gill was referring to Spanner .
And judging from Dean ’s presentation , the technology has already been deployed .
As reported by Data Center Knowledge , Google has also said that its new data center in Saint - Ghislain , Belgium , operates without chillers .
Apparently , Spanner is used to automatically move loads out of the Belgium facility when the outside air gets too hot during the summer .
Additional information is sketchy .
Dean refers to Spanner as a “ single global namespace , ” with names completely independent of the location of the data .
The design is similar to BigTable , Google ’s distributed database , but rather than organizing data in rows , it uses hierarchical directories .
Dean also mentions “ zones of semi- autonomous control , ” indicating that Google splits its distributed infrastructure into various subsections that provide redundancy by operating independently of each other .
The goal , Dean says , is to provide access to data in less than 50 milliseconds 99 per cent of the time .
And Google aims to store data on at least two disks in the European Union , two in US , and one in Asia .
But one has to wonder how far this technology has actually progressed .
Over the past year , two much - discussed Gmail outages occurred when Google was moving workloads between data centers .
Clearly , Google has talent for distributed computing .
But it also has talent for leaking just enough information to make you think it must doing something that no one else could possibly do . ®
How Our Federal Criminal Defense Attorneys Can Assist You
If you face federal criminal charges , your case may be based on :
Indictment by a federal grand jury .
In the federal criminal justice system , the prosecution presents evidence to a grand jury , which then decides to issue formal criminal charges , known as an indictment .
You respond to an indictment as you would other criminal charges .
But , if you know an indictment is imminent or that a federal investigation is underway , that can be a highly beneficial time to seek the legal assistance of a federal criminal defense attorney .

National Park Service properties , such as Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area , Ellis Island , Gateway National Recreation Area and Fort Hancock , Morristown National Historical Park , New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve , etc .
If you are arrested on federal property or by federal law enforcement officers for any legal offense , the related charges are filed by the U.S. government and are referred to the federal court system .
Federal installations in New Jersey include :
Crimes of violence , property destruction , service disruption or interfering with a Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) official at an airport may be prosecuted as federal crimes , as well .
Sometimes , a case that is being investigated by state and / or local officials becomes a federal case if multiple people , multiple alleged instances of crime and / or large amounts of money or contraband ( drugs , illegal weapons , etc. ) are involved .
When a series of indictments allege multiple people have colluded to form a criminal enterprise , the government may , in addition to conspiracy charges , levy RICO charges under the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act .
If you have been arrested and are being held , we will work first to have you released for the lowest amount of bail possible or released on your own recognizance ( ROR ) .
We can also begin immediately to investigate your case , including reaching out to contacts with the U.S. Attorney ’s Office to work to keep the most serious potential charges against you from even being considered .
In cases before a grand jury , we can :
Monitor the investigation and the grand jury testimony to get an idea of the evidence against you
Investigate the facts of the case , and the evidence and charges under consideration
Advise you about your own testimony and / or cooperation with investigators , if you are subpoenaed
It is not unusual for us to negotiate the conversion of a client ’s status in an investigation from “ target ” to “ unindicted coconspirator , ” “ person of interest , ” or “ witness . ”
In certain situations , we can negotiate with the government for you to testify under a grant of immunity .
If you are indicted , we can begin immediately to work on our challenges to the government ’s case .
We may be able to attack the charges on the basis of flawed testimony or lack of credibility among alleged coconspirators or undercover agents .
Sometimes , such as when alleged coconspirators face more serious charges , we can leverage your knowledge of the case or the names of confidential informants to convince the government to reduce or drop charges against you .
In some cases , such as simple arrests on federal property or charges transferred from state to federal court , we may be able to challenge the government ’s case due to :
Improper or illegal search and seizure
Chain of custody issues with evidence alleged to have been in your possession , such as drugs or weapons
Mistaken identity , due to a flawed lineup or false accusations , or another procedural error
Racial , ethnic , socio- economic or other bias against you
When necessary , or if it best serves your interests , we will be ready for trial with a case that demonstrates to judge and jury that justice demands a not - guilty verdict .
Federal charges are often based on complex cases and laws , which can make it tougher for the federal government to prove its allegations .
It is important that you understand what you ’re up against , for better or worse , and that you have skilled and experienced legal representation .
Call or fill out our online form today to talk to one of our experienced federal crimes defense attorneys about your case .
We can meet in any of our nine offices in New Jersey to outline the legal options available , and the best steps to take to protect yourself from federal authorities .

Closed 7 years ago .
So , the big buzz in the last few days is Go , the new language from Google .
Assuming you 're all obsessive programming language geeks like me , you 've all downloaded it , built it , and run your " Hello , 世界 " program ( is n't it nice using a language written by the inventors of UTF - 8 ? ) .
You 've all read the tutorial , Effective Go , and some of the other docs .
Now , what are you going to do with it ?
I 'd like to see some demos that show off the power of Go .
What can you do in a brief program ?
Show off your best example code .
While the true measure of a language can't really be taken until you 've written and maintained a large codebase with a team of many programmers over the course of a project with changing requirements , seeing how much you can do in a limited amount of code does help to demonstrate the expressive power of a language .
I 'd like to see short , complete programs that truly exercise the unique new features of Go ; not just snippets or " Hello , World " .
So , post some cool code you 've written with Go .
Take advantage of its unique features , like its goroutines and channels for concurrency , or its interface based type system .
Can you write a primitive chat server , or cool IRC bot ?
Implement a parallel Mandelbrot set that scales to many cores ?
Write an interpreter for some tiny language ?
And can you do it all in 30 lines ?
I chose 30 arbitrarily as about as much as you can fit into a Stack Overflow code block without it overflowing and getting a scroll bar ; it should be enough to do something interesting without golfing too much , but short enough to keep everyone 's attention for a quick demo .
For instance , with just a bit of reformatting , the example web server should be able to fit ( not counting the data ) .
Show us your Go code !

Internet pioneer Vinton Cerf repeated a call Wednesday evening for migrations to IPv6 ( Internet Protocol version 6 ) to stave off an anticipated lack of available addresses on IPv4 .
Speaking at an industry event at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , Calif. , Cerf , co-designer of the TCP / IP protocols , warned that IP v4 will run out of addresses next year or in early 2011 .
While there will be a period of attempts to sell off IP v4 spaces , Cerf stressed that the " smart thing to do is implement v6 now . "
He has made similar calls for migration to IP v6 previously .
[ Many businesses say they see no economic advantage to deploying IP v6 over their networks , but IP v6 is coming , ready or not . ]
IPv6 , from the Internet Engineering Task Force , dates back several years and represents the next generation of the Internet protocol .
Internet service providers need to move to IPv6 , said Cerf , who currently is vice president and chief Internet evangelist at Google .
Without more IP addresses , the Internet will not be able to grow very well , he said .
Cerf and other dignitaries in computing were featured at a dual celebration of the 40th anniversary of ARPAnet ( Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ) , which was a forerunner of the Internet , and the 125th anniversary of IEEE , which sponsored the event .
The first transmission of the ARPAnet was on Oct. 29 , 1969 , from the University of California , Los Angeles , to SRI .
Cerf hailed the growth of the Internet and predicted its expansion into numerous devices , including household temperature systems and even into outer space .
Sensor networks on the Internet will tell people which devices are consuming how much electricity , Cerf added .
" There are over 600 million servers on the Net that we can see , " and the actual number is probably double that , Cerf said .
The Internet has 1.6 billion users as of 2009 , he said .
" We are still in a state of evolution , " Cerf said .
" There are so many opportunities to add new functionally and new capabilities , " to the system , he said .
" We are going to see billions and billions of devices on the Net , " he said .
The Internet , for its part , has invited many people to contribute content , Cerf said .
He explained he has been developing protocols for Internet - like space exploration systems .
A three - node interplanetary network already is in use in a test mode involving the international space station , the EPOXI space craft and an Earth - bound surface system , he said .
Also speaking at the event , Howard Charney , senior vice president in the Office of the President at Cisco , said development of the Internet has come a long way , although three - fourths of the world remains unconnected .
This leaves an amazing opportunity , he said .
" Basically , the advent of this technology has transformed every single sector of our lives , " including government , retail , health care , manufacturing , and education , Charney said .
" Nothing -- nothing -- is the same anymore . "
" What comes next is pervasive computing , where everything is connected , 24/7 , to everything else , " said Charney .
Echoing Cerf , Charney said everything would be connected ranging from pacemakers to maybe even cartons of milk .
The Internet , meanwhile , can offer the opportunity for someone in Botswana to sell crafts to a much larger market , Charney said .
In Cambodia , one spot lacking electricity nonetheless is improving itself through use of wireless Internet access , he said .
The Internet boosts productivity and , in turn , standards of living , Charney said .

The researchers counted 56 tigers in a monitoring area of 9,000 square miles
The last remaining population of Siberian tigers has declined significantly , according to research .
The work was carried out by the Siberian Tiger Monitoring Programme , which is coordinated by the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) .
Its report says that tiger numbers have shown a " declining trend " over the last four years , and the latest assessment counted just 56 of the animals .
The researchers attribute the decline to poaching and habitat loss .
The organisation carries out annual tiger surveys at 16 monitoring sites scattered across the tigers ' range .
The monitored area represents about 15 % of the animals ' habitat in Russia .
These surveys are done every winter , using tracks in the snow to estimate the population .
The scientists did point out that deep snows during the last winter may have forced tigers to reduce the amount they travelled , making them less active and therefore less detectable
But , in 2005 , the total number of Siberian tigers across their entire range was estimated at approximately 500 individuals .
This recovered from fewer than 30 animals in the late 1940s .
" The sobering results are a wake - up call that current conservation efforts are not going far enough to protect Siberian tigers , " said Dr Dale Miquelle a researcher from the WCS 's Russian Far East Program .
" The good news is that we believe this trend can be reversed if immediate action is taken . "
Russian scientists and conservation organisations are now recommending changes in law enforcement regulations , improvements in habitat protection , and a strengthening of the protected areas network to help protect the tigers .
The World is Digital
One of the biggest insights of computer science is that the world is digital
Alan Kay is a brilliant computer scientist who has won the Turing Award , along with many other honors .
He is famous for creating the Dynabook concept — the idea that became the laptop , and for creating many programming languages , such as Smalltalk .
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest results in all of Computer Science .
No , it is not the Halting Problem , it is not the P=NP question , it is not that Linear Programming is in P , nor any of the many other beautiful results of theory .
It is , in my opinion , the realization that the world is digital ( WID ) .
This summer I was at an NSF workshop on Computational Thinking — an idea that Jeannette Wing is behind .
During the workshop I said :
In my opinion , one of the key insights in all of Computer Science , is that the world is digital .
I also added that this was a relatively recent result , and it has had a tremendous impact on the world .
As soon as I said this , Bill Wulf and Alan Kay both jumped all over me , and continued their comments into the next coffee break .
They must have thought that I was crazy or worse — perhaps they still do .
Their position was that WID had been known forever — back to the Greeks — therefore it was not new , nor was it a deep insight .
I disagreed .
It ’s hard to argue with the past president of the National Academy of Engineering , Bill ; and with a Turing Award winner , Alan .
But I tried .
I did not get them to budge , not at all .
I still think I am right .
I will explain why and I hope that you might agree with me , but either way let me know what you think .
The World is Digital
The more original a discovery , the more obvious it seems afterwards — Arthur Koestler , journalist , novelist , social philosopher , and science writer .
The fact that all things can be represented by sequences of zeroes and ones sounds like a simple idea , but I claim that it is deep and profound .
Look around you .
You may see , like I do , beautiful trees outside in the backyard .
You may hear wonderful sounds : birds chirping ; music playing classical or rock or hip hop or another genre .
You may be reading a book or watching a show on a HD - TV and seeing images of people that are almost lifelike .
Yet no matter how beautiful the images are , no matter how complex the sounds are , they all can be reduced to sequences of bits .
The world truly is digital .
In a sense , 0 and 1 represent computer science ’s basic atomic particles .
Information consists of arrangements of 0’s and 1’s .
Nothing else is needed .
Computer science differs from modern physics , while Physics uses hundreds of “ basic particles ” to build the world — we only need two .
I believe that the discovery that all things can be viewed as digital is as revolutionary as the notion that the world is made of atomic particles .
But , the discovery that the WID took half a century longer to discover than even the simplest atomic particles .
Electrons , for example , were discovered by Joseph Thomson in 1897 , long before we knew that the WID .
Some may scoff and say that it ’s obvious that the WID .
But , I think I can argue that is not so .
Yes , particle physics is a deep theory ; however , Computer Science ’s insight that everything can be represented digitally is profound .
Who Knew What When ?
One way to argue , I believe , that WID is profound is that it is a recent discovery .
I believe that if it was “ obvious , ” then it would have been known for a long time .
The Ancient Greeks : Greats like Euclid did not know the WID .
In all of his famous Elements , there is not one section on boolean functions .
Yet , Alan and Bill said to me that the ancient Greeks already knew that the WID .
Of course , the Greeks knew that the square root of was not a rational number .
Somehow , Alan and Bill felt that this showed that they knew that the WID .
I think the Greeks knew many wonderful things but that they were in the dark with respect to the WID — at least that is my opinion .
A kind of atomic theory was known , without proof , to the Greeks .
That the world is made of discrete atoms is not the same I would argue as the WID .
They did not make the key jump : that is they did not realize that any object of any kind could be represented as a binary string .
It seems obvious to us today , but it was not centuries ago .
The Classic Mathematicians :
The great mathematicians such as Augustin Cauchy , Joseph Fourier , Carl Gauss , David Hilbert , Pierre - Simon Laplace , and Isaac Newton did not know the WID .
They mainly studied continuous systems , and when they did work on discrete systems , they worked with the integers .
But I do not believe they ever thought about boolean functions , and nor
do I think that they knew the WID .
Lewis Carroll : Greats like Lewis Carroll — Charles Dodgson — did not know that the WID .
While he is famous for his Alice In Wonderland series of books , during his later years he spent a great deal of time working on symbolic logic .
He was especially interested in the theory of syllogisms : a set of premises that lead to a conclusion .
Here is one of his examples :
Babies are illogical
Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile
Illogical persons are despised
He then concluded that
Babies cannot manage crocodiles
Lewis Carroll used a version of Venn diagrams to help his readers understand his logical examples ; these diagrams are named after the mathematician John Venn who introduced them in 1880 .
Carroll worked out a method of squares within squares that worked up to letters — where a letter is a “ proposition . ”
What I find interesting is that Carroll did not see that he was working with boolean logic .
His examples and notation are fairly complex , and show , I believe , again that the central nature of bits and boolean values was not understood by him nor his contemporaries .
Gödel : Greats like Kurt Gödel did not know the WID .
If he had , he would not have needed to invent his elaborate scheme for numbering proofs .
If he had realized that proofs were only a finite collection of symbols , he could have assigned each symbol a unique binary string .
That ’s all he needed to do : no primes , no fancy facts about primes , just binary strings .
Indeed , I never present his complex numbering system when I teach Gödel ’s Theorem ; I just explain that proofs and formulas are binary strings .
Markov : Greats like the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov did not know the WID .
He invented a model of computation that he called “ normal algorithms . ”
Unlike Turing Machines , his model was based on string rewriting rules .
I remember reading his 1950 book on his theory of algorithms .
One of the striking parts of the book , to me , was the introduction .
His model needed to restrict the set of symbols to a finite set of symbols — otherwise , his rewriting rules would not be finite .
Today , since we know that the WID this is obviously no issue .
However , when he wrote his book he was concerned about the restriction to a finite alphabet .
He talked .
at length , about the infinite number of ways that one might be able to write a script letter such an “ a ” :
But , he reasoned that while there might be an infinite number of script letter “ a”s , the restriction to a fixed size alphabet was just fine .
That Markov felt , in 1950 , that he had to discuss the restriction to a finite alphabet shows me that he was unaware that the WID .
Today if I had to argue why a finite alphabet suffices to describe any script letter , I would point out that we can just represent the letter as a digital image .
Let the image be by pixels , where is some huge number — if is large enough I would argue that if a human can tell two script letters apart , then they would have different digital representations .
How I Came to Know the World is Digital
I remember when it finally began to dawn on me that the world is digital .
I would like to say that I always knew , or at least that it came to me in a flash one day .
But that would be a lie .
It took me years to realize it .
It ’s one of those ideas or notions that came slowly to me .
However , once I saw it , I wondered how I could have not always known it .
At Carnegie Mellon , where I got my Ph.D. , we were never taught that the WID .
My professors , like Albert Meyer and Alan Perlis , never told me .
Meyer was then , and is now a brilliant researcher — he never told me the WID .
Perlis was , at the time , the chair of the entire department of Computer Science , yet he never told me either .
When I was an assistant professor of Computer Science at Yale University in 1976 , I got my first inkling that the world could be viewed as digital .
I was on the phone with a friend , Bob Sedgewick , who at the time was an assistant professor at Brown University .
He was telling me how a newly purchased printer worked .
Now you have to go back 30 years to recall that printers were once very different from the beautiful laser / ink jet printers of today .
In those days a printer was a typewriter on steroids .
In case you have never used one , here is how a typewriter worked .
There was a keyboard like today ’s laptops .
But when you pressed a key , a piece of metal hit an ink ribbon and then hit your paper .
In this way each letter was printed .
Printers did the same — again each letter had a piece of metal that was pressed onto the paper .
The user was limited to the font and symbols which were built into the printer .
Some printers had clever arrangements , so the printer could go fast .
Some had the metal letters arranged on wheels ; others had them arranged in even more complex configurations .
In any event , typewriters and printers used the impact of a piece of metal onto an ink ribbon to leave a mark on paper .
The only difference between printers and typewriters was speed .
Back to my story : Bob was telling me about a new kind of printer that used dots to represent each letter or symbol on the page .
He explained how the page was coded as an array of 0’s and 1’s .
Where a 1 occurred , the printer placed ink on the page ; a 0 instructed the printer to leave a blank on the spot .
The way the ink was placed onto the paper was not laser - based or ink - jet based by the way .
This early printer used a more primitive technology ; however , the page was represented as an array of bits — it was digital .
I have to say , I was surprised .
I knew about Gödel numbers .
I knew about binary numbers .
I knew a lot of computer science — I thought .
However , I somehow was surprised that the printer was just placing bits onto a piece of paper .
I did not see that printed words and images could be represented solely by dots .
Really .
What Bob explained was that he had written a program that created an array of 0’s and 1’s .
Then , his program sent the array to the printer which created a printed page .
He explained , further , that the program could create text or images or anything in this manner .
This was a major shift from pieces of metal striking a ribbon and putting ink onto a page .
Typewriters and printers had been limited to print only the images that were built into the metal keys or balls .
Now with the digital approach of using bits as a way to control the printing process , a whole new vista opened up .
Any picture , any image , any font could , in principle , be represented , or printed , without changing the hardware .
This was a huge breakthrough .
The Chicken and The Egg Argument
I always show these posts to Subruk before I post them ; otherwise , they would be a mess .
This time he raised an interesting point that we decided that he should make — that I would not change my thoughts to conform to his insight .
I am doing this partly because I do not completely agree with his point , and partly because I think it is a great insight that he should make himself .
The plan is that he will add a comment to this once it is out there for you to read .
I would , however , like to address an issue that is related to his point , but please read his comment .
Mathematics is driven by practice and also drives practice .
There are many examples of deep mathematics that was created to solve very practical problems .
For example , the theory of Fourier Series was driven by the need to solve certain differential equations .
Many other examples come to mind : geometry — construction of temples , calculus–astronomy , probability theory — life insurance tables , and on and on .
On the other hand , many times mathematics has been ahead of practice .
Godfrey Hardy was actually proud that his favorite area , number theory , was pure — that it had no possible applications .
Of course we can only speculate what he would think of modern cryptography ’s use of number theory as a basis of encryption .
Other areas of mathematics were also developed because they were beautiful .
Many examples come to mind : abstract measure theory , set theory , algebraic geometry , infinite dimensional geometry — I am sure the list could go on and on .
Sometimes these areas have eventually been used to solve real problems , and sometimes they remain beautiful areas that seem to be without any practical application .
My point is simple .
Even before computers existed mathematicians could have worked on binary strings , on boolean functions , and on many of the areas that we work on today .
They did not , in my opinion , because they did not understand the power of bits ; they did not know that the WID .
A final point .
If they had worked on boolean functions years ago , one wonders where theory would be today ?
Curiously , the difficult foundational issues that plagued early analysis , for example , would have been completely moot .
Early mathematicians struggled with the basic question of “ what is a real number ? ”
If they had worked on boolean problems , these difficult problems would have been completely avoided .
Open Problems
Is the “ world is digital ” one of the great insights of Computer Science ?
Or do you agree with Kay and Wulf ?
Never mind that it stars Meryl Streep and soon - to - be Oscars hosts Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin ; would you watch a movie named after a Facebook relationship status ?
A natural set of candidates came to mind last week when people started talking about possible Oscars hosts .
The return of Hugh Jackman , perhaps ?
Or golden boy and similarly all - singing , all - dancing Neil Patrick Harris ?
Or even both ?
A young , hip comedian ?
A satirist ?
Or … oh .
It was suddenly announced .
Oh .
It 's Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin .
Yes , they 're both veteran presenters of Saturday Night Live , yet , somehow , they did n't bubble to the top of the list for most people .
So , what were the Academy Award producers thinking ?
Had they , perhaps , seen this ?
Judging by trailer alone ( it 's what we do here ) , It 's Complicated is the story of when Meryl met Alec .
It 's Complicated … Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin .
Photograph : Public Domain
Or rather , when Meryl met Alec again .
Meryl , here called Jane , is the central character – which is brilliant , because it 's always exciting to see a strong , powerful female actor playing a feisty , professional woman .
But then we 're presented with a flickering list of words that could sum her up , before settling on the one that finally does :
It 's Complicated … ' meet Jane ' title card .

Meet Jane … Divorced .
Nice .
Of course , I realise that there are many empowering words in that list .
But then we can't claim that as any great cinematic feminist truth , since there are also words in that list that are n't words at all , just caught in the screengrab while it was flickering .
Sorry .
Of course , this story would have no legs if it was just a case of ex-partners getting back together after a midlife split .
That would be too easy .
There has to be a third party involved .
It 's Complicated … Meryl Streep and Steve Martin .

Steve Martin , introduced as " Jane 's Architect " ( which is at least more of a description than Alec " Her Ex " Baldwin ) .
And so here we get to see a little of the magic that has led to Alec and Steve being announced as the hosts of the spangliest award ceremony of the year .
Or , rather , we do n't .
Alec looks forever startled , like a cartoon rabbit undergoing a thorough airport security check ;
Steve like someone who'd really rather be somewhere else .
Ca n't wait for a whole five hours of it .
It 's Complicated … This Christmas title card .

This is n't a particularly important moment in the trailer .
I just think I might start boycotting any film trailer that uses the words " This Christmas " , particularly when simultaneously enunciated by a gravelly voiceover bloke with a soppy smile in his voice .
I think I might advise it .
I think it might be a safe bet , as a general rule .
It 's Complicated … Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin in bed Photograph : Public Domain
This , though , I fear , may be if not the climax of the film , then certainly among the more excitable moments .
And there 's the rub .
Not only is there apparently no centre to this film , it seems to not care .
It does n't think it needs any marketing points beyond the basic plot .
And maybe it does n't .
It just has to say " This Christmas … why not , as a divorced woman yourself ( hooked you in at the first identifying sales point , did n't we ? ) indulge yourself in a tale about what life would be like if you could not only lure your cheating husband back from his new , younger wife , but then possibly turn him down because you were so in demand yourself ? "
And that 's about as simple as it gets .
It 's as low a common denominator as the plot with the dowdy girl who ends up attracting the handsome boy and becoming the homecoming queen even though she has the misfortune of wearing glasses and being clever .
It 's not that this film is bad , exactly .
It just is what it is .
And what it seems to be is High School Musical for the over - 50 divorcee .
And just to wind it up , there 's a list of things that this film is .
It 's Complicated …
It 's title card Photograph : Public Domain
Exciting , challenging , liberating , mysterious … rutting ?
( as seen above , actually , yes ) , frustrating , confusing , funny and most of all … It 's Complicated .
In fact , the name itself does the best job , if only they 'd been able to fit it in a box .
It 's a film named after a Facebook relationship status .
And when that 's the best you have to offer for a very large audience indeed ?
It 's a bit sad .
“ Is this impasse the United States ’ fault ?
Of course .
But others are at fault as well , ” said Dan Becker , director of the Safe Climate Campaign in Washington , citing the opposition of polluting industries and the reluctance of emerging economies to commit to binding curbs on emissions .
“ We have both the obligation and capability of taking the lead on this issue .
The longer we delay , the more extreme the steps that will have to be taken . ”
Mr. Obama expressed support on Sunday for a proposal from Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen of Denmark to pursue a two - step process at the Copenhagen conference .
Under the plan , the 192 nations convening in the Danish capital would formulate a nonbinding political agreement calling for reductions in global warming emissions and aid for developing nations to adapt to a changing climate .
The group would also promise to work to put together a binding global pact in 2010 , complete with firm emissions targets , enforcement mechanisms and specific dollar amounts to aid poorer nations .
“ We must in the coming weeks focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible , ” Mr. Rasmussen said in Singapore , making clear he would prefer to lock in the progress that has been made to date and not postpone action until countries are prepared to accept legally - binding commitments .
Although many read the compromise as a sign that the Copenhagen talks were doomed to produce at best a weak agreement , Yvo de Boer , the United Nations official managing the climate negotiations , said the statements out of the Singapore meeting did not limit his ambitions .
“ Copenhagen can and must deliver clarity on emission reduction targets and the finance to kick start rapid action , ” Mr. de Boer said .
“ I have seen nothing that would change my view on that . ”
Not everyone blames the United States for the apparent deadlock .
A European Union official , who asked that his name not be used so he could speak more freely , said that Mr. Obama was moving to use his executive authority to regulate greenhouse gases , but that India and China had delivered little beyond promises .

Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) was on NBC ’s Meet The Press today , where he not only promised to filibuster the public option , but also continued to lie about the public plan .
Lieberman said that the public option would not give a single poor person health insurance , and he stuck to his bogus claim that the public option would increase the deficit .
Here is the video :

Lieberman said , “ And I ’m convinced that the public option , a government - run insurance company –basically , people do n’t understand what it , what it ’s going to do .
It does n’t offer free insurance .
It wo n’t get one more poor person insurance .
It wo n’t force one insurance company to give insurance to somebody who ’s got a pre-existing condition .
And it wo n’t even lower the cost of health insurance , which the advocates said it originally would , because the Congressional Budget Office has now said to us that the public option in Senator Reid ’s bill will actually charge more for insurance than the average charge by health insurance companies .
What I–I can tell you one thing I ’m sure it will do .
If we create a government insurance company , it ’s going to run a deficit and it ’s only the taxpayers who are going to pay for it . ”
Apparently Lieberman does n’t believe the CBO estimate for the Senate bill , which according to Reuters , would cover more Americans and cut the deficit , “ The CBO analysis also said the plan would reduce the deficit by $ 127 billion over 10 years and $ 650 billion in the second decade while extending coverage to 31 million more Americans . ”
Lieberman has been going on national television for weeks now and using any distorting that he can think of justify not only his opposition to the healthcare reform bill , but also his threat to filibuster the bill if it contains the public option .
Senate Democrats managed to get Lieberman ’s vote to advance debate on the bill , but he is making it clear that the only way he will support the bill is if the public option is removed .
The decision for the Democratic leadership might come down to whether they want to pass a healthcare bill , or their healthcare bill .
Lieberman ’s threat to filibuster is probably an empty one , but the frustrating thing about Lieberman ’s lies is that neither the Senate Democratic leadership , nor the White House has called him on it .
If Democrats really want a public option , they need to fight for it , and counter the misinformation campaign of Joe Lieberman .

Established in the wake of the controversial banning – and subsequent censorship – of Left 4 Dead 2 , the Gamers 4 Croydon party plans to run against South Australian Attorney - General and R18 + videogame opponent Michael Atkinson in next year ’s state election .
I caught up with party founder David Doe to discuss those plans .
Doe grew up in Adelaide and currently lives in Melbourne where he works at games development studio Firemint .
He ’s a passionate gamer and , perhaps soon , an officially political gamer , too .
As mentioned earlier this morning , Doe will be in Adelaide ’s Rundle Mall this evening to collect the 150 membership signatures he requires to officially register Gamers 4 Croydon as a political party .
I spoke with him yesterday to find out why he founded Gamers 4 Croydon and what he hopes to achieve .
Tell me about your reasons for starting this campaign .
Was there one particular incident that triggered the idea ?
As it happens , it was reading [ on Kotaku ] that Michael Atkinson had thrown down the gauntlet in a letter to The Advertiser : “ I welcome a challenge in my electorate of Croydon at the next general election on this issue . ”
That initially gave me the seed of an idea to run a candidate against him .
But when Left 4 Dead 2 was Refused Classification , I decided that enough was enough .
Here , finally , was a game I was just absolutely not prepared to play in a watered - down condition .
Last year we had the same kind of issue with Fallout 3 being initially Refused Classification , although that , laughably , was over the use of the word ‘ morphine ’ , and not the intensely graphic ( and inappropriately rated MA15 + in my opinion ) violence that Fallout 3 offered players .
I ’d seen enough “ Down with Atkinson ” threads over the past few years , typically every time an anticipated game gets the dreaded RC from the Classification Board , but as a community we were n’t getting any traction on the issue .
I ’m 30 years old now , and I ’m more than a little sick and tired of being moralised at by people that do n’t understand , nor want to understand , the culture and community that plays a huge part in my life .
I thought it was time to actively DO something , so for better or worse , here I am doing something .
What do you feel is the biggest problem with the current classification scheme ?
There is just no consistency .
On one hand we have television and film being given a free pass with all types of content being made available ( and rightly ) to those who want to ( and are legally able to ) view R18 + ( or even x18 + ) content , but for some reason , the idea that “ videogames are just for kids ” has stuck around .
The current scheme without an R18 + rating for videogames is fundamentally flawed , as you see all types of content , which by television and film standards would garner a rating of R18 + , being literally shoved into the MA15 + rating .
As a result , we have content in the MA15 + rating that is inappropriate , and this is a potential source of confusion for parents and caregivers .
Let ’s just a consistent message across the board for our national Classification guidelines .
What do you hope to achieve – just an R18 + rating or do you feel the system needs a more thorough overhaul ?
I think it ’s fair to make the argument that the Classification Board ’s processes are n’t very transparent .
After all , who is making these decisions for the country ?
Who are the people that work for the Classification Board ?
What is their background ?
Why ca n’t we know more about them ?
That said ( and I ’m not going to be Mr Popular after this ) , I think that the Classification Board does an outstanding job .
I agree with their decision to Refuse Classification for Left 4 Dead 2 on the grounds that it is graphically violent .
This is n’t about the board , it ’s about the lack of an R18 + rating that effectively hamstrings what the Board can and ca n’t classify .
If we give them the ability to classify videogame content as R18 + , we would n’t be having this discussion as they would have rubber - stamped an R18 + on the L4D2 application and it would have saved Valve a bunch of money and dev-time re-tooling the game just for the ( small ) Australian market , and the rest of us undue heartache and misery .
It ’s important to remember that the Classification Board is not the enemy , the guidelines it adheres to are .
Why did you feel the need to state your party ’s policies on issues beyond videogames classification ?
While I , and no doubt many others , feel that the issue of an R18 + rating for videogames is pretty important , it ’s not something I think can win , in an election against a 20 - year incumbent who is hugely popular within his electorate , as a standalone issue .
We ’re not going to get 10,000 votes on what is essentially a civil rights issue that many people just do n’t care enough about .
We might , however , get 10,000 votes for other issues that play a lot closer to home for a lot of South Australians .
Have you had any contact with Michael Atkinson ?
Do you know if he ’s aware of your campaign ?
Yes and no .
I have sent him an email asking for his thoughts on the matter at hand , and I did receive a reply via email .
I ’m really looking forward to opening the letter that his office has said they are sending , let me tell you !
I do n’t know if he ’s aware of the campaign .
I have no doubt that in the fullness of time he will become aware of it , but whether or not he decides to take it seriously will of course be entirely up to him .
Make no mistake , we ’re playing to win .
Mr Atkinson claims an 18 + rating would allow “ children and vulnerable adults ” access to such material .
What ’s your response to this argument ?
I think it ’s completely specious .
He is claiming that children , already legally restricted from purchasing content given the MA15 + rating , will somehow have easier access to R18 + rated material .
It ’s a typical “ wo n’t somebody think of the children ” argument , and it does not do well under any scrutiny .
To take that kind of argument to its logical end - point , once we have an R18 + rating for videogames , parents will cease being responsible for the welfare of their children , and Michael Atkinson is saving us all from ourselves .
The R18 + rating is specifically designed to restrict children ’s access to inappropriate content .
To suggest otherwise is ridiculous .
As for “ vulnerable adults ” , how would we know ?
We ’re all being treated like vulnerable adults at the moment .
It ’s fair ( and completely bloody obvious ) to say that the overwhelming majority of adults in this country ( and around the world ) are not suddenly going to go on wild rampages because they are allowed to play an R - rated game .
Given that the rest of the developed world already has the equivalent of an R18 + rating , I do n’t seem to recall too many occasions where the fabric of society has completely broken down in those areas after any particular videogame was released .
Studies have even shown that as videogame sales go up , violent crime goes down .
His position is not backed by any supporting facts or evidence .
He ’s either Australia ’s best troll , getting a massive rise out of our community in particular , or he just likes being a moral crusader .
Either is sad .
What can Kotaku readers do to support your campaign ?
A lot of things .
They can hit up the site and become a member ( s this is a one - man - band at the moment , all new members keep me motivated to keep working on the issue ) , or they can donate to the cause ( anything I do n’t use in the campaign will be donated to Child ’s Play ) , they can help me canvass support by linking the site to their friends and family , or by joining the Steam or Facebook groups .
But if they really want to do me a solid , and they ’re over 18 and live in South Australia and are enrolled to vote ; they can come down to Rundle Mall ’s balls on Friday the 6th of November between 5.30 pm and 6.30 pm , as I ’ll be signing people up for the party so we can get the 150 members we require to get officially registered as a political party by the South Australian Electoral Commission .
I ’m doing a road - trip from Melbourne to get over there and get names on paper for this party to get off the ground .
Anybody else they can bring that fits that criteria ( over 18 , enrolled to vote , lives in SA ) and who also wants to see the introduction of an R18 + rating for videogames – friends , sisters , brothers , parents , workmates – make sure to bring them !
Right now you ’re just looking at one seat , but do you have plans to take this campaign further and contest other seats in other elections ?
At this stage , our primary focus is Croydon .
I have had a few requests to run a candidate for the Legislative Council .
If we get enough popular support in South Australia , and a forthcoming caucus approves a candidate , it ’s definitely something we ’ll look into .
I ’d like to thank David for taking the time to answer our questions and also wish him well in his campaign .
And I ’d urge any Kotaku readers able to make it to Rundle Mall today to do so and pledge their support .
Hands up who wants to help ?
You have come to Nottingham with your Goods on market day , and the only thing standing between you and your hard - earned profits is the Sheriff .
All you need to do is bluff or bribe your way past him …or maybe , tell the truth !
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Israel promised Russia it would not launch an attack on Iran , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview aired on Sunday in which he described such an assault as “ the worst thing that can be imagined . ”

Israel has hinted it could forcibly deny Iran the means to make an atomic bomb if it refuses to suspend uranium enrichment and has criticized Russia for agreeing to supply to Tehran S-300 anti-aircraft weapons that could complicate an attack .
In an interview with CNN recorded on Tuesday , Medvedev denied Moscow was backing Iran but said it had the right to supply defensive weapons and said sanctions against Tehran should only be used as a last resort .
An attack would lead to “ a humanitarian disaster , a vast number of refugees , Iran ’s wish to take revenge and not only upon Israel , to be honest , but upon other countries as well , ” Medvedev said , according to a Kremlin transcript .
“ But my Israeli colleagues told me that they were not planning to act in this way and I trust them . ”
During a meeting in the Russian resort of Sochi in August , Israeli President Shimon Peres said Israel would not attack Iran , Medvedev said .
After the meeting , Peres told journalists Medvedev had promised to reconsider a contract to sell S -300s to Iran .
“ When he visited me in Sochi , Israeli President Peres said something important for us all : ‘ Israel does not plan to launch any strikes on Iran , we are a peaceful country and we will not do this ’ , ” Medvedev said .
Asked about the possible delivery of S-300s , Medvedev said Russia had the right to sell defensive weapons to Iran .
SANCTIONS
“ Our task is not to strengthen Iran and weaken Israel or vice versa but our task is to ensure a normal , calm situation in the Middle East , ” Medvedev said .
On Western calls for sanctions on Iran , he said such moves were often ineffective and action should only be taken as a last resort .
“ Before speaking of applying additional sanctions , we should make full use of the existing possibilities , ” he said .
“ We should be absolutely confident that we have no other option . ”
Analysts have been watching for Russian concessions on Iran after the White House on Thursday canceled plans to site elements of a missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic , but CNN interviewed Medvedev before the announcement .
Medvedev said he was hopeful Moscow ’s relations with Washington would improve under President Barack Obama and described the chances of an agreement on a new treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons by year - end as “ quite high . ”
But he was critical of mixed messages coming from the White House .
Shortly after Obama hailed a “ reset ” of ties during a visit to Moscow in July , U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Russia ’s shrinking population base and “ withering economy ” would push it to make deals on nuclear arms reductions .
“ This is simply an incorrect move , ” Medvedev said .
“ Because while having only started to develop relations ... with the Russian Federation , at the same time to strain them in such a way is to make a mistake . ”
James Randerson :
It may not be on the scale of similar projects in Copenhagen or Nice , but the Welsh capital 's bike hire scheme has a lot going for it
" It 's a bit front - heavy .
Not much good for wheelies . "
That was the verdict of one passerby as he inspected one of Cardiff 's fetching new yellow and green rentable bicycles that are now dotted around the city at 11 hire locations .
With just 70 bicycles and hire stations restricted to the city centre and Cardiff Bay , it is small by comparison with similar schemes in other European cities such as Paris , Copenhagen and Nice .
But the company running it , called OYBike , say this is just the start .
" The system will hopefully continue to grow ( locations and thus stations ) as private companies want to sponsor more rental points outside their offices , " said Deborah Pester , a spokesperson for OYBike .
I tried out the scheme on a blustery Saturday afternoon earlier this month and was impressed ( you can listen to how I got on in tomorrow 's Guardian bike podcast ) .
Hiring is easy .
Once you have registered online ( at a cost of £ 18 per year or £ 5 for a week ) you simply go to a hire station and call OYBike from your mobile phone .
The system automatically recognises your phone number and releases a bike .
And if you do n't have a mobile there are other options .
Your first 30 minutes of riding is free , with costs rising gradually to £ 5 for between 4 and 24 hours – any more than that and they assume you 've nicked the bike and charge you around £ 200 to replace it .
Not that many people appear to want to steal them .
The bikes are pretty distinctive , clunky , sit - up - and - beg numbers with a handy basket on the front .
And they do n't appear to be very attractive to thieves – only two have gone missing so far .
" Actually our experience of vandalism elsewhere shows that at the beginning curiosity means one or two disappear but once thieves realise they are not worth much on the market , it tends to stop , " said Pester .
A similar scheme with 900 bikes that launched earlier this year in Nice on France 's Cote d'Azur clocked up 100,000 hires in the first 3 months .
It remains to be seen whether the old - fashioned look to the Cardiff bikes will prove as appealing .
By mid-November the scheme was close to clocking up 200 hires .
" It 's not bad for a very small system in the autumn months , " said Pester .
I hope it does catch on .
The bikes are sturdy , easy to use and the two I hired were both in good working order ( apart from some slightly soft brakes ) .
Most importantly , the scheme is convenient .
You can first check online that there is a bike available where you want it .
Then , as long as your destination has a drop - off point you can get there without the expense of buying and maintaining your own bike – and the risk of someone stealing it .
But if it is wheelies you want , then you will be disappointed by more than the bike 's weight balance .
Disappointingly , " racing , mountain bike riding , stunt or trick riding " are all expressly forbidden by OYBike 's terms and conditions .

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent out an e-mail on Monday saying it now supported climate change legislation -- which turned out to be a hoax .
CNBC , Reuters fall for climate hoax
In a dramatic shift , the Chamber of Commerce announced Monday that it is throwing its support behind climate change legislation making its way through the U.S. Senate .
Only it did n’t .

An email press release announcing the change is a hoax , say Chamber officials .
Several media organizations fell for it .
A CNBC anchor interrupted herself mid-sentence Monday morning to announce that the network had “ breaking news , ” then cut away to reporter Hampton Pearson , who read from the fake press release .
Pearson quickly followed up with a second report saying the “ so - called bulletin ” was an “ absolute hoax . ”
Smelling a rat , CNBC ’s Larry Kudlow demanded to know whether the White House had been involved .
In a story posted Monday morning , Reuters declared : “ The Chamber of Commerce said on Monday it will no longer opposes climate change legislation , but wants the bill to include a carbon tax . ”
Reuters updated the story to acknowledge the hoax , but it was too late : The Washington Post and the New York Times had already posted the fake story on their Web sites .
" Reuters has an obligation to its clients to publish news and information that could move financial markets , and this story had the potential to do that , ” said a Thomson Reuters spokesperson .
“ Once we had confirmed the release was a hoax , we immediately issued a correction , and in keeping with Reuters policy , the story was subsequently withdrawn and an advisory sent to readers . "
The Yes Men , a left - leaning activist group that often impersonates officials from organizations they oppose , took responsibility for the hoax .
Andy Bichlbaum — an alias the activist uses for Yes Men demonstrations — told POLITICO that his group is targeting the Chamber for what he considers “ retrograde ” positions on climate change .
“ Clearly , there is a question of who is hoaxing who , ” Bichlbaum said .
“ I think the Chamber is hoaxing the American public at this point . ”
Bichlbaum said that activists will continue targeting the organization .
Bichlbaum said the Yes Men got help with their prank from members of the AVAAZ Action Factory , an activist group , and BeyondTalk.net , an environmental website .
AVAAZ has not returned calls for comment .
But a post on the group ’s Web site said it had plans to “ make this the worst Monday ever for the anti-climate PR machine at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . “
The fake Chamber press release distributed to reporters Monday looked like an authentic document from the Chamber , with a logo and contact information for follow - up stories .
But there were clues that it was false .
The name of Chamber president Tom Donohue was misspelled , and the individuals listed as press contacts do not work at the Chamber .
The press release falsely quoted Donohue as saying : “ We at the Chamber have tried to keep climate science from interfering with business .
But without a stable climate , there will be no business .
We need business more than we need relentlessly higher returns . ”
And the press release said that the Chamber is implementing an “ immediate moratorium on lobbying and publicity work opposing climate legislation ” – and suggested that high - profile defections from Apple , Nike PG&E and other companies played a role in the decision .
In fact , the Chamber opposes – and continues to oppose – the cap - and - trade bill passed by the House in July .
The fake press release said that Donohue would be announcing the policy shift in a speech at the National Press Club Monday morning .
Donohue gave no such speech , but Bichlbaum and other imposters posing as Chambers officials did attempt to hold a press conference at the facility Monday .
It came to an abrupt end when a real representative of the Chamber showed up to confront the imposters .
Bill McCarren , general manager of the National Press Club , said that an organization calling itself the U.S. Council on Climate – same initials as the Chamber– booked space at the club on Friday .
On Monday , the group asked that its contact information be changed :
The new information included a number for the real Chamber of Commerce , tipping off the press club that there was a hoax taking place .
The group used the Chamber ’s logo in staging the new s conference , and also had a sign - in sheet for reporters that listed it as a Chamber of Commerce event .
McCarren said the group paid for the room — the typical cost is about $ 500 — and would not be permitted to hold future events .
“ We , as an organization , meant no offense to the Chamber of Commerce , ” McCarren said , adding : “ We did not mean to participate , willingly or unwillingly , in a spoof a news conference . ”
A former Naval Academy water - polo star amazingly survived a suicide leap of 212 feet off the George Washington Bridge into the 55 - degree waters of the Hudson yesterday — then swam to New Jersey after suddenly finding that he still had the will to live .
Adrian Rawn , 28 , took the plunge without so much as a pause after abruptly stopping his car on the span ’s lower level at about 11:30 a.m. , sources said .
He was pulled from the freezing water by Fort Lee church deacon Gi Yeon Rheem , who had been walking along the base of the Palisades when she spotted someone clutching a rock about a quarter - mile to the north , sources said .
“ He started shivering , ” Rheem , 63 , told The Post , adding that the impact had torn off Rawn ’s pants and shredded his underwear .
“ He got up and walked into the sunshine , ” she said .
“ I gave him my scarf , and he said , ‘ Thank you . ’ ”
Rawn was listed in serious condition last night at Hackensack University Medical Center .
But that he survived at all came as no surprise to Mike Schofield , his Naval Academy water - polo coach of four years .
“ If anybody could do that and swim to shore , that would be Adrian , ” Schofield said .
“ I love the guy .
I think very , very highly of him , and my prayers are with him .
I hope he ’s OK . ”
Rawn led Schofield ’s team to within a game of the 2000 national championship and won a Pan - Am Games gold medal that year as a member of the 21 - and - under national team .
He later became an assistant coach at Maryland and Johns Hopkins universities .
His death - defying leap , one of just a handful on record for the bridge , occurred one day after he was arrested and charged with drunkenly beating up a Northampton , Mass . , cabby in a fare dispute .
Authorities said Rawn was pepper - sprayed by cops while allegedly resisting arrest , arraigned in a Northampton court Thursday morning and released .
The AMT and STM have decided to give reduced - fare Opus users a one - time grace period to renew their ID cards ( probably since many of them – including my little brother – did n’t know they had to renew their cards , thinking they were good for two years ) .
Students now have until Nov. 15 ( which I guess means they can buy their November passes but they ca n’t use them past that date ? )
The STM says it is buying ads on Facebook to reach many of those students and remind them of this weird new policy .
Long before I supported Ron Paul for president and in general , I was a staunch Pat Buchanan conservative .
I still am .
Giving my opinion on the radio and in print , at least twice a week for over a decade , I ’ve been called a libertarian or a conservative depending on the issue being discussed , but more importantly , the political figures associated with those discussions .
If arguing my opposition to NAFTA , illegal immigration and American empire in 2000 , I was derided as a Buchananite - nationalist - isolationist .
If arguing against NAFTA , illegal immigration and American empire in 2008 , I was derided as a Paulite - libertarian - isolationist .
I plead guilty on all counts .
Last weekend I had the pleasure of attending the 2nd annual HL Mencken Club conference where a host of conservative and libertarian thinkers came together for a rousing exchange of ideas on what might — and what should — animate the American Right .
One , surely ongoing , debate seemed to be whether right - wingers could make more progress by focusing on cultural issues like illegal immigration , multiculturalism and affirmative action or libertarian issues like government size , spending and perhaps , civil liberties .
Would a more culture - minded Buchananite approach work best ?
Or perhaps a more libertarian - minded Paulite approach ?
What many are now calling , appropriately and accurately enough , the “ Alternative Right ” encompasses both the Buchanan and Paul camps , and whatever differences each have are miniscule compared to their shared , stark differences with the liberal Left and mainstream neoconservative Right .
Before discussing what should be done to advance Alternative Right causes — why not look at what has already been done ?
Danone insisted that the advert 's claims were " sound " A TV advert which asserted that Actimel yogurt supported children 's natural defences against disease has been banned by the advertising watchdog .
The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that claims that it could help protect school - age youngsters against illness were not supported by evidence .
The advert stated that Actimel was " scientifically proven to help support your kids ' defences " .
Manufacturer Danone said it was " very disappointed " by the ruling .
Broke rules
The advert showed a bottle of Actimel jumping over a skipping rope over a soundtrack of cheering children .
A voice - over said " kids love Actimel and it's good for them too " before the words " scientifically proven " were stamped on the screen .
PROBIOTICS
The term probiotics refers to foods that contain bacteria similar to the ones normally found in a healthy gut
It is estimated that the average adult human has 1.5 kg of these bugs in their digestive system
They help with digestion and protect against harmful bacteria Two Sussex hospitals are providing free pots of probiotic yogurt drinks to patients to see if they can cut the amount of clostridium difficile infections
The general claims about the health benefits of probiotics were dismissed by the European Food Safety Agency nearly two weeks ago Probiotic health claims dismissed
But following an investigation sparked by a viewer complaint , the ASA rejected studies submitted by Danone to back up their assertions .
ASA chief executive Guy Parker said the ruling was not a comment on whether Actimel worked per se , but was an adjudication on whether or not the specific claim that they made was supported by adequate evidence .
" We thought that their evidence fell short .
It was n't a million miles away , it was n't actually bad evidence , compared to some that we see , but it was n't good enough to prove the claim , " he said .
A spokesman for Danone said its scientific claims were " sound and based on a large body of evidence " .
It said it had 24 published clinical studies demonstrating the product 's positive health benefits in a variety of circumstances , for children through to the elderly .

The company said eight studies were carried out on children up to the age of 16 , two of which were carried out on hospitalised children in India who suffered acute diarrhoea or were taking gastritis - related medication .
The ASA ruled that these two studies could not be applied to healthy youngsters .
Broke rules
Two other trials were dismissed as the mean age in each of the sets of children under examination - six months and 15.5 months - were too young to apply to school - age children .
Mr Parker said the advert had implied it was that age group that would benefit .
The watchdog also decided that no health benefits could be established in relation to asthmatic children , and a drop in the number of children with allergic rhinitis and diarrhoea was too small compared to the control group to prove Actimel was the cause .
In addition , it said that studies on children in day cay centres in the US and Russia found too small a reduction in common infectious diseases when drinking Actimel compared to not doing so .
In the end , the ASA ruled that the advert was misleading and broke rules in relation to evidence and accuracy in advertising .
A Danone spokesman added : " These studies are designed and approved by a board of internationally recognised experts with extensive , directly relevant experience in human clinical trials , effects of probiotics in the gut , paediatrics and immunology . "
Professor Jeremy Nicholson , head of surgery and cancer at Imperial College London , said there is some good evidence that these good bacteria are beneficial to people with health problems , but there had been no wide , long - term studies on healthy people .
" These bugs have evolved with us and there 's actually a gigantic number in the human body .
To compete with the number of bacteria in your gut you 'd need to have 50,000 pots [ of Actimel ] a day , " he said .
" There are 100 trillion bacteria in your gut , 1.5 kg of them , so that 's really quite substantial . "

Appellate Court : Encouraging Civil Disobedience is Not Protected Speech
The conviction of the SHAC 7 –animal rights activists hit with â€œterrorismâ€ charges for publishing a website and vocally , unapologetically supporting direct action –has been upheld by a U.S. appellate court .
It is a landmark free speech ruling that lowers the threshold of what types of conduct are protected by the First Amendment , and upholds a law that is so broad that it targets civil disobedience as â€œterrorism.â€ 
As a brief introduction :
The â€ œSHAC 7â€ of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty ran an effective campaign that had the sole purpose of putting Huntingdon Life Sciences , a notorious animal testing company , out of business .
The campaign pressured corporations to sever ties with the lab .
The SHAC 7 were never accused of breaking windows or releasing animals from labs , but they supported those who did .
They published a website which posted news of both legal and illegal tactics , and supported all of it .
The website had also posted names and addresses of individuals connected to the corporations targeted .
The ruling was issued today and , although there are many aspects that deserve attention , I want to walk through what I think are by far the most dangerous and troubling implications of this ruling –those related to the First Amendment :
[ PDF of the SHAC appeal ruling ]
Supporting and facilitating non-violent civil disobedience is not protected speech .
As part of their campaign , SHAC supporters were emailed about “ electronic civil disobedience . ”
The email and message board posts included instructions on how electronically “ sit in ” on corporate web sites through emails , faxes and phone calls .
Now , one of the benchmarks in First Amendment law is what is called the Brandenburg standard .
It holds that even the most controversial and inflammatory speech is protected as long as it not likely to incite â€œimminent and lawless action .â€ 
That is a very high threshold .
In this court ruling — which , to the best of my knowledge and the attorneys I have spoken with is the first of its kindâ € ” the written word can be construed as promoting , or resulting in , imminent and lawless action .
To put it more plainly : Vocally supporting civil disobedience , explaining what it involves , and encouraging / facilitating people to take part is not protected speech .
This is so important let me say it again , another way : People who write about civil disobedience and encourage people to take part can be found convicted of a crime even if they do not take part in the civil disobedience .
This has dangerous implications far beyond this case .
For instance , I wrote about the recent call by mainstream environmental groups for massive non-violent civil disobedience in defense of the environment .
Under this reasoning , organizers of that event who published a website arenâ€™t protected by the First Amendment .
[ UPDATE : One person had this question , so others might as well : I am not at all saying that simply endorsing civil disobedience is now not protected speech .
However , doing so and also facilitating civil disobedience is what the court ruled is not protected .
So in the example above , the organizers promoted civil disobedience , encouraged it , set up a website telling people where to go and when , and there were people involved to specifically support those arrested .
I think there is a very real danger of that type of conduct being affected by the reasoning presented in this ruling .
That is what I had meant by the headline and preceding points . ]
Fiery rhetoric is a â€œtrue threatâ€ when illegal conduct has taken place in the same campaign .
Another measurement of whether speech is protected by the First Amendment is whether it is a true threat .
Throughout the appellate court ruling , the court argued that SHAC ’s speech did , in fact , constitute a true threat .
SHAC pressured corporations to divest and sever ties with HLS and â€œused past incidents to instill fear in future targetsâ€ ( by publicizing illegal conduct , supporting that conduct ) .
â€ œIn this regard , their actions meet the standard of a â€œtrue threatâ€ as articulated in Watts , because viewed in context , the speeches , protests , and web postings , were all tools to further their effort.â€ 
The courtâ€™s reasoning goes something like this : SHAC wants to close HLS , SHAC supports legal and illegal activity , therefore when SHAC targets a new corporation there is a true threat that the company will be the victim of illegal activity .
So SHACâ€™s speech is not protected .
There are two huge problems with this .
The first is that social movements throughout history have had both legal and illegal components .
I have interviewed countless activists who only take part in legal protest , but vocally and unequivocally support illegal tactics , and recognize their role in the broader movement .
The court argues that it does n’t matter if you are not breaking the law ; if you support illegal tactics , note their efficacy , and believe they play a role in the broader movement and your own campaigning , it is tantamount to a “ true threat . ”
The second problem is that no action by animal rights or environmental activists in the United States has ever resulted in physical injury or death .
Not one .
That ’s by the admission of the FBI and DHS , along with groups that track animal rights crimes , like the Southern Poverty Law Center .
It defies logic how even the most outlandish rhetoric can be construed as a “ true threat ” that places someone in reasonable fear of physical violence , when the movement has never engaged in physical violence .
The Animal Enterprise Protection Act and â€œanimal enterprise terrorismâ€ charges can be applied to First Amendment activity .
The court ruled that the defendants were guilty of â€œconspiracyâ€ to commit animal enterprise terrorism because of :
Speechâ € ” Josh Harper â€ œwrote editorials and gave speeches praising militant tactics and direct action.â€ 
Running a websiteâ € ” Jake Conroy â€œdesigned and maintained multiple websites affiliated with SHACâ € “ the primary tools of the campaign against Huntingdon.â€ 
Protestâ€ ” Andy Stepanian told Kevin Kjonaas â€ œthat he could not explain over an unprotected phone line what protest activity he had planned for the following weeks .â€ 

This Ruling is Bigger than the SHAC 7
This ruling is disappointing , to put it mildly , for the SHAC 7 defendants still behind bars .
They will serve the remainder of their sentence in prison and , if this appellate court decision stands , be forever marked as “ terrorists . ”
But this case is much bigger than the SHAC 7 , and it is bigger than the animal rights movement .
The AETA 4 are facing terrorism charges for chalking slogans and protesting with masks .
Climate groups are organizing massive civil disobedience campaigns .
These movements continue to grow , and so does the crackdown against them .
This is critical time in American history .
Corporations , working alongside ambitious prosecutors , are radically expanding cultural and legal conceptions of “ terrorism ” in order to push a political agenda .
Mainstream animal and environmental groups , the press , civil liberties groups , they have all largely remained silent on this historic case .
As a result , this appellate court has issued its sweeping ruling with impunity .
It is all too easy to weaken the First Amendment when it comes to the rights of “ radicals ” and “ extremists . ”
It is even easier when no one is paying attention .

Once , the person filming fell asleep and half of the movie was just snoring and the back of the chair in front of him .
Matthew claimed he did n’t know the quality of the movies before he got them , but during one of the movies , the person filming answered his phone with , " Hello Matthew speaking . "
When I mentioned this to Matthew , he stopped selling me movies .

Sir and / or Madam , I have received a request for seventy - five of my dollars for putting my trash out for collection without securing it inside a bear - proof container .
Due to a series of events the night before , I forgot to put my trash out and had to run it out the next morning after hearing the collection truck approach .
As regulations govern only actions within certain defined limits and thereby justify all similar actions that lie outside those limits , I request that my offence is changed from ' unsecured trash ' to ' secured trash barring the possibility of bears formulating a strategy in which to take advantage of the thirty seconds between deposit and collection .
' Regards , David

Section 9 of the MPOA Agreement which you would have signed clearly states that trash must be secured .
The reason we have these rules is so that bears and other large animals are not attracted to the area .
This is for everyone ’s safety .
All bear sightings should be reported immediately to the MPOA .
A ladys cat was almost bitten by a bear just a few weeks ago near the mini golf course .
PatriciaDavid ThorneThursday 7 October 2010 9.12 pmPatricia JenningsRe : Re : BearsDear Pat , Due to the abundant supply of cats in the area , I 'm surprised bears bother with trash at all .
As I have run over four cats this week and one of those did not put up much of a chase , it may be suggested that elderly residents and their cats pose more of an attraction for bears than unsecured trash .
For the safety of all residents , section 9 of the MPOA Agreement should probably be amended to state that all cats , and their elderly owners , be kept in bear - proof containers .
While out walking this evening , I witnessed several cats having some kind of meeting on the sidewalk ahead of me .
Possibly to discuss the local bear problem .
After reading that a bear recently ate a ladies cat in the area and hearing a twig snap in the woods behind me , I took the shortest route home by cutting through the Massanutten mini - golf facilities .
Managing to scale the three metre fence via fear and a trash can , I slipped , caught my back pants pocket on one of the pointy metal bars , and hung there for several minutes before managing to wriggle out of them - dropping to the right of hole 7 .
Fashioning temporary legwear by removing my jumper and placing my legs in the sleeves , figuring they would look like Hammer pants to people driving by , I left the premises by climbing the papier - mâché boulders near hole 16 , leaping onto the ticket hut roof , and dropping down the other side to safety .
If my shoes had not been wet and slippery from the pond to the right of hole 7 , I 'm pretty sure I would have made it on the first attempt .
While not pointing any blame , I quite liked those pants as they fit really well and cost around seventy - five dollars .
Also , as per your instructions to report bear sightings , I have attached a photograph taken outside my home a few minutes ago .
I apologise for the quality but was fearful of getting too close .
Please send assistance immediately .
Regards , DavidPatricia JenningsFriday 8 October 2010 2.26 pmDavid ThorneRe : Re : Re : BearsI checked with Carol at the mini golf hut and no pants were found on the fence .
I doubt that really happened .
That looks like a dog with a blanket on it .
I 'm not going to waste anyone ’s time sending an officer out to check that .
David ThorneFriday 8 October 2010 2.51 pmPatricia JenningsRe : Re : Re : Re : BearsDear Pat , If Carol from the mini - golf hut has time to check the perimeter for pants , why not send her ?
While issuing me a seventy - five dollar fine by justifying it is for the safety of others , you seem pretty quick to dismiss mine .
As people rely on your protection from bears and your position consists entirely of not waiving fines issued to ensure the compliance of regulations that protect people from bears , you should probably send out a memo or something stating that we are on our own in an emergency situation .
On the back of the memo , you could include instructions on making a pointy stick to protect ourselves with .
Although wary after reading recently that a bear ate a lady and her cat in the area , I decided to risk leaving the premises in order to drive to your office and pay the fine .
Unfortunately , possibly due to an unsecured Snickers bar on the dashboard , the bear is now in my vehicle and I am unable to do so .
Please send assistance immediately as I have run out of cigarettes and need to drive to the shop .
Or , if you send Carol , please ask her to stop on the way and grab me a pack of Marlboro Red .
While you may not class this as an emergency or possible danger to others , you have n't seen me after two hours without nicotine .
Regards , DavidPatricia JenningsFriday 8 October 2010 3.18 pmDavid ThorneRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : BearsI wo n’t be sending an officer because you ’re not in danger .
If you want to express your opinion on trash collection rules you 're welcome to attend the next MPOA community meeting which is held each month .
Not understanding the importance of bear safety doesnt mean you dont have to follow the rules .
I 'm not even sure what your point is .
David ThorneFriday 8 October 2010 4.22 pmPatricia JenningsRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : BearsDear Pat , My point is , barring the possibility of strategy formulating bears , stating my actions constitute a punishable breach of regulations structured to protect the community only enables you to be wrong with authority , not right .
While I was able to persuade the bear to exit my vehicle by pretending to be an old lady looking for her cat , it is now inside my premises .
Although not immediately evident from the attached photograph , the bear is sitting between myself and the television remote control .
As this effectively cuts off my ability to change channels and The View just started , this should be classed as an emergency situation .
If I wanted to watch a group of old women carry on , I ’d attend an MPOA community meeting .
Regards , DavidPatricia JenningsFriday 8 October 2010 5.03 pmDavid ThorneRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : BearsI 'll waive the fine this time if you agree to make sure all your trash is secured in future .
David ThorneFriday 8 October 2010 5.16 pmPatricia JenningsRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : BearsDear Pat , Regardless of whether you waive the fine or not , I will secure my trash .
Not because it is a rule , but because it is a logical rule to follow .
Despite my continuing doubt as to the ability of bears to plan and execute manoeuvres requiring SWAT team precision , I will also secure my trash regardless of the time frame between deposit and collection .
Not because it is a logical rule to follow , but because it is a rule .
How about you agree to waive the fine and I promise not to email you the remaining eighty - six photos of my dog dressed as a bear .

The most recent was the congressman ’s postscripting more than $ 500,000 to his assets disclosure last summer , essentially doubling his net worth to somewhere between $ 1 million and $ 2.4 million .
This joined a lengthy docket of bizarre - to - outrageous behavior that was supposed to have been fully investigated by the House by last January , according to Ms. Pelosi ’s initial estimate .
Mr. Rangel ’s accumulating missteps and Ms. Pelosi ’s refusal to force him to step aside only compound the spectacle .
Here is the nation ’s chief of tax - writing legislation clinging to power even as his flaws as taxpayer and lawmaker grind slowly and mysteriously through the House ethics committee .
The congressman clearly violated House standards in using his official letterhead to solicit donations from scores of business and foundation leaders for a City College of New York center named for him to house “ the inspirational aspects of my legacy . ”
One oil executive pledged $ 1 million to Mr. Rangel , who insists there was no quid pro quo in his defending an off - shore tax loophole worth tens of millions to the donor .
Mr. Rangel admitted an “ irresponsible ” slip - up in his failure to pay taxes and disclose $ 75,000 in income from a Dominican villa on which he enjoyed an interest - free mortgage .
Closer to home , the congressman was allotted four rent - stabilized apartments in Harlem by a politically savvy landlord  a boon worth an estimated $ 30,000 a year .
The ethics panel is supposed to be studying whether that violates House gift rules .
The Republicans , of course , were chortling at the electioneering value of their resolution that Mr. Rangel ’s problems have “ held the House up to public ridicule . ”
It ’s hard to blame them .
But they better beware  public ridicule is as easily applicable across the aisle and across the Capitol , where Senator John Ensign ’s troubles in job hunting for his cuckolded former aide may eventually merit an ethics investigation .

A deer stand is where you choose to hunt , and can be any location where you wait for the animals .
It could be near a tree , rock , or hilltop ; or it could be a treestand , tripod or ground blind .
The main purpose of a stand is to allow you to see the animal and get a shot before it detects you .
A stand site should afford some means of protection from the animal seeing , smelling or hearing you , while letting you see the animal .
Your method of hunting dictates where you place your stand .
If you are rifle or muzzle loader hunting your stand can be farther away from where you expect deer than if you are shotgun , handgun , archery or crossbow hunting .
Distance alone is enough to avoid detection .
The shorter the effective range of you and your weapon , the more concealment from sight and sound , and the more the wind direction dictate where your stand should be placed .
If you intend to wait for the animals , or use techniques to attract them at distances closer than 100 yards , place your stand out of the direct line of sight of the animal and keep downwind or crosswind from its approach .
A treestand can be placed near high use areas but can be out of normal visual range because of height .
Height also helps to disperse scent and sound .
Ground stands can be effective as long as adequate concealment or camouflage is used , and precautions are taken so the animal does n’t smell you .
There are numerous hunting blinds that conceal movement , muffle sound , and because you are out of the wind , less smell escapes .
Because deer have learned to look into trees for hunters , and associate the upright human form with danger , I have begun hunting more from the ground .
The biggest advantages of ground stand hunting are mobility and comfort .
By sitting on rocks , logs , the ground , or my Back Seat portable stool , I can easily pick up and move if the area is unproductive .
I do n’t have to worry about hanging multiple stands that may or may not be in the right location , or taking down my stand and moving it .
I simply get up and walk away .
This is especially helpful if there is a sudden wind change .
While I am sitting on my Back Seat I do n’t present the upright human form , and deer do n’t perceive me as a danger .
I have been hunting from ground stands for years and have had more “ close encounters ” with animals and shooting opportunities than I have when hunting from a treestand .
Treestands : Location , Placement and Safety
With hunters spending so much time in treestands hoping to see and get a shot at a deer , the location of the stand in relation to where they expect to see the deer is crucial .
But , I often see stands hung too close to open feeding areas , too far from core areas ; too far from or too close to deer travel corridors and trails ; in places where the wind or thermal currents are wrong ; in surroundings where the hunter is sky - lined ; and often too low .
In order for you to get the most out of your treestand it needs to be in the right location ; an area frequented by deer at the time of the day that you intend to hunt from it .
Ideally this is in a wooded or semi- wooded area where the deer feel secure in during the day .
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD ADVERTISEMENT
Secure Areas
Since deer spend the majority of the daylight hours in secure areas , often in thick vegetation and wooded or low - lying areas where visibility is limited , the majority of your stand sites should be in or near those areas .
If you ca n’t see the deer and shoot into those areas , you are too far away .
Deer ( especially older bucks ) do n’t usually leave their security areas and Â move into open areas until shortly before or after sunset , which means that hunters who place their stands at the edge of agricultural fields and other open areas will see fewer deer , and especially older bucks , during legal hunting hours , than hunters who place their stands in or near the secure areas .
Close Enough
A stand also needs to be close enough to where you expect to see the deer to get a shot , but far enough away so that the deer do n’t detect you , either while you are waiting or getting ready for a shot .
Obviously hunters using a bow , crossbow , handgun , shotgun or muzzleloader need to be closer to the deer than a rifle hunter .
When you choose a location for your stand consider the effective shooting distance of you and your weapon , and then set up several yards closer than that for good measure .
Do not set your stand too close to where you expect to see the deer .
Too often I see stands that are within yards of a deer trail , or are hanging off to the side of the trail where the deer may be looking directly toward the stand as it comes around a corner in the trail .
If you are using a short - range weapon , and can see several yards of the trail in any one direction , you are probably too close , because the deer will probably be able to see you .
Not Too Close
Although you want to be close to the deer ’s core area , where they spend most of their time during daylight hours , you do n’t want to be so close that you alert the deer to your presence .
You do n’t want the deer to smell , hear or see you when you are in your stand ; and especially when you put your stand up , which is when you can be seen , smelled or heard by the deer as you walk in , hang your stand and clear shooting lanes .
How close you can get to the core area depends on the terrain , the thickness of the vegetation and the wind direction .
No matter what the terrain and vegetation are like , I do n’t think you can setup a stand closer than 100 yards without the deer hearing , seeing or smelling you .
Air currents are often the determining factor as to where you can set up , because wind from you to the core area will carry your scent to the deer .
If the wind or thermals are wrong , a half mile may be too close .
Air Currents
One of the most important considerations in treestand placement should be wind direction and the movement of thermal air currents .
You want to place your stand where it is either downwind of where you expect to see deer , or down and crosswind of the direction in which you think the deer will be moving .
You do n’t want the deer to be able to smell you at all if possible when you are hunting , even if you do n’t get a shot .
If you have to set up crosswind of a deer ’s approach , you should be very confident that you will be able to take the deer when it comes by , and that the deer wo n’t cross your downwind scent until it is well past you , which should be out of range .
If a deer smells you , even if you did n’t get a shot , it may leave behind enough interdigital or metatarsal scent to alarm other deer that may come through the area .
Those warning scents may linger for hours , reducing your chances of seeing any deer as long as you are there .
You also need to take into consideration the effects of thermal currents .
If you hunt in country with gullies , ravines , hills or mountains , there is a good chance that changing thermal currents will not allow you to hunt some stands are particular times of the day .
Thermal currents generally rise in the morning as the sun heats up the air , and fall in the evening as the air cools .
When the wind is blowing these thermal currents might not be noticeable while you are hunting , and they may not affect your hunting .
Thermal currents may not be noticeable even when there is no wind , but they can ruin a stand location just as easily as the wind .
When you set up your stand be aware of the terrain , and the vegetation .
Thick trees ( especially evergreens ) in otherwise less dense areas may funnel the wind and thermal currents into some areas .
If the area you hunt has changes in elevation , think about what time of day you want to hunt the area , and which way the thermals may be moving at that time of day .
If you are unsure whether or not there are thermals in the area , use talcum powder , thistle down , a piece of sewing thread tied to your weapon , or a commercial product like Breeze Detector from Wildlife Research Center to determine when and which direction the thermals are blowing .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Background Cover
When you set up your stand you do n’t want to be sky - lined , you do n’t want to be noticeable from a deer ’s level of sight .
Try to place your stand in a tree as wide as your body ; or with other trees , limbs or a hill behind you .
The denser the background behind you , the harder it will be for the deer to spot you .
When I hang a stand I like pick a spot on the tree , and then go to where I think I will have my shots , and squat down so that I ’m at the level of the deer , then look at the spot I picked to hang my stand .
If I see a lot of sky , I know I have chosen the wrong spot .
It may also be beneficial to hunt with the sun behind you , rather than in your face , where and when it is possible .
Having the sun behind you keeps sunlight from glaring off you and your equipment , and it makes it easier to see in front of you .
Tree Selection
There are two main things you have to consider when you hang a stand ; strength of the tree and straightness of the tree .
The tree needs to be big enough to support the weight of you and your stand in a high wind , and it needs to be healthy .
Even if a tree is big enough to hold you it may be cracked or rotten .
Check the tree carefully , to make sure there are no cracks or rotted areas in it , and give it a good thump with your tree steps or a stick to make sure it sounds solid .
If you have screw - in steps you also need to make sure you can get your steps into the tree .
Height
Another consideration in stand placement is how high off the ground you want to be .
Height alone can keep you out of the normal line of sight of the deer .
Depending on the terrain and vegetation where you hunt , and the speed and direction of the wind or thermal currents , if you are high enough , the air currents may keep your scent above the areas you intend to hunt , and keep the deer from detecting you .
On the other hand , if you are producing scents that can be detected by the deer , and there is no wind , the higher you are , the more your scent spreads out around you as it descends .
One drawback to height is that the higher you are , the smaller your target zone gets , especially if you are using a short range weapon .
The side of a deer or a bear offers a lot bigger target at ground level than the top of a deer or bear at 40 yards .
You should also think about the terrain around you when you choose a height for your stand .
If you hunt steep hills and ravines , and the deer are moving below you , there is no need to place your stand 20 feet up in a tree , because the deer may already be 5 to 20 feet below your stand .
On the other hand , if you hunt in hilly country or in a ravine or gully , and the deer move on higher ground than your tree , you may have to put your stand higher than normal , because the deer may be moving at about the same level as your stand .
When you place your stand remember that one of the purposes of using a treestand is to be above the normal line of sight of the deer around you , no matter high you are .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Shooting Lanes
While I am on the ground checking to see if my stand is sky - lined I also check to see if I have one or more clear shooting lanes from my stand .
If I do n’t , I decide whether or not I can cut off some limbs and brush out the area to create shooting lanes .
If I have to remove too much vegetation , I look for another place to hang my stand , because cutting too many branches , and removing too much brush , will be noticeable to the deer , and they will be alert when they approach the area .
If they discover a sight , scent or sound that is out of place the first time they come through the area , they may spook , take another route or travel after dark .
You can avoid this by putting your stand up two weeks or more in advance , and then staying out of the area until you plan to hunt .
That way the deer have a chance to get accustomed to the changes when you are n’t there , and without the sight , scent or sound of you .
Â Â Â Â Â
Access Routes
Once I ’ve hung my stands ( I often hang two or three stands in the same area so I can hunt according to the air currents )
I look for one or more routes I can use to get to my stand .
The route I use depends on the time of day I hunt , which direction the air currents are moving , and where I expect the deer to be as I go to my stand .
I like to use the easiest route I can find , a route where I do n’t have to walk through a lot of brush that I might leave scent on as I walk by .
I avoid rough or steep terrain if I can , so that I do n’t have to work too hard to get where I ’m going , which may cause me to make a lot of noise , and it may cause me to work up a sweat .
Unless
I have spent a lot of time in the area , and the deer have gotten accustomed to seeing , smelling and hearing me moving through it , I try to stay well away from any deer trail , especially the lightly used buck trails and rub routes .
If I have to cross a trail I try to do it far enough from where I expect the deer to be coming from , and far enough in advance of the time they get there , that much of my scent will have dispersed by the time the deer come through .
If there are watercourses in the area that I can walk in , I use them to get to my stand .
However , because I often scout my hunting areas every day , checking for tracks , droppings and scrapes , the deer get used to me , which allows me to walk on or next to their trails without them becoming alarmed when I hunt .
I believe that if you scout your hunting area two to three times per week , between the hours of 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM ( when the deer are usually in their core areas ) you can get the deer accustomed to your scent , and you can use the same trails the deer do when you go to your stand .
Â Â
Safety
Safety should be on your mind every time you get into your treestand .
But , all too often , hunters fail toÂ use even the slightest precautions when they are in their stands .
Climbing 10 to 20 feet up a tree on tree steps , and standing on a two to three foot square platform that high up is dangerous ; take some precautions so that you , or someone you are with does n’t fall and get hurt .
Use a climbing belt when you go up the tree , and a safety belt or harness when you are in the tree .
Two of my favorite safety belts are the Treehopper , which doubles as a heavy duty climbing and safety belt , and the Silent Slide safety belt , which allows you to pivot 180 degrees in silence .
When my kids took up hunting I began to worry about their safety , and I realized that if they fell while they were wearing a safety belt , they might end up upside down , or with a severely injured midsection .
So , I began working on a safety harness , with straps around both legs to keep the wearer from falling out of the harness , with the attachment for the tether strap between the shoulders , so they would n’t end up upside down if they did fall .
With the tether strap between the shoulders you could also use the harness as a deer drag .
Then I though about adding a couple of rings to the front of the harness , so you could use the tether strap as a climbing belt .
I was well on my way to producing the safety harness / deer drag / climbing belt when I found out that there was already one on the market .
I firmly believe that a safety harness is the best precaution you can take , especially if you are a heavy person , or for children .

While everyone is so focused on the anniversary of Lehman Brothers ( 9/15 ) and AIG ( 9/16 ) , today is a different sort of anniversary :
Its been exactly one year months since the single dumbest column ever published in The Washington Post appeared : Quit Doling Out That Bad-Economy Line .
Breathtaking in its ignorance , shocking in its fallibility , astonishing in its author ’s perversely misperceived world view , it stands as a monument to sheer cluelessness in a single person :
“ There have been 11 recessions since the Great Depression .
And we ’re nowhere close to being in the 12th one now .
This is n’t just a matter of opinion .
Words — even words as seemingly subjective as “ recession ” — have meaning . ”

It turned out that we were already in a recession for 9 months — and it was about to get a whole lot worse .
The article goes on to deny the Housing slump , misreads the debt markets , recommends equities , states that bank capital was more than sufficient , looked at employment trends as proof there was no recession , applauds economic growth levels , decried the use of the terms crisis ” and “ meltdown ” — and gets every single one exactly wrong .
If you had a time machine , knew the future , and purposefully tried to write something where every word was literally wrong , you could not have done a better job .
Be sure to read the whole embarrassing thing if you want to enjoy a good chuckle .

Taliban militants have stepped up their attacks against the US - led forces
The US military in Afghanistan is to be allowed to pay Taliban fighters who renounce violence against the government in Kabul .
The move is included in a defence bill which President Obama has signed .
Such payments have already been widely used by US commanders in Iraq , but it is the first time the system is being formally adopted in Afghanistan .
Early on Wednesday , Afghan troops were engaged in a shootout with suspected militants at a house in Kabul .
A day earlier eight US soldiers were killed in bomb attacks in southern Afghanistan .
The deaths make October the deadliest month for American forces in the eight - year war in Afghanistan .
President Obama is yet to decide whether to send thousands more troops to Afghanistan .
Mr Obama has said he will not risk their lives " unless it is absolutely necessary " .
The latest attacks come amid heightened tension in Afghanistan in the run-up to the second round of a presidential election marred by widespread fraud in favour of incumbent President Hamid Karzai .
' Re - integration ' programmes
The Commander 's Emergency Response Programme , or Cerp , was set up to give the US military the means to clear roads , dig wells and provide other urgent humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan , the BBC's Richard Lister in Washington says .
Foreign forces in Afghanistan are sustaining heavier casualties But in Iraq , the money can also be given to insurgents provided they switch sides .
Backers of the Cerp scheme say it enabled some 90,000 formerly hostile Iraqis to form local militias and protect their towns from militants , our correspondent says .
He adds that now the same authority is being given to US commanders in Afghanistan .
A clause in the annual defence appropriations bill says they can use the money to support the " re-integration into Afghan society " of those who have renounced violence against the Afghan government .
Although $ 1.3bn ( £ 691 m ) has been authorised for the fund as a whole , no specific sum has been allocated to the re-integration programmes , our correspondent says .
The Senate Armed Services Committee chairman , Senator Carl Levin , has said he envisages the money being used to pay former Taliban fighters to protect their communities .

We were having a chat in the Clearleft office today about site stats and their relative uselessness ; numbers about bounce rates are like eyetracking data — without knowing the context , they ’re not going to tell you anything .
Anyway , I was reminded that I have an account over at Google Webmaster Tools set up for three of my sites : adactio.com , huffduffer.com and thesession.org .
I logged in today for the first time in ages and started poking around .
I noticed that I had some unread messages .
Who knew that Google Webmaster Tools has a messaging system ?
I guess all software really does evolve until it can send email .
One of the messages had the subject line Blocked URLs :
For legal reasons , we ’ve excluded from our search results content located at or under the following URL / directory : http://www.thesession.org/discussions/display/21250
This content has been removed from all Google search results .
Cause : Somone has filed a DMCA complaint against your site .
What now ?
I visited the URL and found a fairly tame discussion about Perfect Pitch .
Here ’s the only part of the discussion that references an external resource in a non-flattering light :
I think that is referring to www.PerfectPitch.com.
I ’m not saying anything about such commercially - oriented courses because I do n’t know them , but I think we ’d all be wise to bear in mind the general comments voiced in the first two posts on this thread .
That single reference to a third - party site is , apparently , enough to trigger a DMCA complaint .
Google link to the complaint on Chilling Effects but that just says
The cease - and - desist or legal threat you requested is not yet available .
It does , however , list the party who sent the complaint : Boucherle .
By a staggering coincidence , Gary Boucherle of American Educational Music , Inc. is registered as the owner of perfectpitch.com .
So let ’s get this straight .
In a discussion about perfect pitch , someone mentions the website perfectpitch.com .
They do n’t repost any materials from the site .
They do n’t even link to the site .
They do n’t really say anything particularly disparaging .
But it all takes is for the owner of perfectpitch.com to abuse the Digitial Millenium Copyright
Act with a spurious complaint and just like that , Google removes the discussion from its search index .
To be fair , Google also explain how to file a counter - complaint .
However , the part about agreeing to potentially show up in a court in California is somewhat off - putting for those of us , like me , who live outside the United States of America .
There is another possible explanation for this insane over - reaction ; one that would explain why the offended party sent the complaint to Google rather than going down the more traditional route of threatening the ISP …
The Session has pretty good Google juice .
The markup is pretty lean , the content is semantically structured and there ’s plenty of inbound links .
Could it be that the owner of perfectpitch.com sent a DMCA complaint to Google simply because another site was getting higher rankings for the phrase “ perfect pitch ” ?
If so , then that ’s a whole new level of SEO snake - oilery .
Hmmm … that gives me an idea .
If you have a blog or other personal publishing platform , perhaps you would like to write a post titled Perfect Pitch ?
Feel free to republish anything from this post , which is also coincidentally titled Perfect Pitch .
And feel free to republish the contents of the original discussion on The Session titled , you guessed it : Perfect Pitch .
Update :
Thanks for inbound links , everyone .
The matter is now being resolved .
I have received an apology from Gary Bourcherle who was being more stupid than evil .
CIA director Leon Panetta got into hot water with Congress , after he revealed an agency program to hunt down and kill terrorists .
A recent report from the U.S. military 's Joint Special Operations University argues that the CIA did n't go far enough ( .pdf ) .
Instead , it suggests the American government should set up something like a " National Manhunting Agency " to go after jihadists , drug dealers , pirates and other enemies of the state .
America 's military , intelligence and law - enforcement agencies already devote thousands of people and billions of dollars to tracking down top terrorists and insurgents .
But even the most successful of these efforts – like going after Iraqi militant leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi – have been " ad hoc " efforts , with units cobbled together from different corners of the government .
Report author and retired Lt. Col.
George Crawford instead would like to see a permanent group with clear authority , training , doctrine and technology to go after these dangerous individuals .
These " manhunting teams would be standing formations , trained to pursue their designated quarry relentlessly for as long as required to accomplish the mission , " he writes .
Sometimes , that will mean operating " in uncooperative countries . "
In those cases , the teams must be prepared " to act unilaterally , with no support or coordination with local authorities , in a manner similar to that employed by Israel ’s Avner team in response to the Munich Olympics massacre . "
( That was the controversial unit , fictionalized in Steven Spielberg 's movie , that allegedly roamed the world , assassinating Palestinian militants in response to the 1972 Olympic attack . )
The hit squads would only be one part of the manhunting agency , according to the Joint Special Operations University monograph , uncovered by Inside Defense .
" Dedicated teams must be assembled , able to respond ' on - call ' in the event of a raid on a suspect site or to conduct independent ' break - in and search ' operations without leaving evidence of their intrusion , " Crawford notes .
Manhunting will also " require personnel who are experts at conducting surveillance of particular facilities , personnel , or activities without arousing suspicion or being detected , " he adds .
" Picture in your mind a typical city street scene , with a little old lady walking her dog , the phone repair crew descending into a manhole , two little old men playing an innocent game of checkers , or the homeless person sleeping on the park bench , and you are on the right track . "
Such a group would n't just go after terrorists .
" Human networks are behind narcotics trafficking , arms proliferation , piracy , hiding war criminals from authorities , human trafficking , or other smuggling activities , " Crawford writes .
" Human networks also lie at the core of national governments , offering an increased potential to nonlethally influence state actors with precision .
A robust manhunting capability would allow the United States to interdict these human networks . "
Crawford , who says he served as the " lead strategist " for developing U.S. Special Operations Command 's " advanced intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance capabilities for counterterrorism operations , " compares manhunting to " curling , the Winter Olympics sport .
As a skater releases the heavy stone onto the ice , a few strokes from a broom can alter the speed and trajectory of the stone .
Likewise , a small amount of precise influence or force employed at an early point in a developing situation might divert the trajectory of an event away from crisis or full - scale conflict . "

Blaze breaks out as workers attempt to plug leak with heavy mud to stop oil slick which is threatening marine wildlife
A massive fire has broken out on an Austalian oil rig and delayed plans to plug the leak that has been spilling oil into the Timor Sea since August .
The blaze started on Sunday when workers began pumping heavy mud into a leaking well casing .
An estimated 400 barrels of oil a day have escaped from the hole since 21 August , threatening marine wildlife over an area ten times the size of London .
Australia 's government today promised an investigation , the latest drama in a 10 - week saga to plug the hole .
PTTEP Australasia , which operates the rig , said no one was injured and nonessential workers were evacuated after the fire broke out on the West Atlas rig and Montara wellhead platform .
Officials had planned to pour more mud into the leak on Monday in the hopes of removing the source of fuel from the fire , which was sending massive plumes of smoke into the sky .
But the company said it was mixing 4,000 barrels of heavy mud , and would not be ready to pour it down the well until Tuesday .
On Sunday , PTTEP Australasia chief financial officer Jose Martins said the company does n't know how the blaze started .
" Presently there are many unanswered questions , including what caused the fire , " Martins told reporters in Perth .
" Our sole focus now is the safety of all personnel , bringing the fire under control and completing the well kill . "
Federal resources minister Martin Ferguson said that once the spill is contained he would launch an official inquiry .
" Our requirement is to assess the cause of the accident and any lessons to be learnt , and that could lead to a change in the regulatory environment , " he told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio .
Ferguson later told reporters in Melbourne that if PTTEP was " found to have been at fault with respect to any of their responsibilities , then any potential action will be appropriately considered at the time . "
The oil slick from the rig , about 150 miles off Australia 's north - west coast , now stretches across thousands of milesof remote ocean .
Indonesia said last week that thousands of dead fish and clumps of oil have been found drifting near its coastline .
Prime minister Kevin Rudd said today he was " deeply disturbed " at the latest turn of events on the rig , signalling the government 's rising frustration that fixing the spill is taking so long .
" Do I think this is acceptable ?
No , I don't , " Rudd told Fairfax Radio Network .
" Are we angry with this company ?
Yes we are .
Are were trying to do everything we can to get this under control ?
You betcha . "
Stop the Apartheid Wall , Nov. 9-15
Apartheid and walls never seem to work .
Help us bring an end to apartheid in the Occupied Palestinian Territories by bringing down Israel 's apartheid wall .
A coalition of Palestinian Popular Committees has called for a week of action to bring down the apartheid wall ; now is the time for you to answer that call !
Please use the following resources and strategies to bring an end to Israeli apartheid .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - The United States would veto a Palestinian declaration of statehood in the United Nations Security Council , U.S. senators visiting Israel said Monday .
They said the threat by Palestinian officials to take the issue to a United Nations resolution was a waste of time and would go nowhere .
They urged Arab states to stop it .
“ It would be D.O.A. - dead on arrival , ” Democratic Party Senator Ted Kaufman ( DE ) told a news conference in Jerusalem .
“ It ’s a waste of time . ”
Senator Joseph Lieberman ( CT ) , an independent , said “ an essentially unilateral ” declaration of statehood was the one thing that would not move the stalled peace process forward .
“ I hope and presume that the United States would veto such a move if it ever came to the Security Council , ” Lieberman said .
The only way to end the Middle East conflict was an agreement reached through bilateral negotiations , he added .
The Palestinians should “ give the new government of Israel an opportunity at the negotiating table , ” he said .
Without setting a timeframe , Palestinian officials Sunday said the Palestinian leadership planned to go to the U.N. in an effort to secure international support for an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
They said the move was born of frustration at the lack of progress in peace talks , stalled for a year with no sign of any end to the deadlock over Palestinian demands that Israel freeze building of settlements on occupied land in the West Bank .
STICK TO NEGOTIATIONS
Israel reacted quickly , warning that a negotiated peace agreement was the only solution to the conflict , while declaring a state without it would lead to Israeli counter - measures that could include annexation of more West Bank territory .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was “ no substitute for negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority and any unilateral path will only unravel the framework of agreements between us and will only bring unilateral steps from Israel ’s side . ”
Monday , however , Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said moves were already under way to seek a decision from the U.N. Security Council to recognize the Palestinian state .
He said Israel had for 18 years continued to “ impose facts on ground by stealing Palestinian lands and build settlements and barriers aiming to finish off the two - state project . ”
U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham ( SC ) said a “ unilateral ” declaration by the Palestinians “ would take a desperate situation and make it more chaotic . ”
“ Now is the time for the Arab leadership of this world to step forward and urge the President of the Palestinian Authority to sit down with this new government and see where it goes , ” Graham said .

A DECISION by an investigating judge to send Jacques Chirac , a former president , to stand trial in a court is without precedent in modern French history .
Mr Chirac is accused of “ misappropriation of public funds ” during his time as mayor of Paris .
The decision comes in a month in which the entrails of France 's one - time ruling elite have been spilling out .
A former interior minister , Charles Pasqua , was this week sentenced to a year in prison ( and a suspended sentence of two years ) for involvement in arms trafficking to Angola .
A former prime minister , Dominique de Villepin , has also been tried in connection with a smear campaign and is awaiting a verdict .
The case against Mr Chirac concerns 21 “ fake jobs ” that were allegedly created for friends at the Paris town hall , where he held office between 1977 and 1995 .
As long as he was president , from 1995 to 2007 , Mr Chirac was immune from prosecution , and his lawyer has argued that he remains so for acts carried out during his time in office .
This has frustrated various investigating judges over the years , who have compiled numerous dossiers concerning Mr Chirac , all of which have been dropped , in some cases because the statute of limitations had expired .
Many observers expected the same to happen with the last remaining case , especially after the public prosecutor , himself appointed by Mr Chirac , judged that there was not enough evidence to take it to court .
Yet in a bold move Xavière Simeoni , the investigating judge leading the case against the ex-president , decided otherwise .
It remains uncertain whether the case will reach court .
The prosecutor may appeal against the decision , which would delay any proceedings .
Mr Chirac 's office said that he was “ serene ” about the matter , and confident that he could demonstrate that the jobs were real .
But if found guilty Mr Chirac could face ten years in prison .
It is the first time under France 's fifth republic that a former head of state has been ordered to stand trial .
The decision comes at the end of a highly charged month which has cast light on all manner of murky dealings at the heart of the French elite , many of them during Mr Chirac 's presidency .
The judgment this week in the arms - trafficking case to Angola concerned the supply , in contravention of a United Nations arms embargo , of landmines , shells , tanks , helicopters and naval vessels to the Angolan government between 1993 and 1998 , during its civil war .
Mr Pasqua , who has appealed against his conviction , was Mr Chirac 's interior minister .
Among the dozens of other defendants , Jean - Christophe Mitterrand , son of the Socialist former president and his father 's Africa adviser at the time , was fined for embezzlement and given a two - year suspended prison sentence .
Pierre Falcone , a French arms dealer , and Arkady Gaydamak , an Israeli - Russian businessman , were each sentenced to six years imprisonment .
The French political class has also been gripped this month by a trial over the “ Clearstream ” smear - campaign .
Mr de Villepin , who was prime minister under Mr Chirac , has been accused of helping to spread a fake list of names linking Nicolas Sarkozy , then a fellow government minister and fierce rival , and other politicians to false bank accounts supposedly containing kickbacks from arms deals .
Prosecutors have asked for an 18 - month suspended sentence against Mr de Villepin for complicity in slander , and jail terms for two others .
Mr de Villepin has denied all the charges .
The verdict is due in January .
The consequences of all this for President Sarkozy are likely to be limited .
He served in government under Mr Chirac , and is from the same political family , but was also his fierce rival and campaigned for office against Mr Chirac 's record .
Mr Sarkozy is unconnected to the Angola trial and he is a civil plaintiff in the Clearstream case .
Still , the conviction of Mr Pasqua does raise questions about the political milieu in which he made his name .
Mr Pasqua was head of the Hauts - de - Seine council , the department that includes the posh suburb of Neuilly , where Mr Sarkozy was first elected mayor , and became his political godfather .
The “ Angolagate ” trial has strained relations between France and the oil - rich former Portuguese colony .
In May last year Mr Sarkozy made a one - day trip there to try to smooth relations .
In many ways , this series of trials gives France a dismal image .
A class of politicians seems to have been up to no good for a long period of time , and to have assumed that the timorous French justice system would never act .
This month 's events , however , have suggested exactly the opposite : that forthright investigating judges can still hold politicians to account .
After twenty years of sex - free marriage , a frigid woman has discovered that her asexual husband is really a woman , and she finally admitted that she is really a man .
And , when they found out the truth , they finally had sex for the first time , and they loved it !
Marco and Kalala Tergensonen , of Kuopio , Finland , had both been dressing as the opposite sex since their teenage years .
Marco , originally Marcia , 38 , had always enjoyed dressing , talking , and acting like a woman .
And Kalala , originally Katu , had always enjoyed cutting his hair and dressing to look like a man .
When the couple fell in love and got married , it just made each of their little games that much more believable .
And , in twenty years , they just never got around to having sex .
The subject simply never came up , since neither of them wanted to face the issue .
“ I thought Marco was n’t interested , ” says Kalala .
“ And that was fine with me , because I did n’t want to have sex with him . ”
“ The same goes for Kalala , ” Marco says .
“ I had no desire at all to make love to another woman .
So when she never said anything about it , and never touched me in any sexual way , it made life a lot easier . ”
In the future , the couple plans to keep everything the way it was — except in bed .
“ I ’m still Marco , ” says the woman who talks , walks , and works ( as a heavy machinery operator ) just like a man .
“ Except when the lights go out .
Then I ’m Marcia for a little while .
This has been the most incredible surprise a person could ever get . ”
“ And I ’m still Kalala , ” says the man who wears short dresses and swings his hips as a waitress in a popular restaurant .
“ Until we get cozy .
Then I ’m Katu again .
It ’s great . ”

The " A.V. " is the tool most commonly used for semen collection from stallions for use in artificial insemination programs , for the semen to be frozen , or for analysis .
There are many types of artificial vagina available commercially .
Although there are differences , they all follow the same general design format of having a tubular inner liner , usually of latex , which is surrounded by a fillable water jacket encased in a harder outer shell .
Attachable at the distal end is some form of collection apparatus to capture the ejaculated semen , this apparatus will often include a filter of some sort to remove the gel fraction of the ejaculate and any detritus such as smegma .
Probably the two most common models seen in use in North America are the Colorado and Missouri models .
The Colorado model has been modified by other companies but retains a similar basic design .
Each AV model has different advantages , and many technicians - and indeed stallions - may develop a preference for one or another model .
Below we show AVs commonly available in the USA and list some of the advantages seen with each model :
COLORADO STYLE Various manufacturers
Retains water temperature longer in cold weather
Is more durable under extreme use
Liner is cheaper to replace when worn or damaged
If not too long , allows the stallion to ejaculate well clear of the heated liner , thereby avoiding danger of sperm damage by heat shock MISSOURI Manufactured by : NASCO and others
Is cheaper to purchase initially
Is lighter and therefore easier to handle when filled with water
Will allow for the addition of air to make the liner tighter
Allows a less direct manual stimulation of the penis , which can be preferable with some stallions FRENCH ( INRA MODEL ) Manufactured by : IMV Technologies
Has 2 handles ( second handle not visible ) making it extremely easy to handle
Holds marginally more water than the Missouri or Roanoke models , but not as much as the Colorado , making it lighter to handle , but maintaining good heat retention properties
The removable / adjustable latex hood ( seen at the right end of image ) enables the use of a single AV for many different size stallions
The latex hood also allows for the less direct manual stimulation of the glans of the penis during collection if required
Liner is cheaper to replace when worn or damaged BOTUPHARMA ( BRAZILIAN MODEL ) Manufactured by : BotuPharma
Extremely light weight - can be held with one hand
Is more durable under extreme use
Has solid handle making it extremely easy to hold
Holds marginally more water than the Missouri or Roanoke models , but not as much as the Colorado , making it lighter to handle , but maintaining good heat retention properties
Liner is cheaper to replace when worn or damaged ROANOKE Manufactured by : Roanoke AI Labs .
Extremely light weight - can be held with one hand
Allows for great bell pressure on penis glans , which is preferred by some stallions
Shortness permits manual stimulation of the upper shaft of the penis at the sensitive pressure point located close to the preputial ring
" Spit - off " pressure relief valve automatically adjusts water pressure to required level
Summary
At Equine - Reproduction.com we have used all of the above models , but generally prefer either the French or Brazilian models , as we find they are convenient in size and weight to handle , while providing rigidity and good heat retention properties .
Many farms and semen collection centers use a sterile liner in the artificial vagina .
This liner is usually made of a thin plastic of some sort , and is especially useful if one is collecting semen from different stallions , as it pretty well eliminates any chance of cross-contamination of any kind , either bacterial or seminal .
Even if not collecting multiple stallions , it is still extremely convenient , as it eliminates the need for removing and cleaning the latex AV liner after each use , and aside from the time savings , this will also assist in extending the length of time before the latex liner becomes worn out .
Often stallion owners will advise us that some stallions do not tolerate a disposable liner , but we have found that changing the internal temperature or pressure of the AV , or switching to another brand or style of liner that may be of a different thickness or " softness " will solve this situation .
Some of the sterile liners available commercially , notably those designed for use in the Missouri model AV , come with a built - in filter for gel and detritus , which can be very convenient .
If one is going to be using the AV a lot however , it may be preferable to buy your liner in a straight continuous roll , and cut off the desired length at the time of use , as this will prove a lot cheaper .
Women seeking abortions in Oklahoma are to be forced to reveal an array of personal information , such as the state of their relationships , how many children they have and their race , which will be posted on an official website .
Abortion rights groups say the new law is intended to intimidate women because , although it does not require them to reveal their names , other information to be made public will sometimes be enough to identify them .
The move , which takes effect on 1 November , comes after a judge struck down a law that would have forced women to undergo an ultrasound and to listen to a doctor 's description of the embryo or foetus before a termination .
Abortion rights groups have filed a lawsuit to try to block the new law , which requires women seeking abortions to provide doctors with answers to 34 questions including their age , marital status and education levels , as well as the number of previous pregnancies and abortions .
Women are required to reveal their relationship with the father , the reason for the abortion and the area where the abortion was performed .
Doctors are obliged to pass the information on to the Oklahoma health department , which will post it on a public website .
Jennifer Mondino , a lawyer for the Centre for Reproductive Rights , said the reporting requirements were intended to " make women more nervous about going to [ abortion ] doctors " .
" The intent of this law is to further restrict access to abortions in Oklahoma , " she said .
" There are a number of states that have a reporting requirement but not as broad and detailed as in Oklahoma .
It 's very unusual to consider putting such detail about patients on a website . "
Oklahoma was a state with a small population , Mondino said , and " questions about race , number of children , other details can be used to identify a patient .
There 's a trend in Oklahoma , every year putting out new laws intended to restrict women 's access to abortions and to make it harder for doctors to provide them , " she said .
Doctors face prosecution and loss of their medical licences for failing to provide the state with the required information .
Mondino said that would make doctors hesitant to perform terminations for fear of unintentionally falling foul of the law .
" Anti-choice advocates in other states watch and see what happens in Oklahoma .
Oklahoma has become a leader in this , " she said .
Two years ago , Oklahoma passed a law barring public funds from being used for abortions with the exception of rape or incest .
The effect has been to prevent virtually all hospitals in the state from carrying out terminations because they are unable to prove that some part of the procedure has not been subsidised by public money .
Many hospitals had in any case already stopped terminations under pressure from politicians and intimidation by anti-abortion groups .
About 96 % of the state 's counties have no abortion provider and most women seeking terminations have to travel .
Last month a judge struck down a state law requiring a doctor about to perform an abortion to carry out an ultrasound with the screen positioned in front of the mother and to then describe the developing limbs and organs of the foetus .
The woman could not be forced to look at the screen but would have no choice but to listen to the doctor 's description .
The law required that the ultrasound be carried out vaginally if the pregnancy was in its early stages in order to get a clear picture .
Rape victims were not exempted .
The sponsor of that law , the Republican state senator Todd Lamb , said it was intended to give the mother " as much information as possible about that baby " because it might grow up to win the Nobel prize .
The legislation was successfully challenged because the Oklahoma state constitution requires laws to address only one subject at a time .
The ultrasound legislation also restricted use of the morning - after pill .
The attorney general is appealing against the ruling .
Lamb is also behind the latest law , which opponents are challenging on similar grounds .
About 10 % of pregnancies in Oklahoma end in induced abortions .
Something old .
On March 30 , 2009 Tom Keene of Bloomberg 's " On the Economy " interviewed Robert Lucas and Edward Prescott .
Ed Prescott 's part of the interview is much , much stranger than Robert Lucas .
In the part I want to highlight , Prescott starts out with an apparent belief that after 1984 the Federal Reserve stopped trying to stabilize the economy :
PRESCOTT : I do n’t see the mechanism for money [ to affect the economy ] ....
[ O ] nce the Fed stopped trying to stabilize the economy , the economy got a lot more stable ...
Where this comes from I cannot imagine .
It certainly does n't describe anything the Federal Reserve has done over the past quarter century .
And it gets more bizarre .
Prescott says that the financial crisis did not affect the economy :
PRESCOTT : I think the financial crisis has been greatly overstated as a problem ... [ it ] has had virtually no consequences for the real economy ...
What did affect the economy was big bad government scaring people for no reason :
PRESCOTT : [ P ] eople got scared ....
The press scared people .
People running for office scared people .
Bernanke scared people ; Paulson scared people ....
[ P ] eople began not to know what was going to happen .
Then they stopped investing -- by investing , I mean getting a new car or fixing up your house .
And that led to the economy -- it was depressed a bit that fourth quarter of last year ...
Depressed " a bit " ?
Yes , a bit -- and only a bit :
PRESCOTT : The growth rate from 4th quarter 2007 to 4th quarter of 2008 , that includes that bad quarter , was 1 % ....
And if that fourth quarter was a normal quarter , it would have been almost up to trend ...
If only the Federal Reserve and the Treasury had let the economy alone maybe the fourth quarter would have been a normal quarter , Prescott says :
[ With ] benign neglect the economy would have come roaring back quite quickly ...
And if the economy does not come roaring back with a very strong recovery now , Prescott knows what to blame : big government scaring people again .
He simply does not live in the consensus reality with the rest of us .
Ah , well : at least the reality he lives in is a happier place then this one .
BREAST CANCER AND PAIN BREAST CANCER AND PAIN FORUM : LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM : LIVING WITH CANCER Patients , survivors , loved ones touched by any type of cancer invited to share questions , advice , experiences Nearly half of breast cancer survivors suffer from persistent pain , even two to three years after surgery , a study shows .
Almost 60 % of the 3,253 women surveyed experience other symptoms of nerve damage , such as numbness or tenderness , according to a study of all Danish women treated for breast cancer in 2005 and 2006 .
Women under 40 and those who have more extensive surgery , such as a mastectomy , and radiation are the most likely to report pain , says the University of Copenhagen 's Henrik Kehlet , senior author of the report in today 's Journal of the American Medical Association .
Women also have more pain if surgeons remove many of the lymph nodes in their armpits , a common place for breast cancer to spread , the study says .
Fortunately , most breast cancer patients can ease their symptoms with over - the - counter pain relievers , says Loretta Loftus of Tampa's H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center , who co-wrote an accompanying editorial .
Kehlet says his study underscores the need to improve care , both by finding ways to reduce nerve damage during surgery and by learning why some women have so much pain and others do not .
Though it 's not always possible to prevent chronic pain , doctors say women can reduce their risk .
Women should choose doctors who perform " sentinel - node " biopsies , says Moffitt 's Christine Laronga , who co-wrote the editorial .
In the procedure , surgeons remove and test one or a few key lymph node for malignant cells instead of automatically removing all of the nodes .
If the sentinel node is cancer - free , surgeons leave the others in place .
The procedure also reduces the risk of lymphedema , a painful swelling in the arm .

What went wrong in Dubai Dubai does not have the enormous oil wealth enjoyed by its neighbours such as Abu Dhabi .
Its main source of wealth has historically been as a port .
In recent years it has sought to make money from property development and luxury tourism , building impressive hotels such as the Burj al - Arab .
The global downturn left many financial workers unemployed .
The population fell an estimated 17 % , meaning there was little demand for new properties .
There was also less demand for luxury holidays .
Dubai companies have borrowed money to fund huge building projects such as " The World " and are now unable to repay it .
There are jitters on financial markets about who lent all the money .
European banks are estimated to have lent more than £ 50bn to the whole of the United Arab Emirates .
Dubai state - backed companies may also have to sell - off some of their assets overseas such as luxury property in London and the Turnberry golf course in Scotland .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT US shares have fallen on worries about Dubai 's debt problems , with the Dow Jones ending down 154 points , or 1.5 % , at 10,309.92 , in a shorter trading day .
It was the first chance for markets in the US to react to news that state - owned Dubai World had asked for more time to repay its debts .
US markets were closed for a holiday on Thursday when other world markets suffered steep losses .
However , the main European markets recovered from earlier falls .
The main share indexes in the UK , France and Germany had all fallen by more than 3 % on Thursday .
But after falling further in early trade on Friday , the UK's FTSE 100 closed up 1 % , and both Germany 's Dax index and France 's Cac 40 ended more than 1 % higher .
Earlier in Asia , Japan 's Nikkei index had closed down 3.2 % and the Hong Kong Hang Seng ended 4.8 % lower .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the fall in the markets as a " setback " but said it was " not on the scale of previous problems " .
" The world financial system is stronger now and able to deal with the problems that arise , " he told reporters on his way to a Commonwealth leaders summit .
Holiday hiatus Dubai World is the centrepiece of the Gulf state 's economy .
Certain London - based hedge funds who had bet on Dubai World being bailed out could have an uncomfortable few weeks ahead

Sources close to the company have suggested that various refinancing options have been on the table for at least a month , although details have not been revealed until now .
A six - month suspension on interest payments is believed to be the most likely option .
David Buik , senior partner at BGC Partners , said : " You ca n't just say to the world : ' I do n't want to pay my debts ' .
There is no income coming in from any of these properties .
I think this is shocking PR . "
The news shook markets that are recovering from the collapse of the US housing market and contagion that threatened to rupture the global financial system last year .
It was the timing of the announcement as much as the lack of clear information that heightened nerves .
The first news emerged late on Wednesday , as the Muslim world was preparing for its Eid celebrations .
It also coincided with the closedown of the world 's most important share market , with US markets winding down for Thursday 's Thanksgiving holiday .
Uncertainty of the scale of banks ' exposure to Dubai hit banking shares at first .
However , bank shares recovered strongly throughout Friday morning .
Threat to confidence
The biggest underlying fear is that Dubai 's problems could reignite the international financial turmoil of the credit crisis .

Any knock to economic confidence could lower global demand for a whole range of commodities , including oil .
Oil prices dropped sharply .
US crude fell about 5 % to $ 73.64 a barrel and London Brent Crude was down $ 1.56 to $ 75.31 .
Dubai , which has less oil money than many of its neighbours , became a trading and tourism hub with global ambitions .
Dubai World , the conglomerate that led the emirate 's expansion , had $ 59bn ( £ 36 bn ) of liabilities as of August , a large proportion of Dubai 's total debt of $ 80 bn .
Its subsidiary Nakheel was the builder of the landmark palm tree - shaped island developments off Dubai .

the rhodes trust squares off against wall street
The Rhodes Trust is concerned that the financial industry is effectively bribing top notch talent away from politics , science , and technology , and parasitizing our future in the process .
Wall Street has three favorite activities .
The first is making big , bold bets .
The second is making a staggering amount of cash .
The third is boasting how its banks employ only the best and the brightest , and they ’re more than ready to shell out whatever it takes to attract them .
Since most of the compensation comes from a bonus based on how profitable the company has been in a given year , they can afford to promise millions to a future scientist , or general , or researcher for diving headfirst into the stock market .
And after more than two decades , the American Secretary of the Rhodes Trust , which gives highly prestigious scholarships to some of the most promising scholars in the world , voiced his concern that all the Wall Street style hyper - bonuses which have been dangled in front of Rhodes scholars , are creating a very disruptive brain - drain from other disciplines .
Having written for a business magazine and spent time at business school , I can already hear the infuriated cries of those who grew up in a culture that cherishes business above everything else or have a somewhat unhealthy trust in the stock market as the ultimate arbiter of the economy about the anti-business attitude of those Ivory Tower elitists .
And indeed , some of the comments on his op - ed say almost exactly that .
But the real point Elliot Gerson is making is n’t about the values of capitalism vs. the values public service .
The issue that bothers him , and should bother us as well , is the jaw - dropping asymmetry in compensation which lures people who could make very useful and productive contributions in other fields .
The higher the pay disparity , the less incentive there is to go into a field that pays well , but not thousands of times as well as going to Wall Street and inventing new ways to leverage banks into the stratosphere and beyond .
If everyone ’s busy making millions on The Street when the getting is good , who ’s going to invent a new wave of actual products that will move the knowledge economy forward ?
Gerson lets the numbers highlight his concerns …
… Until [ the 1980s ] , even though business ambitions and management degrees have not been disfavored in our competition , business careers attracted relatively few Rhodes scholars .
No one suggested this was an unfit domain ; it was simply the rare scholar who went to [ join ]
Wall Street , finance and general business management .
Only three American Rhodes scholars in the 1970s ( out of 320 ) went directly into business from Oxford ; by the late 1980s the number grew to that many in a year .
Recently , more than twice as many went into business in just one year than did in the entire 1970s .
To put those statistics in perspective , over the last twenty years business fields went from attracting under 1 % of all Rhodes scholars to nearly a quarter of them based on the disparity between the earnings of almost any other profession and the finance / management combination of Wall Street .
Just like the financial sector spent the last three decades creating boom and busts cycles made of ever larger bubbles which popped with brutal results for the economy at large , so do the business professions seem to be becoming an academic bubble which is being fueled by leveraging debt related assets for immense profits .
Even the recent bust which really should ’ve shown how unstable and precariously positioned Wall Street banks really are and that instead of a sharp eye for new innovations , the banks make money by plowing everything they ’ve got into the hottest asset of the day , is unlikely to stem the tide of wanna - be business tycoons .
Already , banks are paying stratospheric bonuses at the end of a year in which they used public money to save themselves from absolute obliteration , then gambled with it to return to profitability , tempting more and more students to get an MBA rather than an M.S. or a PhD .
Sure it ’s good to know your way around money and have a general business sense to raise funding for your projects , and I think everyone should be required to take a few business classes to understand how their potentially profitable ideas could one day be brought to life .
But something is very wrong if we have more managers than designers , scientists or engineers and the cash to pay them comes from playing with algebra rather than investing into the future …
Mexican authorities have arrested the secretary for public security of an eastern state on suspicion of co-operating with drug gangs .
Salvador Rocha Vargas was arrested on Wednesday in the state of Quintana Roo .
He is one of the most senior public officials to be held over alleged links to Mexico 's powerful drug gangs .
But the governor of Quintana Roo denied that it was being taken over by drug gangs , following the arrest and earlier detentions of other senior officials .
Mr Rocha Vargas , who has been in office for a year and a half , was detained by the military on Wednesday over his suspected links to organised crime .
Other senior officials were also arrested - among them the chief of Cancun 's tourist police and the state delegate , and his deputy , for the federal attorney general 's office .
But despite the string of arrests the state governor , Feliz Gonzalez Canto , told Mexico 's El Universal newspaper that authorities had the resources and capability to fight organised crime in public institutions effectively .

It ’s hard to draw any other conclusion from Michael Moss ’s New York Times blockbuster investigative piece on E. coli in industrial beef , which is centered on the plight of Stephanie Smith , a young dance instructor left comatose , near death and now paralyzed from eating a single Cargill hamburger .
Of course , a “ single hamburger ” can include meat from hundreds , some would say thousands , of animals .
As Moss puts it :
Ground beef is usually not simply a chunk of meat run through a grinder .
Instead , records and interviews show , a single portion of hamburger meat is often an amalgam of various grades of meat from different parts of cows and even from different slaughterhouses .
These cuts of meat are particularly vulnerable to E. coli contamination , food experts and officials say .
Despite this , there is no federal requirement for grinders to test their ingredients for the pathogen .
This is why a food safety expert who helped develop tracking systems for E. coli in meat can declare that , “ Ground beef is not a completely safe product . ”
No kidding .
The problem , however , is not with E. coli in general .
The problem is that the particular strain of E. coli which infected Smith — known as E. coli O157:H7 — is virulent , deadly , persistent and endemic in industrial beef .
How virulent , deadly and persistent ?
This much :
Food scientists have registered increasing concern about the virulence of this pathogen since only a few stray cells can make someone sick , and they warn that federal guidance to cook meat thoroughly and to wash up afterward is not sufficient .
A test by The Times found that the safe handling instructions are not enough to prevent the bacteria from spreading in the kitchen .
In other words , if a piece of infected meat ends up in your kitchen , you are almost guaranteed exposure to it no matter how carefully you handle it .
And how endemic ?
This year alone almost half a million pounds of E. coli infected ground beef have been recalled nationwide ( and that does n’t include the 800,000 pounds of Cargill beef recalled for contamination with antibiotic - resistant salmonella ) .
Indeed , if Moss ’s work proves anything , it ’s that the safety systems in industrial beef processing are both barely functioning and almost fully opaque .
And while the government is able to peek behind the curtain at these massive slaughterhouses and processing facilities , it seems far more concerned with protecting companies ’ intellectual property than with the public health :
The meat industry treats much of its practices and the ingredients in ground beef as trade secrets .
While the Department of Agriculture has inspectors posted in plants and has access to production records , it also guards those secrets .
Federal records released by the department through the Freedom of Information Act blacked out details of Cargill ’s grinding operation that could be learned only through copies of the documents obtained from other sources .
Those documents illustrate the restrained approach to enforcement by a department whose missions include ensuring meat safety and promoting agriculture markets .
In one of the most chilling , and I thought devastating , quotes in the entire piece , a top official at the USDA ’s Food Safety and Inspection Service observed that his options were somewhat limited since he had to “ look at the entire industry , not just what is best for public health . ”
Note the fact that his phrasing sets the meat industry ’s needs at odds with ours — the two ca n’t be reconciled in his eyes .
What does that say about the government ’s ability to ensure a safe food supply ?
No matter how you structure it , the industry now appears too big and too powerful to be regulated .
What other explanation is there for the fact that the top food safety job at the USDA remains unfilled if not regulatory paralysis — the meat industry seems to have veto power over its regulators and has n’t found a federal overseer to its liking .
One area that Moss does not cover is how E. coli O157 got into industrial beef in the first place .
In fact it ’s there because of the meat industry ’s insistence on feeding cows corn — something they cannot easily digest — instead of grass .
Among other things , corn feeding requires cows to be fed a steady dose of antibiotics , which has led to the rise of antibiotic resistance among various pathogens .
But more importantly , it has caused very real changes in the cow ’s gut which has allowed this toxic strain of E. coli to take hold , a strain that research suggests cannot survive in the gut of cows that eat only grass .
In short , E. coli did n’t just “ happen ” to the meat industry — it ’s a consequence of industrial practices .
But nowhere in the article ( or in the halls of the USDA or the largescale beef producers for that matter ) is the possibility of moving away from this corn- based system raised as a solution for the industrial system .
Surprisingly , the article includes virtually no proposed solutions for this crisis — just vague assurances that the USDA is n’t “ standing still ” on the issue .
In reality , the industry focuses exclusively on “ managing ” the ongoing presence of E. coli O157 though the development of an E. coli vaccine for cows , and irradiation or chemical washes for the meat .
All of which are attempts to mask the risks of a failed system and represent an institutionalizing of the underlying failures .
And none of which make me ever want to touch industrial meat again .
Indeed , if there ever was a powerful argument for eating only grass - fed beef from small producers , this article is it .
The only conclusion worth drawing from this expose is that industrial ground beef simply is n’t worth the risk .
And without wholesale industry and regulatory reform — neither of which appears likely or even possible , it may never be .
Greg Sargent :
I ’m told by a CNN source that the network privately pressed cable operators not to run the Media Matters ad attacking Dobbs , which pilloried his footsie with the birthers as CNN ’s " Lou Dobbs problem . "
Media Matters had previously booked a week ’s worth of ad time on MSNBC , Fox , and CNN — during Dobbs ’ show .
The killings appeared to be linked to an electoral challenge to the Ampatuan clan by the Mangudadatu family .
Esmael Mangudadatu , the deputy mayor of the small town of Buluan , is planning to run for governor of Maguindanao next year , a position that Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr. is believed to have promised his son .
The victims were abducted while on their way to file paperwork to register Mr. Mangudadatu as a candidate .
The bodies recovered so far included members of the Mangudadatu clan , which controls a province just to the south of Maguindanao ; at least 18 journalists ; and several women who went along in the belief that the militias , following custom , would not hurt them .
Image Police officers stood guard on Wednesday as the bodies of massacre victims were dug up in Maguindanao Province .

As the scope of the massacre became clear , the Arroyo administration promised a swift investigation .
The president “ is enraged by these barbaric acts , ” said a spokesman , Cerge M. Remonde .
“ She has literally thrown the full force of the law and has mobilized the security and police forces of the state to go after the perpetrators . ”
Mrs. Arroyo also declared a state of emergency in Maguindanao and an adjoining province this week .
Mrs. Arroyo came under intense pressure to go after the Ampatuans , with her opponents accusing her of treating her allies with too much leniency .
Her political party expelled Mr. Ampatuan , his father and his brother Zaldy , the governor of an autonomous Muslim region , on Wednesday .
“ This is unprecedented and historic , ” said Kim Bagundang , a Maguindanao resident and the president of the nonprofit Liguasan Youth Association for Sustainable Development , noting that the people of Shariff Aguak had never witnessed a member of the clan seemingly vanquished .
“ This province and this town ”  which is run by a cousin of Mr. Ampatuan  “ is their kingdom .
They rule absolutely . ”
Critics have attributed the massacre to the power of the Ampatuan dynasty in this troubled province .
Until this week , Andal Ampatuan Sr. , the governor , maintained a private militia of more than 200 men , military officials have said .
He treated the province as his own domain , they say , carving out new towns and letting his sons run them .
One such town is Datu Unsay , which he created .
His son , who is known commonly as Datu Unsay , became mayor , and the town was named for him .
The army announced on Wednesday that it would disband the 200 - member militia , and it deployed 500 extra troops from the central Philippines to Maguindanao , which is part of the long - troubled region of Mindanao .
Launchpad entry : software - library
Created : 2005-08-29 by MatthewPaulThomas
Ubuntu Software Center is a utility for installing , purchasing , and removing software in Ubuntu , a major part of Ubuntu ’s overall software handling .
This design specification describes , for designers , developers , testers , and potential contributors , how USC is supposed to work .
The project is open source .
Rationale
Early versions of Ubuntu shipped many graphical utilities for installing and removing software : Add / Remove Applications , Synaptic Package Manager , Update Manager , Software Sources , apturl , GDebi , and Computer Janitor .
This redundancy increased the amount of interface people had to learn , wasted space on the Ubuntu CD , fragmented development effort , and made people more likely to think that unsanctioned software installation methods were safe .
Ubuntu Software Center replaces Add / Remove Applications , Synaptic , apturl , and GDebi , and acts as one of the main entry points to Software & Updates Settings .
Beyond providing a central point for installing and removing software , USC played a small but important part in encouraging application development on Ubuntu , by providing application developers with a prominent way to offer their software for installation .
Branding
The program itself , as well as application launchers , help pages , and marketing materials , should consistently follow these guidelines :
✔ Ubuntu Software Center ✘ the Ubuntu Software Center ✘ Software Center ✘ the Software Center
For example , you might say “ Jazz Writer , the hit note - taking app , has just arrived in Ubuntu Software Center . ”
The name should be localized , for example as “ Centre ” in Commonwealth countries .
It is not necessary to translate it word - for - word , but translations should ( a ) include the word “ Ubuntu ” ( to reduce confusion with Debian Software Center etc ) , and ( b ) should not use a word that means “ applications ” in particular ( because it also allows installation of non-application software such as add - ons , fonts , and themes ) .
The package name and executable name should both be software - center .
The application Comment should be “ Lets you choose from thousands of applications available for Ubuntu ” ( without a period ) , and the summary in the About window should be “ Lets you choose from thousands of applications available for Ubuntu . ” ( with a period ) .
The package Summary should be “ Utility for browsing , installing , and removing applications ” ( without a period ) .
The package Description should be :
Ubuntu Software
Center lets you browse and install thousands of free and paid applications and other software available for Ubuntu .
You can view available software by category , or search quickly by name or description .
You can also examine the software already installed , and remove items you no longer need .
To install , purchase , or remove software using USC , you need administrator access on the computer .
The application icon should be of an attractive shopping bag with handles , such as you might get from a high - class department store .
softwarestore.svg Versions 1~4 Version 5 +
Launching
If USC is launched by any means when it is already open , the existing instance should be focused .
Otherwise , the main window should open within five seconds on benchmark hardware , even if most of the UI is not ready yet , so that all controls need to be disabled .
→ → →
If USC is n’t ready after two seconds , a USC icon should appear centered in the window .
If , after two more seconds , the system has not finished generating an up - to - date package database in your current UI language , a progress bar should appear below the icon , showing the database generation ( bug 434601 ) .
If after two more seconds it still has n’t finished , progress text should begin appearing below the progress bar : “ Updating package database … ” followed by the latest package name .
Directly
In Unity , Ubuntu Software Center should be a default item in the launcher .
In the standard gnome - panel “ Menu Bar ” applet , “ Ubuntu Software Center ” should be the last item in the “ Applications ” menu , with a separator immediately before it .
In the gnome - panel “ Main Menu ” applet , “ Ubuntu Software Center ” should similarly be after the list of application categories , with separators immediately before and after it .
When opened directly , USC should by default display the home screen of the “ All Software ” section , scrolled to the top .
The search field should be empty .
Default focus should be on the search field ( so that you can start searching immediately , or use Down followed by other arrow keys to navigate the items in the home screen ) .
From an apt : link
Opening an apt : URL should launch Ubuntu Software Center directly to the appropriate screen ; or if it is already open , focus it , wait until any currently - open alerts or dialogs have been dismissed , and then switch to the appropriate screen .
What that “ appropriate screen ” is depends on the URL and whether the package is known to exist .
If the URL is of the form “ apt : package - name ” :
If the package is known , the software item screen for the package .
Test case : ( sc-001 )
Follow the link apt : python - wxtools .
It should show the item screen for “ All Software ” > “ System ” > “ python - wxtools ” .
If the package is not known , an ephemeral error screen in the “ All Software ” section .
It should be possible to return to this screen later in the navigation history , but it should not be possible to navigate to it directly .
Test case : ( sc-009 )
Follow the link apt :abcdefghijklmnop .
If the URL is of the form “ apt:package-name?minver=1.0 ” :
If the package is not known , the same kind of ephemeral error screen as used for apt : unknown - package - name .
If the package is known , the software item screen for the package .
If a version late enough is not available , this screen should include an extra ribbon , between the summary and the installation state bar : “ Sorry , version {minver} is n’t available in your current software sources . ” .
If the URL is of the form “ apt : package1 , package2 , … ” : A custom package list for the package names ( including displaying the comma- separated names in the search field ) .
If the URL is of the form “ apt:package-name?section=multiverse ” :
If the section is not currently enabled , a placeholder for the package screen , inviting you to enable the section .
It should use the package name as its heading , the text ‘ This software is available from the “ {source} ” source , which you are not currently using .’ , and a button “ Use This Source ” .
Activating the button should add the source , and the software item screen should automatically expand to its normal format .
Erratum :
The text currently implemented is shorter and better .
If the section is enabled but the package is not present in it , the same ephemeral error screen as used for apt : unknown - package - name .
Otherwise , the software item screen for the package .
If the URL is of the form “ apt:package-name?channel=lucid-partner ” : Exactly the same appearance and behavior as for apt : package - name ? section=multiverse , but enabling a whitelisted repository as listed in /usr / share / app - install / channels / , rather than a section .
When this feature is fully implemented , the software - center package should be marked as Provides : apturl and Replaces : apturl .
from a standalone .deb package
While installing Skype , I was informed that a “ later version is available in a software channel .
You are strongly advised to install the version from the software channel , since it is usually better supported . ”
I 'm pretty sure that could have been translated to , “ Click ‘ Next ’ to install a newer version of Skype . ”
— Farhad Manjoo , “ Get a blazing - fast computer for free ” , Slate
Opening a .deb package should launch Ubuntu Software Center ( or focus it , wait until any dialogs are dismissed , and then navigate ) to a temporary software item screen for the package .
In the navigation bar , the screen should be located in an “ Other ” source , following “ All Software ” or “ Installed ” depending on whether this package version is already installed .
This software item screen should differ from the standard one :
Its visual design should hint that this is a little less safe than installing a package from a repository .
The installation state bar should say “ Standalone software package ” , not “ Free ” .
( For all USC knows , you might have had to pay to download the package in the first place . )
If one of your repositories contains a package with the same name but a higher version number , there should be an extra bar below the installation state bar , with text of the form ‘ Ubuntu has a newer version . ’ ( without quotes ) or ‘ “ Other Repository Label ” has a newer version . ’ ( with quotes ) .
Activating the adjacent “ Newer Version ” button should navigate to the software item screen for the newer version .
The software - center package should be marked as Provides : gdebi and Replaces : gdebi .
from the command line
software - center should launch USC to its default view .
software - center package - name should open USC to display that package .
If the package is unknown , it should display the same unknown - package screen as apturl uses .
Main window
The main window should be a normal , resizable window containing a navigation bar and a main pane .
Initially , the window should be centered on the main display , but its size and position should persist between sessions .
The navigation bar should contain :
Back and Forward buttons .
Tab - like buttons for navigating between sections .
Exactly one should be selected at any time : Available software , defaulting to “ All Software ” , with a menubutton for all available software sources .
The individual available software source you are currently looking at , if any .
( Before this item appears , all those on the trailing side should slide out to make room , and after it disappears they should slide back . )
Installed software , defaulting to “ All Installed ” ( appearing as “ Installed ” in the navigation bar ) , with a menubutton for all installed software sources .
The individual installed software source you are currently looking at , if any .
( Before this item appears , all those on the trailing side should slide out to make room , and after it disappears they should slide back . )
“ History ” ( “ Popular ” , “ Updates ” , and / or “ Account ” sections may be added later . )
“ Progress ” , present only occasionally .
The search field , visible for any searchable screen .
Test case : ( sc-002 ) Launch USC .
From the “ All Software ” menu , choose “ Canonical Partners ” .
All following items in the navigation bar should slide to the right , making room for a “ Canonical Partners ” item , highlighted , between “ All Software ” and “ Installed ” .
Next , from the “ Installed ” menu choose “ For Purchase ” .
The “ Canonical Partners ” item should disappear , and the “ Installed ” item should slide to the left , making room for a “ For Purchase ” item , highlighted , between “ Installed ” and “ History ” .
Click Back ; the “ For Purchase ” item should disappear from the navigation bar , and the “ Canonical Partners ” item should reappear , highlighted once more .
Navigation
Navigation in general
Whenever USC navigates to a screen , whether directly ( with mouse or keyboard ) or indirectly ( e.g. when it first launches ) , it should :
immediately reveal ( if necessary ) and highlight the appropriate item in the navigation bar , if it has changed ; begin displaying the corresponding screen in the main pane ; if the corresponding screen has not displayed within 2 seconds , display a blank screen with a horizontally and vertically centered spinner , until the screen is available .
Unless the screen was navigated to by Back / Forward or by editing the search field , the screen should be focused as a whole ( fixing bug 832265 ) .
From this initial focus , pressing Down or Tab should focus the first item in the screen , and pressing Shift + Tab should focus the sort menu if present .
Test case : ( sc-003 )
On a slow computer , choose “ System ” ; the spinner screen should appear until the full list is available .
Press Down ; the first item in the category should be selected .
Press Shift + Tab ; the sort menu should be selected .
Section navigation
The section navigation commands — “ All Software ” , “ Installed ” , and so on — should always navigate to the top level of that section , with no search text or scroll position .
( The alternative would have been to remember your exact position in each section , as in previous versions of USC , but that made it harder to understand how to navigate up to the top level in each .
Instead , we rely on Back and Forward navigation to preserve state . )
Test case : ( sc-006 )
In the “ All Software ” section , navigate to Abi Word .
In the navigation bar click on “ Installed ” , then on “ All Software ” .
USC should return to the home screen .
Back / Forward navigation
The navigation history ( not to be confused with USC ’s “ History ” section ) is a browser - like history of which screens USC has navigated to , either directly ( for example , by clicking a link or using the navigation bar ) or indirectly ( for example , by following an apt : link ) , since it opened .
Unlike previous versions of USC , it should include screens from any section .
The Back and Forward commands should navigate through this navigation history , as with a Web browser : navigating using the history should not add items to it , and navigating without using the history should discard all forward items from the history .
The Back command should be unavailable whenever no previous screens exist in the history , and the Forward command whenever no later screens exist in the history .
Test case : ( sc-007 ) Launch USC .
In both the navigation bar and the menus , the Back and Forward commands should be unavailable .
Choose “ History ” .
The Back command should become available .
Choose Back .
USC should return to the home screen , Forward should become available , and Back should no longer be .
Choose Forward .
USC should return to the History screen , Back should become available , and Forward should no longer be .
Each item in the history should remember its scroll position , whether items hidden by default were shown , what software item was selected ( if any ) , and what element was focused ( if any ) .
These attributes should persist if you return to the screen using Back / Forward navigation , but not if you navigate to the screen any other way .
If the search field was non-empty when you navigated to a separate screen , the search you had entered just before you navigated should be stored as its own history item .
Intermediate searches should not be in the history .
Whenever a screen in the navigation history does not currently exist ( for example , the “ Progress ” screen when no tasks are in progress , or the software item screen for an item that was uninstalled and does n’t exist in any software source ) , the Back and Forward commands should skip over that screen in the history — and the commands should be unavailable if all previous or later screens , respectively , consist of screens of that sort .
Test case : ( sc-008 ) Launch USC .
In Software & Updates Settings , add a new PPA .
In USC , choose “ All Software From Source ” > that PPA .
Back should become available .
Choose Back .
Back should become unavailable , and Forward should become available .
In Software & Updates Settings , remove the PPA .
Forward should no longer be available .
In Software & Updates Settings , re-add the same PPA .
Forward should become available once more .
Choose Forward .
USC should return to the screen for that PPA .
“ All Software ” section
The “ All Software ” section should present the union of {all software that is available , from any of the computer ’s current software sources , plus any software source represented by a X - AppInstall - Channel attribute in app - install - data } , and ( unlike previous versions of USC ) {all software that is installed , regardless of whether it is installed from any of the computer ’s current software sources} .
The section encompasses a home screen , as well as screens for top - level search results , individual categories , category search results , subcategories , subcategory search results , software sources and search results , and individual software items .
Whenever you are in the “ All Software ” section , the “ View ” > “ Software Maintained by Anyone ” and “ View ” > “ Software Maintained by Canonical ” items should be enabled .
Changing the selection should determine whether all software or just Canonical - updated software is are shown .
The selection should persist regardless of which screen in the “ All Software ” section is being displayed .
Whenever a software item is selected — whether searching from the home screen , in a category , in a subcategory , or implicitly because you are at a software item screen itself :
If it is an item that is not currently installed nor being installed , “ File ” > “ Install ” should be enabled .
Selecting it should install the selected item .
If it is an item that is currently installed and not currently being removed , “ File ” > “ Remove ” should be enabled .
Selecting it should remove the selected item .
Home screen
Erratum : “ Most Popular ” should be “ What ’s Popular ” .
The home screen should be a searchable screen containing as many of these elements as have been implemented so far :
Arrow keys should change focus between the selectable items in the home screen .
The “ Categories ” section of the home screen should list ( without icons ) alphabetically all categories , as defined and sorted under “ Genre ” , which contain any items matching the current repositories and view options .
Exhibit banners
An exhibit is either a single item , or a collection of items on a theme , that is temporarily promoted at the top of the home screen .
Exhibits are stored and transmitted as mini-HTML documents from the USC server .
Whenever the server provides exhibits for your Ubuntu version , and any of those exhibits are for — or are collections that contain any — items available with your current filters , the banner area on the home screen should show a carousel of those particular exhibits .
When there are multiple applicable exhibits , the current one should fade into the next one after ten seconds .
The carousel should pause whenever the window is not focused .
In any other case ( for example , if there is no Internet connection , or there are no exhibits for the Ubuntu version you ’re running ) , the banner area should show a fallback banner ( included in the USC code ) that links to the canned list of Featured applications .
Activating the banner for a single - item exhibit should navigate to the software item screen for that item .
Activating the banner for a multi-item exhibit should navigate to a list view , with the appropriate heading , showing whichever items match your current filters .
Future work : Switch from a list view to a tile view .
“ What ’s New ”
On the home screen , the “ What ’s New ” area should use tiles to list , newest first , the applications that appeared most recently in any of your software channels , excluding items that you have already installed .
( For this purpose , an “ application ” is any package containing a . desktop file . )
The number of applications should be as many as fills the height of the “ Categories ” area next to it ( or , if “ Recommended For You ” has been implemented , half the height ) .
Choosing “ More ” in the home screen area should navigate to a separate “ What ’s New ” screen that uses a software tile view to list , newest first , the 60 applications that appeared most recently in any of your software sources , regardless of whether they are installed ( bug 1009967 ) .
“ Top Rated ” overall
An item ’s dampened rating ( DR ) should be 3 plus the sum , for each possible number of stars ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) , of ( that number of stars – 3 ) multiplied by the lower bound of the Wilson score confidence interval with a 90 % confidence level for the proportion of ratings that had that number of stars .
For example :
★☆☆☆☆ ★★☆☆☆ ★★★☆☆ ★★★★☆ ★★★★ ★
DR 0 0 0 0 0 3.0 16 0 0 0 0 1.19 8 0 0 0 0 1.34 4 0 0 0 0 1.58 2 0 0 0 0 1.90 1 0 0 0 0 2.24 0 1 0 0 0 2.62 0 0 1 0 0 3.00 0 0 0 1 0 3.38 0 0 0 0 1 3.76 0 0 0 0 2 4.10 0 0 0 0 4 4.42 0 0 0 0 8 4.66 0 0 0 0 16 4.81
Sorting items by “ Top Rated ” should sort them by their DR , so that ( for example ) an item with ten reviews , nine 5 - star and one 4 - star , is appropriately ranked higher than an item that has only two reviews , both 5 - star .
On the home screen , the “ Top Rated ” area should use tiles to list , in descending order of DR , the items with the highest DR ( out of all items that USC is configured to display ) , regardless of whether they are installed ( bug 1009967 ) .
The number of items shown in this area depends on whether “ What ’s Popular ” has also been implemented : 24 if it has n’t , 12 if it has .
Choosing “ More ” in the “ Top Rated ” area should navigate to a separate “ Top Rated ” screen that uses a software tile view to list , in descending order of DR , the 60 items with the highest DR , regardless of whether they are installed .
( As usual , the number of stars shown for each item should represent the median rating , not the DR itself . )
Category screen
A category screen should be searchable .
It should always begin with a heading giving the name of the category , and end with centered text of the form “ 1234 items available ” ( this count should include items in any subcategories ) .
If the category is set to “ Show non-applications by default ” , it should use a software listing view .
Otherwise , it should use a software tile view , and non-application items should be hidden by default .
If it has any subcategories that contain any items matching the current repositories and view options , the screen should have buttons for each subcategory , a “ Top Rated ” area listing the 12 top rated items in that category , and ( once implemented ) a “ What ’s Popular ” area listing the 12 most installed items in that category that are not already in the “ Top Rated ” area .
( Using 12 items produces a filled last row whether there are 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 items per row . )
Erratum : “ Most Popular ” should be “ What ’s Popular ” .
Otherwise , if “ What ’s Popular ” has been implemented and the category contains more than 60 items , the screen should consist only of the “ Top Rated ” and “ What ’s Popular ” areas , each listing 12 items .
Erratum : “ Most Popular ” should be “ What ’s Popular ” .
Otherwise , if “ What ’s Popular ” has not yet been implemented or the category contains up to 60 items , the screen should consist of a software tile view listing every item in the category .
Opposite the heading should be an option menu for choosing the sort order , “ By Rating ” ( the default ) , “ By Name ” , or “ Newest First ” .
Whenever the screen contains a “ Top Rated ” area , that area should list , in descending order of dampened rating , the 12 items with the highest DR in that category .
Choosing “ More ” should navigate to a separate “ Top Rated in { Category Name} ” screen , listing , in descending order , the 60 items with the highest DR in that category .
Whenever the screen contains a “ What ’s Popular ” area , that area should list , in descending order , the 12 most popular items in that category , that are neither installed nor already shown in the “ Top Rated ” area .
( This avoids repetition , giving visibility to more items . )
Choosing “ More ” should navigate to a separate “ What ’s Popular in { Category Name} ” screen , listing , in descending order , the 60 most popular items in that category regardless of whether they are installed or in a “ Top Rated ” list .
If the category is not set to “ Show non-applications by default ” , non-application items should be hidden by default .
Subcategory screen
Like the category screen , a subcategory screen should be searchable .
It should always begin with a link to the parent category and a heading naming the subcategory , and end with centered text of the form “ 1234 items available ” .
If more than one sort order has been implemented , opposite the heading should be an option menu for sorting “ By Rating ” ( the default ) , “ By Popularity ” ( once implemented ) , “ By Name ” , or “ Newest First ” .
If the subcategory is set to “ Show non-applications by default ” , it should use a software listing view .
Otherwise , it should use a software tile view , and non-application items should be hidden by default .
Where to show the number of items in the subcategory ?
We ca n’t nicely show them at the bottom , because in a tile view the bottom will always be scrolling out of view .
“ Installed ” section
In the navigation bar , “ Installed ” should have an icon of a computer .
It may have an emblem indicating inconsistent package state .
The “ Installed ” screen should show all software items currently installed , regardless of whether they are available from any of the computer ’s current software sources .
The items should be grouped into the primary categories ( but not the subcategories ) to which they belong .
Categories for which no items are installed should not be shown .
A category should expand or collapse if you click anywhere in its row ; expand if you press Right when it is highlighted ; and collapse if you press Left when it is highlighted .
The expanded or collapsed state of every category should be remembered between sessions .
At the end of the list should be centered text of the form “ 1047 items installed ” .
Whenever you are in the “ Installed ” section , the “ View ” > “ All Software ” and “ View ” > “ Canonical - Updated Software ” items should be enabled .
Changing the selection should determine whether all software is shown , or just Canonical - updated software .
The selection should persist regardless of which screen is being displayed .
The “ Installed ” screen should be searchable .
Whenever the search field is non-empty , a software item should be visible only if it matches the search text .
A category should be visible only if either ( a ) it contains any matching software items , or ( b ) the category name itself matches the search text .
Searching should not cause a category to expand or collapse by itself .
Software items in the “ Installed ” screen should show their icon , title , and summary .
The icon should be indented so that it lines up with the start of the category name above .
Apart from that extra indentation , individual items in the “ Installed ” section should look and behave just as in any other software list view .
Software item screen
A software item screen should show information about an item , let you install or remove it or change any add - ons , and ( if you have currently or previously installed it ) rate and review it .
A software item screen is not searchable .
Whenever a software item screen is being displayed :
If it is installed or currently being removed , “ Installed ” should be highlighted in the navigation bar .
Otherwise , “ All Software ” should be highlighted .
Test case : ( sc - 012 )
Navigate to an item that is n’t installed ; “ All Software ” should be highlighted .
Install it ; once installation finishes , “ Installed ” should be highlighted .
Now remove it ; once removal finishes , “ All Software ” should be highlighted once more .
If it is an item that is neither currently installed nor being installed , “ File ” > “ Install ” should be enabled .
Selecting it should install the selected item .
If it is an item that is currently installed and not currently being removed , “ File ” > “ Remove ” should be enabled .
Selecting it should remove the selected item .
Whenever text is selected in the screen , the copy action ( “ Edit ” > “ Copy ” and Ctrl C ) should be enabled .
Choosing it should copy the selected text to the clipboard .
“ Edit ” > “ Copy Web Link ” should be enabled .
Choosing it should copy a Web link for the relevant package .
If the relevant package is not maintained by Canonical and you then choose “ View ” > “ Canonical - Updated Software ” , USC should automatically navigate up to the subcategory screen ; or , if the entire subcategory contains no Canonical - updated items , up to the category screen ; or , if the entire category contains no Canonical - updated items , up to the home screen ) .
Except where specified elsewhere , a software item screen should contain :
A link to its primary category .
A triangle ( ▶ ) and a link to its primary subcategory , if it has one .
Its icon , except that the installed emblem should not be shown for an installed application ( because it ’s shown in the installation state bar immediately below instead , which clarifies that the emblem is not part of the application icon itself ) .
On the trailing side , stars representing the item ’s average rating .
Its title , wrapping to multiple lines if necessary .
Its summary , wrapping to multiple lines if necessary .
An installation state bar :
If the item is not installed nor queued for installation , the price of the item ( e.g. “ Free ” ) at the leading end , and a button at the trailing end : “ Buy … ” if installation requires sign - in and payment , “ Install … ” if it requires sign - in only , or “ Install ” if it requires neither .
If the item is installed and not queued for removal , the installed emblem and the text “ Installed ” ( or , if known , “ Installed on {date} ” ) at the leading end ( except for Ubuntu Software Center itself , where it should say “ Installed ( you ’re using it right now ) ” ) , and a “ Remove ” button at the trailing end .
If the item is being installed or removed , or is queued for installation or removal ( but not if its add - ons are being changed ) , the status text for the installation at the leading end , and a progress bar at the trailing end .
Its description .
If the item is in app - install - data and refers to a package that is not present in the apt cache , the text “ To show information about this item , the software catalog needs updating . ” , and an “ Update Now ” button .
Choosing “ Update Now ” should update the screen to its usual format .
And if the item is not available for this architecture , instead of the description should appear the text “ Sorry , < Title > is not available for this type of computer ( < Architecture > ) . ” .
A “ Developer Web site ” link to the URL in the package ’s Homepage : field , if there is one .
The link should have a context menu containing “ Open Link ” and “ Copy Link Address ” items .
A “ Report a Problem ” link , if the vendor has registered a support URL .
If the item is or would be recommended for you , the reason or the hidden status .
A mini gallery of all available videos and / or screenshots of the item ( bug 1049988 ) , if there are any .
( If there are none , the description should extend to the space they would normally occupy ( bug 1056897 ) . )
To emphasize that it is a gallery ( bug 691594 ) , the gallery should include thumbnails of each item even if there is only one .
The currently displayed media , and each thumbnail , should each appear inside an inset border , with the border of the focused item highlighted .
The selected screenshot or video should take up to half the width of the window , and up to the full height of the window , while maintaining its aspect ratio ( bug 673214 ) .
If you activate a screenshot or video ( by clicking it , or pressing Space or Enter when it is focused ) , a small determinate progress meter should appear centered over it , showing download or buffering progress .
If it loads , the screenshot or video should then visibly zoom into a chromeless overlay window that is the height of the display , the width of the display , or the original size of the image , whichever results in the smallest scaled image ( bug 995129 ) .
Clicking or pressing any key should zoom the overlay back into the main display .
The add - ons section .
Text describing the “ Total size : ” of the item : if it is not downloaded or installed , “ { X} to download , { Y} when installed ” , where X is the download size including not - yet - installed dependencies , and Y is the installed size including not - yet - installed dependencies ;
if it is already downloaded but not installed , “ { Y} when installed ” ( bug 851222 ) ;
if it is installed , and you have not specified any changes to add - ons , “ { Y} on disk ”
if it is installed , and you have specified changes to add - ons , “ { X} to download , { Y} on disk ” .
Text of the form “ Version : { package name} {version number} ” .
Text of the form “ Last update : { full date} ” ( bug 680523 ) .
The label “ License : ” followed by its license text .
The label “ Downloaded from : ” followed by the appropriate text ( private bug 882831 ) .
The label “ Updates provided : ” followed by the appropriate text .
A “ People also installed ” area , if there are any relevant items .
The item ’s ratings and reviews .
Copy -editors Within USC , examine the title , summary , and description of an item .
Is it concise and helpful ?
Is the spelling , grammar , and paragraph formatting correct ?
If it ’s a non -geek application , does the description avoid geek language ?
Is it in the appropriate category ?
If you find a problem , and you are comfortable diving into code to fix it yourself , follow the distributed development instructions with the app - install - data - ubuntu package to fix problems in an application ’s title or summary , or the package itself to fix problems with its description .
Otherwise , report a bug with ( a ) the current text , ( b ) what needs improving , and ( c ) your proposed replacement text , and give the bug report the metadata tag .
Packagers
Please look for bugs that people have reported about inappropriate application names or summaries , or package descriptions or categories , and fix them .
Thanks for your help .
Packagers
If a single package contains multiple applications , and people might reasonably want to install these applications separately , work to separate the packages into one per application .
“ History ” section
The “ History ” section should display all installations , updates , removals ( including purges ) , and other changes , in reverse chronological order .
Below the navigation bar , a filter bar should have items for “ All Changes ” , “ All Installations ” ( including purchases ) , “ Purchases ” , and “ Removals ” ( including purges ) ( bug 990998 ) .
( It does not need an item for “ Updates ” , because the use case for seeing those — debugging a problem — involves seeing all other package changes too . )
History entries should be grouped in branches labelled by day .
Clicking anywhere on a branch — or pressing Space when it is selected — should expand it if it is collapsed , and collapse it if it is expanded .
When a branch is selected , pressing Right should also expand it , and Left collapse it .
For the day on which the most recent events happened , that branch should be expanded by default from the start of every USC session .
The “ History ” screen should be searchable .
Whenever the search field is non-empty , a history entry should be shown only if it matches the search text , and a date branch should be shown only if it contains any items matching the search text .
Searching should not cause a date branch to expand or collapse by itself .
Each history entry should consist of an icon , text , a time , and a price .
The icon should be that of the relevant software item .
The text should be of the form : “ { short name} installed ” “ { short name} removed ” “ { short name} purged ” “ { short name} updated from version {version} to {version} ” “ { short name} downgraded from version {version} to {version} ”
The time should be of the form “ 4:08 PM ” .
The price should be of the form “ $ 4.99 ” if it was a purchase , or “ — ” otherwise .
“ Progress ” section
The “ Progress ” section should be visible only when items are being installed or removed , or when the last installation or removal finished less than five seconds ago .
If the section disappears while being displayed , USC should return to the section that was previously being displayed .
In the navigation bar , the section should have an animated icon of two semicircular arrows chasing each other clockwise .
The icon should be overlaid with an emblem showing the number of tasks yet to be completed .
The section itself should list the items requested for installation or removal , earliest first .
The rows in the list should be based on a software item list view , with these differences :
the second row of text is the task status text , rather than the package summary or package name ;
each row has a ( text - less ) progress bar representing the task progress proportion ;
each row representing an installation has a cancel button ( which can be triggered by the Esc key when the row is selected ) , while each row representing a removal has a gap the same size as a cancel button ( so that its progress bar lines up with the progress bars of installation rows ) .
The cancel button for an individual item should be present only when the item has not yet started or is still downloading .

Software item tiles
Errata :
The installed emblem should be at the bottom left of the icon , not the bottom right .
“ Games — Puzzles ” should be “ Puzzles ” .
Tiles are used to present software items on the home screen , category screens , subcategory screens , search results , and other listings .
Tiles have a minimum width .
In an area that is to be filled with tiles , the number of tiles on each row should be based on the minimum width , with each tile stretching equally to fill any remaining width .
A normal software item tile contains the item’s :
Icon .
If the icon is scalable , or larger than 4 em in either dimension , it should be scaled down proportionally so that it is 4 em in its largest dimension .
To subtly encourage developers to produce large / scalable icons , if the icon is already smaller than 4 em in both dimensions , it should be drawn at actual size and centered ( both horizontally and vertically ) inside a 4 em square that has a 0.05 - em - wide border of color 170,170,170 ( #aaaaaa ) .
Title , ellipsized in the middle if necessary to fit on one line .
Average rating ( omitted entirely if there are not enough ratings ) .
Subcategory name if it has one , otherwise its Category name , either ellipsized at the trailing end if necessary to fit on one line .
Price ( or “ FREE ” if the price is zero ) .
A category - specific software item tile is identical except that it omits the category name ( because it would be identical for every item ) .
And a subcategory - specific software item tile omits the category and subcategory names .
If the package is not available for this computer ’s architecture , the whole tile should have 50 % opacity , but should still be clickable .
The whole tile should have a pointing - hand pointer when moused over , and should be a darker shade whenever it is being clicked ( bug 1017454 ) .
Single - clicking should navigate to that item .
Software tile view
A software tile view is used to present software items on various screens .
It includes a heading , followed by a grid of software item tiles .
Where there is no limit on the number of items shown , initially only 60 items should be loaded and shown initially ( 60 because that will produce a decent batch of complete rows whether there are 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 tiles per row ) .
If there are more items , the bottom of the view should have enough space for a spinner .
When you scroll to the bottom of the view , the spinner should appear until the next 60 items load and replace it .
Software list view
A software list view is used for the “ History ” and “ Progress ” sections .
A variation of the list view is used in the “ Installed ” section .
In future it may also be used in “ All Software ” for technical categories and subcategories ( instead of the usual tile view ) , and for search results in those categories and subcategories .
In a list view , each software item should have a row displaying the item ’s icon , title , and summary .
The row ’s accessible name should be the item ’s title , and its accessible description should be the item ’s summary .
If either row of text is wider than the space available , it should be ellipsized at the trailing end .
In “ All Software ” and “ Installed ” , the titles of items with ratings should be followed by stars for the average rating , and the number of ratings in brackets .
If the width of those three things is greater than the width of the list , the stars and number should together be flush at the trailing end of the row , while the title is ellipsized at its end .
( Previously the stars were always flush at the trailing end , making it difficult to see which rating belonged to which item .
Moving them next to the title means stars are not aligned for different rows , but that matters little , because the ratings will much more often be used for sorting than for direct comparison . )
⇄
In the “ All Software ” , “ Installed ” , and “ History ” sections , when ( and only when ) an item is selected , the row should expand to reveal buttons : “ More Info ” and “ Remove ” for an item that is installed , queued for removal , or being removed , and “ More Info ” and “ Install ” etc for an item in any other state .
The “ More Info ” button should have Enter as its access key .
Activating it should navigate to the software item screen .
The “ Install ” button should be disabled if the item is currently installing or queued for installation .
Similarly , the “ Remove ” button should be disabled if the item is currently being removed or queued for removal , or if its add - ons are being changed or queued for change .
Neither button should have an access key ( because that would interfere with typing letters to navigate the list ) .
The “ More Info ” in the row should , if it is enabled , be focused by default ( otherwise no button should be focused ) ; pressing Tab should cycle through any remaining buttons before leaving the list ( bug 634952 ) ) .
Test case : ( usc -005 ) Navigate to “ All Software ” > “ Universal Access ” .
Select “ Indic Onscreen Keyboard ” .
Press Ctrl F ; the search field should be focused .
Press Tab ; the ttf - alee row and its “ More Info ” button should be focused .
Press Tab again ; the “ Install ” button should be focused .
When an item is being installed , being removed , having its add - ons changed , or queued for any of those tasks , the trailing end of the row should have a progress bar showing progress of the task .
If the item is being installed or is having its add - ons changed , it should also have an icon - only cancel button .
During this time the secondary text for the row should be the status text for the task , instead of the item ’s summary .
If the item is not installable for this computer ’s architecture , the icon and the text — but not any buttons when the row is expanded — should have 50 % opacity , but the item should still be selectable .
By default , none of the rows in a software list view should be selected .
If the view allows selection , clicking anywhere in an row should select that item , and Ctrl+clicking on a selected item should deselect it .
If no item is selected , pressing the Down arrow key should select the first row , and conversely pressing the Up arrow key should select the last row .
If the view does not allow selection , the arrow keys should scroll the view without highlighting rows .
Whenever an item is selected in a software list view , “ Edit ” > “ Copy Web Link ” should be enabled .
Choosing it should copy a Web link for the relevant package .
Unless otherwise specified , a software list view should always have a vertical scrollbar .
( This prevents elements at the trailing end from jumping about when the view contents switches between shorter than , and longer than , the container ’s height ) .
A software list view should never have a horizontal scrollbar .
If a software list view has items hidden by default , the bottom of the pane containing the view should have a panel ( below the bottom of the scrollbar ) containing a hyperlink of the form “ Show 17 technical items ” .
Following the link should display the items that were hidden by default , and make the link change to the form “ Hide 17 technical items ” .
Except in Back / Forward navigation , revisiting the software list view should not persist in showing items ; it should resume hiding them by default .
Software sources
In most cases , the collection of software that USC presents should consist of the aggregate of available software items from all enabled software sources , plus any software currently installed that has no known source .
When it is appropriate to present individual software sources separately , they should be presented as follows ( and in this order ) :
Source Icon Label “ Downloaded from ” text “ Updates provided ” text Main and Restricted for the current Ubuntu version the Ubuntu logo “ Provided by Ubuntu ” “ Ubuntu ” “ by Canonical until June 2027 ” , or “ none ( Canonical updates ended June 2011 ) ” Universe and Multiverse for the current Ubuntu version “ Ubuntu ” “ by the Ubuntu development community ” The Canonical partner repository for the current Ubuntu version the Canonical logo “ Canonical Partners ” “ Canonical ” “ by the vendor ” Any other sources represented by an X - AppInstall - Channel attribute in app - install - data , sorted alphabetically a generic repository icon the contents of the Label : field from their Release file domain name of the repository “ unknown ” Purchasable items money “ For Purchase ” “ Canonical ” “ by the vendor ” the Independent repository for the current Ubuntu version a cluster of people “ Independent ” “ Canonical ” “ by the developer ” Any PPAs ( not including those for purchased items ) , sorted alphabetically
The same PPA icon that Launchpad uses the contents of the Label : field from their Release file , once retrieved from Launchpad — until then , the same naming scheme as any other non-CD source “ Launchpad ” “ by the developer ”
Any other network sources , sorted alphabetically a generic repository icon its URI with the protocol stripped , e.g. “ packages.example.org/ubuntu / ” ( we do n’t use the Label : here because we do n’t trust third - party repositories as much as we trust PPAs ) domain name of the repository “ unknown ”
Any volumes ( such as CDs , DVDs , or USB sticks ) containing packages , sorted alphabetically the same icon as it has in the file manager
If a volume contains a /.disk / info file , “ {OS version} ” , where the OS version is the contents of /.disk / info up to but not including the first " character nor any spaces immediately preceding it .
Otherwise , the same label as is used in the file manager . “ — ” “ none ” Packages without an associated source a question mark in a disc “ Other ” “ unknown ” “ none ”
The available software sources should consist of this full list , except for “ Other ” .
The installed software sources should consist of all those items in this list from which you have installed any software .
Test case : ( sc-013 )
Launch USC .
Add a PPA in Software & Updates Settings .
Open the “ All Software ” menu ; the PPA should be shown in the menu .
Open the “ Installed Software ” menu ; the PPA should not be shown in the menu .
Install a package from that PPA .
When it finishes installing , open the “ Installed Software ” menu again ; the PPA should now be present .
Select that menu item , and remove the package ; when it finishes uninstalling , the PPA should disappear from the “ Installed ” menu , and USC should automatically navigate to the main “ Installed ” screen .
Select the PPA from the “ All Software ” , then remove the PPA from Software & Updates Settings .
The PPA should disappear from the “ All Software ” menu , and USC should automatically navigate to the home screen .
Test case : ( sc -014 )
Download and install a standalone .deb package , such as Opera .
Open the “ Installed Software ” menu ; it should have an “ Other ” child item that , if selected , shows the item you installed .
Open the “ All Software ” menu ; it should have an identical “ Other ” child item .
Uninstall the package ; the “ Other ” item should disappear from both menus , if that was the only standalone item installed .
Software list view for individual software sources
When any individual software source inside “ All Software ” is selected , the main pane should show a software list view of all the packages that source contains , with status text of the form “ 17 items available ” .
When any individual software source inside “ Installed ” is selected , the main pane should show a software list view listing all the packages currently installed ( or in the process of being removed ) from that source , with status text of the form “ 3 items installed ” .
For all sources except “ Provided by Ubuntu ” , the items in the “ View ” menu should be disabled , because they do not apply .
Determining information about software items
Most information about a package — its title , short name , summary , and license info — should come from Aptdaemon .
These are the exceptions :
Icon and genre
The icon should be the usual icon for the package , except that unless otherwise specified , a package that is currently installed should have its icon overlaid in the bottom left corner with the installed checkmark emblem .
The summary should be the application Comment , if there is one ; otherwise the package synopsis with its first word capitalized , if the application has a Name but not a Comment ; otherwise the package name ( because if you ’re looking at a non-application package in the first place , you ’re fairly likely to be the sort of user who wants to know the package name ) .
The license label for an item should be :
“ Open source ” , if it is in Main or Universe ;
“ Proprietary ” , if it is in Restricted or archive.canonical.com ;
“ Unknown ” , if it is anywhere else ( including Multiverse and standalone packages ) .
If you want this to be more specific ( bug 435183 ) , do what you can to get DEP - 5 implemented .
When it is implemented in USC , the words “ Open source ” ( or their localized equivalent ) should be included in the string for each license , rather than in a separate string ( bug 811489 ) .
Finally , every item has a genre represented by a primary category , and sometimes also by a primary subcategory and / or a secondary category .
If an item has a secondary category , it may also have a secondary subcategory .
Each category , and each subcategory , should have its own icon .
As used elsewhere in this specification , an item ’s category means its primary category , and its subcategory means its primary subcategory .
These are the categories and subcategories , in the order in which they should be presented when presented together :
Category Equivalent menu spec categories Equivalent sections Package name pattern

Librarians
If debtags had become available , we would have refined this classification scheme .
For example , what subcategories could the “ Games ” category have ?
And how could the items in the “ Internet ” menu be redistributed ?
Ideas were invited on the Classification page .
The algorithm for determining an item ’s primary category and subcategory should be :
If it has a . desktop file with at least one Category : value that matches one of the subcategories listed above , then : Use the first recognizable Category : value to determine the subcategory from the table .
Determine the category from the subcategory ’s location in the table .
Stop .
If it has a Section : that matches one of the subcategories listed above , then : Use the Section : value to determine the subcategory from the table .
Determine the category from the subcategory ’s location in the table .
Stop .
If it has a . desktop file with at least one Category : value that matches one of the categories listed above , then : Use the first recognizable Category : value as the category .
Stop .
If it has a Section : that matches one of the categories listed above , then : Use the Section : value to determine the category from the table .
Stop .
Use “ System ” as the primary category , with no primary subcategory .
The algorithm for determining an item ’s secondary category and subcategory should be :
If the .desktop file has at least one X - Ubuntu - Category - Secondary : field that matches one of the known categories , then : Use the first X - Ubuntu - Category - Secondary : value as the subcategory .
Determine the category from the subcategory ’s location in the table above .
Stop .
The item has no secondary category or subcategory .
Test case :
We should have a test repository containing packages with various combinations of Category : and / or X - Ubuntu - Category - Secondary : .
Hardware requirements
If a package has one or more of the following requires - hardware : : debtags , then in the software item screen , the “ Total size : ” row should be followed by an “ Also requires : ” row listing the requirements in human - readable form .
( A translator note should explain that the “ Also ” refers to the preceding “ Total size ” requirement . )
The requirements should be comma-separated , each preceded by a text - colored checkmark if it detectably meets that requirement , an error - colored cross if it detectably fails , or nothing if the requirement is ( currently ) untestable .
In addition , whenever the computer detectably does not meet the requirements , immediately above the installation state bar should be an extra bar containing a warning specific to the unmet requirements , with a icon aligned with the button below .
And if the software is not currently installed , that “ Install ” or “ Buy … ” button should read “ Install Anyway ” or “ Buy Anyway … ” instead .
( These requires - hardware : : tags are largely parallel to Debian ’s existing hardware : : tag hierarchy , with some improvements . )

Multiple unmet requirements
This software has multiple requirements missing from this computer .
Searching
Whenever the current screen is searchable , the navigation bar should contain a search field ( with accessible label “ Search ” ) , and the “ Edit ” > “ Search … ” command should be enabled .
Activating that command should focus the search field , and ( even if it is focused already ) select its entire contents .
The search field
Whenever the search field is focused , the “ Edit ” > “ Undo ” , “ Redo ” , “ Cut ” , “ Copy ” , “ Paste ” , “ Delete ” , and “ Select All ” items should have their usual enabled / disabled state and operation for a text field .
Inside the leading end of the field should be a symbolic magnifying glass icon .
Clicking the icon should focus the field and select its entire contents .
When ( and only when ) the search field is not empty , the trailing end of the field should have a symbolic clear icon .
Clicking the icon should focus the field and clear its contents .
Besides the normal behavior for text fields , whenever the insertion point ( caret ) is at the trailing end of the search field , pressing the Down arrow key should focus the contents of the main pane and select the first item — such as the first category in the home screen , or the first result in any list of search results .
Interpreting search text
When searching anywhere in USC , any word in the search string that is followed by a space or punctuation should be treated as a a complete word , while any word that is not should be treated as if it may be either a complete word or the beginning of a word .
Test case : ( sc-004 )
From the top - level “ All Software ” screen , search for “ atom ” ; it should return both Atomix and Liferea ( an Atom feed reader ) .
Now search for “ atom ” ( with a trailing space ) ; it should return only Liferea .
For the sake of people who are unfamiliar with how they should use the search , there should be a greylist of words that are downplayed when searching .
“ Downplayed ” in this sense means that :
A search that consists only of greylisted words should work just as if none of the words were greylisted .
In any other search that contains one or more greylisted words , the greylisted words should be ignored : only the words that are not greylisted should be searched for .
However , once the results are chosen , the presence of any greylisted words should cause a result to appear higher in the list .
For English , the greylist should be “ app application package program programme suite tool ” .
The greylist should have a translation note : “ Do not translate this list directly .
Instead , provide a list of words in your language that people are likely to include in a search but that should normally be ignored in the search . ”
Test case : ( sc -011 )
From the home screen , search for “ drawing ” ( with a trailing space ) .
Then search for “ drawing program ” .
USC should return exactly the same results for both searches , though possibly in a different order .
Search results and behavior
If the search field contains text at the moment you navigate to any other view , that search should be added to the end of the Back / Forward navigation history , with the previous item being the same screen without any search text .
( So clicking Back is one way to clear a search . )
Test case : ( sc-010 ) Launch USC .
Type Ctrl F ; the search field should be focused .
Type “ fire ” ( without quotes or pressing Enter ) ; the main pane should be replaced by search results , with Firefox first .
Press the down arrow key once ; Firefox should be selected in the results .
Press Enter ; USC should navigate to the software item screen for Firefox .
Choose Back once ; USC should return to the “ fire ” search results .
Choose Back again ; USC should return to the home screen .
If there are no results , the main pane should temporarily be replaced by a screen of this form :
No results for “ google mail ”
No items in Internet ▸
Chat match “ google mail ” .
Suggestions :
Try the 2 items in Internet that match .
[ Present only if there is a parent category that has any matches . ]
Try the 1 item that matches in software not maintained by Canonical .
[ Present only if you ’re viewing “ Canonical - Updated Software ” and there are matches in “ All Software ” . ]
Try using a different word .
/
Try using fewer words or different words .
[ Text dependent on how many words are in the search string . ]
Check the search is spelled correctly .
If there are any results , then at the top of the main pane should be a heading , “ Search results ” , opposite a menu ( if there ’s more than one result ) for sorting the results “ by Relevance ” ( the default ) , “ by Rating ” , or “ by Name ” .
The rest of the main pane should contain search results for that scope .
( For example , in a subcategory , the results should be limited in scope to that subcategory . )
In search results , a non-application item should be hidden by default :
from a subcategory screen , if that subcategory does not “ Show non-application packages by default ” ;
from a category screen , if ( a ) it is in one subcategory of that category and that subcategory does not “ Show non-application packages by default ” , ( b ) it is in multiple subcategories of that category , and its primary subcategory does not “ Show non-application packages by default ” , or ( c ) it is not in any subcategories and the category itself does not “ Show non-application packages by default ” ;
from the home screen , if its primary subcategory ( or , if it has no subcategory , its primary category ) does not “ Show non-application packages by default ” ;
never , in any other screen ( such as “ History ” ) .
If the search terms exactly match a package name , that package should be returned first in the results , even if the package was hidden by default .
Testers
You can help us improve the search function by testing it in successive versions .
Custom package lists
For ease of sharing lists of software , USC should allow “ searches ” that return ad - hoc package sets .
From the home screen , whenever a search string consists entirely of characters allowed in package names , interspersed with commas ( and no spaces ) , and optionally followed by a comma :
The main pane should display an “ All Software ” list view of the software items corresponding to those package names .
Unlike usual search results , this list should be sorted in exactly the same order as the search string .
If any of the package names does not have a corresponding package in your current software sources , its item in the list should have a question mark as its icon , “ Not found ” as primary text , and the package name as secondary text ; the icon and text should both be greyed out , and selecting the row should not expand it .
The bottom of the pane should have an action bar .
At its leading end should be text of the form “ { X} items ” , where X = the number of recognized items ( not including any “ Not found ” items ) .
If any of the recognized items are not currently installed , its trailing end should have a button of the form “ Install { X} Items ” , where X = the number of items not currently installed ( regardless of whether they are queued for installation ) .
Test case : ( sc -016 )
On a machine that has Gobby and Gimp installed but neither 9 base nor abcde , with “ View ” > “ All Software ” selected :
Navigate to the home screen and enter “ gobby , gimp ” ( without quotes ) in the search field .
The main pane should list “ Gobby ” and “ GIMP Image Editor ” , and the action bar should say “ 2 items ” .
Add “ , 9base ” to the search text ( “ gobby , gimp , 9base ” ) .
The list should change to “ Gobby ” , “ GIMP Image Editor ” , and “ Plan 9 userland tools ” , in that order ; an action bar should appear offering to “ Install 1 Item ” ; and the action bar should say “ 3 items ” .
Add a comma to the end of the string ( “ gobby , gimp , 9base , ” ) .
Nothing should change .
Add the letters “ abcd ” to the end of the string ( “ gobby , gimp,9 base , abcd ” ) .
A greyed - out item should appear at the end of the list : “ Not found ” / “ abcd ” .
The button should still say “ Install 1 Item ” , and the action bar should still say “ 3 items ” .
Finally , add the letter “ e ” to the search string ( “ gobby , gimp ,9 base , abcde ” ) .
The “ Not found ” item should change to “ A Better CD Encoder ” / “ abcde ” , and “ Install 1 Item ” should change to “ Install 2 Items ” .
Copying a Web link for a package
Whenever you choose to copy a Web link for a package , USC should copy to the clipboard text of the form http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/
package - name ( without a leading or trailing line break ) .
Installing software
When you request to install a software item :
The “ Install ” command should become unavailable for that item , and remain unavailable until the installation has been completed or cancelled .
If the item is published through MyApps or the ARB , and either ( a ) you have never yet accepted the terms of use or ( b ) the terms have changed substantially since you last accepted them ( bug 1107802 ) , a “ Terms of Use ” dialog should open for you to accept or decline them .
“ Decline ” should always be enabled , but “ Accept ” should be enabled only when the terms have loaded completely and successfully .
If the item requires sign - in and / or filling in a purchase form , USC should navigate through those steps , then return to the previous screen ( the listing or software item screen ) .
If installing the software would involve removing ubuntu - desktop , the package should be treated as uninstallable ( just as it is with software updates ) ( bug 1110188 ) .
If the relevant package cannot be installed , for that reason or any other , an error alert should appear , with primary text “ Sorry , {title} ca n’t be installed at the moment .
Try again in a day or two . ” .
A “ Details ” expander should reveal a text frame containing the dpkg error , or , depending on the problem , the text “ Installing this software would remove critical Ubuntu components .
If this problem persists , contact the software vendor . ” .
If “ View ” > “ New Applications in Launcher ” is checked ( as it should be by default ) , and the item is an application without NoDisplay = True ( bug 1006483 ) :
If the Launcher was in auto - hide mode , it should temporarily reveal itself .
A copy of the item ’s icon shown in USC ( in the software list view or software item screen , whichever was being used ) should be hoisted from that spot to a space the Launcher has just freed for it , resizing as necessary as it moves .
If the Launcher was in auto - hide mode , it should then hide again .
For as long as the item is waiting for other package transactions , the Launcher should show it as a greyed - out icon , with the help tip “ Waiting to install ” .
Trying to launch the item should do nothing .
While the item is installing , the Launcher should show installation progress with an overlaid progress bar .
Trying to launch the item should still do nothing .
The item should be installed with the standard interface .
The item should appear in the “ Progress ” section .
If the item is queued waiting for another package manager to close , the status text for the item should be “ Waiting for { Application Name} to exit ” ( bug 995149 ) .
Otherwise it should be the standard status text for the operation .
When installation completes , either successfully or unsuccessfully :
If the item is present in the Launcher ( that is , it was added and you did n’t remove it during the installation ) , then : If installation was unsuccessful , the item should disappear from the Launcher .
If installation was successful , the launcher item should flash and become launchable .
If installation was successful , the “ installed ” emblem should be applied to the item icon inside USC , and the status text should be set to “ Installation complete ” .
Five seconds later , the item should disappear from the “ Progress ” section .
For an item being installed , 50 % of the progress bar length should be allocated to the downloading process , and 50 % to running the installation script .
Packagers ( and testers )
Wait , what ?
Fifty percent ?
That ’s not accurate !
Perhaps not , but even a progress bar that varies a bit in speed is infinitely more accurate than one that fills up completely only to jump back to zero for the next step .
And you can help us make it even better .
Removing software
The Remove function should be disabled by default , enabled only when one or more items are selected or you are at an individual software item .
When you request to remove a software item :
The Remove function for that item should become disabled , and remain disabled until the removal has been completed or cancelled .
USC should handle inconsistent package state if necessary .
The package removal should be presented in the standard way .
At the same time , the item should appear in the “ Progress ” section .
If the item is queued waiting for another package manager to close , the status text for the item should be “ Waiting for { Application Name} to exit ” .
If the item is queued waiting for any other activity to complete , the status text for the item should be “ Waiting ” .
If at any point removal is blocked by a debconf question , the status text for the item should be set to “ Waiting for your response … ”
Add -on packages
Package A should be treated as a recommended add - on of package X if either of these are true :
X Recommends A
X is the only known package that Depends ( directly or indirectly ) on some other package Y , and Y Recommends A .
Package A should be treated as a suggested add - on of package X if any of these are true :
X Suggests A
X is the only known package that Depends ( directly or indirectly ) on some other package Y , and Y Suggests A
A Enhances X ( or Enhances a virtual package that X Provides ) , and A is not a language pack ( i.e. does not match a name or pattern in /usr / share / language - selector/data/pkg_depends )
A Enhances some other package Y , where X is the only known package that Depends ( directly or indirectly ) on Y .
What about where X depends on a virtual package that A1 or A2 provide ?
Perhaps show a menu of the options ?
This applies not just to add - ons but to dependencies too .
Also consider the possibility that installing A1 requires uninstalling something else , while installing A2 does not …
What if A Enhances X or X Suggests A , but another installed package Y Depends on A ? Maybe checked and disabled ?
What if A Enhances X or X Suggests A , but another installed package Y Recommends A ? Maybe checked by default ?
If a software item has any add - ons , it should have an “ Add - ons ” section in its software item screen .
The list of add - ons for the item should be presented as a series of checkboxes .
Recommended add - ons should be listed first alphabetically , then suggested add - ons alphabetically .
The add - on ’s package name , in brackets , should follow the trailing end of the label for each checkbox .
The package name should be a link that navigates to the software item screen for the package .
At the leading end of the label for each checkbox should be a text - sized version of the add - on ’s icon .
This should be followed by as much of the add - on ’s title as fits in the rest of the window width ( without obscuring the package name ) , ellipsized at the trailing end if necessary .
If the main package is not installed already , the checkboxes for recommended add - ons should be checked by default , while the checkboxes for suggested add - ons should be unchecked by default .
If the main package is installed already , the checkboxes for add - ons that are currently installed should be checked by default , while those that are not should be unchecked by default .
The “ Total size : ” text should update immediately whenever checking or unchecking a checkbox .
If the main package is already installed , whenever the current checkbox values no longer match the add - ons currently installed , an add - ons state bar should appear immediately below the list of checkboxes .
Initially , this bar should contain the total price of any newly - selected add - ons ( e.g. “ Free ” ) at its leading end , and “ Cancel ” and “ Apply Changes ” buttons at its trailing end .
Activating “ Cancel ” should reset the checkboxes to match the add- ons currently installed ( and therefore cause the bar to disappear ) .
Activating “ Apply Changes ” should install and / or remove the add-ons as specified , showing the status of this process in the add - ons state bar itself .
In the “ Progress ” section , when installing an item , installing any of its add - ons should be presented as part of the same task .
But changing add - ons for an installed item should be presented as a separate task for each add - on .
ISV software
This includes software published through MyApps and the ARB .
Installing ISV software
For any software item that costs money and that ( to USC ’s knowledge ) you have not already purchased :
When it is selected in a software list view , the text at the leading end should display the price instead button at the trailing end should be “ Buy … ” instead of “ Install ” .
Both when it is selected in a software list view , and when you are at its software item screen , “ File ” > “ Install ” should instead be “ File ” > “ Buy… ” .
If you choose the “ Buy … ” command by any of these routes :
If necessary , an Ubuntu Single Sign - On / Registration dialog should appear .
If you sign on successfully and USC realizes you have already purchased this item , it should return to the software item screen , which should now be showing the download and installation progress .
Do we need to show more feedback ?
Otherwise , USC should navigate to a new screen that is blank initially except for a spinner and the text “ Connecting to payment service … ” .
Once it has loaded completely , the main pane should display the Canonical Payment Service screen for buying the item .
Once you complete the payment , USC should return to the software item screen , which should now be showing the download and installation progress .
Need to handle the edge case where the price changes while you ’re purchasing .
Perhaps highlight the change and ask you to reconfirm .
Reinstalling previous purchases
Whenever an item is not currently installed ( or queued for installation ) but USC knows that it has been previously purchased :
Its “ Buy … ” button in a software list view should instead be “ Reinstall ” .
When it is selected or navigated to , “ File ” > “ Buy … ” should instead be “ Reinstall Purchase ” .
The “ Install ” button at the trailing end of its installation state bar should be “ Reinstall ” instead .
To make it easier to find previous purchases , the “ File ” menu should contain a “ Reinstall Previous Purchases … ” item .
This should navigate to the “ Purchases ” view of the “ History ” tab .
Wherever it appears , “ Reinstall ” or “ Reinstall Purchase ” should end with an ellipsis if you are not currently signed into the account that was used to purchase it .
In that case , choosing it should open a sign - on dialog that allows only sign - on , not registration , with primary text “ To reinstall this item , sign in to the Ubuntu Single Sign - On account you used to pay for it . ” .
If / once you are signed in , the item should install without any further interaction .

Specification : SoftwareCenter / Recommendations
Support and problem reporting for ISV software
For any software item in “ For Purchase ” or “ Independent ” , its software item screen should include a “ Report a Problem ” link alongside the “ Developer Web Site ” link .
Activating this link should open a “ Report a Problem ” dialog with the icon and name of the application .
It should ask you to “ Please identify the type of problem : ” , with radio buttons for the options : “ Payment does n’t work ” , “ Download does n’t complete ” , “ Installation does n’t work ” , “ Software installs but does n’t run properly ” , “ Inappropriate / offensive ” ( only once maturity ratings are implemented ) , “ Legal issue ” , and “ Other ” ( the default ) .
Regardless of reason , if you choose “ Continue ” , USC should open a Web browser to a URL with the package name and reason as query parameters .
That URL should then redirect to the developer support site , or the Canonical Support form , depending on the reason .
Comparing and syncing installed software between computers
The “ File ” menu should contain a “ Sync Between Computers … ” item .
If syncing is not already set up , choosing it should :
Navigate to the “ Installed ” section , if USC is not there already .
If you are not signed in to Ubuntu SSO , open an SSO sign - on dialog with primary text “ With multiple Ubuntu computers , you can publish their inventories online to compare the software installed on each . ” and secondary text “ No - one else will be able to see what you have installed . ”
Reveal a sidebar in the “ Installed ” screen , and focus it .
This sidebar should remain visible whenever you view the “ Installed ” section subsequently .
Begin publishing the name and source , for each package installed on this computer , to the OneConf server .
If syncing is already set up , choosing “ Sync Between Computers … ” should just navigate to the “ Installed ” screen and focus its sidebar .
The sidebar should list all computers registered with this account , starting with “ This Computer ( {hostname} ) ” , then a space , then any others sorted alphabetically .
Whenever there are no others , the remaining space in the sidebar should instead contain horizontally and vertically centered text :
‘ To sync with another computer , choose “ Sync Between Computers ” from that computer . ’
Exactly one computer in the sidebar should be selected at any time .
Whenever “ This Computer ” is selected in the sidebar , the rest of the main pane should contain the usual contents of the main pane for a single computer .
Whenever any other computer is selected , and that computer has not yet finished pushing its list of software to the Ubuntu One account , the rest of the main pane should contain horizontally and vertically centered text : ‘ “ {name} ” has n’t finished publishing its inventory yet .
Try again in a few minutes . ’
Whenever the other computer has finished pushing its list of software , the rest of the main pane should consist of a software list view with three branches :
‘ {number} items on “ {name of other computer} ” not on this computer ’ , with an “ Install All ” button at the trailing end , and each item inside having “ More Info ” and “ Install ” buttons when selected ; ‘{ number} items on this computer not on “ {name of other computer} ” ’ , with a “ Remove All ” button at the trailing end , and each item inside having “ More Info ” and “ Remove ” buttons when selected ; ‘ { number} items on both computers ” , with no button at the trailing end , and each item inside having only a “ More Info ” button when selected .
The “ Install All ” and “ Remove All ” buttons should be the same width .
As with the normal list view , only one branch — or software item inside that branch — should be selected at any time , and whenever an item is selected it should expand to reveal a “ More Info ” button .
In addition , a selected item inside the that - computer - but - not - this - one branch should have an “ Install ” button at the trailing end , and a selected item inside the this - computer - but - not - that - one branch should have a “ Remove ” button at the trailing end .
The menubutton at the bottom of the sidebar should contain one item , ‘ Stop Syncing “ {name of selected computer} ” ’ .
If the selected computer is the computer you are using right now , the “ Installed ” screen should return to single - computer mode , and stop publishing this computer ’s inventory to the server .
If the selected computer is any other computer ( for example , one that has been lost or destroyed ) , “ Stop Syncing ” should remove that computer both from the sidebar , and from the set of computers that will be synced .
Help
The help should cover these topics :
What is the Ubuntu Software Center ?
Why are all the programs free ?
Installing a program
Using a program once it ’s installed
Removing a program
Why is it asking me to remove several programs together ?
“ Provided by Ubuntu ” — what ’s that ?
“ Canonical - updated ” — what ’s that ?
What if a program I want is n’t in Ubuntu Software Center ?
Using software from multiple sources
What if a program does n’t work ?
There is also an online FAQ for issues with purchases .
These are based on the questions most frequently asked by real customers :

icon_size is the maximum of the width and height of the icon
desktop_file is the desktop file that the item will launch once the installation is complete
aptdaemon_task is the aptdaemon transaction ID .
The Launcher should handle the rest .
For alternative designs that were considered , see / Launching Applications .
Future work :
On the screen for an already - installed application , show an invitation to add it to the launcher if it is n’t there already .
Deauthorizing your computer
So that you can be honest about using keeping purchased software only on your own computers , the “ File ” menu should contain a “ Deauthorize Computer … ” item .
This item should be enabled only when you are already signed in or when any USC purchases are installed .
Activating the item should open a confirmation alert , which lists installed purchases only if there are any .
Choosing “ Deauthorize ” should queue any purchased items for removal , and clear your Ubuntu SSO credentials from the computer .
Choosing between backport and non-backport versions
Whenever the Backports channel contains a version of any item that is greater than the version that would normally be installed , the installation state bar should contain a radio menu on the leading side of the Install / Remove button .
The menu should contain two items , the backport version and the version that would normally be installed , in ascending order .
Both should start with “ v {version number} ” .
If the backport version is higher , this should be followed by “ ( latest ) ” .
And if the normally - installed version is from the Ubuntu archive , this should be followed by “ ( release ) ” .
The default should be the release version , if it is one of the items , otherwise the highest version .
If the item is not currently installed at all , the adjacent button should be “ Install ” .
If a version different from the selected item is installed , the button should be “ Change ” .
And if the selected version is installed , the button should be “ Remove ” .
Region restrictions
For any item which you may not install in your region :
The Install command should not be available .
In the software item screen , the installation state bar should contain only the text “ Sorry , this software is not available in your region . ”
In the software item screen , screenshots should not be displayed .
( A common reason for region restrictions is banning of particular logos or imagery . )
Features you can implement
These are mini-specifications for new features and other changes that anyone is welcome to implement .
Some are more important than others ; some are more difficult than others .
If you would like to implement any of them , please do so in a branch and propose it for merging .
Thanks !
( Once a feature is implemented , the mini-specification here will similarly be merged into the main specification . )
“ Go ” menu and simplified navigation bar
Between the “ Edit ” and “ View ” menus should be a “ Go ” menu .
This should replace the “ Go Back ” and “ Go Forward ” items , and the following separator , from the “ View ” menu .
_ Go === Back [ Forward ]
---------------------------------
All Software Ctrl 1 All From Source > Installed Ctrl 2 Installed From Source > History Ctrl H Progress Ctrl 0
The “ All From Source ” submenu should consist of an item , with icon , for each available software source .
The “ Installed From Source ” submenu should consist of an item , with icon , for each installed software source .
Atop the screen for each individual software source should be a header containing the icon and name for the source .
This should be followed by a software list view of all the items in that source , then centered text of the form “ 141 items ” .
In the “ Provided by Ubuntu ” screens , non-application packages should be hidden by default .
Once this is implemented , the dropdown menus should be removed from the “ All Software ” and “ Installed ” navigation bar buttons , simplifying the navigation bar ( bug 1020521 ) .
Installing from external media
( bug 449337 )
If you insert a volume that consists of software packages , but is not installation media , Ubuntu Software Center should launch to ( or navigate to ) the screen for that volume as an individual source .
The usual header pane should have a checkbox at its trailing end , “ Use as a software channel ” , reflecting whether the volume is currently in your sources .
list .
If a volume is added as a software channel , Ubuntu should cache all its package details so that you can request installation without having the media inserted .
If you request to install an item from media that is not currently inserted , an “ Insert Media ” alert should appear using the volume ’s icon , primary text “ To insert {name of item} , you need to insert the volume “ {name of volume} ” , and “ Cancel ” and “ Retry ” buttons .
If the media is detectably inserted , the alert should go away automatically .
“ What ’s Popular ” overall
Erratum : “ Most Popular ” should be “ What ’s Popular ” .
( bug 432525 )
An item ’s popularity should be determined by the proportion of people , who have opted in to recommendations , who have the item installed .
On the home screen , the “ What ’s Popular ” area should use tiles to list , in descending order , the 12 most popular items that are not currently installed and that are not already shown in the “ Top Rated ” section .
( This avoids repetition on the home screen , giving visibility to more items . )
Choosing “ More ” in the “ What ’s Popular ” area should navigate to a separate “ What ’s Popular ” screen that uses a software tile view to list , in descending order , the 60 most popular items overall — regardless of whether they are installed or whether they are also in any “ Top Rated ” listing .
Subcategories for “ Tweaks & Themes ”
( Implementing this will have no effect until Ubuntu archives contain debtags . )
Any package that is not already in another category , and matches any of these patterns , should appear in a subcategory of “ Themes & Tweaks ” .
Subcategory Rule
Show non-application packages by default Automation debtag admin::automation yes Backup debtag admin : : backup yes Benchmarking debtag admin:: benchmarking yes Dash Search Plugins package name unity - lens -* but not *- dbgsym yes Data Recovery debtag admin:: recovery yes Disk Utilities debtag admin:: filesystem or admin:: forensics yes Package Management debtag admin :: package - management yes Themes ???
yes
The category should be renamed to “ Tweaks & Themes ” to reflect the shift in emphasis .
( unity - scope -* is not included in “ Dash Search Plugins ” because scopes are only useful inside , and already show up as add - ons for , individual lenses . )
Subcategories for “ Sound & Video ”
( This should not be implemented until Ubuntu archives contain debtags , otherwise there would be only one subcategory . )
Any package that is not already in another category , and matches any of these patterns , should appear in a subcategory of “ Sound & Video ” .
Subcategory Rule Examples
Show non-application packages by default Amateur Radio ( fixing bug 905894 ) Section hamradio ibp , morse , qrq , tk2 , wsjt yes Audio Utilities tags scope : : utility + works - with : : audio aconnectgui , bitmeter , earcandy , gladish no Camera tag hardware : : camera cameramonitor , camorama , cheese no CD / DVD Authoring ?

Encouraging use an archived version instead of a standlone .deb
When you open a standalone . deb package , if one of your repositories contains a package with the same name , regardless of version number , there should be an extra bar below the installation state bar .
Its text should be whichever is appropriate of these :
Ubuntu has a newer version of this software .
“ Other Repository Label ” has a newer version of this software .
Ubuntu has a trusted version of this software .
“ Other Repository Label ” has a trusted version of this software .
The button at the trailing end of the bar should be labelled “ Show ” in any case .
Launching from multiple standalone .deb packages
( bug 1190469 )
If you select multiple .deb packages in a file manager , and open them with Ubuntu Software Center , it should display a custom list for the packages .
Opening a standalone package from within USC
( bug 782617 )
At the start of the “ File ” menu — before “ Install ” , “ Remove ” and other actions — should be an “ Open Package … ” item , with the keyboard equivalent Ctrl O , followed by a separator .
Choosing “ Open Package … ” should open an “ Open Package ” file picker that allows selection only of package files .
If you choose one to open , USC should display a centered spinner with the caption “ Opening package … ” until the standalone package screen can be shown .
Dragging a software item
( bug 1088085 )
A software item should be draggable , wherever in USC it appears — on the home screen , in any other tile view , in a list view , or ( for its icon only ) in the software item screen itself .
If you drag an item to the Launcher , then :
If the item is an application without NoDisplay =True , the drag should cancel .
Otherwise :
If the item is already installed , and already in the Launcher , the Launcher item should move to the new location .
Otherwise :
If the item is already installed , and not already in the Launcher , it should be added to the Launcher at that location .
Otherwise :
The icon should appear as a greyed - out item in the Launcher until installation completes or fails .
The item should install as usual , without a separate icon for the same item appearing in the Launcher , and remaining in the Launcher regardless of the “ New Applications in Launcher ” setting .
Dragging an item anywhere else , except the Launcher , should drop its icon as a graphic or its title as text .
Any “ Developer Web Site ” link should be draggable outside of USC .
When dragged to a file manager , it should produce a shortcut with the name “ { Title} ( Developer Web Site ) ” ; to a rich text document , a hyperlink with the text “ { Title} ( Developer Web Site ) ” ; and to a plain text field , just the URL .
Being encouraged to submit a review
If you have installed an application , and used it at least three times in the past week , the end of the home screen should have a “ Give Your Feedback ” box with text of the form : “ You ’ve used {title} a lot recently .
Would you like to review it ? ” .
The link should begin the review process for that application .
Can we vary the “ a lot ” wording sensibly ?
Minimal implementation
Whenever the Backports channel contains a version of any item that is newer than the version you have installed ( or fewer than five seconds have passed since that stopped being true ) , an “ Updates ” item should appear last in the navigation bar ( except for the “ Progress ” item , when present ) .
The “ Updates ” section should begin with a panel giving the number of updates at the leading side , and an “ Update All ” button on the trailing side .
Each individual item should consist of its icon , title , and the new version number on the leading side , and an “ Update ” button on the trailing side .
Whenever an item is selected , Enter should activate its “ Update ” button .
Whenever an update is installed or waiting to be installed , its “ Update ” button should be disabled .
Test case : Install an application for which Backports has a newer version .
As soon as its installation finishes , “ Updates ” should appear in the navigation bar .
Enhancement : Navigation bar emblem
In the navigation bar , the icon for the “ Updates ” item should have a badge containing the number of updates .
Enhancement : Launcher item emblem
In the Unity launcher , the icon for Ubuntu Software Center should have a badge containing the number of updates , regardless of whether USC is running .
The panel atop the “ Updates ” screen should contain an “ Also install Ubuntu updates ” checkbox .
Whenever Ubuntu updates are not available , the checkbox should be both disabled ( because changing it has no effect ) and unchecked ( because no Ubuntu updates will be installed when you update anything else ) .
Whenever Ubuntu updates are available , the checkbox should be enabled , and default to whichever checked / unchecked state it was in last time it was enabled ( checked by default ) .
Test case : ( replaces previous test case ) Install Ubuntu without installing updates .
Install an application for which Backports has a newer version ; as soon as its installation finishes , “ Updates ” should appear in the navigation bar .
Navigate to the “ Updates ” screen ; the “ Also install Ubuntu updates ” checkbox should be enabled and checked .
Use Update Manager to install all updates ; as soon as they finish , the “ Also install Ubuntu updates ” checkbox should become disabled and unchecked .
If you choose “ Update All ” , or “ Update ” for any individual item while the checkbox is checked , installation of Ubuntu updates should be queued ahead of whichever update or updates you chose with that action .
In the “ Updates ” screen , each individual update should have a “ Hide ” button on the leading side of its “ Update ” button .
The “ View ” menu should have a corresponding “ Hide This Update ” item that is disabled except when you are in the “ Updates ” section and an update is selected .
Activating this command should remove the update from the list indefinitely .
Below “ Hide This Update ” in the “ View ” menu should be a “ Show Previously Hidden Updates ” item , which is enabled whenever there are any , regardless of which screen you happen to be in .
Selecting the item should navigate to the “ Updates ” screen if you are not there already , and indefinitely un - hide all updates .
The “ Updates ” screen should show updates for not just Backports , but any NotAutomatic channel , for example “ For Purchase ” .
When a new version of Ubuntu is available , it should appear as the first row in the “ Updates ” screen , above the “ Update All ” panel .
In this case the panel should say not “ { N} updates available ” , but “ { N} other updates available ” .
The row itself should , instead of an “ Update ” button , have an “ Upgrade … ” button that opens the upgrade dialog .
Smarter ellipsis of software list view items
In a software list view , if the secondary text is wider than the space available , it should be ellipsized in the middle , not the trailing end ( because unique parts of package names are often at the trailing end ) .
Copying software list view items to the clipboard
Whenever an item in a software list view is selected , “ Edit ” > “ Copy ” should be enabled .
Choosing it should copy to the clipboard the item ’s title and summary as plain text separated by one line break .
If the item has a custom icon , it should also be copied as both a bitmap and as a vector image if available .
Pausing or cancelling all queued tasks
At the bottom of the “ Progress ” section should be an action bar , with text of the form “ 2 items remaining ” or “ All items completed ” ( as appropriate ) at the leading end , and “ Pause ” and “ Cancel All ” buttons at the trailing end .
When “ Pause ” is clicked , it should change to “ Resume ” , the “ Progress ” navigation bar element should change to “ Paused ” , and all tasks ( except for the current one , if it is no longer pauseable ) , even any you add after you clicked “ Pause ” , should be greyed out except for thei
Senate moves to give Bush more power to wiretap Brian Beutler
Published : Tuesday August 29 , 2006 Print This Email
This A bill that expands President Bush 's ability to wiretap American phones and conduct other forms of domestic surveillance will likely appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee next Thursday , RAW STORY has learned .
The bill , which was written by judiciary chairman Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , and which has been widely and publicly excoriated by Democratic members of the committee , contains provisions such as the institution of program - wide warrants , and warrants that do not expire for a year that would weaken the strict limits that currently govern the FISA courts .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) was written nearly 20 years ago and offers guidelines about the legal use of wiretaps on phones inside the United States .
It includes provisions for the use of courts to issue warrants if the governments case against a suspect meets legal scrutiny .
The judiciary committee originally sought to bring the NSA wiretapping program into compliance with FISA , but in practice , critics claim , Specters FISA amendments actually give the president freedom to expand his wiretapping activities .
A statement released by the office of Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) states that Specters bill gives him even more power than he has asserted under his illegal NSA wiretapping program . 
A different bill , written by Senator Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) and cosponsored by Specter will also appear before the committee Thursday .
Its provisions would do more to limit the NSA program than Specters , and would even mandate that the program face judicial review .
But a Senate aide who works closely with Specter tells RAW STORY that ,  The White House said they would veto any bill that includes a provision for judicial review . 
 I cant say that the bills work hand in hand ,  an aide told RAW STORY adding that , though Specters bill does not make judicial review mandatory , it makes it optional .
Specters bill , written as a result of that threat , makes concessions to the White House that go beyond Feinsteins legislation , which itself represents a diminution of the 1978 FISA statutes .
FISA , for instance , allows 15 days of warrantless surveillance in the event of a declaration of war .
Senator Feinsteins bill extends that allowance to include the 15 days after a Congressional authorization of the use of force .
Senator Specters bill deletes the exception altogether .
 Basically , " one aide told RAW STORY , " the White House said ,  you can trust us , you have our word that we will submit the program for judicial review .
Just dont make it mandatory for us .
Senator Feinstein has come out against the new legislation , intimating that it would legalize the NSA program that was recently declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in Michigan .
If passed by Congress , Specter 's bill could potentially influence the outcome of White House appeals that may ultimately put the program before the Supreme Court .
In an op - ed cowritten with Senator Feingold in the San Francisco Chronicle , Senator Feinstein said , every time the Supreme Court has confronted a statute limiting the commander - in - chief 's authority , it has upheld the statute . "
Feinstein continued : " Congress explicitly banned wiretapping individuals in the United States without a court order , except in limited circumstances such as emergencies , when it passed FISA in 1978 .
That means the president 's power to wiretap Americans without a warrant would be viewed very skeptically by the Supreme Court .
If Congress were to pass Specter 's bill , however , the legal analysis would be much more deferential to the president .
By repealing the ban on wiretapping without a warrant Congress would help the president make his case .
Senator Specter , who unlike Senators Feingold and Feinstein does not sit on the Intelligence committee , and who therefore is privy to less information about the NSA program , had been critical of its apparent violation of FISA in the past .
When asked at a press conference recently if it was frustrating to now be in a position to write legislation for the courts without knowing the details of the wiretapping program , he responded ,  Is it frustrating ?
Yes , but I 'm used to that From the very start , I said , I do n't have to know what the program is , but the court has to know what the program is .
There has to be judicial review before you can wiretap .
That 's been the tradition . 
